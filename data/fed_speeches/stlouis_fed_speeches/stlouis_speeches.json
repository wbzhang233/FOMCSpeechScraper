Robert H. Rasche, Senior Vice President and Director of Research, and Marcela\nWilliams, Special Research Assistant to the President, provided assistance. I take full\nresponsibility for errors. The views expressed are mine and do not necessarily reflect official\npositions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fA Perspective on the U.S. Economy\nIntroduction\nIt is a pleasure to be here this morning to talk with you about the state of the U.S.\neconomy. I am impressed that such a large group is willing to come to breakfast to hear an\neconomist like me give a talk. By the time this is over, of course, some of you may wish you had\ndecided to sleep in!\nAs many of you know, I joined the Federal Open Market Committee at a difficult\njuncture for the Committee and for the American economy. Growth in real gross domestic\nproduct, one of our best measures of overall health in the economy, has been sluggish. Financial\nmarkets have been struggling to return to normal operation since the current turmoil began in\nearnest 10 months ago. In addition, the housing sector has been extraordinarily weak for some\ntime, with prices falling and sales of both new and existing homes on the decline. The Federal\nReserve has responded to this situation by instituting an array of new lending facilities and\nsharply lowering interest rates through the fall of 2007 and into the first several months of 2008.\nMy intention this morning is to talk about these developments in the context of mediumand longer-term objectives for monetary policy. My sense is that the U.S. economy will be able\nto post stronger growth in the second half of this year despite the ongoing financial crisis and the\ndrag from the housing sector. As I will make clear, such growth is likely to make the inflation\noutlook a more pressing concern for the Fed in the second half of this year.\nLet me say before I continue that any views expressed here are my own and do not\nnecessarily reflect the official views of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal\nReserve System.\n\n1\n\n\fBefore saying more about the current situation in the U.S. economy, let me provide some\ncontext for my current views by describing the goals and objectives of monetary policy as I see\nthem.\n\nA General Perspective on the Objectives of Monetary Policy\nOver the past two decades, much has been said about the benefits of transparency and\naccountability in the conduct of monetary policy. Much has been achieved, both in the United\nStates and abroad, to reach these goals. I applaud these developments, and I believe that\nprogress in this direction can and should continue. Consistent with those principles, in my role\nas the newest participant on the FOMC, I want to talk for a few moments about my fundamental\nbeliefs on the appropriate objectives of monetary policy.\nOne of the guiding principles from contemporary economic theory is that monetary\npolicy should be conducted in a systematic and predictable fashion. The expectations of\neconomic actors are critically important for the nature of equilibrium in the economy. These\nexpectations evolve in part according to the outlook for future policy itself and the implications\nof that policy for the path of the economy. This view, once considered radical, is now widely\naccepted in academia and by monetary policymakers around the world. This perspective rejects\nan alternative view, common in an earlier era in macroeconomics, that policy actions are most\nuseful when they surprise participants in financial markets and the public more generally.\nSystematic monetary policy must start with a clear statement of the ultimate policy\nobjectives. The Federal Reserve is commonly characterized as striving to foster price stability\nalong with maximum sustainable employment. Other central banks, including the European\nCentral Bank (ECB) and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, for example, are charged with a\n\n2\n\n\fsingle mandate: to maintain price stability. In the 1960s, the dual mandate was perceived to\nrequire a policy tradeoff. Under the then-prevailing Phillips curve hypothesis, lower inflation\ncould be achieved only at a cost of higher unemployment. Today, the consensus view is that\nthere is no long-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment. Indeed, a succession of Fed\nChairmen—Paul Volcker, Alan Greenspan, and Ben Bernanke—have emphasized the\ncomplementarity of the two objectives: namely, that price stability is a precondition for\nmaximum sustainable employment. 1 I agree with this perspective.\nMoreover, I have been impressed during my 18-year career as a Fed economist in\nconsidering the contrast in the behavior of the U.S. economy between the high inflation period of\nthe 1970s and the more-recent period of low inflation. Between 1965 and 1984, U.S. inflation\nrose to double-digit levels before falling again. Since that time, inflation has remained under\nbetter control. The earlier era was associated not only with higher and more variable inflation,\nbut also with a more volatile real economy. My sense is that a monetary policy better-focused on\nprice stability has made an important contribution to the improved stability on the real side of the\neconomy that we have observed since 1984.\nThis stability has meant a lot to the average household in our nation: long periods of\nuninterrupted growth punctuated by just two mild recessions since the mid-1980s.\nPrice stability has multiple interpretations. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, price\nstability meant that variations in the general level of prices would be transitory: the price index\nwould revert to a mean. In recent policy discussions, price stability generally is interpreted as a\nsmall positive rate of inflation. Under these conditions, the level of prices does not revert to a\nconstant, but trends upward. I accept this latter definition of price stability. There may be\n\n1\n\nSee, for example, Ben S. Bernanke, “The Benefits of Price Stability,” February 24, 2006.\n<www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20060224a.htm>.\n\n3\n\n\ftheoretical and practical reasons to believe that the best price indexes we have available are\nsubject to upward biases. While I am not a big fan of the upward-bias argument—after all, the\nbest-available adjustments are already made to the indexes—I admit that I do not have better\nmeasures myself. My preferred definition of price stability is that trend inflation, correctly\nmeasured, is zero. In practice, this likely converts into a trend in measured inflation on the order\nof ½ to 1½ percent, depending on the particular price index referenced.\nOne important aspect of my definition of price stability, which I will revisit this morning,\nis that it concerns only the trend in inflation. Central banks cannot and should not try to control\nperiod-to-period fluctuations in any measured price index. Such fluctuations are largely\ntransitory and reflect different movements of various relative prices. Price stability as a policy\nobjective for a central bank must be focused on the longer-run behavior of the inflation rate.\nGiven the current state of knowledge, a central bank that maintains a low and stable average rate\nof inflation over a horizon of two to three years should be judged successful at achieving price\nstability.\nA sustained era of price stability requires that central banks create an environment in\nwhich financial market participants and the general public maintain the expectation that future\ninflation will remain low and stable. Such an environment frequently is characterized as having\nan “anchor for inflation expectations”; in some cases, the central bank establishes such an anchor\nfor the economy by announcing an explicit numeric inflation target. The Reserve Bank of New\nZealand was the first institution to choose this approach. During the 1990s it was followed by\nthe Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, and the European Central Bank, among others.\nThe FOMC has chosen not to announce such a quantitative guideline, although many past\nand current participants on the Committee have expressed individual preferences or “comfort\n\n4\n\n\fzones” about ranges of inflation that they personally feel are appropriate objectives for policy.\nWithin the past year, the FOMC has started publishing the ranges and central tendency of the\ninflation forecasts of the participants on a three-year horizon. These forecasts generally have\nbeen consistent with the revealed “comfort zones.” In the media, midpoints of these forecasts\nare often associated with an implicit FOMC objective for trend inflation. This represents\nimportant progress concerning the transparency of the FOMC inflation objective. Still, there is\nsome risk that if the evolving inflation situation appears inconsistent with the inflation objective\nthat is inferred from the revealed preferences of the individual FOMC participants, the anchor for\ninflation expectations may start to drag or come completely loose.\nI take some comfort that, even absent an explicit numeric inflation objective, the FOMC\nhas achieved a nominal anchor for the economy over the past 25 years. The Committee\naccomplished this the old-fashioned way—the Fed earned credibility for the expectation of low\nand stable trend inflation based on the successful outcome of about 25 years of policy history.\nThe Volcker disinflation in the early 1980s succeeded in stabilizing inflation around 4 percent\nper annum. After a mild and short-lived inflation breakout in the late 1980s, the Greenspan Fed\nproduced a declining trend in inflation throughout the 1990s and into the first few years of the\n21st century.\nDespite this past success, it is my judgment that at the present time inflation expectations\nare fragile. By many measures, inflation has trended up in recent years. At the same time,\navailable measures of long-term inflation expectations, whether from survey data or from\nTreasury inflation-protected securities spreads, have remained remarkably stable. My sense is\nthat, absent stabilization or reversal of the recent trend in inflation, those expectations will begin\nto move higher. That is, market participants, businesses, and consumers will come to view higher\n\n5\n\n\finflation as part of the economic landscape. These expectations will then feed into the\nequilibrium of the economy and will be difficult to reverse.\nA breakdown in inflation expectations has not occurred yet, to be sure, but the risk is real.\nIt is possible that a breakdown could happen over a very short horizon. Indeed, in the May 2008\nUniversity of Michigan/Reuters survey, the 12-month-ahead median expected inflation rate\njumped to 5.2 percent (from 4.8 percent) and 25 percent of respondents reported expecting\ninflation in excess of 10 percent over the next 12 months! My sense is that these extraordinary\nreadings were driven in part by recent exceptional increases in certain commodities prices,\nespecially gasoline. Still, the 5-year-ahead median expected inflation has drifted up to 3.3\npercent.\nDespite these worrisome numbers, I think that the Fed can contain the potential for\ninflation expectations to drift higher. It is rule number one in modern central banking that\ninflation and inflation expectations be kept under control. Let me repeat that: It is rule number\none in modern central banking that inflation and inflation expectations be kept under control.\nAfter a 10-month period in which the dominant policy concern has rightly been the state of\nfinancial markets, policy can begin to address pressing inflationary concerns during the\nremainder of the year. While it is too early to say that the financial market turmoil has\ncompletely abated, the Fed’s new lending facilities combined with an environment of low\ninterest rates have gone some distance to return markets to more normal operation.\n\nSome Implications for the Current Policy Environment\nIn August of last year, the FOMC took the first of a sequence of policy actions that\nreduced the target for the federal funds rate 325 basis points, from 5.25 percent to 2 percent. The\n\n6\n\n\finitial actions were motivated by turmoil in credit markets. By the end of last year, evidence of\nslowing economic growth emerged. By early this spring, many commentators and some\neconomic forecasters were predicting that the economy was in or about to enter a recession. The\nmost recent Blue Chip consensus forecast projects positive growth in real GDP for each quarter\nin 2008, though the projected growth in the second quarter is close to zero. The most recent\nquarter-by-quarter outlook from the Survey of Professional Forecasters is almost identical to the\nBlue Chip consensus. Within the past month, forecasters have generally backed off substantially\nin their estimates of the probability that the economy is now in or will soon enter a recession.\nThese forecasts may have a more optimistic tone than many of you have heard earlier this\nyear. I think this is because financial market turmoil is waning. A financial crisis is, naturally, a\ntime of great uncertainty, as market participants are all wondering what will happen next.\nForecasters have to take into account the possibility that the crisis will worsen to the point that a\ngreat deal of harm is done to U.S. financial markets. My sense is that, during the first several\nmonths of this year, some forecasts were putting a high probability on such an outcome. As the\nprobability of especially severe damage to the financial system recedes, forecasts are being\nrevised upward. This is complicating the inflation outlook for those projecting that significant\neconomic slack would help to keep inflation in check.\nCurrent consensus forecasts show no sign of relief for the near-term inflation situation.\nThe Blue Chip consensus forecast for core CPI inflation for 2008 over 2007 is 2.4 percent. The\nforecast for 2009, at 2.3 percent, is essentially unchanged. The Survey of Professional\nForecasters puts inflation at 2.3 percent in both years. These forecasts show little change from\nthe inflation experience in 2007. Forecasts of headline CPI inflation are more disturbing, with\n\n7\n\n\fboth the Blue Chip and the Survey of Professional Forecasters current forecasts in excess of 3\npercent. This inflation outlook is not consistent with my view of price stability.\nStill, given the current economic environment and the outlook for the next 18 months, my\nview is that policy is appropriately calibrated at this time. I see several reasons why maintaining\nthe current policy is a good option for now.\nFirst, the FOMC has already reduced the target federal funds rate by 325 basis points.\nThese policy actions were preemptive and involved more aggressive rate cuts than in previous\nepisodes, such as 1990-91 or 2001. The rate reductions were based on forecasts that economic\nactivity would slow in the face of contracting housing activity and substantial turmoil in financial\nmarkets. Growth has indeed been slow, at least for the first half of 2008, but that cannot now be\njustification for further rate reductions. Surprises to forecasts of economic activity, if any, have\nbeen to the upside. Acting preemptively means that patience is required when circumstances\nplay out in a way that is consistent with the forecast. Further action in the absence of substantial\nforecast errors would be double counting: in effect, reacting twice to the same concern.\nSecond, the full impact of monetary policy actions is not realized immediately. It is\nlikely that additional stimulus to economic activity from the monetary policy actions taken in\nJanuary and March will peak in the second half of 2008. In addition, there is a fiscal stimulus\nprogram in place that may shift some spending into the second and third quarters of this year.\nAny additional monetary policy actions must be judged by their expected impacts in the future in\nlight of current forecasts of the evolution of the economy. The best judgment, as incorporated in\ncurrent forecasts, is that the pace of economic activity will recover in the second half of 2008 and\nthroughout 2009.\n\n8\n\n\fThird, at the current funds rate target of 2 percent, real interest rates are quite low by\nhistorical standards. Short-term real rates computed by subtracting near-term forecasts of\nheadline inflation from nominal rates are significantly negative. Three- to six-month-ahead\nheadline CPI inflation forecasts exceed 3 percent; some forecasts for this period exceed 3.5\npercent. Three-month Treasury bill and prime nonfinancial commercial paper rates are less than\n2 percent. Even when evaluated against forecasts of core inflation rates, these yields are zero to\nslightly negative in real terms. Five-year inflation-indexed Treasury note yields are essentially\nzero. In short, the Fed has created a low interest rate environment that should allow the economy\nto continue to adjust to the drag from the housing sector and the aftermath of financial market\nturmoil.\n\nHeadline versus Core Inflation\nAs I mentioned earlier, there are many different ways to measure and discuss inflation.\nSince July 2004, the FOMC has focused on inflation measured by the core PCE price index in\nthe semiannual Monetary Policy Reports. I think everyone in this room is aware of the fact that,\nfor most of the time since 2003, headline inflation has exceeded core inflation. What are the\nrelative merits of focusing on core rather than the headline inflation? 2\nCore measures of inflation defined as excluding food prices have been constructed by the\nBLS at least since 1957. Core measures of inflation excluding both food and energy prices have\nbeen published since 1977. The rationale for these measures is not well documented, but it is\nlikely that the original intent was to better reveal inflation trends.

Some of the major changes in real energy prices in the\n\n2\n\nFor a discussion of this issue, see Mark Wynne, “Core Inflation: A Review of Some Conceptual Issues,” Federal\nReserve Bank of St. Louis Review, Part II, May/June 2008, pp. 205-228.\n\n9\n\n\f1970s and mid-1980s also proved transitory. Under these conditions, a focus on core measures\ngave policymakers a clearer indication of changes in the trend of inflation that was subject to\npolicy control. Much of the volatility of these prices originated with supply shocks in particular\nmarkets: droughts, crop failures, abundant harvests, OPEC boycotts, political disturbances in\nmajor oil-producing countries, and the collapse of the world oil market. Supply disturbances of\nthis sort do not produce the persistent spreads between headline and core inflation measures that\nhave been observed over the past five years.\nI believe that consideration has to be given to the hypothesis that different forces have\ndriven the relative price of food and energy in the recent past—namely, shifts in demand in\nworld markets. These forces are likely to persist for some time. In particular, I have in mind\nrapid increases in standards of living in large emerging-market economies. Associated with\nthese increases in living standards are higher consumption of calories and higher consumption of\nenergy and thus increasing demand in the global markets for these products. With low short-run\nelasticity of supply for food and energy production, these trends in demand generate trends in\nrelative prices.\nThe best forecast is that China, in particular, will continue to grow at a rapid rate for the\nnext decade. Longer-run elasticities of supply for agricultural products are likely substantially\nlarger than short-run elasticities, and hence the trend in relative prices of food can be expected to\nmoderate. Trends in relative energy prices may moderate with the emergence of new\ntechnologies. Nevertheless, a plausible case can be made that current trends in these relative\nprices will persist and that, therefore, headline measures of inflation will remain above core\nmeasures.\n\n10\n\n\fShould policymakers take into consideration persistent differences in headline and core\nmeasures of inflation? I believe that consistency requires attention to such differences in the\nformulation of policy. Unless there are compelling reasons to do otherwise, policy has to focus\non the prices actually faced by households and businesses. 3 Persistent and substantial trends in\nother relative prices are not factored out in measuring overall inflation trends. The relative prices\nof computers, communications equipment, and consumer electronics, for instance, have been\nfalling for decades. However, no one to my knowledge has argued that we are understating the\nfundamental trend in inflation because our core measures do not exclude these items.\nAvailable price indexes may be viewed as reasonably good estimates of consumer\npurchasing power. Food and energy are significant components of consumer budgets, as\nwitnessed by the abundant commentary on recent price changes. Monetary policy aimed at price\nstability cannot ignore continuing deterioration of purchasing power, regardless of the source. It\nis the overall trend in prices that is the inflation measure on which central bankers must\nconcentrate. If, under current global market conditions, historical core indexes do not measure\nthat trend appropriately, then it is necessary to develop filters that produce unbiased measures of\ntrend inflation.\n\nConclusions\nI appreciate having this opportunity to share with all of you some of my thoughts on the\ncurrent state of the U.S. economy.

The views expressed are mine and do not\nnecessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fRemarks on the U.S. Economy and the State of the Housing Sector 1\nIntroduction\nAs many of you know, I joined the Federal Open Market Committee at a difficult\njuncture for the Committee and for the American economy. Growth in real gross domestic\nproduct, one of our best measures of overall health in the economy, has been sluggish. Financial\nmarkets have been struggling to return to normal operation since the current turmoil began in\nearnest 10 months ago. In addition, the housing sector has been extraordinarily weak for some\ntime, with prices falling and sales of both new and existing homes on the decline. The Federal\nReserve has responded to this situation by instituting an array of new lending facilities and\nsharply lowering interest rates through the fall of 2007 and into the first several months of 2008.\nMy intention today is to talk about these developments in the context of medium- and\nlonger-term objectives for monetary policy. My sense is that the U.S. economy will be able to\npost stronger growth in the second half of this year despite the ongoing financial crisis and the\ndrag from the housing sector. As I will make clear, such growth is likely to make the inflation\noutlook a more pressing concern for the Fed in the second half of this year.\nLet me say before I continue that any views expressed here are my own and do not\nnecessarily reflect the official views of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal\nReserve System.\nBefore saying more about the current situation in the U.S. economy, let me provide some\ncontext for my current views by describing the goals and objectives of monetary policy as I see\nthem.\n\n1\n\nPortions of this speech were delivered as “A Perspective on Monetary Policy,” in Fayetteville, Arkansas, June 4,\n2008.\n\n1\n\n\fA General Perspective on the Objectives of Monetary Policy\nOver the past two decades, much has been said about the benefits of transparency and\naccountability in the conduct of monetary policy. Much has been achieved, both in the United\nStates and abroad, to reach these goals. I applaud these developments, and I believe that\nprogress in this direction can and should continue. Consistent with those principles, in my role\nas the newest participant on the FOMC, I want to talk for a few moments about my fundamental\nbeliefs on the appropriate objectives of monetary policy.\nOne of the guiding principles from contemporary economic theory is that monetary\npolicy should be conducted in a systematic and predictable fashion. The expectations of\neconomic actors are critically important for the nature of equilibrium in the economy. These\nexpectations evolve in part according to the outlook for future policy itself and the implications\nof that policy for the path of the economy. This view, once considered radical, is now widely\naccepted in academia and by monetary policymakers around the world. This perspective rejects\nan alternative view, common in an earlier era in macroeconomics, that policy actions are most\nuseful when they surprise participants in financial markets and the public more generally.\nSystematic monetary policy must start with a clear statement of the ultimate policy\nobjectives. The Federal Reserve is commonly characterized as striving to foster price stability\nalong with maximum sustainable employment. Other central banks, including the European\nCentral Bank (ECB) and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, for example, are charged with a\nsingle mandate: to maintain price stability. In the 1960s, the dual mandate was perceived to\nrequire a policy trade-off. Under the then-prevailing Phillips curve hypothesis, lower inflation\ncould be achieved only at a cost of higher unemployment. Today, the consensus view is that\nthere is no long-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment. Indeed, a succession of Fed\n\n2\n\n\fChairmen—Paul Volcker, Alan Greenspan, and Ben Bernanke—have emphasized the\ncomplementarity of the two objectives: namely, that price stability is a precondition for\nmaximum sustainable employment. 2 I agree with this perspective.\nMoreover, I have been impressed during my 18-year career as a Fed economist in\nconsidering the contrast in the behavior of the U.S. economy between high-inflation and lowinflation eras. Between 1965 and 1984, U.S. inflation rose to double-digit levels before falling\nagain. Since 1984, inflation has remained under better control. The earlier era was associated\nnot only with higher and more variable inflation, but also with a more volatile real economy. My\nsense is that a monetary policy better-focused on price stability has made an important\ncontribution to the improved stability on the real side of the economy that we have observed\nsince 1984. 3\nThis stability has meant a lot to the average household in our nation: long periods of\nuninterrupted growth punctuated by just two mild recessions since the mid-1980s.\nPrice stability has multiple interpretations. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, price\nstability meant that variations in the general level of prices would be transitory: the price index\nwould revert to a mean. In recent policy discussions, price stability generally is interpreted as a\nsmall positive rate of inflation. Under these conditions, the level of prices does not revert to a\nconstant, but trends upward. I accept this latter definition of price stability. There may be\ntheoretical and practical reasons to believe that the best price indexes we have available are\nsubject to upward biases. While I am not a big fan of the upward-bias argument—after all, the\nbest-available adjustments are already made to the indexes—I admit that I do not have better\n\n2\n\nSee, for example, Ben S. Bernanke, “The Benefits of Price Stability,” February 24, 2006.\n<www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20060224a.htm>.\n3\nFor a discussion of this possibility, see John B. Taylor, “Monetary Policy and the Long Boom,” April 16, 1998. <\nhttp://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/98/11/9811jt.pdf>.\n\n3\n\n\fmeasures myself. My preferred definition of price stability is that trend inflation, correctly\nmeasured, is zero. In practice, this likely converts into a trend in measured inflation on the order\nof ½ to 1½ percent, depending on the particular price index referenced.\nA sustained era of price stability requires that central banks create an environment in\nwhich financial market participants and the general public maintain the expectation that future\ninflation will remain low and stable. Such an environment frequently is characterized as having\nan “anchor for inflation expectations.” Some central banks have established such an anchor for\nthe economy by announcing an explicit numeric inflation target. The Reserve Bank of New\nZealand was the first institution to choose this approach. During the 1990s it was followed by\nthe Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, and the European Central Bank, among others.\nThe FOMC has chosen not to announce such a quantitative guideline, although many past\nand current participants on the Committee have expressed individual preferences or “comfort\nzones” about ranges of inflation that they personally feel are appropriate objectives for policy.\nWithin the past year, the FOMC has started publishing the ranges and central tendency of the\ninflation forecasts of the participants on a three-year horizon. These forecasts generally have\nbeen consistent with the revealed “comfort zones.” In the media, midpoints of these forecasts\nare often associated with an implicit FOMC objective for trend inflation. This represents\nimportant progress concerning the transparency of the FOMC inflation objective. Still, there is\nsome risk that if the evolving inflation situation appears inconsistent with the inflation objective\nthat is inferred from the revealed preferences of the individual FOMC participants, the anchor for\ninflation expectations may start to drag or come completely loose.\nI take some comfort that, even absent an explicit numeric inflation objective, the FOMC\nhas achieved a nominal anchor for the economy over the past 25 years. The Committee\n\n4\n\n\faccomplished this the old-fashioned way—the Fed earned credibility for the expectation of low\nand stable trend inflation based on the successful outcome of about 25 years of policy history.\nThe Volcker disinflation in the early 1980s succeeded in stabilizing inflation around 4 percent\nper annum. After a mild and short-lived inflation breakout in the late 1980s, the Greenspan Fed\nproduced a declining trend in inflation throughout the 1990s and into the first few years of the\n21st century.\nDespite this past success, it is my judgment that at the present time inflation expectations\nare fragile. By many measures, inflation itself has trended up in recent years, while inflationary\nexpectations, whether measured from survey data or from Treasury inflation-protected securities\nspreads, have remained remarkably stable. How long can this situation continue? My sense is\nthat, absent stabilization or reversal of the recent trend in inflation, inflation expectations will\nbegin to move higher. That is, market participants, businesses, and consumers will come to view\nhigher inflation as part of the economic landscape. These expectations, if allowed to persist, will\nthen feed into the equilibrium of the economy and will be difficult to reverse.\nA breakdown in inflation expectations has not occurred yet, to be sure, but the risk is real.\nIt is possible that a breakdown could happen over a very short horizon. Indeed, in the May 2008\nUniversity of Michigan/Reuters survey, the 12-month-ahead median expected inflation rate\njumped to 5.2 percent (from 4.8 percent) and 25 percent of respondents reported expecting\ninflation in excess of 10 percent over the next 12 months! My sense is that these extraordinary\nreadings were driven in part by recent exceptional increases in certain commodities prices,\nespecially gasoline. Still, the five-year-ahead median expected inflation has drifted up to 3.3\npercent.\n\n5\n\n\fDespite these worrisome numbers, I think that the Fed can contain the potential for\ninflation expectations to drift higher. It is rule number one in modern central banking that\ninflation and inflation expectations be kept under control. Let me repeat that: It is rule number\none in modern central banking that inflation and inflation expectations be kept under control.\nAfter a 10-month period in which the dominant policy concern has rightly been the state of\nfinancial markets, policy can begin to address pressing inflationary concerns during the\nremainder of the year. While it is too early to say that the financial market turmoil has\ncompletely abated, the Fed’s new lending facilities combined with an environment of low\ninterest rates have gone some distance to return markets to more normal operation.\n\nSome Implications for the Current Policy Environment\nIn August of last year, the FOMC took the first of a sequence of policy actions that\nreduced the target for the federal funds rate 325 basis points, from 5.25 percent to 2 percent. The\ninitial actions were motivated by turmoil in credit markets. By the end of last year, evidence of\nslowing economic growth emerged. By early this spring, many commentators and some\neconomic forecasters were predicting that the economy was in or about to enter a recession. The\nmost recent Blue Chip consensus forecast projects positive growth in real GDP for each quarter\nin 2008, though the projected growth in the second quarter is close to zero. The most recent\nquarter-by-quarter outlook from the Survey of Professional Forecasters is almost identical to the\nBlue Chip consensus. Within the past month, consistent with some stronger-than-expected\neconomic data, forecasters have generally backed off substantially in their estimates of the\nprobability that the economy is now in or will soon enter a recession.\n\n6\n\n\fThese forecasts may have a more optimistic tone than many of you have heard earlier this\nyear. I think this is because financial market turmoil is waning. A financial crisis is, naturally, a\ntime of great uncertainty, as market participants are all wondering what will happen next.\nForecasters have to take into account the possibility that the crisis will worsen to the point that a\ngreat deal of harm is done to U.S. financial markets. My sense is that, during the first several\nmonths of this year, some forecasts were putting a high probability on such an outcome. As the\nprobability of especially severe damage to the financial system recedes, forecasts are being\nrevised upward. This is complicating the inflation outlook for those projecting that significant\neconomic slack would help to keep inflation in check.\nCurrent consensus forecasts show no sign of relief for the near-term inflation situation.\nThe Blue Chip consensus forecast for core CPI inflation for 2008 over 2007 is 2.4 percent. The\nforecast for 2009, at 2.3 percent, is essentially unchanged. The Survey of Professional\nForecasters puts inflation at 2.3 percent in both years. These forecasts show little change from\nthe inflation experience in 2007. Forecasts of headline CPI inflation are more disturbing, with\nboth the Blue Chip and the Survey of Professional Forecasters current forecasts in excess of 3\npercent. These forecasts suggest that headline CPI inflation will moderate from its recent pace\nover the past six months, which is 4.5 percent. While heartening, this inflation outlook is still\nnot consistent with my view of price stability.\nStill, given the current economic environment and the outlook for the next 18 months, my\nview is that policy is appropriately calibrated at this time. I see several reasons why maintaining\nthe current policy is a good option for now.\nFirst, while the economy is clearly sluggish now, the FOMC has already reduced the\ntarget federal funds rate by 325 basis points. These policy actions were preemptive and involved\n\n7\n\n\fmore aggressive rate cuts than in previous episodes, such as 1990-91 or 2001. The rate\nreductions were based on forecasts that economic activity would slow in the face of contracting\nhousing activity and substantial turmoil in financial markets. Growth has indeed been slow, at\nleast for the first half of 2008, but that cannot now be justification for further rate reductions.\nSurprises to forecasts of economic activity, if any, have been to the upside. Acting preemptively\nmeans that patience is required when circumstances play out in a way that is consistent with the\nforecast. Further action in the absence of substantial forecast errors would be double counting:\nin effect, reacting twice to the same concern.\nSecond, the full impact of monetary policy actions is not realized immediately. It is\nlikely that additional stimulus to economic activity from the monetary policy actions taken in\nJanuary and March will peak in the second half of 2008. In addition, there is a fiscal stimulus\nprogram in place that may shift some spending into the second and third quarters of this year.\nAny additional monetary policy actions must be judged by their expected impacts in the future in\nlight of current forecasts of the evolution of the economy. The best judgment, as incorporated in\ncurrent forecasts, is that the pace of economic activity will recover in the second half of 2008 and\nthroughout 2009.\nThird, at the current federal funds rate target of 2 percent, real interest rates are quite low\nby historical standards. Short-term real rates—computed by subtracting near-term forecasts of\nheadline inflation from nominal rates—are significantly negative. Three- to six-month-ahead\nheadline CPI inflation forecasts exceed 3 percent; some forecasts for this period exceed 3.5\npercent. Three-month Treasury bill and prime nonfinancial commercial paper rates are less than\n2 percent. Even when evaluated against forecasts of core inflation rates, these yields are zero to\n\n8\n\n\fslightly negative in real terms. Five-year inflation-indexed Treasury note yields are essentially\nzero.\nIn short, the Fed has created a low-interest rate environment that should allow the\neconomy to continue to adjust to the drag from the housing sector and the aftermath of financial\nmarket turmoil.\n\nThe Housing Sector\nLet me turn now to more specific comments on the housing sector. Private single-family\nhousing starts peaked in January 2006 at an annual rate of 1.823 million units. Since that time,\nhousing starts have continued to fall; in April 2008, they were only at an annual rate of 692\nthousand units, roughly 38 percent of the previous peak value. As striking as these statistics\nappear, they are not unprecedented. To put the contraction in housing production in a longerterm perspective, it is useful to divide housing starts by the number of households. In February\n2006, housing starts per household peaked at 1.65 percent. In March 2008, they had declined to\n0.64 percent per household. A startling fall, to be sure, but it has happened before. In January\n1973, housing starts per household peaked at 2.10 percent before declining to a trough of 0.94\npercent in February 1975. The 1973-75 decline was similar in magnitude to our current\nsituation, according to this metric. A similar phenomenon occurred later in the 1970s. In\nDecember 1977, housing starts per household were 2.03 percent before beginning to fall. They\nfell all the way to 0.66 percent in November 1981. These statistics remind us that housing can be\na highly cyclical industry. They also illustrate that the current contraction has clear precedents.\nIndeed, it is perhaps comforting that the order of magnitude in the previous declines is not unlike\n\n9\n\n\ftoday’s figures and that, when housing starts per household have fallen this low in the past, it\nwas near a turning point.\nA difference in the current environment is that housing prices have declined. The\nnational OFHEO purchase-only house price index in March of this year was about 3.4 percent\nlower than one year ago. The FHLMC conventional mortgage purchase-only home price index\nwas about 4.4 percent lower in the first quarter of this year as compared to one year earlier.\nMore ominously, the national S&P/Case-Shiller home price index was about 14.1 percent lower\nin the first quarter of 2008 compared to one year earlier. The Radar Logic per-square-foot\nmeasure of housing prices in 25 metropolitan statistical areas shows declines similar to those in\nthe Case-Shiller measure. The median sales price of existing homes is off about 8.5 percent from\none year earlier. These various measures have strengths and weaknesses, but they all tell a tale\nof declining prices over the past year.\nA key question for the macroeconomic outlook is whether and to what extent home prices\nwill continue to decline. My sense is that house prices today may be closer to fundamental\nvalue than is commonly believed. Consider the following simple calculation. Starting in the\nfirst quarter of 2001, a recession year, normalize the value of nominal GDP to one and the value\nof the house price index to one. Let’s use the house price index showing some of the most\ndramatic movements, the Case-Shiller national index. Now plot the level of the two indexes\nfrom 2001 to today. The nominal GDP index grows at a more or less steady pace up to the most\nrecent quarter for which data are available, the first quarter of this year. The Case-Shiller index\nshows a dramatic rise—often called a housing price bubble—before falling off again beginning\nin 2006. But, given the recent housing price declines, the level of the Case-Shiller index in the\nfirst quarter of 2008 is not far from the level of nominal GDP. If we expect fundamental house\n\n10\n\n\fprices to grow roughly in line with nominal GDP, then the current level of house prices is not far\nfrom fundamental value. One can reach similar conclusions using the other measures of housing\nprices. I take this as one indication that much of any “bubble component” of house prices is now\nout of the market.\nThis calculation depends on the idea that in 2001, we were not already in a housing\nbubble. I do not think we were. It is true that the Case-Shiller index was growing fairly rapidly\nin the late 1990s, but I interpret that as catching up from lower rates of growth earlier in that\ndecade. The calculation also depends on the idea that nominal GDP provides a rough benchmark\nfor nominal expenditure on housing and that house prices are a good measure of spending on\nhousing services. This is probably broadly true, but there are many details that would need to be\naddressed to produce a good theoretical model of fundamental housing prices. This is a great\narea for research. And finally, the calculation concerns national measures of the level of housing\nprices. Of course, real estate markets are driven by many local factors as well.\nA trend line is not a theory. I want to briefly mention some research that I have seen at\nrecent conferences that has shaped some of my thinking on house prices. These papers have a\ncommon theme that I think is important to emphasize—namely, that there are reasons to think\nthat the run-up in housing prices since the last recession reflect fundamental factors in part, and\nthat not all observed price movements can be attributed to a “bubble.” One paper is by the\nUniversity of Wisconsin’s own Morris Davis and François Ortalo-Magné, called “Household\nExpenditures, Wages, Rents,” which argues that expenditure share on housing is constant over\ntime. This seems important to me from a research perspective because it means we can build\nmacroeconomic models with housing sectors that use standard preferences for households. A\nsecond paper is by Carlos Garriga, who is on the staff at the St. Louis Fed, with co-authors\n\n11\n\n\fMatthew Chambers and Don Schlagenhauf, titled “Accounting for Changes in the\nHomeownership Rate.” The authors look at how changes in mortgage product aspects, such as\ndownpayment requirements and repayment structure change participation of different\ndemographic and income groups in a general equilibrium setting. This is an important topic as a\nkey, long-standing public policy goal in the United States has been to increase homeownership,\nand this paper helps us understand how innovations in financing might shape the participation\nrate in equilibrium. The third paper is by Princeton University economist Nobuhiro Kiyotaki\nwith co-authors Alexander Michaelides and Kalin Nikolov, titled “Winners and Losers in\nHousing Markets.” These authors emphasize that when the share of land value in the value of\nstructures is large, housing prices can be importantly influenced by changes in real interest rates.\nIn all of these studies, and many others that I do not have time to mention here, a theme is that\ntheoretical modeling of the housing sector is a difficult but important problem in\nmacroeconomics. Many details come into play—life cycle and demographic features, housing as\ncapital, housing as an asset, and the role of financing—each of which is a separate topic in the\neconomics literature. Another theme, and an important one from a policy perspective, is that\nhouse price movements may have more to do with fundamental factors than is commonly\nthought.\n\nConclusions\nIn conclusion, I appreciate having this opportunity to share with all of you some of my\nthoughts on the current state of the U.S. economy. While these are challenging times for\nmonetary policymakers, I am cautiously optimistic that we can move into the second half of\n\n12\n\n\f2008 on firmer footing with reduced financial market turmoil, reduced drag from the housing\nsector, more rapid economic growth, and a renewed focus on keeping inflation low and stable.\n\nReferences\nBernanke, Ben S. “The Benefits of Price Stability.” Speech delivered at The Center for\nEconomic Policy Studies and on the occasion of the Seventy-Fifth Anniversary of the Woodrow\nWilson School of Public and International Affairs, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey,\nFebruary 24, 2006; www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20060224a.htm.\nChambers, Matthew; Garriga, Carlos and Schlagenhauf, Don E. \"Accounting for Changes in the\nHomeownership Rate.\" Working Paper 2007-034A, August 2007 (forthcoming in International\nEconomic Review); http://research.stlouisfed.org/wp/2007/2007-034.pdf\nDavis, Morris A. and Ortalo-Magné, François. “Household Expenditures, Wages, Rents.”\nUnpublished manuscript, University of Wisconsin--Madison, November 2007;\nhttp://morris.marginalq.com/wages_rents_final.pdf\nKiyotaki, Nobuhiro; Michaelides, Alexander and Nikolov, Kalin. “Winners and Losers in\nHousing Markets.” Unpublished manuscript, Princeton University, CEPR and NBER, LSE,\nCEPR and FMG, Bank of England and LSE, September 2007;\nhttp://www.princeton.edu/~kiyotaki/papers/KMN08302007.pdf\nTaylor, John B.

Robert H. Rasche, Senior Vice President and Director of Research,\nand Marcela M. Williams, Special Research Assistant to the President, provided\nassistance. I take full responsibility for errors. The views expressed are mine and do not\nnecessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fRemarks on the U.S. Economy1\n\nIntroduction\nAs many of you know, I joined the Federal Open Market Committee at a difficult\njuncture for the Committee and for the American economy. Growth in real gross\ndomestic product, one of our best measures of overall health in the economy, has been\nsluggish. Financial markets have been struggling to return to normal operation since the\ncurrent turmoil began in earnest 10 months ago. In addition, the housing sector has been\nextraordinarily weak for some time, with prices falling and sales of both new and existing\nhomes on the decline. The Federal Reserve has responded to this situation by instituting\nan array of new lending facilities and sharply lowering interest rates through the fall of\n2007 and into the first several months of 2008.\nToday I will talk about these and related developments in the context of mediumand longer-term objectives for monetary policy. My sense is that the U.S. economy will\nbe able to post stronger growth in the second half of this year despite the ongoing\nfinancial turmoil, the drag from the housing sector, and rising energy prices. Meanwhile,\ninflation is becoming a more pressing concern as both inflation and inflation expectations\nare moving higher.\nLet me say before I continue that any views expressed here are my own and do\nnot necessarily reflect the official views of the Federal Open Market Committee or the\nFederal Reserve System.\n\n1\n\nPortions of this speech were delivered as “A Perspective on the U.S. Economy,” in Rogers, Ark, on June\n4, 2008, and “Remarks on the U.S. Economy and the State of the Housing Sector,” in Madison, Wis., on\nJune 6, 2008.\n\n1\n\n\fThe Objectives of Monetary Policy\nOver the past two decades, much has been said about the benefits of transparency\nand accountability in the conduct of monetary policy. Much has been achieved, both in\nthe United States and abroad, to reach these goals. I applaud these developments, and I\nbelieve that progress in this direction can and should continue. Consistent with these\nprinciples, in my role as the newest participant on the FOMC, I want to talk for a few\nmoments about my fundamental beliefs on the appropriate objectives of monetary policy.\nOne of the guiding principles from contemporary economic theory is that\nmonetary policy should be conducted in a systematic and predictable fashion. The\nexpectations of economic actors are critically important for the nature of equilibrium in\nthe economy. Private sector expectations evolve in part according to the outlook for\nfuture policy itself and the implications of that policy for the path of the economy. This\nview, once considered radical, is now widely accepted in academia and by monetary\npolicymakers around the world.\nSystematic monetary policy must start with a clear statement of the ultimate\npolicy objectives. The Federal Reserve is commonly characterized as striving to foster\nprice stability along with maximum sustainable employment. Other central banks,\nincluding the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, for\nexample, are charged with a single mandate: to maintain price stability. In the 1960s, the\ndual mandate was perceived to require a policy trade-off. Under the then-prevailing\nPhillips curve hypothesis, lower inflation could be achieved only at a cost of higher\nunemployment. Today, the consensus view is that there is no long-run tradeoff between\n\n2\n\n\finflation and unemployment. Indeed, a succession of Fed Chairmen—Paul Volcker, Alan\nGreenspan, and Ben Bernanke—have emphasized the complementarity of the two\nobjectives: namely, that price stability is a precondition for maximum sustainable\nemployment.2 I agree with this perspective.\nMoreover, I have been very impressed during my 18-year career as a Fed\neconomist considering the contrast in the behavior of the U.S. economy between highinflation and low-inflation eras. Between 1965 and 1984, U.S. inflation rose to doubledigit levels before falling again. Since 1984, inflation has remained under better control.\nThe earlier era was associated not only with higher and more variable inflation, but also\nwith a relatively volatile real economy. The more recent era has been associated with\nlower and less variable inflation and a substantially less volatile real economy. In the\nrecent macroeconomics literature, this has been called the “great moderation.” I think\nthat an important part of the volatility reduction is due to a monetary policy betterfocused on price stability since 1984.3 The volatility reduction—a reduction in the level\nof uncertainty faced by economic actors—is no small matter. It has meant a lot to\nbusinesses and households in our nation: long periods of growth punctuated by just two\nmild recessions since the mid-1980s.\nIn contemporary discussions, the term “price stability” has come to mean\nsomething other than “stable prices.” In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, price\nstability meant that variations in the general level of prices would be transitory and the\nprice index would revert to a mean. In recent policy discussions, however, price stability\n\n2\n\nSee, for example, Ben S. Bernanke, “The Benefits of Price Stability,” February 24, 2006.\n<www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20060224a.htm>.\n3\nFor a discussion of this possibility, see John B. Taylor, “Monetary Policy and the Long Boom,” April 16,\n1998. < http://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/98/11/9811jt.pdf>.\n\n3\n\n\fgenerally is interpreted as a small positive rate of inflation. If there is ongoing inflation,\nthe level of prices does not revert to a constant, but trends upward. I am willing to accept\nthis latter definition of price stability because there may be theoretical and practical\nreasons to believe that the best price indexes we have available are subject to upward\nbiases. While I am not a big fan of the upward-bias argument—after all, the bestavailable adjustments are already made to the indexes—I admit that I do not have better\nmeasures myself. My preferred definition of price stability is that trend inflation,\ncorrectly measured, is zero. In practice, this likely converts into a trend in measured\ninflation on the order of ½ to 1½ percent, depending on the particular price index\nreferenced.\nA sustained era of price stability requires that central banks create and maintain\nan environment in which financial market participants and the general public hold the\nexpectation that future inflation will remain low and stable. This commitment is an\nimplicit contract between the central bank and the public, and it should not be taken\nlightly. Such a commitment is frequently characterized as having an “anchor for inflation\nexpectations.” Some central banks have established such an anchor for the economy by\nannouncing an explicit numeric inflation target. The FOMC has chosen not to announce\nsuch a quantitative guideline, although many past and current participants on the\nCommittee have expressed individual preferences or “comfort zones” about ranges of\ninflation that they personally feel are appropriate objectives for policy.\nEven absent an explicit numeric inflation objective, the FOMC has achieved a\nnominal anchor for the economy over the past 25 years. The Committee accomplished\nthis the old-fashioned way—the Fed earned credibility for the expectation of low and\n\n4\n\n\fstable trend inflation based on the successful outcome of about 25 years of policy history.\nThe Volcker disinflation in the early 1980s succeeded in stabilizing inflation around 4\npercent per annum. After a mild and short-lived inflation breakout in the late 1980s, the\nGreenspan Fed produced a declining trend in inflation throughout the 1990s and into the\nfirst few years of the 21st century.\nDespite this past success, it is my judgment that at the present time inflation\nexpectations are fragile. By some measures, inflation has trended up in recent years. In\nthe decade from 1994 through 2003, the annual headline personal consumption\nexpenditures (PCE) inflation rate was less than 2.0 percent for five of the years, and was\nnever above 2.5 percent. Despite all that happened during that decade, it was credible to\nbelieve that the target for inflation was around 2.0 percent. Indeed, the average annual\nheadline PCE inflation rate was 1.86 percent. In contrast, in the past four years, the\nannual headline PCE inflation rate has consistently been above 2.5 percent; and, in the\npast six months, readings for headline PCE inflation measured from one year earlier have\nall been in excess of 3.0 percent. The step-up since 2004 has been due, in large part, to\nthe rapid increase in energy and other commodity prices during these years. Still, one\nwould expect that policy can be designed to deliver actual inflation rates near target over\nperiods as long as four or five years.\nInflation expectations have remained remarkably stable, but not at the 1.86\npercent headline PCE inflation rate established during the decade from 1994 to 2003.\nRecent market-based measures calculated from Treasury inflation-protected securities\nspreads indicate an implied five-year forward inflation rate of about 2.5 percent. One\nmight wonder how long inflation expectations can remain stable in this range. My sense\n\n5\n\n\fis that actual headline inflation in excess of 3.0 percent coupled with inflation\nexpectations near 2.5 percent will not be compatible for long. If inflation remains\nelevated, inflation expectations will begin to move higher. Market participants,\nbusinesses, and consumers will come to view higher inflation as part of the economic\nlandscape, in part because of doubts about the Fed’s ability and willingness to keep\ninflation contained. These expectations, if allowed to persist, will then feed into the\nequilibrium of the economy and will be difficult to reverse. In short, credibility is much\neasier to keep than it is to recover.\nA breakdown in inflation expectations has not occurred yet, to be sure, but the\nrisk is real. It is possible that a breakdown could happen over a very short horizon.\nIndeed, in the May 2008 University of Michigan/Reuters survey, the 12-month-ahead\nmedian expected inflation rate jumped to 5.2 percent (from 4.8 percent) and 25 percent of\nrespondents reported expecting inflation in excess of 10 percent over the next 12 months!\nMost likely these extraordinary readings were driven in part by recent exceptional\nincreases in certain commodities prices, especially gasoline. Still, the five-year-ahead\nmedian expected inflation in the survey has drifted up to 3.3 percent.\nDespite these worrisome numbers, I think that the Fed can contain the potential\nfor inflation expectations to drift higher. It is rule number one in modern central banking\nthat inflation and inflation expectations be kept under control. Let me repeat that: It is\nrule number one in modern central banking that inflation and inflation expectations be\nkept under control. After a 10-month period in which the dominant policy concern has\nrightly been the state of financial markets, policy can begin to address pressing\ninflationary concerns during the remainder of the year. While it is too early to say that\n\n6\n\n\fthe financial market turmoil has completely abated, the Fed’s new lending facilities\ncombined with an environment of low interest rates have gone some distance to return\nmarkets to more normal operation.\n\nSome Implications for the Current Policy Environment\nIn August of last year, the FOMC took the first of a sequence of policy actions\nthat reduced the target for the federal funds rate 325 basis points, from 5.25 percent to 2\npercent. The initial actions were motivated by turmoil in credit markets. By the end of\nlast year, evidence of slowing economic growth emerged. By early this spring, many\ncommentators and some economic forecasters were predicting that the economy was in or\nabout to enter a recession. The most recent Blue Chip consensus forecast projects\npositive growth in real GDP for each quarter in 2008, though the projected growth in the\nsecond quarter is close to zero. The most recent quarter-by-quarter outlook from the\nSurvey of Professional Forecasters is very similar to the Blue Chip consensus. Within\nthe past month, consistent with some stronger-than-expected economic data, forecasters\nhave generally backed off substantially in their estimates of the probability that the\neconomy is now in or will soon enter a recession.\nWhy have forecasts become more optimistic through the spring? I think it is\nbecause financial market turmoil is waning. A financial crisis is, naturally, a time of\ngreat uncertainty, as market participants are all wondering what will happen next.\nForecasters have to take into account the possibility that the crisis will worsen to the\npoint that a great deal of harm is done to U.S. financial markets. My sense is that, during\nthe first several months of this year, some forecasts were putting a high probability on\n\n7\n\n\fsuch an outcome. They were putting non-negligible weight on the prospect of the\neconomy switching to an equilibrium in which financial intermediation activity would be\nsharply curtailed. Now, however, it seems that such a prospect is more remote. As the\nprobability of severe damage to the financial system recedes, the likelihood of a\nmeasurable contraction in growth this year has lessened. These conditions complicate\nthe inflation outlook, in which significant economic slack had been seen as helping to\nkeep inflation in check.\nDespite these complications for the inflation outlook, my view is that policy is\nappropriately calibrated at this time, given the current economic environment and the\noutlook for the next 18 months. I see several reasons why maintaining the current policy\nis a good option for now.\nFirst, while the economy is clearly sluggish now, the FOMC has already reduced\nthe target federal funds rate by 325 basis points. These policy actions were preemptive\nand involved more aggressive rate cuts than in previous episodes, such as 1990-91 or\n2001. The rate reductions were based on forecasts that economic activity would slow in\nthe face of contracting housing activity and substantial turmoil in financial markets.\nGrowth has indeed been slow, at least for the first half of 2008, but that cannot now be\njustification for further rate reductions. Surprises to forecasts of economic activity, if\nany, have been to the upside. Acting preemptively means that patience is required when\ncircumstances play out in a way that is consistent with the forecast. Further action in the\nabsence of substantial forecast errors would be double counting: in effect, reacting twice\nto the same concern.\n\n8\n\n\fSecond, the full impact of monetary policy actions is not realized immediately. It\nis likely that additional stimulus to economic activity from the monetary policy actions\ntaken in January and March will peak in the second half of 2008. In addition, there is a\nfiscal stimulus program in place that may shift some spending into the second and third\nquarters of this year. Any additional monetary policy actions must be judged by their\nexpected impacts in light of current forecasts of the evolution of the economy. The best\njudgment, as incorporated in current forecasts, is that the pace of economic activity will\nbegin to strengthen in the second half of 2008 and throughout 2009.\nThird, at the current federal funds rate target of 2 percent, real interest rates are\nquite low by historical standards. Short-term real rates—computed by subtracting nearterm forecasts of headline inflation from nominal rates—are significantly negative.\nThree- to six-month-ahead headline CPI inflation forecasts exceed 3 percent; some\nforecasts for this period exceed 3.5 percent. Three-month Treasury bill rates are less than\n2 percent. Even when evaluated against forecasts of core inflation rates, these yields are\nzero to slightly negative in real terms. Five-year inflation-indexed Treasury note yields\nare essentially zero.\nIn short, the Fed has created a low-interest-rate environment that should allow the\neconomy to continue to adjust to the drag from the housing sector and the aftermath of\nfinancial market turmoil.\n\nHeadline versus Core Inflation\nLet me turn now to make a few comments on the issue of core versus headline\ninflation. Since July 2004, the FOMC has focused on inflation measured by the core\n\n9\n\n\fPCE price index in the semiannual Monetary Policy Reports. I think everyone in this\nroom is aware of the fact that, for most of the time since 2003, headline inflation has\nexceeded core inflation. According to core PCE measures of the price level, prices are\nabout 11 percent higher than they were in the beginning of 2003. But according to the\nheadline PCE measures, prices are about 15 percent higher than they were in 2003.\nUnfortunately for all of us, we face the headline prices, not just the core prices. Many are\nasking, What are the relative merits of focusing on core rather than headline inflation?4\nCore measures of inflation defined as excluding food prices have been\nconstructed by the BLS at least since 1957. Core measures of inflation excluding both\nfood and energy prices have been published since 1977. The rationale for these measures\nis not well documented, but it is likely that the original intent was to better reveal\nunderlying inflation trends. Historically, real food prices have exhibited large transitory\nmovements. Some of the major changes in real energy prices in the 1970s and mid-1980s\nalso proved transitory. Under these conditions, a focus on core measures gave\npolicymakers a clearer indication of changes in the trend of inflation that was subject to\npolicy control. Much of the volatility of these prices originated with supply shocks in\nparticular markets: droughts, crop failures, abundant harvests, OPEC boycotts, political\ndisturbances in major oil-producing countries, and the collapse of the world oil market.\nSupply disturbances of this sort do not produce the persistent spreads between headline\nand core inflation measures that have been observed over the past five years.\nI believe that consideration has to be given to the hypothesis that different forces\nhave driven the relative prices of food and energy in the recent past—namely, shifts in\n\n4\n\nFor a discussion of this issue, see Mark Wynne, “Core Inflation: A Review of Some Conceptual Issues,”\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Review, May/June 2008, 90(3, Part II), pp. 205-28.\n\n10\n\n\fdemand in world markets. These forces are likely to persist for some time. In particular,\nI have in mind rapid increases in standards of living in large emerging-market economies.\nAssociated with these increases in living standards are higher consumption of calories\nand higher consumption of energy and thus increasing demand in the global markets for\nthese products. With low short-run elasticity of supply for food and energy production,\nthese trends in demand generate trends in relative prices.\nThe best forecast is that China, in particular, will continue to grow at a rapid rate\nfor the next decade. Longer-run elasticities of supply for agricultural products are likely\nsubstantially larger than short-run elasticities, and hence the recent trend in relative prices\nof food may be expected to moderate. Trends in relative energy prices may moderate\nwith the emergence of new technologies. Nevertheless, a plausible case can be made that\ncurrent trends in these relative prices will persist and that, therefore, headline measures of\ninflation will remain above core measures.\nShould policymakers take into consideration persistent differences in headline and\ncore measures of inflation? I believe that consistency requires attention to such\ndifferences in the formulation of policy. Unless there are compelling reasons to do\notherwise, policy has to focus on the prices actually faced by households and businesses.5\nPersistent and substantial trends in other relative prices are not factored out in measuring\noverall inflation trends. The relative prices of computers, communications equipment,\nand consumer electronics, for instance, have been falling for decades. However, no one\n\n5\n\nOne recent analysis of this issue is by Bodenstein, Erceg, and Guerrieri (2007), which provides some\nsupport for focusing on core inflation when energy prices are volatile. I think this is a good example of the\ntype of research required, but I also think that conclusions in this area will be sensitive to the details of the\nmodel used and that the possibility of a relative price trend has to be addressed.\n\n11\n\n\fto my knowledge has argued that we are understating the fundamental trend in inflation\nbecause our core measures do not exclude these items.\nLet me stress that I do not have an answer to this question, but I think it has\nbecome an important concern for the FOMC. Again, what is new here is relative price\ntrends in food and energy that may plausibly be expected to persist for some time. If it\nwere just a matter of the food and energy components being volatile, I think a theoretical\ncase could be made that these prices contain too much noise and so should be ignored in\nday-to-day policy decisions. Historically, the ex-food and energy calculation seems to\nhave worked well, even though arbitrarily ignoring certain prices is not very elegant.\nWith relative price trends, the ad hoc approach to this question is becoming increasingly\nuntenable.\n\nConclusions\nIn conclusion, I appreciate having this opportunity to share with all of you some\nof my thoughts on the current state of the U.S. economy. While these are challenging\ntimes for monetary policymakers, I am cautiously optimistic that we can move into the\nsecond half of 2008 on firmer footing with reduced financial market turmoil, reduced\ndrag from the housing sector, more rapid economic growth, and a renewed effort on\nkeeping inflation low and stable.\n\n12\n\n\fReferences\nBernanke, Ben S. “The Benefits of Price Stability.” Speech delivered at The Center for\nEconomic Policy Studies and on the occasion of the Seventy-Fifth Anniversary of the\nWoodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, Princeton University,\nPrinceton, New Jersey, February 24, 2006;\n<www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20060224a.htm>\nBodenstein, Martin, Christopher Erceg, and Luca Guerrieri (2007). \"Optimal Monetary\nPolicy in a Model with Distinct Core and Headline Inflation Rates,\" unpublished paper,\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\n<http://dallasfed.org/news/research/2007/07taylor_erceg.pdf>\nWynne, Mark A. “Core Inflation: A Review of Some Conceptual Issues,” Federal\nReserve Bank of St. Louis Review, May/June 2008, 90(3, Part2), pp. 205-28.\nTaylor, John B.

Wall Street has\nbeen racked by seismic change. Uncertainty over the future\nprospects for the U.S. economy has caused consumers\nand businesses to pull back on discretionary consumption\nand investment spending. Doubts concerning the true\nvalue of complex securities continue to weigh heavily on\n\nPresident and Chief\nExecutive O cer\n\nnancial markets worldwide. The still-uncertain fate of\nhousing markets has kept the value of the underlying\nmortgage assets obscured.\n\nPhotos\n\nThe Federal Reserve has been active and innovative in\nresponding to the evolving turmoil during 2008. In addition\nto deploying interest rate cuts, the Fed has implemented a\nseries of new and unconventional tools. This innovation\nhas intensi ed in response to market events over the past\nseveral weeks. There may be many more twists and turns\nin the policy response going forward.\nTonight I will discuss the challenges my Federal Reserve\ncolleagues and I face as we strive to implement a policy\nthat is designed to deliver low and stable in ation along\nwith maximum sustainable employment.\nTo organize my talk, I will describe three funerals and a\nwedding—that is, three ideas about the U.S. economy that\nmay be going to their nal resting place and one idea that,\n\nBio\nCurriculum Vitae\nStaff Contacts\nIDEAS/RePEc Pro le\n\nVideos\nSubscribe:\nEmail alerts\nRSS\n\"Rationally, let it be said in a\nwhisper, experience is certainly\nworth more than theory.\"\nAmerigo Vespucci\n\n\fonce left for dead, may be taking on a new life. I will keep\nyou all in suspense about what ideas I have in mind.\nAs always, any views expressed here are my own and do\nnot necessarily re ect the o cial views of other Federal\nOpen Market Committee members.\nThe Fate of the Great Moderation\nA common description of current events is that some\ncherished theories about the macroeconomy have been\nshattered. One idea is that the fabled resiliency of the U.S.\neconomy over the past several decades is being called into\nquestion. Policymakers and academics alike have\ndescribed the period since the mid-1980s as the Great\nModeration, meaning that the volatility of the economy has\nbeen markedly lower during recent decades than it was in\nthe earlier part of the postwar era, and certainly much less\nthan during the interwar period during the 1920s and\n1930s. Now, that moderation and resiliency may be coming\nunraveled. If so, it would be a funeral for the Great\nModeration.\nIs it really true that the Great Moderation is coming to an\nend? My sense is that it is too early to tell. Let's begin with\na description of why policymakers and academics started\ntalking about moderation and resiliency in the rst place.\nThe main idea is simple: Our primary measures of\nmacroeconomic performance have been a lot less volatile\nthan they were before 1984. In particular, quarterly GDP\ngrowth rates for the U.S. economy since 1945 show a clear\nchange in behavior beginning in the middle 1980s. After\n1984, these growth rates are only about half as volatile as\nthey were during the earlier period.(1) So, for the past 25\nyears, growth rate volatility has dramatically moderated\nfrom what it was in the 1950s, '60s, and '70s.\nFurthermore, this phenomenon is not limited to real GDP\ngrowth rates. Almost all macroeconomic data have been\ndramatically less volatile since the mid-1980s, according to\nacademic research.(2) So the Great Moderation is a clear\nfeature of the U.S. macroeconomic data since the mid1980s. And, as is often the case when the data show a\nclear pattern, theories abound about the causes of this\nphenomenon. But all the theories have a common theme—\nnamely, that some important macroeconomic event\ntriggered a more stable, more resilient American economy\nover the past 25 years.\nUnderstandably, many are yearning for a sense of stability\ntoday, and many are questioning what happened to the\nresiliency and moderation in the U.S. economy. Two areas\nstand out where volatility has been particularly high since\nthe current nancial turmoil began in earnest in August of\n2007. One is in certain interest rates and interest rate\nspreads, especially in markets that have experienced\nsevere di culties since the turmoil began. The closely\nwatched LIBOR-Overnight Index Swap spread, for instance,\n\n\fpeaked at more than 300 basis points before retreating in\nrecent weeks. In July of 2007, this spread was less than 10\nbasis points. Another is in equity markets: The Wilshire\n5000 stock price index, one of the broadest measures of\nequity valuation, is currently trading near its lows of 2002\nand 2003. The Chicago Board Options Exchange market\nvolatility index, or VIX, has often been above 60 during\nOctober and November of this year; in July of 2007 it was\nbelow 20. The dramatic rise in volatility based on numbers\nlike these is clear.\nStill, it is far too early to organize a funeral for the Great\nModeration. Even though nancial market volatility is\nexceptionally high and even though the U.S. economy is\ncontracting during the second half of 2008, the demise of\nthe Great Moderation would require much more evidence\nthan currently exists. Real economic variables, in particular,\nwould have to swing much more than they have to date,\nand the increased volatility would have to continue for a\nnumber of years before we could start to compare the\ncurrent environment to the pre-1984 experience and\npronounce the moderation dead. So far, real GDP has fallen\nby 0.3 percent at an annual rate, which is the number\nreported for the third quarter of this year. To be sure,\ncurrent quarter output is expected to fall sharply, followed\nby further but less-severe contraction in the rst quarter of\n2009. If that scenario materializes, the contour of the\ncurrent recession will look much the same as that of the\n1990-91 recession. As bad as that feels, it is not enough to\nundo 25 years of moderated behavior in the U.S. economy.\nChanges in the Financial Marketplace\nIt is no secret that the current nancial market turmoil has\nbrought about once-unimaginable changes on Wall Street.\nOne telling sign of the magnitude of these changes is that\nthe U.S. economy began the year with ve large investment\nbanks, but will exit the year with zero. Without question, the\npast 15 months of nancial market turmoil is radically\naltering the nature of U.S. nancial intermediation. I think it\nis fair to say that we are witnessing a funeral for the\nnancial system we knew over the past two decades.\nA key culprit has been the illiquidity of mortgage-backed\nsecurities and related nancial instruments. Many nancial\nrms simply did not manage risk exposure on these\nsecurities well and, as a result, have struggled with losses\nand write-downs. The International Monetary Fund has\nestimated that more than $1.4 trillion of losses will have to\nbe absorbed by the nancial sector before all is said and\ndone in this episode, and that only a portion of these\nlosses has been accounted for to date.(3) The opacity of\nthe nancial instruments involved has kept everyone\nguessing as to where these losses truly lie, which explains\na lot about how events have unfolded during 2008. No rm\nhas an incentive to declare that they may suffer debilitating\nlosses, and; so, markets have to discover which rms are\n\n\finsolvent and which are likely to survive and build market\nshare in the post-shakeout industry structure. The sharp\ndownturn in the real economy during the fall has intensi ed\nthe pressure. In the meantime, rms have become wary of\ntrading with one another, certain markets have ceased\nnormal functioning, and market participants and\npolicymakers alike have been confronted with a series of\nannouncements from rms near bankruptcy. In a recent\nNew York Times editorial, Treasury Secretary Paulson\nnamed the litany of rms experiencing \"failure, or the\nequivalent of failures\": Bear Stearns, IndyMac, Lehman\nBrothers, Washington Mutual, Wachovia, Fannie Mae,\nFreddie Mac and the American International Group.\"(4)\nThe Federal Reserve has been forced to improvise in\nresponse to rms' announcements of this nature. The key\nconcern has been that, if important nancial market\nplayers are failing, the failure should occur in an orderly\nway with the lowest level of market disruption. In the\nbanking sector, there are well-established procedures for\nresolving a failed institution in an orderly way. These\nprocedures have served the nation well both during the\ncurrent crisis and during the savings and loan episode\nduring the late 1980s and early 1990s. It is very important\nto recognize that in the non-bank nancial sector today\nthere are no such procedures. This regulatory gap is likely\nto be a primary focal point for discussions of the future of\nnancial market regulation. In particular, any reform has to\naddress the question of whether and how to set up\nsystems to resolve failing non-bank nancial rms in an\norderly way.(5) The current system—bankruptcy court—is\nnot working.\nAs the shakeout process has unfolded this year, markets\nhave been continually bracing for further surprise\nannouncements from nancial rms. The policy response\nto this situation has been exceptionally aggressive.\nConsider the S&P 500 largest nancial rms by assets as\nof the fourth quarter of 2007. The rst 47 rms on the list\naccounted for 95 percent of the total assets held by the\nsector at that date. As of mid-summer 2008, just one of\nthese nancial rms had been the focus of a direct policy\nresponse of any kind. That rm was Bear Stearns, which,\nback in March, was purchased by JPMorgan Chase with\nhelp from the Fed. Almost all the others were operating as\nthey had during recent years. The situation is dramatically\ndifferent today. As of today, 20 out of the 47 have received\ncapital injections under the Treasury's TARP effort. Three\nof these are non-bank nancial rms that changed their\ncharters to become bank holding companies, including two\nof the largest rms on the list, Goldman Sachs and Morgan\nStanley, and, just recently, American Express. Several other\nrms on the list merged with stronger partners, including\nCountrywide Financial and Merrill Lynch (both acquired by\nBank of America), National City (acquired by PNC),\nWachovia (acquired by Wells Fargo) and Sovereign\nBancorp (proposed acquisition by Banco Santander). The\n\n\fassets and debt obligations of Washington Mutual were\npurchased by JPMorgan Chase. Lehman Brothers went to\nbankruptcy court, but important portions of the company\nwere acquired by Barclay's Capital. Fannie Mae and Freddie\nMac were placed into conservatorship. American\nInternational Group has a restructured loan arrangement\nwith the Treasury and the Federal Reserve. These events\nhave touched 31 of the 47 rms on the list. This means\nthat much of the uncertainty surrounding the fate of U.S.\nnancial companies has been addressed in one manner or\nanother during the past several months. Turmoil is still\nsigni cant, to be sure, but the policy response has been\nvery aggressive, and many of the largest uncertainties have\nbeen addressed.\nFuneral for a Friend\nThe nancial market turmoil began during the summer of\n2007. The initial analysis—widely accepted among\npolicymakers and forecasters—suggested that problems in\nthe subprime sector of the mortgage markets were unlikely\nto be large enough to have a substantial impact on the U.S.\neconomy outside of the nancial sector. Markets seemed\nto con rm this judgment during the fall of 2007, as equity\nindexes peaked. Late last year, however, it became\napparent that problems were going to be more di cult and\nlong-lasting than the original analysis suggested. Real GDP\ngrowth in the fourth quarter of last year was slightly\nnegative based on the revised data available today.\nEmployment growth turned negative in January 2008.\nThe Fed responded to the weakening economy by easing\naggressively, lowering the target federal funds rate by 225\nbasis points during the rst few months of the new year, all\nthe way down to 2 percent. During the summer, the FOMC\nwent on hold, but intensi ed turmoil during the fall\ncombined with weaker-than-expected data on the real\neconomy triggered further easing moves during the past\nseveral weeks. This has left the FOMC with a federal funds\ntarget at the 1 percent level, with further easing possible as\nweak data roll in over the next several months.\nWhether the FOMC decides to stay on hold at this point or\neases further and then stays on hold at some lower level,\neven zero, may not be the most critical question. The fact\nis, monetary policy de ned as movements in short-term\nnominal interest rates is coming to an end, at least for now.\nIt's a funeral for a friend.\nThe end of nominal interest rate targeting in the U.S. for the\nnear term means that much more attention will have to be\npaid to alternative ideas about controlling in ation and\nin ation expectations going forward. An important\ncharacteristic of the current environment is that mediumterm in ation expectations seem to be spreading out\ndramatically, with some analysis warning of high in ation,\nothers warning of de ation and still others expecting\nin ation to remain near the levels recently experienced.\n\n\fOne focus of analysis over the coming quarters will be the\nexperience in Japan. Japan was buffeted by large declines\nin equity and real estate markets in the early 1990s. In\nresponse, the Bank of Japan lowered nominal interest\nrates to near-zero by the middle of that decade, and it has\nnot been above 1 percent since. An important part of the\noutcome in Japan has been a rate of de ation that has\naveraged about 1 percent since the mid-1990s. De ation,\nshould it occur in the U.S., might be particularly challenging\nbecause some of the core problems we have are in\nhousing markets, where contracts are written in nominal\nterms. An unexpected de ation would make those\ncontracts more expensive for borrowers.\nOne idea from the Japanese experience is that, with\nnominal interest rates at very low levels, more attention\nmay have to be paid to quantitative measures of monetary\npolicy. By announcing and maintaining targets for key\nmonetary quantities, the Fed may be able to keep in ation\nand in ation expectations near target and ward off either a\ndrift toward de ation or excessively high in ation. This will\nbe an important issue for the Fed in coming months and\nrepresents a challenge in the communication of monetary\npolicy going forward.\nA Rebirth\nSo far, I have discussed three funerals, ideas whose times\nmay have passed. I now want to turn to a macroeconomic\nidea that is being rehabilitated as we speak. That idea is\nscal policy, in particular the spending side of scal policy\nand the idea of more direct intervention in the affairs of\nprivate sector rms.\nAt least since the 1980s, scal policy de ned by de cit\nspending has had a negative connotation in many\nmacroeconomic policy circles. Former Council of\nEconomic Advisers Chairman N. Greg Mankiw, writing in\n1991, listed as his \"dubious Keynesian proposition #4\" the\nidea that \" scal policy is a powerful tool for economic\nstabilization.\" He included this sentence: \"In the United\nStates today, scal policymakers have completely\nabdicated responsibility for economic stabilization.\"(6)\nThat was 1991, but I think it is a fair assessment of the\nthinking in much of the economics profession up until the\ncurrent nancial market turmoil. Fiscal policy, at least in\nthe U.S., was viewed as important for the macroeconomy,\nbut from a longer-run perspective. To the extent there are\nstabilization goals—goals requiring time-critical policy\ninterventions—the usual idea is that certain types of tax\ncuts might be bene cial, but that otherwise the effort is\nbest left to monetary policy. Not least in this thinking is\nthat the Fed can act relatively quickly, while the political\nprocess tends to be much slower and more cumbersome.\nYet, during the past two months in particular, scal policy\nconceived of as more direct intervention in the operation of\nprivate sector rms has emerged as a leading tool to\n\n\fcombat ongoing nancial market turmoil. This is so, not\njust in the U.S., but globally. The passage of the Emergency\nEconomic Stabilization Act (EESA), with authorization for\nthe Treasury to spend up to $700 billion to help return\nnancial markets to more normal operation, has put the\nfocus going forward squarely on scal responses. This has\ncreated, in a matter of weeks, a very different policy\nenvironment from the one that had existed in the U.S.\nduring the past 25 years.\nThe original idea behind the EESA was to create a market\nfor the illiquid asset-backed securities and related\ninstruments that are at the heart of the present situation.\nThese assets have current prices, to the extent that they\ncan be determined, that are very low, the so-called re sale\nprice, because so many rms would like to sell their\nholdings and few buyers exist in the current climate.\nHowever, these securities also have a higher, hold-tomaturity price that re ects the likely value of the stream of\nrevenue for a patient investor who is willing to simply hold\nthe asset for a period of time. Under the original EESA\nproposal, the government would play the role of the patient\ninvestor, buying the securities at a reverse auction and\nholding them or selling them at a future moment when\nnancial market stress has receded. In principle, this idea\ncould be executed at no ultimate cost to the taxpayer,\nalthough taxpayer money would be put at risk. An\nimportant part of the concept is that taxpayer money\nwould be used to purchase assets that would then be sold\nin the future, recouping most or all of the initial outlay. The\ngovernment would not have to purchase all assets, only\nenough to credibly create a market. I thought such a\nprogram, if it could be executed on a su cient scale, may\nhave helped to liquefy illiquid asset-backed securities\nmarkets and so may have helped progress toward an\norderly nancial market consolidation. This in turn would\nhave helped to reduce or eliminate the downside risk to\neconomic performance.\nAs events have transpired, the asset-purchase program has\nbeen put on hold. Given the rapid ow of events, capital\npurchases came to be viewed as a simpler, more timely\nand more direct method of intervention. The Treasury's\ncapital injection program, for which $250 billion is\ncommitted, has taken the bulk of the resources from the\nrst $350 billion tranch of the $700 billion appropriation.\nRestructuring of the deal with American Insurance Group\nhas taken an additional $40 billion. With $60 billion\nremaining, Secretary Paulson has indicated that he does\nnot want to commit further funds at this point without input\nfrom the new administration. Also, the remaining amount\nfrom the rst tranch may be too small to run an effective\nprogram.\nConclusions\n\n\fTonight I talked about three funerals and a wedding. The\nongoing nancial market turmoil may have caused the\ndeath of many cherished ideas about how the\nmacroeconomy operates. One funeral was for the idea of\nthe Great Moderation. Certainly nancial markets have\nseen exceptional volatility recently, and some behavior in\nthose markets has been unprecedented. Still, I am not\nready to bury the Great Moderation yet—we will need a lot\nmore very volatile data on the real side of the economy to\ntruly depart from the experience of the past 25 years. A\nsecond funeral was for our nancial system as we have\nknown it. That transformation has occurred and continues,\nwith repercussions for U.S. and global nancial market\nregulation. A third funeral was for monetary policy de ned\nas nominal interest rate targeting. At least over the near\nterm, any additional in uence through interest rate\nreductions will be limited, and the focus of monetary policy\nmay turn to quantity measures. The wedding—the idea on\nthe rise—is scal policy de ned as more direct intervention\nin certain parts of the private sector. While the Fed will\ncontinue to be innovative in providing liquidity to markets\nthrough existing facilities and possibly some new\nprograms, an important part of the response to ongoing\nnancial market turmoil will come from scal policy\nintervention. This runs counter to much of the thinking in\nmacroeconomic policy circles over the past two decades.\nIt may be discomforting or rewarding or both, but\nstabilization policy in the coming months and quarters is\nlikely to look very different from what we have been\naccustomed to seeing.\nFootnotes\n1.

The\nviews expressed are mine and do not necessarily re ect\no cial positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nGood evening.(1) The nancial turmoil in the U.S. has been\ngoing on for more than one year. The investment bank Bear\nStearns collapsed in March, and over the summer the\nhealth of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\nwas called into question. Financial markets have been on\nedge. Financial strains intensi ed two weeks ago with the\nbankruptcy of another investment bank, Lehman Brothers,\nand threatened bankruptcy of insurer American\nInternational Group.\nIn a short period of time, the landscape of Wall Street and\nthe American nancial system has changed radically.\nFinancial market turmoil is widely considered to be the\nprimary near-term threat to U.S. economic performance,\nand market commentary focuses on which nancial\ninstitutions the government considers \"too big\" or \"too\nconnected\" to fail.\nOver the past year, several large global nancial institutions\nhave either failed or have been signi cantly restructured to\navoid failure. But why should any rm, large or small, be\nprotected from failure? After all, in a dynamic, competitive\neconomy, individuals can raise capital, organize rms and\nenter markets. Obsolete rms, either because the demand\nfor their products has declined or their management has\nnot adapted to environmental change, must be allowed to\nfail. Why not apply this principle universally? For nancial\n\nJames Bullard\nPresident and Chief\nExecutive O cer\nBio\nCurriculum Vitae\nStaff Contacts\nIDEAS/RePEc Pro le\nPhotos\nVideos\nSubscribe:\nEmail alerts\nRSS\n\"Rationally, let it be said in a\nwhisper, experience is certainly\nworth more than theory.\"\nAmerigo Vespucci\n\n\frms, the answer usually focuses on systemic risk.\nSystemic risk refers to the possibility that the failure of one\nrm will severely impair or even cause the failure of other\nhealthy rms or markets. If such contagion became\nwidespread, it could severely affect the macroeconomy.\nSystemic concerns were at the heart of many recent public\npolicy decisions. For instance, regarding Bear Stearns,\nChairman Bernanke recently explained: \"Our analyses\npersuaded us . . . that allowing Bear Stearns to fail so\nabruptly at a time when the nancial markets were already\nunder considerable stress would likely have had extremely\nadverse implications for the nancial system and for the\nbroader economy. In particular, Bear Stearns' failure under\nthose circumstances would have seriously disrupted\ncertain key secured funding markets and derivatives\nmarkets and possibly would have led to runs on other\nnancial rms.\"(2)\nIn my remarks this evening I will try to make sense of\nsystemic risk. An important theme of systemic risk is its\nexpectations component: In particular, if a rm is known to\nbe at risk of failure for a substantial period of time, it\ncannot normally be thought to pose important systemic\nrisk. Counterparties in such a case are well aware of the\npossibility of failure and can take action to mitigate their\nown risk. A second theme is that nancial regulation\nshould seek to ensure that no nancial rm is \"too big\" or\n\"too connected\" to fail. The nation needs a regulatory\nregime that can liquidate in an orderly fashion non-bank\nnancial rms that fail the market test. A third theme is\nthat an overly aggressive public sector response to the\npotential failure of a nancial institution can exacerbate\nsystemic risks in the nancial system by creating the\nexpectation that taxpayers will pick up losses for failing\nrms. This is the well-known \"moral hazard\" problem.\nLet me stress that I am presenting my personal views,\nwhich are not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market\nCommittee or the Federal Reserve System.\nWhat Is Systemic Risk?\nLet me begin with a discussion of what is commonly\nmeant by systemic risk and why failures of nancial\ninstitutions sometimes are believed to be more likely to\npose systemic risks than failures of non nancial\ninstitutions.\nSystemic risk is di cult to de ne precisely. The leading\npractical de nition seems to be that \"we know it when we\nsee it.\" In part because systemic risk is considered to be\nsomething of a rare event, it does not play a signi cant role\nin commonly used macroeconomic models. As a\nconsequence, the discussion of systemic risk can be rather\nloose. Macroeconomists sometimes de ne systemic risk\nas the danger of widespread disruption of nancial\nmarkets and institutions that, in turn, affects the\n\n\fmacroeconomy. For example, former Fed Gov. Frederic\nMishkin de nes systemic risk as \"the risk of a sudden,\nusually unexpected, disruption of the information ows in\nnancial markets that prevents them from channeling\nfunds to those who have the most productive pro t\nopportunities.\"(3) A key part of this de nition is the word\n\"unexpected.\" Should a disruption cause nancial markets\nto become badly damaged, all other parts of the economy\nmay be adversely affected because the ensuing level of\nnancial intermediation services may be considerably\nlower than they were before the disruption.\nFor example, consider a banking system. Traditionally,\nbanks have held deposits with other banks to settle\npayments and exchange for services. Large money center\nbanks often hold deposits for hundreds of other banks. The\nfailure of a large money center bank thus could tie up the\ndeposits of other banks, possibly causing large losses for\nthem as well. Continental Illinois Bank was the largest\ncorrespondent bank in the United States when it failed in\n1984. Regulators stepped in to protect Continental's\ncreditors —even those with deposits exceeding the normal\ninsurance limit—to guard against the possible failure of a\nlarge number of banks that held deposits at Continental.\nSystemic risk is often associated with incomplete\ninformation. In the case of a banking system, systemic risk\ncan arise when a bank's depositors—even relatively\nsophisticated depositors, such as other banks—become\nunsure about the condition of the bank in which they hold\ntheir funds. If Continental Illinois' depositors had realized\nthat the bank was nearly insolvent, they would have\nprotected their assets by moving their deposits to banks\nthey considered sound. In fact, many large depositors did\njust that, suggesting that the systemic risk associated with\nContinental's failure was not very large. Indeed, one study\nconcluded that few banks would have suffered signi cant\nlosses even if the FDIC had not fully guaranteed all of the\ndeposits in Continental.(4)\nRecent concern about systemic risk has focused not so\nmuch on depositor runs on depository institutions, but\nrather on investment banks that deal in complex nancial\ncontracts. For example: Suppose Bank A purchases an\noption from Bank B to hedge some risk, perhaps the risk of\na change in the term structure of interest rates. If Bank B\nlater fails, perhaps because of bad investments in the\nhousing market, then the option that Bank A purchased\nbecomes worthless. Thus, Bank A—which thought it was\ncarefully hedging its risk—is adversely affected by Bank B's\nproblems in housing markets.\nOf course, nancial rms can take steps to protect\nthemselves to some degree in simple situations like the\none I just described. Inside the framework of an economic\nmodel, such steps would in fact fully compensate Bank A\nagainst the possible failure of Bank B. The logic of self-\n\n\finterested behavior combined with market clearing would\nlead to an appropriate pricing of risk—Bank A would have\nconsidered the possibility of the failure of Bank B and\ntaken this into account in its contingency plan. The\npossibility of counterparty failure would be fully priced into\nmarket transactions.\nEconomic models are abstractions, of course, but they do\ncontain insight about the world. Is counterparty risk\nsomehow mispriced in actual markets? It may be that, in\nactual markets, nancial arrangements are so complex\nthat the nature of risk that rms face might not be obvious.\nIf so, that may be a challenge for those managing the risks.\nNevertheless, as we saw with Bear Stearns and Lehman\nBrothers, sophisticated investors and counterparties will\ncease to do business with a rm once the rm's weak\ncondition becomes known.\nIn recent years, concerns about bank runs have tended to\ncenter on individual institutions, rather than on the banking\nsystem as a whole. However, sometimes all rms in an\nindustry are \"tarred by the same brush\" and the failure of\none rm leads investors to shun an entire industry. Banking\npanics are the classic example: During the early 1930s,\nbank failures were so widespread that the public shifted a\nlarge portion of their funds out of bank deposits and into\ncash. Many economists believe that the Federal Reserve's\nunwillingness to counteract the resulting decline in the\nnation's money supply was an important cause of the Great\nDepression.\nWhy should the failure of a single rm cause the public to\nbecome suspicious of an entire industry? One answer is\nrelated to the fact that people have imperfect information,\ntheir own private noisy signal, and as a result they may try\nto infer information from the behavior of others. I'll give you\na well-known example. Suppose you are driving down a\nhighway and stop in a small town to eat. There are two\nrestaurants on Main Street. Would you prefer to eat in the\none with the crowded parking lot or the one whose parking\nlot is empty? Many people will infer that the restaurant with\nthe crowded parking lot has better food and go there.\nMany in this audience will know that a situation in which\npeople infer information from the actions of others is\ncalled an \"information cascade,\" and that it is an active eld\nof research. Inferring others' information from their actions\ncan be misleading, however. For example, suppose the rst\nperson to stop for lunch that day chose a restaurant\narbitrarily. That uninformed choice might in uence all the\nsubsequent hungry people who attempt to determine a\nrestaurant's quality from the number of cars parked in its\nlot.\nAs in the restaurant example, if depositors see others\nwithdrawing money from a bank, they might infer that\nthose making withdrawals have private information about\nthe bank's condition. Similarly, if one bank fails, then\n\n\fdepositors—who are unable to independently distinguish\ngood and bad banks—might decide that the problems that\nbrought down the failed bank will also affect other banks.\nAs a consequence, depositors might withdraw their money\nfrom all banks.(5) The collapse of the asset-backed\ncommercial paper market in 2007 appears to exemplify\nsuch herding behavior, because investors shunned the\nasset-backed commercial paper of all issuers more or less\nindiscriminately. Herding may explain why all rms in an\nindustry are \"tarred by the same brush\" by investors, even if\nthey are not necessarily tied to each other through explicit\ncontractual obligations.\nWhy the Financial System Is Special\nNothing I have said thus far about systemic risk is\nnecessarily unique to nancial institutions or markets.\nEven the failure of a non nancial rm, such as an\nautomobile manufacturer, will affect the rm's suppliers\nand distribution networks. Spillovers to the non-auto sector\nwill also occur, but the regional effects might be larger than\nthe national effects. By the same token, a default by an\nairline company on its debt obligations might cause\ninvestors to shun the debt of other airline companies if\ninvestors believed that the default re ected an industrywide problem, such as rising fuel prices. Still, over the past\ndecade, some very large rms have failed, including Enron,\nWorldCom and several major airlines, yet none caused\nsigni cant problems beyond its immediate shareholders,\nemployees, suppliers and customers. In fact, in recent\nyears systemic risk has not been a public policy concern\nwhen a non nancial rm has failed. Rarely would the\nfailure of a non nancial rm threaten the solvency of a\ncompetitor, let alone signi cantly affect the economy more\nbroadly. Instead, failure of a large industry player often\nsuggests opportunity for the remaining players to increase\nmarket share and pro tability.\nWhy do we think the failure of a large nancial rm\npresents risks that the failure of a non nancial rm does\nnot? Several reasons have been emphasized.\nThe rst is interconnectedness. In the normal course of\nbusiness, large commercial and investment banks may\nbecome signi cantly exposed to one another through\ninterbank deposit markets, transactions in over-the-counter\nderivatives, and wholesale payment and settlement\nsystems. Settlement risk—the risk that one party to a\nnancial transaction will default after the other party has\ndelivered—is a big concern for large nancial institutions\nwhose daily exposures routinely run into many billions of\ndollars. The lightning speed with which nancial\ntransactions take place and the complex structures of\nmany banks and securities rms make it especially di cult\nfor a rm to fully monitor the counterparties it deals with,\nlet alone the counterparties of counterparties. A seemingly\nstrong bank that fails quickly may potentially expose other\n\n\frms to large losses. Even rms that do not make direct\ntransactions with the affected bank may be exposed\nthrough their dealings with third parties that do trade with\nthe affected bank.\nA second reason is leverage. Compared with most\nnon nancial rms, banks and other nancial institutions\nare highly leveraged—that is, they have relatively thin\ncapital margins to absorb losses. Firms acquire their\nassets either by selling equity or borrowing funds. If a\nnancial rm has borrowed the equivalent of 95 percent of\nits assets, a 5 percent loss in asset value will render the\nrm insolvent. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the giant\ngovernment-sponsored enterprises that have nanced or\nguaranteed nearly 50 percent of all U.S. home mortgages,\nran into nancial di culties in part because of their\nextreme leverage. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were able\nto operate with very little capital because investors widely\nviewed their debt as guaranteed by the federal government.\nMy predecessor, Bill Poole, warned several years ago that\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac held too little capital and\nwere vulnerable to a downturn in the housing market.(6)\nHis comments were prescient: Both Fannie Mae and\nFreddie Mac have lost billions, prompting sharp declines in\ntheir share prices and ultimately a government\nconservatorship.\nA third reason is maturity mismatch. Not only are nancial\ninstitutions typically highly leveraged, but the nature of\ntheir business entails an inherent mismatch in the\nmaturities of their assets and liabilities that can make\nthem vulnerable to liquidity shocks. Most nancial\nintermediaries borrow short and lend long—that is, they\nfund long-term, relatively illiquid investments with shortterm debt. For example, commercial banks traditionally\nhave used demand deposits, which depositors can\nwithdraw at any time, to fund loans and other long-term\ninvestments. Similarly, many banks and securities rms\nrely heavily on commercial paper, repurchase agreements\n(repos) and other short-term funding sources. If depositors\nsuddenly pull their funds from a commercial bank, or\nlenders cease to roll over the commercial paper or repos\nissued by a securities rm, the bank or securities rm\ncould be forced into bankruptcy. Bear Stearns collapsed\nwhen investors refused to roll over the rm's short-term\ndebt, collateral notwithstanding. Other rms have faced\nsharply higher funding costs as markets have reevaluated\nthe creditworthiness of borrowers. The speed with which\nthe markets can \"turn off the tap\" makes nancial\ninstitutions especially vulnerable to temporary disruptions\nof liquidity in nancial markets. A parallel was the \"hot\nmoney\" that was withdrawn from Thailand and other East\nAsian countries in the late 1990s—or Mexico prior to that.\nRecent Developments in Financial Markets\n\n\fDuring the past several years, a large number of nancial\ninstitutions have built up considerable holdings of\nmortgage-backed securities and related nancial\ninstruments. These securities provided holders with a ow\nof income derived from the monthly mortgage payments of\nthe underlying asset. The recent decline in house prices,\nalong with a slowing economy, caused many homeowners\nto default or walk away from their homes—especially those\nwith nontraditional mortgages. These conditions have\neroded the value of the mortgage-backed securities and\nthus reduced the net wealth of those investors and\ninstitutions that held them.\nThe resulting illiquidity of mortgage-backed securities and\nrelated nancial instruments has caused severe stress for\nthe U.S. nancial system over the past year. Many nancial\nrms simply did not manage risk exposure on these\nsecurities well and, as a result, have struggled with losses\nand write-downs. A nancial sector shakeout has ensued,\none that was entirely appropriate considering the\nmagnitude of the mismanagement involved. As is normal\nduring an industry shakeout, weaker rms are forced into\nbankruptcy or merge with stronger partners, and\nopportunity abounds for those rms that are able to\nsurvive and build market share in the post-shakeout\nindustry structure.\nThe Federal Reserve has responded vigorously in an\nattempt to mitigate the effects of the shakeout on the rest\nof the economy. The key concern has been that if\nimportant nancial market players are failing, the failure\nshould occur in an orderly way with the lowest level of\nmarket disruption. In the banking sector, there are wellestablished procedures for resolving a failed institution in\nan orderly way. It is very important to recognize that in the\nnon-bank nancial sector there are no such procedures.\nThis has kept the Fed improvising, especially during the\nlast seven months.\nThe Bear Stearns episode provided the rst case of a largescale failure. The novelty of the situation suggested that a\nBear Stearns bankruptcy was largely unexpected within\nnancial markets and therefore likely to cause signi cant\nmarket disruption. In that case, the Fed helped arrange a\nmerger with JPMorgan Chase as the stock price of Bear\nStearns was declining toward zero.\nDuring the summer, mortgage giants Fannie Mae and\nFreddie Mac experienced increasing stress, eventually\ninducing an aggressive policy response. Placing these\nentities into conservatorship was largely a Treasury action\nin conjunction with the primary regulator, the Federal\nHousing Finance Agency (FHFA), with only a consultative\nrole for the Federal Reserve. These government sponsored\nenterprises, or GSEs, were previously implicitly backed by\nthe U.S. government, and the recent action makes that\nbacking completely explicit. The GSE conservatorship\n\n\fremoves a key uncertainty from the scene and should help\nto stabilize markets going forward.\nIn recent weeks, the investment bank Lehman Brothers\nappeared to be in a position similar to Bear Stearns. The\nLehman Brothers situation had been evolving for a year,\nand market players had already seen the demise of an\ninvestment bank. In this case, counterparties had plenty of\ntime to assess the potential for Lehman to fail. As a\nconsequence, nancial market participants were less likely\nto have been surprised and signi cant market disruption\nwas judged less probable. In addition, the Fed had\nimplemented additional liquidity facilities in the wake of\nBear Stearns in an attempt to mitigate adverse\nconsequences from future failures. Lehman led for\nbankruptcy. Since then, important pieces of the company\nhave been sold to Barclays Capital. In a related\ndevelopment, investment bank Merrill Lynch agreed to sell\nitself to Bank of America. The two remaining investment\nbanks, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, last week\nchanged their charters to become commercial banks.\nThese events have left the U.S. with no large investment\nbanks.\nOne di culty in dealing with a crisis is the element of\nsurprise. Just as the events surrounding Lehman were\ncoming to a head, solvency problems at insurer American\nInternational Group, with $1.1 trillion in assets, became\nacute. While AIG's stock price had been declining for some\ntime, its demise was rapid and largely unanticipated. A\nbankruptcy ling in the immediate aftermath of Lehman\nwas judged likely to cause signi cant market disruption.\nThe AIG board of directors agreed to a Fed bridge loan. The\nterms included the ouster of the CEO and an interest rate\nset at Libor plus 850 basis points.\nIt is important to stress that the Federal Reserve's intent in\neach of these cases has not been to save these rms but\nto orchestrate an orderly transition for nancial markets as\nthese rms exit the scene in their current form.\nAgain, because of the lack of a regime for the orderly\nresolution of failed institutions in the non-bank nancial\nsector, the Fed was forced to improvise in the Bear Stearns,\nLehman, and AIG episodes. These improvised actions have\nhad mixed success. In the Bear Stearns episode, there was\nsigni cant, but manageable, turmoil in the aftermath of the\nmerger announcement. In the Lehman-AIG episode, there\nwas signi cant turmoil that threatened to spread globally\nto seemingly unrelated markets. Part of this was\nattributable to the largely unexpected nature of the AIG\nbankruptcy threat within 48 hours of Lehman's bankruptcy\nling. The continuing turmoil prompted Treasury Secretary\nPaulson to approach Congress concerning a more\nsystematic method of handling the shakeout in the\nnancial sector.\n\n\fIt is far from clear how nancial market turmoil of this\nmagnitude will ultimately affect the real economy. The\nleading modern example for large economies is Japan,\nwhere substantial problems in real estate and the banking\nsector were followed by a decade or more of sub par\neconomic performance. Many Asian countries involved in\nthe currency crises of 1997 and 1998 suffered through\nsevere recessions. In the U.S., we have been more\nfortunate so far. The 1987 stock market crash has often\nbeen mentioned in conjunction with recent events, but real\nGDP growth was actually strong during the second half of\n1987: Third quarter growth was 3.7 percent, and fourth\nquarter growth was 7.2 percent. At the time, many\nsuggested that the U.S. was in or would immediately go\ninto recession due to nancial market upset. It did not\nhappen, which provides an object lesson about how\ndi cult it can be to really understand what is driving shortterm dynamics in the economy. Similarly, the collapse of\nLong-Term Capital Management occurred in the second\nhalf of 1998, the culmination of a year of turmoil in global\nnancial markets. But U.S. real GDP growth in the second\nhalf of 1998 averaged about 5.5 percent.\nAll of these events offer clues but also differ in important\nways from the current episode. We do not know what will\nhappen this time around, and we should be humble in our\npredictions. Still, these examples suggest that there is\nsubstantial downside risk. There is some possibility of a\nrelatively benign outcome, where the nancial market\nshakeout plays itself out and real economic performance is\nmuted but not disastrous. But there is also some\npossibility of a very adverse outcome in which the entire\neconomy is drawn into a protracted downturn.\nReducing Systemic Risk\nWhat policies can reduce systemic risk in the nancial\nsystem? Systemic risk may be viewed as a classic \"public\ngoods\" problem, in which private rms invest less in the\ngood than is socially desirable because they are unable to\ninternalize all of the bene ts of their investment. For this\nreason, private rms may invest less in minimizing\nsystemic risks than would be socially desirable. In addition,\nit is likely to be di cult for private rms to coordinate their\nactivities to minimize or eliminate systemic risks. Because\nof these problems, government policy can and should play\na constructive role in reducing systemic risks in the\nnancial system. Several proposed changes might reduce\nsystemic risk in nancial markets: enhanced supervision of\nnancial rms; Federal Reserve oversight of payment and\nsettlement systems; and the creation of a framework to\nliquidate investment banks and other securities rms in an\norderly fashion, similar to the framework already in place to\nliquidate commercial banks.\nAny change in regulation should be designed to ensure that\nno rm is \"too big\" or \"too connected\" to fail because of\n\n\fsystemic concerns. Bailouts are expensive—not just\nbecause they commit taxpayer funds, but because they can\nencourage behavior that increases subsequent systemic\nrisk. A rm that expects government protection if its\ninvestments go awry may take bigger gambles than a rm\nthat expects no protection. And if no securities rm were\nallowed to fail, then investors would have little incentive to\nmonitor the activities of the rms in which they invest or to\ndemand higher interest rates on loans to the riskiest rms.\nIn short, the expectation of government intervention in the\nevent of loss reduces market discipline and increases the\nincentive for rms to act imprudently.\nMonetary policy plays an important role in the stability of\nour nancial system. A monetary policy focused on\npreserving long-run price stability will, as a by-product,\npromote nancial stability. By contrast, nancial rms and\nmarkets are less resilient to shocks when the price level is\nunstable. An unstable price level can lead to poor price\nsignals and cause inaccurate forecasts of real returns to\ninvestment projects. Errors in disentangling nominal and\nreal returns can result in a misallocation of resources and\neventually in nancial distress that would not have\noccurred if the price level had been stable. Business\ndecisions based on expectations of continuing in ation\noften turn out badly when in ation falls, resulting in higher\nrates of loan defaults and business failures. In short,\nin ation and in ation instability put an economy's nancial\nsector at risk. Therefore, it is critical that monetary\npolicymakers not lose sight of the importance of\nmaintaining price stability—even during periods of nancial\nturbulence.\nConclusion\nIn summary, the near-term outlook for economic growth\nand in ation is above all uncertain. Two keys to future\neconomic performance will be stabilization in housing and\nnancial markets. Financial market turmoil has recently\nbeen severe, and the consequences of this turmoil on real\neconomic performance entail clear downside risk. If\nnancial market turmoil can be contained, the FOMC can\nturn attention to achieving better in ation results than\nthose recently experienced. Until in ation clearly\nmoderates, my colleagues and I will need to be especially\nwatchful that our accommodative policy stance does not\nbegin to worsen the outlook for long-run price stability.\nFootnotes\n1.

            "content": "President’s Welcome\nJames Bullard\n\nA\n\ns president of the Bank, it is my\npleasure to welcome you to the ThirtyThird Annual Policy Conference of\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.\nThis conference concerns measurement of\nthe economy’s potential output. The concept of\npotential output is straightforward to define—the\neconomy’s maximum sustained level of output—\nbut difficult to measure. Inclusion of the term\nsustained suggests that the concept of potential\ngrowth is closely tied to inflation—a low, stable\ninflation rate is essential if an economy is to\nattain maximum economic growth and, hence,\nremain through time at or near its potential level\nof output.\nIn macroeconomic stabilization theory and\npractice, the concept of potential growth has a\nlong history. Early analyses focused on the output\ngap. Fortunately, belief in an exploitable long-run\ntradeoff between the unemployment rate and\nthe rate of inflation was rejected by economists\ndecades ago. Today’s classical and New Keynesian\nmodels suggest that, given enough time for adjustment and a benign pattern of shocks, the economy\nwill adjust in the long run toward its potential\nlevel of output. The speed of such adjustment\ndepends on the relative flexibility or inflexibility\nof wages, prices, and expectations—aptly summarized by Keynes’s quip that “In the long run,\nwe are all dead.” But, taken literally, Keynes’s\ncall to action, as we now recognize, can be quite\ndangerous when near-term preliminary data\ncontain significant uncertainty and measure-\n\nment error, as demonstrated by the papers of\nAthanasios Orphanides, John Williams, and\nSimon van Norden (e.g., Orphanides and\nvan Norden, 2002; and Orphanides and Williams,\n2005).\nThe concept of potential output is an important feature of monetary policymaking. At our\nconference in 2007 in honor of Bill Poole, Lars\nSvensson and Noah Williams (2008, p. 275)\ncharacterized the task of policymakers as seeking\nto “navigate the sea of uncertainty.” Correct economic stabilization policy, like correct navigation,\nrequires a focus on the destination, or long-run\nobjective. The Federal Reserve, in particular, operates with a dual mandate from the Congress to\nachieve both price stability and maximum employment. These goals are not in conflict—both require\nfostering an environment to support maximum\nsustainable growth. Academic policy models,\nwhile differing one from another, typically include\na concept of potential output. Fixed-parameter\npolicy rules, such as the Taylor rule, feature an\noutput gap. Flexible inflation targeting models,\nsuch as those of Lars Svensson (e.g., Svensson,\n1997) emphasize that inflation can, and does, at\ntimes, move away from the desired level. Thus,\nthe choice of an optimal policy that will return\ninflation to its target depends on a tradeoff between\nthe costs of the higher-but-falling inflation and\nany induced output gap (i.e., an output gap judged\nrelative to some measure of potential output). One\nlesson of such models is that, even when monetary policymakers focus solely on achieving price\n\nJames Bullard is president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Review, July/August 2009, 91(4), pp. 179-80.\n\n© 2009, The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.

Some of these challenges arose from price\ndeclines in housing markets and the associated turmoil in\nmortgage nancing. Others were the product of a\nbreathtaking run-up in energy and commodity prices. The\nFederal Reserve has responded to these challenges in\ntimely and innovative ways. Our actions have included\ntraditional monetary policy moves, but we have also\nimplemented new and unconventional tools. This\ninnovation has intensi ed in response to market events\nover the last several weeks. Today I will talk about the nearterm outlook for the economy and the challenges my\nFederal Reserve colleagues and I face as we strive to\nimplement a policy that is designed to deliver low and\nstable in ation along with maximum sustainable\nemployment.\nIn the best of times, forecasting is di cult. In times of\nmagni ed uncertainty, it may be unwise to attempt to\nguess the level of economic performance. That said, my\nsense is that the pace of growth in the U.S. economy over\nthe second half of the year will be positive but slower than\nits pace over the rst half of the year. Although recent\ndevelopments suggest that headline in ation may\nmoderate from its current levels, price pressures are\nelevated and several measures of in ation expectations\n\nJames Bullard\nPresident and Chief\nExecutive O cer\nBio\nCurriculum Vitae\nStaff Contacts\nIDEAS/RePEc Pro le\nPhotos\nVideos\nSubscribe:\nEmail alerts\nRSS\n\"Rationally, let it be said in a\nwhisper, experience is certainly\nworth more than theory.\"\nAmerigo Vespucci\n\n\fare inconsistent with the medium-term projections of\nFOMC participants. A key challenge in the current\nenvironment is to navigate through substantial nancial\nmarket turmoil without creating a new and di cult-to-solve\nin ation problem in its wake.\nLet me say before I continue that any views expressed here\nare my own and do not necessarily re ect the o cial views\nof other Federal Open Market Committee members.\nCurrent Economic Developments\nThe economy has shown some strength thus far in 2008.\nThis strength was apparent in the sharp upward revision to\nreal gross domestic product during the second quarter.\nEarlier this year, many forecasters were predicting negative\ngrowth in real GDP in the second quarter. These\nexpectations seemed consistent with the evolving\nslowdown in growth over the nal three months of last year\nand the rst three months of this year. But the sharply\nnegative growth did not materialize. This is only the most\nrecent example of how di cult it can be to get a good\nhandle on short-term economic developments.\nOne of the most signi cant recent developments on the\nreal side of the economy has been the steady slowing in\nthe pace of spending by U.S. households. Economists pay\nclose attention to consumer spending, since it comprises\nabout three-quarters of expenditures on real GDP. After\nincreasing by more than 3 percent per year from 2003 to\n2006, the growth of real consumer spending began to taper\noff in the second quarter of last year. Since then, real\nconsumer spending has increased at a slower pace—\ndespite a sizable scal stimulus package and aggressive\ninterest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.\nThe consumption spending slowdown has occurred\nagainst the backdrop of the sharp increase in oil and other\ncommodities prices that began last year. Retail gasoline\nprices, which had averaged $2.36 per gallon in the rst\nquarter of 2007, jumped to $3.02 per gallon in the second\nquarter of 2007—and they have mostly stayed above $3 per\ngallon since. In response to record-high gasoline prices,\nconsumers have changed their buying patterns. First, sales\nof domestically manufactured cars and light trucks are on\npace to be their weakest since 1991. Although domestic\nauto sales posted a surprising rebound in August, it seems\nlikely that aggressive sales incentives were an important\ncontributing factor. Second, record-high gasoline prices\nhave caused consumers to switch from relatively highpriced, less-fuel-e cient light trucks and SUVs, to relatively\nlower-priced, more-fuel-e cient passenger cars. The end\nresult has been a decline in total expenditures on motor\nvehicles over the past year. Although the demand for\ndurable goods such as cars and trucks is highly cyclical, it\nseems likely that higher gasoline prices can account for a\nlarge percentage of the recent declines in automotive\nsales.\n\n\fIt is entirely possible that recent developments in the labor\nmarkets will compound the slowing in real consumer\nspending over the second half of this year. In August,\nnonfarm payroll employment declined by 84,000, and\nrevisions indicated bigger declines over the previous two\nmonths than were originally estimated. So far this year,\npayroll employment has declined by an average of about\n76,000 per month. Job losses this year have been largest in\nthe manufacturing and construction sectors, as well as in\nprofessional and business services. Interestingly, about 30\npercent of the drop in payroll employment since January\n2008 is attributable to temporary help services workers.\nThis is much larger than the experience over comparablelength intervals seen in 1990-91 and 2001.\nOne of the most startling statistics to come out of the\nAugust employment report was the rise in the\nunemployment rate. Over the past year, the unemployment\nrate has increased sharply—from 4.7 percent to 6.1 percent\n—mostly in the last three months. Although changes in\nemployment can have signi cant effects on consumer\nspending, it is also true that households tend to smooth\ntheir consumption. That is, during di cult times\nhouseholds rely on accumulated saving and borrowing to\nmaintain living standards. While the decline in employment\nwill probably have some adverse effects on consumer\nspending in the aggregate, the effect tends to be small\nrelative to other factors that seem more important to\nhouseholds, such as current and expected real incomes.\nStill, the rise in unemployment is consistent with a cyclical\nslowing in GDP growth, as rms respond to weaker sales\nby scaling back their work force.\nHigher energy prices also have adversely affected the\nbusiness sector. To help protect their narrowing pro t\nmargins, rms have attempted to pass along all or part of\ntheir cost increases to their customers, they have idled\nsome existing capacity, and they have reduced their labor\ncosts. These are typical responses to an oil price shock. At\nthe same time, sharp increases in oil prices also tend to\nincrease uncertainty about future oil prices. In their\ndecisions to build capacity or expand their work force,\nrms must be forward-thinking. Increased uncertainty\nabout future oil prices may cause rms to postpone\nplanned capital outlays and perhaps lead to a costly\nreallocation of resources. As a current example, some\nautomotive manufacturers have announced permanent\nclosures of some plants that produce less-fuel-e cient\nvehicles.\nBeginning late last year, business capital spending on\nequipment and software weakened. In the second quarter\nof 2008, for example, real equipment and software\nexpenditures declined at the fastest rate in ve and a half\nyears. For the most part, the bulk of this weakness was\nconcentrated in the outlays for industrial and\ntransportation equipment; business spending on\n\n\finformation-processing equipment and software has\nremained brisk. Thus, part of this slowdown is undoubtedly\nenergy related.\nSome strength has re-emerged in the manufacturing\nsector. New orders for manufactured durable and\nnondurable goods have risen strongly for ve consecutive\nmonths. One source of this strength may be the robust\nexport sector, which has been a key part of the economy's\nresilience in the face of declining employment. Other areas\nof business capital spending that are not dependent on\nforeign demand, such as business spending on\ncommercial and industrial structures, have remained quite\nstrong. On balance, business capital spending seems to be\nrebounding modestly and may help to offset some\nemerging weakness in consumer spending.\nGoing forward, falling oil prices, if sustained, should help\nhouseholds and businesses cope with existing strains. In\nfact, given that the recent decline in oil prices has probably\nexceeded the near-term assumptions of most forecasters,\nit is conceivable that economic growth over the second\nhalf of the year may turn out to be moderately stronger\nthan the consensus expects.\nTo be sure, the timing and extent of a strengthening in the\neconomy will also largely depend on the recovery of the\nhousing sector. Since the rst quarter of 2006, the\nresidential housing investment component of real GDP has\nsubtracted, on average, almost a full percentage point from\neach quarter's real GDP growth. This has been a signi cant\ndrag on growth, and; so, stabilization in the housing sector\nshould provide a sizable stimulus to overall growth, all else\nequal.\nMost forecasters do not expect to see a bottom in housing\nconstruction until early 2009. By then, homebuilders will\nhave probably worked off the bulk of their excess\ninventories of unsold new homes. However, the inventory\nof existing homes on the market remains near record-high\nlevels, and it seems likely that it will take longer to work off\nthat inventory. Sales of new and previously sold singlefamily homes appear to have stabilized over the past few\nmonths. It seems unlikely that sales would have stabilized\nif buyers were still expecting steep price declines.\nWidely watched house price measures include the\nS&P/Case-Shiller index and the O ce of Federal Housing\nEnterprise Oversight (OFHEO) index. There are some\nsigni cant differences between the two.(1) The CaseShiller index includes homes purchased with\nnonconforming mortgages—also known as jumbo\nmortgages. By contrast, the OFHEO index has broader\ngeographic coverage and only includes conforming\nmortgages, that is, mortgages that are eligible to be\npurchased by government-sponsored enterprises such as\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac.(2) Over the four quarters\nending in the second quarter of 2008, the Case-Shiller\n\n\fnational price index has declined by a little more than 15\npercent, while the OFHEO price index has declined by a\nlittle less than 5 percent.\nThe decline in home prices, which has been most severe in\nparts of the West and in the Southeast—places where\nhome prices had earlier posted the largest increases—has\naffected the economy in important ways. One widely cited\neffect is that falling house prices reduce household equity\nwealth, which may have a depressing effect on consumer\nspending. My sense is that these effects may not be very\nlarge. A recent study published by the Bank of Canada\nnotes that in the United States the extra boost to\nconsumption from an increase in housing wealth ranges\nfrom 2 to 11 percent according to existing empirical\nresearch.(3) That's a large range. Moreover, other studies\nhave found that a decline in housing wealth has no effect\non consumption. These results suggest that we want to be\ncareful not to overstate wealth effects.\nRecent Developments in Financial Markets\nMore substantial macroeconomic effects from falling\nhouse prices may come through nancial markets. A large\nnumber of nancial institutions have had considerable\nholdings of mortgage-backed securities on their balance\nsheets. These securities provided holders with a ow of\nincome derived from the monthly mortgage payments of\nthe underlying asset. The recent decline in house prices,\nalong with a slowing economy, caused many homeowners\nto default or walk away from their houses—especially\nthose with nontraditional mortgages. These conditions\nhave eroded the value of the mortgage-backed securities\nand thus reduced the net wealth of those investors and\ninstitutions that held them.\nThe resulting illiquidity of mortgage-backed securities and\nrelated nancial instruments has caused severe stress for\nthe U.S. nancial system over the past year. Many nancial\nrms simply did not manage risk exposure on these\nsecurities well and, as a result, have struggled with losses\nand write-downs. A nancial sector shakeout has ensued,\none which was entirely appropriate considering the\nmagnitude of the mismanagement involved. As is normal\nduring an industry shakeout, weaker rms are forced into\nbankruptcy or merge with stronger partners, and\nopportunity abounds for those rms that are able to\nsurvive and build market share in the post-shakeout\nindustry structure.\nThe Federal Reserve has responded aggressively in an\nattempt to mitigate the effects of the shakeout on the rest\nof the economy. The key concern has been that if\nimportant nancial market players are failing, the failure\nshould occur in an orderly way with the lowest level of\nmarket disruption. In the banking sector, there are wellestablished procedures for resolving a failed institution in\nan orderly way. It is very important to recognize that in the\n\n\fnon-bank nancial sector there are no such procedures.\nThis has kept the Fed improvising, especially during the\nlast seven months.\nThe Bear Stearns episode provided the rst case of a largescale failure. The novelty of the situation suggested that a\nBear Stearns bankruptcy was largely unexpected within\nnancial markets and therefore likely to cause signi cant\nmarket disruption. In that case, the Fed helped arrange a\nmerger with JPMorgan Chase as the stock price of Bear\nStearns was declining toward zero.\nDuring the summer, mortgage giants Fannie Mae and\nFreddie Mac experienced increasing stress, eventually\nleading to an aggressive policy change. Placing these\nentities into conservatorship was largely a Treasury action\nin conjunction with the primary regulator, the Federal\nHousing Finance Agency (FHFA), with only a consultative\nrole for the Federal Reserve. The GSEs were previously\nimplicitly backed by the U.S. government, and the recent\naction makes that backing completely explicit. The GSE\nconservatorship removes a key uncertainty from the scene\nand should help to stabilize markets going forward.\nIn recent weeks, the investment bank Lehman Brothers\nappeared to be in a position similar to Bear Stearns. The\nLehman Brothers situation had been evolving for a year,\nand market players had already seen the demise of an\ninvestment bank. In this case, counterparties had plenty of\ntime to assess the potential for Lehman to fail. As a\nconsequence, nancial market participants were much less\nlikely to have been surprised and signi cant market\ndisruption was judged less probable. In addition, the Fed\nhad implemented additional liquidity facilities in the wake\nof Bear Stearns in an attempt to mitigate adverse\nconsequences from future failures. Lehman led for\nbankruptcy. Since then, important pieces of the company\nhave been sold to Barclays Capital. In a related\ndevelopment, investment bank Merrill Lynch agreed to sell\nitself to Bank of America. The two remaining investment\nbanks, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, this week\nchanged their charters to become commercial banks.\nThese events have left the U.S. with no investment banks.\nOne di culty in dealing with a crisis is the element of\nsurprise. Just as the events surrounding Lehman were\ncoming to a head, solvency problems at insurer American\nInternational Group, with $1.1 trillion in assets, became\nacute. While AIG's stock price had been declining for some\ntime, its demise was rapid and unanticipated. A bankruptcy\nling in the immediate aftermath of Lehman was judged\nlikely to cause signi cant market disruption. The AIG board\nof directors agreed to a Fed bridge loan. The terms\nincluded the ouster of the CEO and an interest rate set at\nLibor plus 850 basis points.\nIt is important to stress that the Federal Reserve's intent in\neach of these cases has not been to save these rms but\n\n\fto orchestrate an orderly transition for nancial markets as\nthese rms exit the scene in their current form.\nAgain, because of the lack of a regime for the orderly\nresolution of failed institutions in the non-bank nancial\nsector, the Fed was forced to improvise in the Bear Stearns,\nLehman and AIG episodes. These improvised actions have\nhad mixed success. In the Bear Stearns episode, there was\nsigni cant, but manageable, turmoil in the aftermath of the\nmerger announcement. In the Lehman-AIG episode, there\nwas signi cant turmoil, which threatened to spread\nglobally to seemingly unrelated markets. Part of this was\nattributable to the largely unexpected nature of the AIG\nbankruptcy threat within 48 hours of Lehman's bankruptcy\nling.\nThe continuing turmoil has prompted Treasury Secretary\nPaulson to approach Congress concerning a more\nsystematic method of handling the shakeout in the\nnancial sector. The intent of the Secretary's proposal is to\ncreate a market for the illiquid asset-backed securities and\nrelated instruments that are at the heart of the present\nsituation. These assets have current prices that are very\nlow, the so-called re sale price, due to the fact that so\nmany rms would like to sell their holdings, and there are\nfew buyers in the current climate. But these securities also\nhave a hold-to-maturity price that re ects the likely value of\nthe stream of revenue for a patient investor who is willing\nto simply hold the asset for a period of time. Under the\nproposal, the government would play the role of the patient\ninvestor, buying the securities at auction and holding them\nor selling them at a future moment when nancial market\nstress has receded. In principle, this idea could be\nexecuted at no ultimate cost to the taxpayer, although\ntaxpayer money would be put at risk. An important part of\nthe concept is that taxpayer money would be used to\npurchase assets, which would then be sold in the future,\nrecouping most or all of the initial outlay. A program like\nthis would probably go a long way toward liquefying illiquid\nasset-backed securities markets and; so, would help\nprogress toward an orderly nancial market consolidation.\nIt is far from clear how nancial market turmoil of this\nmagnitude will ultimately affect the real economy. The\nleading modern example for large economies is Japan,\nwhere substantial problems in real estate and the banking\nsector were followed by a decade or more of subpar\neconomic performance. Many Asian countries involved in\nthe currency crises of 1997 and 1998 suffered through\nsevere recessions. In the U.S. we have been more fortunate\nso far. The 1987 stock market crash has often been\nmentioned in conjunction with recent events, but real GDP\ngrowth was actually strong during the second half of 1987:\nThird quarter growth was 3.7 percent, and fourth quarter\ngrowth was 7.2 percent. At the time, many suggested that\nthe U.S. was in or would immediately go into recession due\nto nancial market upset. It did not happen, which provides\n\n\fan object lesson about how di cult it can be to really\nunderstand what is driving short-term dynamics in the\neconomy. Similarly, the collapse of Long-Term Capital\nManagement occurred in the second half of 1998, the\nculmination of a year of turmoil in global nancial markets.\nBut U.S. real GDP growth in the second half of 1998\naveraged about 5.5 percent.\nAll of these events offer clues but also differ in important\nways from the current episode. We do not know what will\nhappen this time around, and we should be humble in our\npredictions. Still, these examples suggest that there is\nsubstantial downside risk. There is some possibility of a\nrelatively benign outcome, where the nancial market\nshakeout plays itself out and real economic performance is\nmuted but not disastrous. But there is also some\npossibility of a very adverse outcome in which the entire\neconomy is drawn into a protracted downturn.\nRecent In ation Developments\nOne of the most unsettling aspects of the current\nmacroeconomic environment is the high and volatile rate\nof in ation. In 2007, headline in ation—whether measured\nby the consumer price index (CPI) or the personal\nconsumption expenditures price index (PCE Price Index)—\nreached its highest rate in more than 17 years!\nSkyrocketing oil and commodity prices over the rst seven\nmonths of this year contributed to the high in ation rate.\nAs a result, through August, the CPI has increased at an\nannual rate of more than 5 percent, while the PCE price\nindex has increased at an annual rate of a little less than 5\npercent through July. This is not price stability. In fact,\nthese numbers are very far from meeting any de nition of\nprice stability.\nWhen discussing the outlook for in ation, the FOMC has\ntended to place considerably more weight on core in ation\nmeasures that exclude food and energy prices. The\nrationale for this is that price shocks emanating from\nhigher oil or commodity prices have historically tended to\nbe temporary. However, one could argue that the rise in oil\nprices from a little less than $20 per barrel in late 2001 to\nmore than $100 per barrel this year re ects a permanent\nincrease in the demand for crude oil from rapidly growing\ncountries in Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America. It is\nnatural to think that global demand will continue to rise for\nsome time.\nHigher oil prices have both direct and indirect effects on\nprices paid by households. An example of a direct effect is\nthe increased price of gasoline or diesel fuel, or the natural\ngas to heat one's home. The indirect effects occur when\nbusinesses experiencing compressed pro t margins due to\nhigher energy costs are able to increase their selling prices\non non-energy goods and services or to add on fuel\nsurcharges. These indirect effects typically show up in the\ncore measures of in ation. There is considerable evidence\n\n\f—as most recently discussed in the September Beige Book\nnarrative—that producers are increasingly able to pass\nalong their higher input costs to offset the compression in\ntheir pro t margins. We can perhaps see this most clearly\nin the acceleration in the core in ation rate over the past\nthree months.\nA key concern is that the current level of the federal funds\ntarget rate, at 2 percent, is well below the current rate of\noverall in ation. This means that the real cost of borrowing\nshort-term is negative. In other words, the FOMC's interest\nrate target is unusually low. Over time we will need to\nadjust this rate to a level that is more conducive to long-run\nprice stability and maximum sustainable employment.\nConclusions\nIn summary, the near-term outlook for economic growth\nand in ation is above all uncertain. Two keys to future\neconomic performance will be stabilization in housing and\nnancial markets. Financial market turmoil has recently\nbeen severe, and the consequences of this turmoil on real\neconomic performance entail clear downside risk.

However, he noted that any recovery in household spending will be\nslow and gradual.\nBullard also pointed to recent housing data that indicates this sector is nearing a\nbottom and to recent employment gures that are showing smaller declines, although\nthe labor market is expected to remain weak. The turmoil in the nancial markets also\nseems to be abating, although conditions have not yet gone back to pre-crisis levels.\nAnother positive sign is improved economic growth in other countries, Bullard said.\n\"The international outlook is also showing more positive signs, most recently with\nFrance, Germany and Japan reporting positive growth gures,\" Bullard said.\nTo help keep the edgling recovery on track, the Fed's monetary policy will remain\naccommodative, he said.\n\"The Fed's main objective during 2007-2009 was to avoid a de ationary experience\nsuch as the one experienced during the 1990s in Japan,\" Bullard said. \"Monetary policy\nis still very accommodative, and the FOMC intends to keep the fed funds target near\nzero for an extended period.\"\n\"As we head to 2010, the Fed will shift its focus to implementing an exit strategy in\norder to avoid any potential in ation threats to the economy,\" he added.\nHe highlighted three parts to exiting from current monetary policy: Exiting the liquidity\nprograms as they expire, exiting the asset purchase program and exiting current\ninterest rate policy.\n\"While exiting liquidity programs seems quite clear, exiting the asset purchase program\nmay have to rely on selling assets as appropriate,\" Bullard said. Regarding current\n\n\finterest rate policy, Bullard stressed the FOMC's intention to keep the target low for an\nextended period in order to help alleviate the strains in the economy.\nIn other comments, Bullard discussed regulatory reform and noted that the regulatory\nsystem for smaller banks has proven to be robust during the current crisis due to\ndeposit insurance, high-quality monitoring of banks and a clear resolution regime.\n\"The same is not the case for large banks and non-bank nancial institutions,\" Bullard\nnoted, as monitoring is more di cult and no clear resolution regime exists.\nHe also addressed the need for the Fed to remain closely involved in the regulatory\nstructure due to the Fed's role as the lender of last resort and its monetary policy\nfunctions. In regard to the importance of Fed independence, Bullard said that limiting\nFed independence would be counterproductive because it would lead to concerns of\nmonetization of the national debt and higher yields.\n###\nWith branches in Little Rock, Louisville and Memphis, the Federal Reserve Bank of St.\nLouis serves the Eighth Federal Reserve District, which includes all of Arkansas, eastern\nMissouri, southern Indiana, southern Illinois, western Kentucky, western Tennessee and\nnorthern Mississippi.

Second, the asset purchase program has shown that an active stabilization\nprogram is possible with the policy rate at zero. And third, the issue of asset price\n‘bubbles’ is a di cult one for monetary policy and may require new and innovative\nanalysis.”\nBullard presented his comments in a panel discussion on “Policy Lessons from the\nEconomic and Financial Crisis,” along with economists John Taylor of Stanford\nUniversity and N. Gregory Mankiw of Harvard University. (View slides from Bullard’s\npresentation.)\n\nLesson One: The Lender of Last Resort — On a Grand\nScale\nThe development and implementation of a wide array of lending programs in 2007 and\n2008 were designed to improve market functioning during the crisis.\n“Central banks traditionally lend extensively in a crisis—this is the ‘lender of last resort’\nfunction of monetary policy,” Bullard said. “The liquidity facilities were intended to\nimprove market functioning. Some may have worked better than others; so, careful\nevaluation of these programs is an important topic for current research.”\nIf nancial markets continue to improve, these programs will wind down naturally.\nHowever, Bullard expressed concern that the crisis may have unintentionally set up\nexpectations of future intervention.\n“The lesson is that these programs were far larger and more varied than what could\nhave been anticipated before the crisis,” he said. “The effectiveness of these programs\nshould now be carefully evaluated, and the central banking research community needs\nto think much more carefully about the rami cations of the lender-of-last-resort policy.”\n\nLesson Two: Monetary Policy by Different Means\n\n\fAnother lesson learned from the 2008 nancial crisis: Quantitative easing can\nsubstitute for policy rate easing after the zero bound is encountered.\n“The Fed is very capable of conducting stabilization policy when policy rates are near\nzero,” said Bullard. “The asset purchase program substituted for additional easing that\ncould not be done through the policy rate,” he said. “The program has been regarded as\nsuccessful in further easing monetary conditions after the zero bound was\nencountered.”\nBullard emphasized, however, that “quantitative policy should be conducted in a manner\nanalogous to interest rate policy. This means adjusting the policy to incoming\ninformation on the economy.” For example, “if reasonably encouraging information on\nthe economy emerges, the FOMC could consider removing some monetary\naccommodation through asset sales,” Bullard said. “If the economy performs poorly,\nthen the FOMC could consider additional asset purchases.”\nThe FOMC lowered its policy rate to near zero in December 2008. It started the asset\npurchase program in January 2009 and has announced it will complete a total\npurchase of $1.725 trillion of asset-backed securities by the end of the rst quarter\n2010.\nIf the policy rate remains near zero, “it would be natural for the FOMC to continue to\nadjust the asset purchase program going forward,” Bullard said. “This would allow\nmonetary policy to remain active, responding to shocks, during the period of near-zero\ninterest rates.”\n\nLesson Three: Asset Pricing and Monetary Policy\nThe third lesson is that “asset price bubbles are a very serious issue for monetary\npolicy,” Bullard said. “This issue has been debated extensively over the past 15 years,\nbut the debate will now intensify.”\n“The main problem is that it is hard to see what was ‘wrong’ with previous policy, given\nconventional ideas about what policy is trying to accomplish.”\nAs examples, he pointed to two bubbles in recent history, the tech bubble of the 1990s\nand the housing bubble of the 2000s. During this time, unemployment hit lows of 3.8\npercent in 2000, and 4.4 percent in 2007. In ation was low and stable through this\nperiod.\n“If the policy was too low for too long in the 1990s and the 2000s, why didn’t we see\nmore in ation?” Bullard asked. “Yet, without an increase in in ation, asset price\nmisalignments seem to have caused signi cant problems for the macroeconomy.”\n“This may mean that monetary policy should put more weight on asset prices going\nforward,” he said. “We need better analysis of policy issues with respect to bubbles. “\n###\nWith branches in Little Rock, Louisville and Memphis, the Federal Reserve Bank of St.\nLouis serves the Eighth Federal Reserve District, which includes all of Arkansas, eastern\nMissouri, southern Indiana, southern Illinois, western Kentucky, western Tennessee and\nnorthern Mississippi.

At this point it seems likely that output and\nemployment will continue to shrink in the rst half of 2009.\n\nPhotos\n\nThere are several important aspects to this contraction.\nFirst, the ongoing nancial turmoil has affected a broad\nspectrum of nancial markets and institutions around the\nworld. The initial turmoil was associated with the downturn\nin the U.S. housing market and the attendant increase in\ndefaults on a variety of mortgage products. But the onset\nof a sharp recession has added to di culties in nancial\nmarkets well beyond those experienced during the rst\nyear of the crisis. In the U.S., the U.K. and the euro area,\nsigni cant nancial institutions have failed, been\nnationalized or received substantial injections of capital\nfrom the public sector. Credit markets far removed from\n\nCurriculum Vitae\nStaff Contacts\nIDEAS/RePEc Pro le\n\nVideos\nSubscribe:\nEmail alerts\nRSS\n\"Rationally, let it be said in a\nwhisper, experience is certainly\nworth more than theory.\"\nAmerigo Vespucci\n\n\fmortgage nance, such as those for commercial paper,\njunk bonds, auction rate securities and credit default\nswaps, have faltered or collapsed.\nSecond, during the fall of 2008 and into early 2009, the Fed\nhas injected an astonishing amount of liquidity into the\neconomy. As a result, the U.S. monetary base has grown\nfrom $871 billion in August of last year to $1.73 trillion in\nJanuary 2009.(1) This undertaking has supported\ndomestic nancial markets as well as domestic and\ninternational nancial institutions. Support for dollar\nfunding markets has been provided through swap\noperations with foreign central banks(2)—an increase of\nmore than $400 billion from the end of September 2007 to\nthe end of January 2009.\nThird, the current recession is a global phenomenon.\nGrowth has slowed appreciably or turned negative in many\nindustrial countries, including the euro area, the U.K. and\nJapan. Even Chinese growth has been signi cantly\naffected as export demand from major world economies\nhas declined. In part, this is because all economies have\nbeen impacted by the dramatic run-up of commodity and\nparticularly energy prices in late 2007 and the rst half of\n2008 and by the subsequent decline in the second half of\n2008.\nThe fourth aspect is the zero bound on nominal interest\nrates. Central bankers around the world have responded\naggressively to the ongoing nancial turmoil and the\nassociated contraction in economic activity. The FOMC\nacted preemptively with a 50-basis-point reduction in the\nintended federal funds rate in September 2007 followed by\nan additional 75-basis-point reduction in January 2008. In\nDecember the Committee set a range for the federal funds\nrate target of zero to 25 basis points, effectively reaching\nthe zero lower bound. Central banks of other major\nindustrial countries started reducing their targets for policy\nrates later than the FOMC did and most have not yet\nreached the zero lower bound. Still, policy rates have been\nmoving lower worldwide. I believe it is fair to conclude that\nwe are entering an extended period of exceptionally low\npolicy rates globally. In the United States, the setting of\nnominal interest rate targets as a monetary policy tool will\nbe off the table for some time. In this environment the\nimplementation of monetary policy has to be refocused.\nThe new focus should be on quantitative measures of\npolicy.\nIn my remarks today, I will lay out a three-part thesis that\ntakes these facts as a starting point.\nIn the rst component, I will argue that a key near-term risk\nfor 2009 is further disin ation and possibly de ation.\nExpectations of de ation for the next ve years may feed\ninto real interest rates, driving real rates higher just at the\ntime monetary policy would like to move them lower. The\n\n\fzero bound is constraining ordinary policy responses to\nthis situation, making things worse.\nIn the second component, I will argue that because of the\nspecial circumstances in which we nd ourselves,\nmonetary policy should focus more squarely on\nquantitative measures, beginning with the monetary base,\nto get some idea of the thrust of policy with respect to\nin ation. I stress that I would not recommend this\napproach in normal circumstances, as I think nominal\ninterest rate targeting works well in more ordinary times. It\nis just that today's economy is operating far from its\nnormal routine.\nIn the third component, I will consider the Fed's balance\nsheet. There I will stress that while the monetary base has\nexpanded at an extraordinarily fast pace during the fall and\nwinter, much of that expansion has been closely related to\nthe Fed's lender-of-last-resort function, and cannot be\ncounted on to keep expectations of disin ation and\nde ation at bay. Because of this, the Fed needs a more\nsystematic method of keeping the persistent component of\nmonetary base growth rates elevated in order to combat\nthe risk of a de ationary trap. Two aggressive programs\nhave been put in place that may help to meet this objective:\noutright open market purchases of agency debt and\nagency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and an\nexpanded Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility\n(TALF). But the strategies behind these programs have\noften been described in terms of the possible impact on\nspeci c markets. While the programs may help, we remain\nfar from the systematic approach I would like to see.\nThe risk of further disin ation and a possible de ationary\ntrap\nLet me turn now to the rst part of the thesis: that the\nprimary near-term risk for monetary policy is continued\ndisin ation and a possible de ationary trap. Core personal\nconsumption expenditures (PCE) in ation has been\nnegative during each of the last three months of 2008—in\nDecember, the rate was about minus three-tenths of one\npercent. The readings for the core consumer price index\n(CPI) in ation during these three months were similar, near\nzero to slightly negative. It is true that measured from one\nyear ago, core PCE and core CPI in ation have not yet\nturned negative, but given the sharp drop-off in real activity\nat the end of 2008, it may be unwise to focus solely on the\nmeasures from one year ago at this juncture. I think it is\nreasonable to say that core in ation is running at zero to\nslightly negative rates at this time.\nFurther, the global recession promises to carry on at least\nthrough the rst half of 2009. This suggests that there is a\nrisk that core prices may continue to stagnate or decline\nslightly for some time to come. Should lingering nancial\nturmoil continue to weigh on the economy and stretch the\nrecession out still longer, the zero or negative in ation\n\n\fcould continue through 2009. Over that time frame,\nde ationary expectations could become entrenched. For\nthis reason I think we face some risk—at this point only a\nrisk—of sustained de ation. One important near-term goal\nfor monetary policy is to guide the economy away from this\noutcome.\nIn some ways, our current environment parallels the\nJapanese experience after 1990. The Japanese banking\nsystem encountered di culties with \"troubled assets\" and\nthe intermediation system broke down. Eventually,\npersistent year-over-year de ation was observed in core\nmeasures of in ation, and average economic growth\nstagnated. In Japan, policy rates have been below 1\npercent for 14 years, and de ation was observed for more\nthan a decade. The ultra-low nominal interest rate,\nde ationary outcome is sometimes referred to as a\nde ationary trap. That is an experience that neither we, nor\nthe rest of the world's economies, want to repeat.\nOngoing de ation in the United States might be particularly\npernicious. Household mortgages are long-term nominal\ncontracts. Sustained de ation increases the real debt\nburden of leveraged homeowners and can erode their\nequity. With sustained de ation, the foreclosure experience\nthat we have seen in the subprime market could generalize\nto a wider spectrum of homeownership. This is a\nsigni cant downside risk to macroeconomic performance.\nIn more ordinary times, central banks would have a\nstandard policy response to in ation rates falling\nsubstantially below desired levels: namely, lower the policy\nrate. However, the zero bound is constraining that response\nin the current environment. To the extent that the recent\ndisin ation is re ected in the expectations of market\nparticipants, it is therefore putting upward pressure on real\ninterest rates, right at the moment when monetary policy\nwould prefer to drive real interest rates lower. This is\ncounterproductive for stabilization policy. The question is:\nWhat can be done to move in ation closer to desired\nlevels, given the zero bound?\nWhy monetary policy should dial \"M\"\nLet me now turn to the second part of the thesis: that\nmonetary policy in the current situation should put\nincreased emphasis on quantitative measures, starting\nwith the monetary base. Conventional monetary policy has\ncome to be de ned as a central bank establishing an\neffective target for a short-term nominal interest rate. This\nhas been incorporated in the recent practice of central\nbankers and in textbook and academic discussions of\nmonetary policy. In textbooks, the nominal interest rate\ntarget is derived from a relationship, or policy rule, involving\nthe long-term in ation objective of the central bank,\ndeviations of actual in ation—either observed or forecast—\nfrom that in ation objective, and deviations of actual\neconomic activity from some measure of \"potential\n\n\foutput.\" In actual practice the FOMC has been shown to\nfollow such rule-like behavior at least since the beginning\nof the Greenspan period, though notable deviations from\nthe predicted target have occurred on occasion. After a\ndecade and a half, the private sector has become fully\nconditioned to think of monetary policy in terms of a target\nfunds rate and predictable adjustments of the target rate in\na strategic or rule-like fashion.(3)\nUnder ordinary macroeconomic conditions, nominal\ninterest rate targeting can work quite well. But under\nconditions where in ation expectations become highly\nunstable, or change rapidly, this approach to monetary\npolicy is less feasible. Di culties in controlling in ation\nexpectations while using a federal funds rate target\nprovoked the October 1979 Volcker monetary policy\nreform.(4) Under exceptional circumstances like the\npresent, with policy rates at or near zero, low rates of\nactual and expected in ation, and a sharp contraction in\neconomic activity, central bankers lose their ability to use\nnominal interest rate movements to signal to the private\nsector. This has surely created substantial uncertainty in\nthe economy.\nOne danger of the current situation is that, because the\ninterest rate signal mechanism has been turned off,\nmedium-term in ation expectations of the private sector\ncan begin to drift, possibly toward a de ationary trap. In\nparticular, once the zero lower bound is encountered, there\nis no conventional Fed policy tool—no nominal interest rate\nmove—that will head off in ation that is \"too low.\"\nTo avoid the risk of de ation, it is important that the Fed\nprovide a credible nominal anchor for the economy. One\nway to do so is to set quantitative targets for monetary\npolicy, beginning with the growth rate of the monetary\nbase. This has several advantages. First and foremost, the\nmonetary base is relatively easy to understand, fostering\nbetter communication about the thrust of monetary policy.\nSecond, we can be fairly certain that rapid expansion of the\nmonetary base will be su cient to head off any incipient\nde ationary threat. Rapid base growth has been\nassociated with in ation in a wide variety of times and\nplaces in economic history.\nOne important disadvantage is that the linkages between\nthe growth rate of the monetary base and key\nmacroeconomic variables are not statistically tight. It is\ndi cult to be as precise as we would like about the impact\non the economy from a given increase in the base. We\nknow this from wide-ranging earlier debates on monetary\ntargeting during the 1980s and 1990s. One reason the\nlinkages are not tight is that the monetary base has been\nleft to be determined as a residual to the interest rate\npolicy. In part as a result, the world's central banks focused\nalmost exclusively on nominal interest rate targeting more\nor less en masse beginning in the 1990s. And, to be sure, I\n\n\frecognize this, and I would not recommend a base\ntargeting approach in normal times. The move toward\nquantitative measures of monetary policy is a\nconsequence of the zero lower bound and the\nexceptionally weak state of the economy.\nWhile the statistical relationships may be less precise than\nin the case of nominal interest rate targeting, the effects\nare unmistakable and every bit as powerful. The fact that\nshort-term nominal interest rates are at zero in no way\ninhibits money creation and its in ationary consequences.\nThis channel can be used to support the Committee's\nmedium-term in ation objective and head off a possible\nglobal de ation trap and the counterproductive rise in real\ninterest rates that would accompany that outcome.\nExamining the balance sheet\nLet me now turn to a discussion of the Fed's balance sheet.\nAstute listeners will note that I said earlier that the amount\nof liquidity injected into the economy since September\n2008 has been astonishing, and that, in fact, the monetary\nbase has more than doubled during this period. However, I\nnow want to divide the increase in the size of the balance\nsheet into two components, one temporary and one\npersistent. The temporary component is presently very\nlarge and is associated with the lender-of-last-resort\nfunction of monetary policy. This component is unlikely to\nhave important in ationary effects as currently\nimplemented. The persistent component is presently\nsmaller and is associated with outright open market\npurchases of agency debt and agency MBS. This program\nmay have greater in ationary consequences going forward,\nand; so, may help the FOMC achieve medium-term in ation\nobjectives and avoid further disin ation or outright\nde ation.\nFirst let me talk about the temporary component.\nAn element of conventional monetary policy that is rarely\naddressed in textbook and academic discussions is the\nlender-of-last-resort function in a time of crisis. Historically\ncentral banks have ooded the banking system with\nliquidity by providing massive reserves in nancial crises or\npanics.(5) Once the crisis is past, the liquidity injection can\nbe reversed. There are few if any in ationary\nconsequences of this type of liquidity injection. The Federal\nReserve response to the 9/11 attacks and disruption of\nnormal nancial market function is a great example of this\nprocess.(6) Total reserves in the banking system nearly\ndoubled in the weeks following the attacks, but were\nremoved in short order. Something like the 9/11 response\nis going on now, but on a grand scale and for an\nundetermined length of time.\nThe current nancial crisis began in earnest in early August\n2007. For more than a year into the crisis, the FOMC\ncontinued to target the nominal federal funds rate in the\n\n\fconventional fashion. The Fed also encouraged depository\ninstitutions to use its lending facilities as appropriate. In\nDecember 2007, the Term Auction Facility (TAF) was\ncreated with the intent of encouraging bank borrowing by\ncircumventing any \"stigma\" associated with the primary\ncredit facility. Simultaneously, the Fed established\ntemporary swap lines with some foreign central banks to\nhelp ease conditions in dollar funding markets globally.\nThe effective federal funds rate was maintained close to\nthe intended target rate by sterilization of the effect of\nincreased Fed lending on the monetary base. Initially the\nsterilization was accomplished by open market sales from\nthe System Open Market Account (SOMA) portfolio and,\nsubsequently, by substantial increases in Treasury\nbalances at the Fed in the Supplementary Financing\nAccount. Monetary policy proceeded in the conventional\nfashion—targeting a nominal interest rate—despite\nsubstantial liquidity injections.\nWhen nancial market turmoil intensi ed in September\n2008, the Fed response—hardly unconventional—was to\nood the banking system with reserves. In fact, as I have\nstressed, this is the normal central bank response to\nsevere nancial market distress such as that experienced\nin 1998 or 2001. However, the scale of the response this\npast fall dwarfed that of these earlier events, and the crisis\nhas persisted much longer than in earlier episodes.\nThese events have left the Fed with an expanded balance\nsheet. The question is, how much of the balance sheet\nexpansion is temporary, being merely associated with the\nlender-of-last-resort function in this time of extraordinary\ncrisis?\nTo keep the discussion simple, let us consider just three\nprograms that are currently some of the largest\ncontributors to the increased size of the balance sheet.\nThese are the CPFF at $251 billion, the TAF at $413 billion\nand the swap lines at $391 billion, a total of more than $1\ntrillion.(7)\nA critical element to the current liquidity injections is\nreversibility: How quickly and easily can programs be\nreversed or phased out, as is normal in the lender-of-lastresort function of monetary policy? The CPFF and TAF\nprograms score high marks on this criterion. Outstanding\nTAF lending is under direct Fed control: The maturity of the\noutstanding loans is 84 days at a maximum, and the size\nand timing of future auctions are policy parameters. This\nfacility can be phased out quickly at any time it is deemed\nappropriate. The Commercial Paper Funding Facility deals\nin short-term money market instruments and can also be\nphased out, if desired, in a short period of time. Indeed, as\nelevated risk aversion recedes and market functioning\nimproves, the use of this facility may atrophy naturally. The\nduration of swap-line programs is somewhat more\nproblematic. While all temporary swap lines have sunset\n\n\fdates, phasing them out cannot realistically be done\nunilaterally by the Fed, but will require discussion with the\nforeign central banks involved. Still, the swap lines are\nclearly intended for temporary use.\nNow suppose that the especially severe market stress of\nthe past several months was to recede in such a way that\nthe size of these three programs falls to zero, without any\nother effects on the remainder of the balance sheet. That\nwould actually leave the size of the Fed balance sheet\nbelow the level of July 2007, before the crisis began in\nearnest, and before any special programs were introduced.\nIt would be as if the FOMC had reacted to the nancial\ncrisis by shrinking the monetary base. From the\nperspective of maintaining an expansion of the monetary\nbase to ward off a de ationary risk, these programs seem\nto be a thin reed on which to balance medium-term\nin ation objectives.\nNow let me turn to the persistent components of the\nbalance sheet. To keep the discussion simple, I will discuss\njust three items: The Fed's holdings of Treasury securities,\nthe agency MBS purchase program and the TALF program.\nFed holdings of Treasury securities in July 2007 were\nabout $800 billion. As liquidity programs were introduced\nduring the crisis, this portfolio was sold off, and it now\nstands at $475 billion. This creates some room on the\nbalance sheet.\nIn November 2008 the Federal Reserve announced a\nprogram to purchase direct obligations of housing-related\ngovernment-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) and MBS\nbacked by those GSEs. The ultimate goal of the program is\nto purchase up to $100 billion in GSE direct obligations and\n$500 billion in MBS. The purchase of agency debt is not\nunprecedented: Historically the SOMA portfolio contained\nagency debt, though these assets were allowed to mature\nand were not replaced.(8) These outright purchases could\nbe viewed as, in part, a replacement for the Treasury\nsecurities that were sold off earlier. Still, the targets for\nthese purchases indicate that the total purchases are\nexpected to exceed the earlier decline in Treasuries. Thus,\nonce these purchases are carried out, the balance sheet\nwould have expanded relative to the $800 billion, July 2007\nlevel. The future liquidity of secondary markets for longerterm agency debt and agency MBS has yet to be\ndetermined, and it is not completely clear that large\nholdings of these securities could be readily sold back to\nthe market before maturity.\nThe remaining program is the Term Asset-Backed\nSecurities Loan Facility (TALF). Maturities of assets that\nwill be purchased under the TALF will extend up to several\nyears, and the current sunset date for new purchases under\nthis program is the end of 2009. This program is not\noperational yet. The intent is to provide support to the\nsecuritization process, which has broken down, and the\n\n\fsunset clause indicates the temporary nature of the\nprogram. The multi-year maturities of the loans and the\npotential size of the program—up to $1 trillion—make the\nimpact on the monetary base more persistent than for\nsome of the other liquidity programs.\nIn general, if we are willing to think of the TALF as a\ntemporary liquidity program, then we are left with the\noutright purchases of agency debt and MBS as the\npersistent components of the increase in the monetary\nbase. These purchases are occurring on a su cient scale\nto replace the previous sell-off of Treasuries and to also\nadd about $275 billion to the size of the balance sheet.\nUnlike other items, this seems like a credible, persistent\nincrease in the monetary base, likely to feed into in ation.\nWhether this increase in the persistent component of the\nmonetary base is of a proper size to mitigate de ation risk\nis an open question. But one bottom line is that much\ndepends on how the various pieces of the balance sheet\nare viewed.\nLet me turn now to some brief conclusions.\nConclusions\nPresently, macroeconomic expectations are very uid and\nvolatile. We know that expectations in uence\nmacroeconomic performance to a great degree, and that\nproviding a solid anchor for expectations is an essential\ningredient for any policy that will help resolve the current\nstress. The fact that the target federal funds rate has hit\nthe zero bound has taken away the Fed's ability to signal its\nintentions for monetary policy at a critical time. And in\nparticular, the Fed cannot lower interest rates further in\nresponse to incoming information that suggests in ation\nmay be uncomfortably low. This makes the \"M\" part of\nmonetary policy more important at this juncture. By\nexpanding the monetary base at an appropriate rate, the\nFOMC can signal that it intends to avoid the risk of further\nde ation and the possibility of a de ation trap.\nAs I have discussed, the Fed's balance sheet has grown at\nan astounding rate since September of last year, and the\nmonetary base has more than doubled. But the new,\ntemporary, lender-of-last-resort programs are blurring the\nmeaning of this picture. A temporary increase in the\nmonetary base, by itself, would not normally be considered\nin ationary. The increase would have to be expected to be\nsustained in the future in order to have an impact. Much,\nbut not all, of the recent increase in the balance sheet can\nreasonably be viewed as temporary. The outright\npurchases of agency debt and MBS are likely to be more\npersistent, however, and it is these purchases that may\nprovide enough expansion in the monetary base to offset\nthe risk of further disin ation and possible de ation. The\nquantitative effects of policy actions in this new\nenvironment are more uncertain than normal, but\nnevertheless these less-conventional policies can have\n\n\fevery bit as powerful an impact on the economy as\nchanges in the intended federal funds rate.\nFootnotes\n1.

A Fisher relation R= r + πe\n2. A continuous Taylor rule\nR = R(π)\nR´(π) > 1\nwhich is “active.”\n3. A zero bound on nominal interest rates.\nWill possess a second “trap” steady state.\n\n\fThe Risk of Deflation:\nBenhabib, Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe\nThe trap steady state is characterized by:\n Very low or zero nominal interest rates.\n Very low or negative inflation rates.\n\nThe trap steady state co-exists with the target steady state.\n Inflation is at target or near target.\n Nominal interest rates are positive.\n\n\fThe Risk of Deflation\nI like the two steady states idea as a way to conceptualize:\n The Bank of Japan policy rate has not been above 1% since\n1994 –14 years!\n• And, it’s headed back down.\n\n This sounds more like a steady state outcome.\n• Not just a temporary visit.\n\nThe risk is falling into the deflationary trap steady state:\n We do not know much about the dynamics.\n Just a way to think about possible outcomes.\n A long-run issue.\n\n\fThe Risk of Deflation\nHow to slay this part of the dragon?\n In the literature, “eliminate the bad equilibrium.”\n Adopt policies that change the set of long-run outcomes.\n• With that in mind …\n\nThe paper was called “The Perils of Taylor Rules.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the model, the policymaker is a slavish devotee of Taylor.\nThe devotion works well at the target steady state.\nThe rule is credible and is not abandoned at any point.\nBut, this devotion creates the trap steady state.\nLogic: inflation is too low, but nominal interest rates cannot be\nlowered.\n This keeps the economy in the trap.\n\n\fThe Risk of Deflation\nVolcker 1979 idea: Switch policy rules at a key juncture.\n This is something like what the FOMC did at the December\nmeeting.\n De-emphasize nominal interest rates.\n Emphasis is on quantitative policy measures going forward.\n This emphasis should help to control expectations and guide\ninflation toward target.\n I am hopeful that the deflationary outcome can be avoided this\nway.\n\n\fToo much of a Good Thing?\n\nIt’s possible.\nThis leads to the second dragon head:\n Possibility of 70s style inflation as a medium term outcome.\n\n\fThe Risk of Inflation\nOrthodox economics a la Milton Friedman: it is essential to\nthink about money when thinking about policies to control\ninflation.\n The monetary base has increased dramatically in the U.S. since\nSeptember 2008.\n Deficit spending is increasing dramatically.\n These would normally be considered inflationary\ndevelopments –medium term.\n How to stop this?\n\n\fThe Risk of Inflation: How to stop this?\n\nTwo Ideas:\n Reversibility of liquidity programs.\n Set an inflation target.\n\n\fThe Risk of Inflation: How to stop this?\nTimes of Crisis and Lender of Last Resort.\n Central Banks often flood the system with reserves in times of\ncrisis.\n Once the crisis passes, the action is reversed.\n The inflationary consequences of this type of action are\nminimal.\n\n\fThe Risk of Inflation: How to stop this?\nReversibility\n Many of the newly introduced programs are temporary.\n Some have explicit termination dates.\n Others are under 13(3) authority which has to end.\n“Emergency.”\n All involve collateralized lending.\n It seems the reverse build up could be reversed quickly and\neasily.\n\n\fThe Risk of Inflation: How to stop this?\nQuestions about Reversibility\n1. Crisis is often a short event measured in “weeks.”\n\n\n\nThis one is 13 months and promises to go on for a long time.\nA problem? No good news for 6 months?\n\n2. What will the criteria be for exiting programs?\n\n\nNormal functioning of markets?\n\n3. Scale of programs is very large.\n\n\n\nLarge scale needed to have an impact.\nMight size hamper reversibility?\n\n\fThe Risk of Inflation: How to stop this?\nThe second idea, other than reversibility would be to set an\nexplicit inflation target.\n Help focus expectations.\n Has to be backed by action.\n Would help fight the two-headed dragon.\n\n\fConclusions\nA time of very fluid, volatile expectations.\n We know expectations are a major factor in macroeconomic\nperformance.\n How the Fed acts in 2009 may have important consequences\nfro the longer run.\n\nI emphasized two risks.\n A Japanese-style deflation trap risk.\n Inflation risk as in the 1970s.\n Both very real medium-term risks.\n\nAn explicit inflation target would help mitigate these risks.\n\n\fLong-Run Economic Challenges:\nA Federal Reserve Perspective\nJames Bullard\nPresident and CEO\nAmerican Economic Association Meeting, NABE\nJanuary 3, 2009\n\n\fA Two-Headed Dragon for Monetary Policy\nJames Bullard\nPresident and CEO\nRoundtable Discussion: Long-Run Economic Challenges: A Federal Reserve Perspective\nAmerican Economic Association Meeting, NABE\nJanuary 3, 2009\n\n\f",

All issues about commitment and announcing\npolicy paths are still relevant.\nSetting µπ = µx = 0, “money does not matter,” may yield\ndeterminacy but would in general be far from the optimal policy.\nSwitching to “quantitative monetary policy” at low nominal\ninterest rates without thinking about issues like this may lead to\npolicy errors.\nObjections to quantitative monetary policy are better couched in\nterms of practical considerations.\nIn addition, interest rate rules have a clear problem—they can\ngenerate deflationary traps.\n\n\fI NTRODUCTION\n\nT HE END OF INTEREST RATE RULES ?\n\nD EFLATIONARY TRAPS\n\nG LOBAL POLICY COORDINATION\n\nC ONCLUSION\n\nR ECENT DATA\n\nDeflation is a real possibility in the current environment.\nA global recession that continues longer than currently\nanticipated could create a deflationary psychology.\nIf this becomes entrenched, we could face an extended period of\ndeclining prices.\nWe have the example of Japan.\nAn important near-term goal for monetary policy is to prevent\nthis outcome.\n\n\fI NTRODUCTION\n\nT HE END OF INTEREST RATE RULES ?\n\nD EFLATIONARY TRAPS\n\nG LOBAL POLICY COORDINATION\n\nC ONCLUSION\n\nD EFLATIONARY TRAPS\n\nThe Japanese experience spawned a literature.\nBenhabib, Schmitt-Grohe, and Uribe (2001, JET): “The perils of\nTaylor rules.”\nThey combined the following features:\nA Taylor-type policy rule which is ‘active.’\nA zero bound on nominal interest rates.\nA Fisher relation: rt = ρ + Et π t+1 .\n\nThese features combine to produce a ‘second’ steady state away\nfrom the targeted steady state.\nThis new steady state has inflation substantially below target\nand very low nominal interest rates.\n\n\fI NTRODUCTION\n\nT HE END OF INTEREST RATE RULES ?\n\nT HE RISK OF\n\nD EFLATIONARY TRAPS\n\nG LOBAL POLICY COORDINATION\n\nA DEFLATIONARY TRAP\n\nThe Benhabib et al. story seems particularly relevant in the\ncurrent environment.\nPolicy rates are moving lower worldwide.\nA large, global shock.\nWhy worry about deflation?

The policy rates of some other\ncentral banks are also at historically low levels, leaving little\nor no room for further cuts: The benchmark rate of the\nEuropean Central Bank stands at 1.5 percent, the Bank of\nEngland policy rate is 0.5 percent and the Bank of Japan\npolicy rate is a mere 0.1 percent.(1) Very low policy rates\ncreate a challenge for the global central banking\ncommunity. The challenge is to maintain an active and\neffective macroeconomic stabilization policy in the face of\na global recession, even when policy rates are low and\nmany are near zero.\nA conventional view has developed—especially over the\npast 15 years or so—that describes monetary policy in\nterms of a target for a short-term nominal interest rate,\nsuch as the overnight federal funds rate in the United\nStates. Within this conventional view, the normal policy\nresponse to deteriorating economic conditions and\nin ation below a target level is to lower the policy rate. This\nview is so conventional, in fact, that many participants in\nnancial markets and in the broader central banking\ncommunity can envision little else. Thus, with policy rates\nat or near zero, it would seem that the world's central\nbanks have little or no scope for further policy response.\nBut there is scope for considerable policy response, every\nbit as effective as movements in short-term nominal\ninterest rates. In my remarks this evening, I will discuss\nhow the Fed and other central banks canprovide additional\nmonetary stimulus as necessary. To keep stabilization\npolicy active and aggressive in the current global recession\nrequires a shift in thinking relative to that of the past 15\nyears. The shift in thinking is not unlike that brought to the\nFed and the world in 1979 by Paul Volcker.(2) While the\nnature of our economic turmoil today is different from the\n1970s in many respects, the shift away from a focus on\n\nJames Bullard\nPresident and Chief\nExecutive O cer\nBio\nCurriculum Vitae\nStaff Contacts\nIDEAS/RePEc Pro le\nPhotos\nVideos\nSubscribe:\nEmail alerts\nRSS\n\"Rationally, let it be said in a\nwhisper, experience is certainly\nworth more than theory.\"\nAmerigo Vespucci\n\n\fshort-term nominal interest rates is similar. The era of\ninterest rate rules, inspired by the seminal paper of John\nTaylor in 1993(3), is in abeyance, at least for now.\nLet me say before I continue that the views expressed here\nare my own and do not necessarily re ect the views of\nother Federal Open Market Committee members.\nMonetary Growth and Expected In ation\nAt very low nominal interest rates, the expected rate of\nin ation plays a larger role. Declines in the expected rate of\nin ation, with nominal rates xed, show up as increases in\nthe real rate of interest. The essence of stabilization policy\nis to lower the real rate of interest when macroeconomic\nconditions are weaker and raise it when macroeconomic\nconditions are stronger. One key to current stabilization\npolicy is therefore to exert in uence over the expected rate\nof in ation.\nThere is a variety of practical policy tools that a central\nbank can employ when the zero bound on nominal interest\nrates precludes additional rate cuts. In particular, the zero\nbound does not prevent a central bank from taking actions\nthat increase the growth of the monetary aggregates. It is\nwell known and widely understood that, over the medium to\nlong run, in ation re ects the growth rate of money. The\ncurrent environment of exceptionally low short-term\nnominal interest rates does not prevent a central bank from\nincreasing the money supply. In this sense, stabilization\npolicy goals can be accomplished through in uence on the\nexpected rate of in ation.\nThe monetary base consists of currency in circulation and\nthe deposits of banks and other depository institutions\nwith the central bank. In the United States, the size of the\nmonetary base doubled over a four-month period\nbeginning in September 2008. This increase is\nastonishingly large. However, the increase in the base is in\npart a byproduct of Federal Reserve programs to assist\ncredit markets and carry out its lender-of-last-resort\nfunction. The lender-of-last-resort programs—on the order\nof $1 trillion in the United States in recent months—should\nproperly be viewed as implying temporary increases in the\nmonetary base designed to improve market functioning.\nTemporary increases in the monetary base—here one day,\ngone the next—would not be expected to have an\nimportant in uence on the rate of in ation. Therefore, we\nshall have to segregate the temporary increases in the\nmonetary base associated with lender-of-last-resort\nprograms from the more persistent increases in the\nmonetary base associated with outright purchases of\nTreasury securities, agency mortgage-backed securities\nand agency debt. It is the persistent increases in the\nmonetary base that should properly be expected to\nin uence the rate of in ation and therefore have an\nin uence on in ation expectations and real interest rates.\nLater in my remarks this evening, I will comment further on\n\n\fhow one might gauge the monetary stimulus re ected in\nthe extraordinary expansion of the Fed balance sheet and\nmonetary base over the past six months.\nI will also discuss the coupling of balance sheet expansion\nwith the possibility of establishing an explicit in ation\nobjective in the United States. In the current environment, a\ncommitment to an explicit in ation objective coupled with\na systematic approach to expanding the monetary base\ncould help avoid further disin ation and a possible\nde ationary trap, such as the one experienced in Japan.\nFurther, by anchoring in ation expectations, an explicit\nin ation objective could assist the transition back to\nconventional policy as normal conditions return and help\nensure that Fed policy does not inadvertently cause a new\nround of high and volatile in ation once the current crisis\npasses. It is exactly because the current situation is so\nuid that the announcement of an explicit numerical\nobjective for in ation at this point may be particularly\nhelpful.\nWere it not for the global recession, I am certain that our\ndiscussions about monetary policy tonight would be within\nthe context of the conventional paradigm of nominal\ninterest rate targeting. The ongoing nancial turmoil has\nchanged that, and restoring stability to nancial markets\nhas been and will continue to be a primary focus of the\nFederal Reserve and the U.S. government. The crisis has\nrevealed clear weaknesses in our nancial infrastructure\nand regulatory system. Near the end of my remarks, I\nwould like to share with you a few thoughts about the\npotential for regulatory reform in the United States.\nMonetary Policy with an 'M'\nLet me now turn to the question of how to conduct an\neffective monetary policy in a low interest rate\nenvironment. Conventional monetary policy has come to\nbe de ned as a central bank establishing an effective\ntarget for a short-term nominal interest rate. This has been\nincorporated in the recent practice of central banks and in\ntextbook and academic discussions of monetary policy. In\ntextbooks, the nominal interest rate target is derived from a\nrelationship, or policy rule, involving the long-term in ation\nobjective of the central bank, deviations of actual in ation\n—either observed or forecast—from that in ation objective,\nand deviations of actual economic activity from some\nmeasure of potential. This textbook description has been\nshown to be a reasonably accurate representation of the\nFed's behavior at least since the beginning of the\nGreenspan chairmanship. The public is now wellconditioned to think about U.S. monetary policy in terms of\na target federal funds rate and predictable adjustments of\nthe target in a rule-like fashion.\nUnder ordinary circumstances, nominal interest rate\ntargeting can work quite well. However, with policy rates at\nor near zero, nominal interest rate targeting is no longer an\n\n\foption for combating low rates of actual and expected\nin ation and a global recession. With policy rates near\nzero, there is no ordinary policy rate move to make to react\nto output that is below potential and to in ation that is too\nlow. Instead, central banks lose their ability to use interest\nrate movements to signal their policy moves to the public.\nThis creates considerable uncertainty in the\nmacroeconomy.\nOne danger of the current situation is that, because the\ninterest rate signal mechanism has been turned off, the\nprivate sector's medium-term in ation expectations can\nbegin to drift. Given the severity of the global\nmacroeconomic shock, the possibility of a de ationary trap\ncannot be dismissed. Central banks therefore must adopt\nalternative policy approaches if they are to anchor in ation\nexpectations, avoid sustained de ation, and maintain an\nactive and effective stabilization policy.\nOne way of providing a credible nominal anchor for the\neconomy is to set quantitative targets for monetary policy,\nbeginning with the growth rate of the monetary base. This\nhas several advantages. First and foremost, the monetary\nbase is relatively easy to understand, fostering better\ncommunication about the thrust of policy. Second, we can\nbe reasonably certain that sustained rapid expansion of the\nmonetary base will be su cient to head off any sustained\nde ation.\nOne important disadvantage is that the linkages between\nthe growth rate of the monetary base, monetary\naggregates and key macroeconomic variables are not\nstatistically tight. This is in part because past data were\nproduced under an interest-rate-targeting regime. The lack\nof precision can make it di cult to determine how rapidly\nto expand the base to achieve a speci c in ation objective.\nWe know this from long and exhaustive debates rooted in\nthe 1980s concerning monetary instruments versus\ninterest rate instruments for monetary policy. This older\ndebate is part of what set the stage for John Taylor's paper\nand the return of nominal interest rate rules. I am well\naware of this intellectual history, and I stress that I would\nnot advocate a monetary base control approach in normal\ntimes. But, I also stress that these are not normal times.\nWe know that we face some risk of further disin ation and\npossible de ation globally. We have seen the example of\nJapan. We know that persistent monetary growth can\nprevent further disin ation and the accompanying\ncounterproductive rise in real interest rates that would\nentail. A policy geared toward maintaining an elevated\ngrowth rate of the monetary base provides a clear, easily\ncommunicated strategy combating additional disin ation,\neven while further signi cant reductions in the nominal\ninterest rate target are no longer possible.\nPersistent versus Temporary Growth in the Monetary Base\n\n\fThe U.S. monetary base has expanded enormously over\nthe past several months, re ecting an extraordinarily large\nexpansion of the Federal Reserve balance sheet. But the\nmeaning of this expansion is blurred because it is di cult\nto discern at a glance how much of it is associated with\nthe temporary lender-of-last-resort role of policy and how\nmuch is associated with a persistent rise in the growth rate\nof the base that can be expected to feed into in ation\noutcomes.\nAs an example, in the aftermath of 9/11, the Fed doubled\nthe level of reserves in the U.S. banking system for a period\nof several weeks. This temporary expansion was a classic\nresponse to stressed nancial conditions. The in ationary\nconsequences of this injection and subsequent removal\nwere minimal or nonexistent. Something similar is going on\nduring the current crisis, but on a grand scale and over a\nmuch longer time frame.\nSince December 2007, the Federal Reserve has established\nseveral lending programs to provide liquidity and improve\nthe functioning of key credit markets. The Term Auction\nFacility, Term Securities Lending Facility and the Primary\nDealer Credit Facility, for example, help ensure that\nnancial institutions have adequate access to short-term\ncredit. The Commercial Paper Funding Facility provides a\nbackstop for the market for high-quality commercial paper.\nIn addition, the Federal Reserve has entered into bilateral\ncurrency swap agreements with some foreign central\nbanks to help ease conditions in dollar funding markets\nglobally. Finally, over the past year, the Fed has provided\nloans to support speci c nancial institutions. The TAF,\nCPFF and swaps in particular have added about $1 trillion\nto the size of the Fed's balance sheet in recent months.\nThese programs belong to a family of policy responses\nassociated with the lender-of-last-resort function of\nmonetary policy. We should view them as temporary, as\nthey are intended to be wound down as nancial stress\nabates, and they are structured so that it is feasible to wind\nthem down over a short period. As such, they are unlikely\nto have a meaningful impact on in ation or in ation\nexpectations.\nMore recently, the Federal Reserve announced that it would\npurchase substantial quantities of debt and mortgagebacked securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\nWithin the past week, the Federal Reserve, in cooperation\nwith the U.S. Treasury Department, has begun to operate\nits Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF).\nUnder the TALF, the Fed could purchase as much as $1\ntrillion of asset-backed securities collateralized by real\nestate and various other types of loans.\nAll of these facilities and programs affect the size and\ncomposition of the Fed balance sheet. However, before\nSeptember 2008, the Fed offset increases in its lending to\nnancial institutions by selling Treasury securities in the\n\n\fopen market. Doing so largely kept these facilities from\naffecting the overall size of the Fed balance sheet and\ngrowth rate of the monetary base. The base increased by a\nmere $20 billion, or about 2.2 percent, between Aug. 1,\n2007 and Aug. 27, 2008.(4)\nA key question for understanding the thrust of monetary\npolicy going forward is how much of the enormous\nincrease in the Fed balance sheet since last September is\nlikely to be temporary and how much is likely to be\npersistent. The temporary components, which mainly\nre ect the liquidity injected by the Fed in carrying out its\nlender-of-last-resort function, remain very large. The more\npersistent components, which to date re ect mainly open\nmarket purchases of agency debt and mortgage-backed\nsecurities, are smaller, but growing rapidly. The persistent\ncomponents are likely to have greater in ationary\nconsequences going forward because these components\nare unlikely to shrink as much or as quickly as the lesspersistent components of the balance sheet. Put\ndifferently, the growth in the persistent components of the\nbalance sheet will have more impact on the medium- to\nlong-term growth of the monetary base and hence the\noutlook for in ation than does the growth of the lesspersistent components.\nA Clear In ation Objective\nUncertainty concerning the path of policy and the\nimplications for in ation could be reduced with the\nannouncement of a speci c in ation objective. A clearly\narticulated in ation objective would help anchor in ation\nexpectations and reduce uncertainty about the long-run\ngoals of policy. Right now, in ation expectations are\nunusually diffuse. The ballooning of the Fed balance sheet\nand large government scal de cit have created worries\nabout higher in ation in the future, while at the same time\nthe weak economy, disin ation and the recent history of\nthe Japanese economy are raising the specter of de ation.\nBy making its long-run in ation objective explicit, the Fed\ncould help provide a credible commitment that the growth\nof the monetary base will slow as de ation risks recede.\nFurther, by reducing in ation uncertainty, the\nannouncement of an explicit in ation objective would\nreduce in ation risk premiums in interest rates and\npromote e cient resource allocation.\nThe Future of Financial Intermediation\nMaintaining price stability is surely one of the most\nimportant ways that a central bank can promote the\nstability of the nancial system. A credible commitment to\nlong-run price stability enables a central bank to respond\naggressively to nancial crises without unmooring in ation\nexpectations. The ongoing nancial crisis demonstrates,\nhowever, that price stability alone will not guarantee\nnancial stability. The crisis has revealed important\nproblems in our system of nancial regulation and\n\n\foversight, and I would like to spend my remaining time\ndiscussing some lessons suggested by the recent nancial\nturmoil.\nOne obvious lesson is that our present system of nancial\noversight and regulation is not up to the challenges posed\nby the size and complexity of the modern global nancial\nsystem. Some very large, complex international nancial\nrms are at the epicenter of the nancial crisis.\nComprehensive regulatory reform must better address the\nregulation and oversight of rms with global operations.\nThis will require continued close cooperation among\nnancial regulators of all countries where large\ninternational nancial rms do business. International\ncooperation may be especially critical to the success of\nany attempt at improved oversight and regulation.\nOne reason for enhanced regulation and oversight of large\ncomplex nancial organizations is that governments are\nunlikely to permit such rms to fail; or, if they do fail, the\ngovernment will substantially protect many of the rm's\ncreditors from loss. As stressed by Gary Stern and Ron\nFeldman,(5) it is simply not credible in most times and\nplaces that a government will allow a large nancial failure\nto occur. This creates a \"too-big-to-fail\" problem. Any new\nregulation has to be soberly designed with this problem in\nmind. It is not su cient for policymakers to simply\nannounce that they will \"get tough next time.\"\nThe present, disorderly too-big-to-fail regime creates a\nmoral hazard: Firms whose liabilities are guaranteed have\nan incentive to take greater risks than rms without such\nguarantees. In the United States, the perception that the\ngovernment would guarantee the liabilities of Fannie Mae\nand Freddie Mac enabled those rms to borrow heavily in\ndebt markets at relatively low interest rates and to maintain\nmuch lower capital ratios than other nancial rms.\nUltimately, nancial losses eroded the thin capital cushions\nof Fannie and Freddie and pushed both rms into the\nhands of a government conservator. Without the\nperception of government backing—which turned out to be\na reality—markets surely would have forced Fannie and\nFreddie to hold more capital, which would have made the\nrms less vulnerable to losses on their mortgage\nportfolios.(6) The experience with Fannie and Freddie\nshows how expectations of what will happen in the failure\nregime really in uence all pricing and behavior during\nnormal times. It is a serious distortion, and it suggests that\nthe nature of the policy in the event of failure needs to be\nclearly delineated and understood both by the private\nsector and the government.\nThe present too-big-to-fail regime also creates tremendous\nuncertainty because it is inherently disorderly. When rms\nare failing, they simply have to be broken apart, liquidated\nor reorganized in some way. Unspeci ed government\nintervention in the event of failure leaves this process open,\n\n\fmaking stakeholders wonder what will happen next. Also\nunspeci ed is which rms are considered too big to fail. If\nthe top ve rms are in this category, how is a crisis at the\nnumber six rm to be handled? Or, is the government to\nextend the unspeci ed protection to all rms in the\nindustry? Leaving the nature of the intervention in the event\nof failure unspeci ed, and in addition leaving the list of toobig-to-fail rms unspeci ed, creates substantial uncertainty\nthat could be avoided with a well-designed reform.\nThese two aspects of the too-big-to-fail problem clearly\npoint toward the need for improvement in the current\nsystem. The improvement would be to design a resolution\nregime for large, insolvent nancial institutions considered\ntoo big to fail. The resolution regime should have several\nfeatures. First, it should be explicit and well understood by\nall players. Second, while it would likely involve some level\nof government assistance, the nature of that assistance\n(even if state-contingent) should be clear. Third, it should\nbe credible, in the sense that when the crisis arrives, the\ngovernment will have incentives to follow through on the\nplan without deviation. And fourth, it should be made clear\nwhich rms would use this alternative resolution regime\nand which rms would use bankruptcy court.\nThe resolution regime now in place for commercial banks\nin the United States works reasonably well and could serve\nas a model for resolving failures of other types of nancial\ninstitutions. Bank failures are generally resolved quickly\nwith little disruption to the broader nancial system. The\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) takes control\nonce a bank's primary regulator determines that a bank is\ninsolvent. The FDIC either liquidates the failed bank or,\nfrequently, arranges a merger with another bank. Insured\ndeposits are either transferred to the new bank or, in the\ncase of liquidation, paid out quickly. The process is\ntransparent and relatively painless for most depositors and\nborrowers of the failed bank.\nAn improved resolution regime might require bringing all\ntoo-big-to-fail nancial organizations under an umbrella\nregulator. The regulator would continuously supervise\nthose organizations and enforce rules to minimize the\nchance of nancial system disruption. Rules that limit the\nsize of nancial organizations or discourage excessive risk\ntaking might also be necessary. A macroprudential\nregulator of this sort would take into account broad\neconomic trends and consider the impact of a rm's\nactions on the entire nancial system, not just on the rm's\nown creditors. To some extent, the Federal Reserve and\nother regulators already consider broad economic trends\nand effects. However, our present system was not\ndesigned to control broad macroeconomic risks posed by\ncomplex nancial organizations with far- ung operations.\nThe success of any macroprudential regulation would likely\nrest not with the allocation of the responsibility, but with\nthe tools given to implement the mandate.\n\n\fMany other changes in regulation have been suggested to\nbetter manage risks in the nancial system, and there isn't\ntime today to discuss all of them. The issues are complex,\nand though reforms are necessary, they should be well\nthought out. Any changes to the regulatory environment\nwill spur innovation in the private sector to legally\ncircumvent restrictions. Reform has to be undertaken with\nthis in mind.\nLet me now turn to some brief conclusions.\nConclusion\nThe nancial crisis has challenged our thinking about both\nmonetary policy and nancial regulation. In the present\nenvironment, it is not useful to think about monetary policy\nin the conventional way. We need a shift in thinking, similar\nto the one adopted by the Volcker Fed under different\ncircumstances in October 1979. A shift away from interest\nrate rules and toward quantitative approaches is\nappropriate in the current environment, even if interest rate\nrules are more appropriate in normal times. As we make\nthis shift, all of the important lessons of the past two\ndecades concerning the nature of good monetary policy\nmust be kept in mind. In particular, we need a clearly\narticulated, credible policy that stretches out for several\nyears and indicates how the central bank plans to respond\nto macroeconomic events going forward. The Fed can\naccomplish this by continuing to expand the persistent\ncomponents of its balance sheet so as to keep the\nmonetary base growing at an elevated rate to avoid further\ndisin ation and the rise in real interest rates that would\nentail. A credible plan would also name an explicit in ation\nobjective to help control the currently very diffuse\nexpectations of medium-term in ation. And, a credible plan\nwould also specify more explicitly how the central bank\nintends to keep base growth under su cient control for the\nmedium and longer term to meet the in ation target.\nOver the near term, monetary policy will continue to focus\non containing the fallout from the ongoing nancial crisis.\nThe crisis has clearly exposed faults in the structure of\nnancial regulation and supervision, especially of large,\ncomplex nancial organizations considered too big to fail.\nAbove all, the current crisis has demonstrated that \"too big\nto fail\" is not good public policy. One of the key remedies is\nto put in place a resolution regime for rms considered too\nbig to fail, one that is clearly articulated, credible and well\nunderstood by all players.\nI appreciate the opportunity to speak here tonight and I\nwelcome your questions.\nFootnotes\n1.

LOUIS — In a speech Wednesday to area business leaders at the 2009 Commerce\nBank Economic Breakfast, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard described the forces\ndriving this nascent economic recovery and posed the question: How sustainable is\nthis growth going forward?\nThe rst phase of the recovery has been driven by several factors, he said, including\nglobal growth: “Stronger-than-expected global growth, especially in Asia, has been a\nmain force.”\nView Bullard’s presentation, “The First Phase of the U.S. Recovery.”\nOther forces are driving the edgling recovery in the U.S.: Personal consumption and\nthe housing sector have stabilized. The stress in nancial markets is abating.\nBond spreads have narrowed and credit default swap prices have declined. However,\n“some stress still remains in these markets,” he said.\nLabor markets are still a trouble spot, but there are signs of improvement. “While\ncivilian unemployment remains high,” Bullard said, “the pace of job losses has slowed.”\nIn ation is still low, although global commodity prices are quite volatile and “in ation\nuncertainty remains elevated compared with last fall,” Bullard said.\n\nMonetary Policy\nLooking ahead, Bullard discussed the three components of current monetary policy: the\nFed’s liquidity programs, the near-zero interest rate policy and the asset purchase\nprogram.\nSince the liquidity programs are naturally tapering off as the crisis recedes, they are not\nan in ationary concern.\n“Policy rates are near zero in the U.S. and the rest of G-7 countries, something not seen\nin postwar economic history,” Bullard said, adding that interest rates may stay low for\nsome time. “The FOMC did not begin policy rate increases until 2 ½ - 3 years after the\nend of each of the past two recessions.”\nAssuming that the most recent recession ended this past summer, and assuming that\nthe FOMC would behave in the same way that it’s behaved in the past, this could mean\nthe FOMC would not start increasing rates until early 2012. To be sure, Bullard said the\n\n\fFOMC will be heavily weighing concerns that stem from criticisms that the Fed kept\ninterest rates too low for too long, contributing to the housing market bubble.\n“The market’s focus on interest rates is disappointing, given quantitative easing,” he\nsaid. Markets are still thinking of monetary policy strictly as changes in interest rates—\neven though the Fed has been conducting successful policy this past year through\nquantitative easing. Markets should be focusing on quantitative monetary policy rather\nthan interest rate policy.\nThe FOMC has committed to buy up to $1.725 trillion in assets by the rst quarter of\n2010, which means that the Fed’s balance sheet will peak at close to $2.4 to $2.5\ntrillion. This amount is about three times the traditional size of the Fed’s balance sheet\nand corresponds to more than double the normal size of the monetary base. While the\nasset purchase program is considered to have been successful in mitigating the crisis,\nit has caused a large and persistent increase in the monetary base, which creates a risk\nof in ation in the medium term, he said.\n“The main challenge for monetary policy going forward will be how to adjust the asset\npurchase program without generating in ation and still providing support to the\neconomy while interest rates are near zero,” Bullard said. Medium-term in ation hinges\non what the Fed will do with this program. Bullard said that he would like the FOMC to\nadopt a state-contingent policy rule that would allow for the adjustment of asset\npurchases as new information on the economy becomes available.\n\nRegulatory Reform and the Role of the Fed\n“’Too Big to Fail’ is an intolerable situation that must be addressed,” Bullard said. “A\nresolution regime for large nancial rms is imperative.” He added that any regulatory\nreform efforts need to take this into account.\nBullard emphasized that the rms at the epicenter of the crisis were large and complex\nglobal institutions and that many of them were not banks. “Quite a few of the large\nrms in trouble were not banks and did not come under banking regulation,” Bullard\nsaid. “The main issue here is not about banking reform, but about the shadow banking\nsystem and addressing regulation for that nancial segment,” he said.\nAs for the Fed’s role in future regulation and policy, Bullard said that as a lender of last\nresort, the Fed needs to have a role in regulating any institutions to which it might lend.\nAlso, in order for monetary policy to be effective, “the Fed needs to know the condition\nof the nancial system through hands-on regulatory involvement,” he added. “Fed\nindependence is vital in maintaining credible monetary policy.”\n###\nWith branches in Little Rock, Louisville and Memphis, the Federal Reserve Bank of St.\nLouis serves the Eighth Federal Reserve District, which includes all of Arkansas, eastern\nMissouri, southern Indiana, southern Illinois, western Kentucky, western Tennessee and\nnorthern Mississippi.

of all financial intermediation in\nthe U.S.\nSome institutions borrowed short—on collateral—to fund\nlonger-term investments.\nThe crisis showed that runs on non-bank, non-deposit-taking\nfinancial institutions are possible as well as very destructive.\nThis was not previously considered a problem.\nThere is no analog of deposit insurance to solve this problem.\n\n\fT HE G LOBAL R ECOVERY\n\nR

published an\nentire book, “Too Big To Fail,” in 2004.\nThese types of warnings show that the Fed is well aware of\nsystemic risk concerns in real time.\nThe problem is what to do in terms of concrete

LOUIS—During a speech Sunday at the 51st annual meeting of the National\nAssociation for Business Economics, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard rea rmed\nthe need for a Taylor-type policy rule for the Federal Reserve’s asset purchase program.\nSuch a rule would help communicate how asset purchases may be adjusted as\neconomic conditions change, while remaining consistent with the Fed’s goals of\nensuring price stability and sustainable economic growth, he said.\nBullard also expressed concern that in ation risks in the medium term may be higher\nthan widely believed. He said that too much emphasis is being given to the idea that the\nrecession implies that the output gap is currently quite large, minimizing the risk of\nin ation.\nHe also proposed a different framework for how U.S. monetary policy could be\nimplemented in the future using interest on reserves held at the Fed. A similar structure\nis already in place at several other central banks.\nBullard’s presentation, “Three Issues for Near-Term Monetary Policy,” is available online.\n\nMONETARY POLICY\nOn current monetary policy, “the key issue is how to think about the asset purchase\nprogram,” Bullard said. “Liquidity programs are shrinking, but the asset purchase\nprogram is only partially complete.”\nHe added that while the asset purchase program is considered a successful tool for\nquantitative easing, it has also caused a large and persistent increase in the monetary\nbase. “This may lead to in ation in the medium-term, depending on markets’\nexpectations of monetary policy going forward,” Bullard said.\nPrior to December 2008, the Fed communicated its monetary policy via adjustments in\ninterest rates. However, with nominal interest rates currently near zero, the likely path of\nthe Fed’s monetary policy is now unclear to nancial markets.\n“Good policy means that the Fed needs to communicate to the private sector how it\nintends to react to shocks in the future,” Bullard said. “There has been little indication of\nhow or whether these [asset purchase] amounts might be adjusted given incoming\n\n\finformation on economic performance. This lack of clarity has created uncertainty in\nnancial markets.”\nBullard called for the development of a quantitative rule for monetary policy in the\ncurrent environment. “We have spent 20 years re ning ideas about interest rate rules\nand optimal monetary policy,” Bullard said. “We should now consider quantitative rules\nbecause we are at the zero bound, and may remain there for some time depending on\nhow the economy performs.”\n\nFUTURE IMPLEMENTATION OF MONETARY POLICY\nGoing forward, Bullard said the Fed’s ability to pay interest on reserves—an authority\ngranted to the central bank in the fall of 2008—could serve as a new tool in the\nimplementation of monetary policy in the U.S. He pointed out that many other central\nbanks around the world operate with three rates:\nan interest rate paid on deposits at the central bank,\na lending rate for loans from the central bank and\na policy rate that lies between the two.\n“The Fed could implement monetary policy differently,” he said. “It could implement the\nlending and deposit rates via standing facilities. The stance of policy would then\ndepend on all three rates, although they might often be adjusted together.”\n\nTHE OUTPUT GAP\nBullard also cautioned that policymakers should not place too much emphasis on\noutput gap estimates when trying to assess in ation risks in the medium-term.\n“I am concerned about a popular narrative in use today—the narrative being that the\noutput gap must be large since the recession is so severe,” he said. “And so, any\nmedium-term in ation threat is negligible, even in the face of extraordinarily\naccommodative monetary policy. I think this narrative overplays the output gap story.”\nHe added that measuring the gap is very di cult, both theoretically and practically. He\ncited research that shows much of the in ationary run-up in the 1970s can be\nattributed to a misreading of the output gap at the time.\n“Even if economists were to accept a particular measure, the empirical relationship with\nin ation is not robust,” he said. In addition, traditional output gap measures do not\naccount for the concept of bubbles.\n“It has been popular to describe recent events as a collapse of a bubble in housing. A\nlook at the housing data makes a convincing case,” Bullard said. “But when it comes to\ncalculating traditional output gaps, there is no notion of a bubble. If part or most of the\nfall in output was a collapsed bubble, then today’s output gap would be smaller than it\nappears.” This would mean that in ation risks in the medium term are higher than\notherwise thought.\n###\nWith branches in Little Rock, Louisville and Memphis, the Federal Reserve Bank of St.\nLouis serves the Eighth Federal Reserve District, which includes all of Arkansas, eastern\nMissouri, southern Indiana, southern Illinois, western Kentucky, western Tennessee and\nnorthern Mississippi.

The Fed also “needs to be able to communicate to the private sector how it\nintends to react to shocks in the future.”\nPrior to December 2008, the Fed communicated its monetary policy via adjustments in\ninterest rates. But with nominal interest rates currently near zero, the likely path of the\nFed’s monetary policy is unclear to nancial markets, causing additional uncertainty.\n“We have spent 20 years re ning ideas about interest rate rules and optimal monetary\npolicy,” Bullard said. “We should now consider quantitative rules because we are at the\nzero bound, and may remain there for some time depending on how the economy\nperforms.”\nBullard noted that while the FOMC had announced its intention to buy up to $1.75\ntrillion in asset-backed securities by the rst quarter of 2010, “there has been little\nindication of how or whether these amounts might be adjusted given incoming\ninformation on economic performance.”\n“It is also unclear whether this policy is consistent with price stability,” he\nadded. “Unclear policy creates uncertainty in nancial markets.”\n“The key issue is how to think about the asset purchase program,” Bullard said, adding\nthat the in ationary impact of unwinding the asset purchase program hinges on the\nnancial markets’ expectations of future policy.\nBullard said that an optimal asset purchase program would:\n\n\fbe contingent on the state of the economy;\nuse a Taylor-type rule that could communicate how purchases would be adjusted\nas additional information on the economy becomes available;\nhelp communicate to markets how the purchase program is consistent with price\nstability and sustainable economic growth;\nreduce uncertainty and make the program more effective, and\nassist in pinning down the optimal size of the program.\nBullard stressed that quantitative rules, while perhaps not as “satisfactory” as interest\nrate rules, are certainly worthy tools for running monetary policy, especially in the\ncurrent environment.\nHe outlined some of the models and research that have been previously conducted and\ntheir potential applications for today. In general, “these rules do not recommend the\nrapid expansion of the monetary base that we have seen recently,” Bullard said.\n“The doubling of the monetary base could be viewed as destabilizing from the\nperspective of quantitative rules,” Bullard said. “The asset purchase program has made\nthe doubling of the monetary base very persistent, as well as very large.”\nIn his speech, Bullard also discussed research that suggests the Great Depression and\nthe Japanese slowdown could have been prevented had quantitative rules for monetary\npolicy been in place during these periods.\n###\nWith branches in Little Rock, Louisville and Memphis, the Federal Reserve Bank of St.\nLouis serves the Eighth Federal Reserve District, which includes all of Arkansas, eastern\nMissouri, southern Indiana, southern Illinois, western Kentucky, western Tennessee and\nnorthern Mississippi.

He also discussed “bullish\nfactors” for the U.S. economy in 2023 during a Wisconsin Bankers Association virtual event.\nInflation remains well above the Fed’s inflation target but is moderating in response to frontloaded and aggressive monetary policy in 2022, Bullard said.\nThe Fed’s policy—especially the aspect of front-loading policy rate increases—has been the\nright one to get the policy rate to the right level to return inflation to the 2% target on a\nconsistent basis, Bullard said. By front-loading transparently and communicating with\nmarkets, the Fed can avoid 1970s outcomes, when inflation would seem to come down but\nthen rise again to even higher levels, he said.\n“That means that the Fed is going to have to maintain rates at high enough levels to make sure\nthat inflation is moving down and staying down on a consistent basis,” he said.\nBullard said that his preference would be to get to the level of the policy rate that would be\nconsidered sufficiently restrictive as soon as possible and get the benefit of downward\npressure on inflation from the higher policy rate.\nBullard also cited “bullish” factors for the U.S. economy going into 2023, including forecasts of\nabove-trend GDP growth for the fourth quarter of 2022, which would bring GDP for the second\nhalf of 2022 more in line with the strong labor market, he said. Bullard also cited household\nwealth and improved global economic prospects.\nBullard answered questions about the Fed’s quantitative tightening program, supply chain\nconstraints and money supply.\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/from-the-president/speeches-and-presentations/2023/inflation-and-the-economic-outlook-wba\n\n1/3\n\n\f8/2/23, 4:21 PM\n\nBullard Discusses Inflation and the Economic Outlook | St. Louis Fed\n\nFOLLOW US\n\nSIGN UP FOR EMAIL ALERTS\nReceive updates in your inbox as soon as new content is published on our website\nSIGN UP\nQUICK LINKS\nAbout Us\nLegal Information\nContact Us\nPrivacy Policy\nCareers\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/from-the-president/speeches-and-presentations/2023/inflation-and-the-economic-outlook-wba\n\n2/3\n\n\f8/2/23, 4:21 PM\n\nBullard Discusses Inflation and the Economic Outlook | St. Louis Fed\n\nDoing Business with the Fed\nEvents\nFederal Reserve Services\nVisiting the St. Louis Fed\nFederal Banking Regulations\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/from-the-president/speeches-and-presentations/2023/inflation-and-the-economic-outlook-wba\n\n3/3\n\n\f",

see also Cogley and\nSargent (JME, 2008) in which the large shock twists the priors of a Bayesian learner and\nleads to slow learning over subsequent decades.\n\n8\n\n\fI NTRODUCTION\n\nC ORE ARGUMENT\n\nR ELATIVELY\n\nE NVIRONMENT\n\nFAST CONVERGENCE IN THE\n\nC ALIBRATION\n\nU.S.\n\nL EARNING\n\nC ONCLUSIONS\n\nDATA\n\nI will calibrate the DSGE model used in this paper to U.S. data assuming U.S.\nmacroeconomic policies are in fact the optimal ones the model requires.\nI will then provide prima facie evidence that actual convergence times in U.S.\neconomic data following a “large, unanticipated shock” are an order of magnitude\nshorter than in the earlier literature.\nIn particular, these transition times are measured in quarters rather than years or\ndecades.\n\n9\n\n\fI NTRODUCTION\n\nC ORE ARGUMENT\n\nS OCIAL LEARNING\n\nE NVIRONMENT\n\nC ALIBRATION\n\nL EARNING\n\nC ONCLUSIONS\n\nFOR THE MASSES\n\nThis suggests that in reality, the U.S. economy—despite its complexity—does not\nseem to follow the types of slow adjustment paths emphasized in some of the earlier\nliterature.\nI will suggest that the rapid convergence observed in the U.S. data could occur if\nthere is substantial communciation across the society—social learning as\nimplemented by JA.\nIn the economy I describe, this can occur because there are many millions of agents\nthat have already learned and retained the “DNA” of optimal decision rules for\nconsumption, assets and hours worked before the shock occurred.\nOther agents that may not know these decision rules can learn relatively quickly from\nthose that do.\nI call this phenomenon “social learning for the masses.”\n\n10\n\n\fI NTRODUCTION\n\nC ORE ARGUMENT\n\nE NVIRONMENT\n\nC ALIBRATION\n\nL EARNING\n\nC ONCLUSIONS\n\nEnvironment\n\n11\n\n\fI NTRODUCTION\n\nC ORE ARGUMENT\n\nE NVIRONMENT\n\nC ALIBRATION\n\nL EARNING\n\nC ONCLUSIONS\n\nE NVIRONMENT BASICS\nAt each date t, a new continuum of households enters the economy, makes economic\ndecisions over T + 1 = 241 dates, then exits the economy. (To fix ideas, think of ≈ 1m\nagents per quarterly cohort.)\nThis corresponds to an agent entering the economy as a decision-maker at age 20 and\nexiting as a decision-maker at age 80, inclusive of end points, and making economic\ndecisions at a quarterly frequency.\nResults are perfectly general for the choice of T, with higher values corresponding to\ndecision-making at more frequent intervals.\nThis class of models has a “paper-and-pencil” equilibrium solution, and so it\nprovides a simple benchmark model for heterogeneous-agent macroeconomies with\naggregate shocks.\n\n12\n\n\fI NTRODUCTION\n\nC ORE ARGUMENT\n\nR ISKS FACED\n\nE NVIRONMENT\n\nC ALIBRATION\n\nL EARNING\n\nC ONCLUSIONS\n\nBY HOUSEHOLDS\n\nThere are both aggregate risk and idiosyncratic risk.\nIdiosyncratic risk is borne as a productivity-profile scaling shock as the agent enters\nthe economy, and also in the form of simple i.i.d. unemployment risk at each date.\nMonetary and fiscal policymakers provide a form of insurance against the aggregate\nrisk, and a labor market authority provides unemployment insurance.\nThe idiosyncratic risk borne as the agent enters the economy via the\nproductivity-profile scaling shock is uninsurable.\nA welfare theorem describes the sense in which the equilibrium studied here\nrepresents a first-best allocation of resources.\n\n13\n\n\fI NTRODUCTION\n\nC ORE ARGUMENT\n\nE NVIRONMENT\n\nC ALIBRATION\n\nL EARNING\n\nC ONCLUSIONS\n\nA SSETS\n\nThere are three nominally denominated assets: privately issued debt, publicly issued\ndebt and capital.\nWe think of these as representing U.S. data counterparts: (1) mortgage-backed\nsecurities (MBS), (2) federally issued debt and (3) physical capital, respectively.\nIn the U.S. data, MBS net out, but federally issued debt and physical capital are in\npositive net supply and we target a value of the assets-to-GDP ratio equal to\n1.23 + 3.32 = 4.55.\n\n14\n\n\fI NTRODUCTION\n\nC ORE ARGUMENT\n\nE NVIRONMENT\n\nC ALIBRATION\n\nL EARNING\n\nC ONCLUSIONS\n\nN OMINAL CONTRACTING\n\nThe credit market friction is non-state contingent nominal contracting (NSCNC): All\ndebt contracts are stated in nominal terms, with a stated nominal interest rate, and\nrepayment is not state-contingent.\nThe role of monetary policy is to adjust the price level each period in order to convert\nthese nominal, non-state contingent contracts into real, state-contingent contracts.\n\n15\n\n\fI NTRODUCTION\n\nC ORE ARGUMENT\n\nE NVIRONMENT\n\nC ALIBRATION\n\nL EARNING\n\nC ONCLUSIONS\n\nH OUSEHOLD TYPES\n\nHousehold types: “life cycle” (LC) and “hand-to-mouth” (HTM).\nThe life-cycle households are assigned a hump-shaped productivity profile at the\nbeginning of their life cycle.

model\nequilibrium.\nHowever, nominal growth rates and interest rates are considerably different during\nlarge, unanticipated shocks like the GFC and the pandemic.\nThe chart suggests that the conditions of macroeconomic equilibrium were\nre-established relatively quickly after the GFC, and also appear to be close to being\nre-established following the pandemic.\n\n40\n\n\fI

with\neconometricians as in Cogley and Sargent (JME, 2008)—might interpret the large\nshocks as moments where rational expectations were badly disturbed across all\nagents in the economy: young and old, rich and poor.\nForecasts that placed considerable weight on the chaotic observations from the crisis\ncould lead to important changes in economic behavior, which could then feed back\nand continue to keep the economy away from its long-run equilibrium for some time.\nThis vision of learning seems to be at odds with the data in the figure.\n\n41\n\n\fI NTRODUCTION\n\nC ORE ARGUMENT\n\nE

different incomes, levels of\nconsumption, and assets.\nNevertheless, they can learn from each other due to the fact that these optimal\ndecision rules are transferable across agents because they adjust for age and\nproductivity in the appropriate way.\nFurthermore, most agents would have had to learn these decision rules before the\nlarge, unanticipated shock occurred.\nThe economy is in effect seeded with a sort of “DNA”—known, previously learned\ndecision rules—even after the large shock occurs and begins to dissipate.\n\n43\n\n\fI NTRODUCTION\n\nC ORE ARGUMENT\n\nE NVIRONMENT\n\nC

and can propagate exponentially\nquickly through the population following the large shock, returning the economy to\nequilibrium in short order.\nThis “social learning for the masses” is more likely to be the successful learning\nconcept in large heterogeneous agent economies.\n\n44\n\n\fI NTRODUCTION\n\nC ORE ARGUMENT\n\nE NVIRONMENT\n\nC ALIBRATION\n\nL EARNING\n\nC

Bullard noted that the Volcker disinflation was costly but “incredible”—\ninitially, few believed that the Fed was serious about reducing inflation at that time.\nThe current situation for the U.S. seems to fall more closely under the rubric of a “credible\ndisinflation,” Bullard said. “Since modern central banks have more credibility than their\ncounterparts in the 1970s, it appears that the Fed may be able to disinflate in an orderly\nmanner and achieve a relatively soft landing,” he said. The path to the soft landing requires a\ncredible switch of monetary-fiscal policy to the policy regime that existed before the\npandemic, he added.\n\nFOLLOW US\n\nSIGN UP FOR EMAIL ALERTS\nReceive updates in your inbox as soon as new content is published on our website\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/from-the-president/speeches-and-presentations/2023/credible-and-incredible-disinflations\n\n1/2\n\n\f8/2/23, 4:20 PM\n\nCredible and Incredible Disinflations | St. Louis Fed\n\nSIGN UP\nQUICK LINKS\nAbout Us\nLegal Information\nContact Us\nPrivacy Policy\nCareers\nDoing Business with the Fed\nEvents\nFederal Reserve Services\nVisiting the St. Louis Fed\nFederal Banking Regulations\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/from-the-president/speeches-and-presentations/2023/credible-and-incredible-disinflations\n\n2/2\n\n\f",

He spoke during a fireside chat with Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari at an\nevent hosted by the Economic Club of Minnesota.\nOn May 3, the FOMC raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, to\n5%-5.25%. Bullard said he thought the move “was a good next step for the committee.” He\nnoted that the FOMC has done a lot in the past year or so. “But we have a lot of inflation in the\nU.S. economy, more than we’ve had since the early 1980s,” he said. “And so I think it’s\nappropriate to put the policy rate at a higher level so we can try to get the inflation problem\nbehind us sooner and get back to the 2% inflation environment that we enjoyed earlier.”\nWhile the U.S. economy always faces risks, Bullard said that a recession is not his base case. “I\nthink the base case is slow growth, probably a somewhat softer labor market and declining\ninflation,” he said. He also noted that the May 5 jobs report was stronger than expected again\nand that the U.S. has a very tight labor market, which will take a while to cool off.\nHe also discussed the recent stresses in the banking sector, the role of Federal Reserve banks\nin supervising banks compared with the role of the Board of Governors, the composition of\nReserve bank boards of directors, and his view on central bank digital currencies.\n\nFOLLOW US\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/from-the-president/speeches-and-presentations/2023/recent-policy-rate-increase-outlook-for-us-economy\n\n1/2\n\n\f8/2/23, 4:20 PM\n\nBullard Discusses Recent Policy Rate Increase, Outlook for U.S. Economy\n\nSIGN UP FOR EMAIL ALERTS\nReceive updates in your inbox as soon as new content is published on our website\nSIGN UP\nQUICK LINKS\nAbout Us\nLegal Information\nContact Us\nPrivacy Policy\nCareers\nDoing Business with the Fed\nEvents\nFederal Reserve Services\nVisiting the St. Louis Fed\nFederal Banking Regulations\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/from-the-president/speeches-and-presentations/2023/recent-policy-rate-increase-outlook-for-us-economy\n\n2/2\n\n\f",

On July 20, 2023, the Federal Reserve launched FedNow®—a safe, ef�cient\ninstant payments infrastructure that aims to modernize the U.S. payment system. FedNow®\ngives participating �nancial institutions the opportunity to innovate by enabling their\ncustomers to send and receive payments in near real time, any day of the year. How might\nthis new service change business as usual? What are the implications for everyday\nAmerican consumers and businesses? The St. Louis Fed hosted a virtual event exploring\nFedNow® and payments innovation featuring Interim President and CEO Kathy O’Neill\nPaese and Federal Reserve Financial Services Chief Payments Executive Mark Gould.\nA transcript follows this video.\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/dialogue-with-the-fed/fednow-what-you-need-to-know\n\n\fFedNow: What You Need to Know\n\n3/29/2024, 10:22 AM\n\nTranscript\nKathy O’Neill Paese: Well, good afternoon. And thank you for joining us for today's\nDialogue with the Fed about FedNow, the new instant payment infrastructure\ndeveloped by the Federal Reserve. My name is Kathy O'Neill Paese. And I'm interim\npresident and CEO here at the St. Louis Fed. And I also serve as the Federal Reserve\nSystem's Treasury product director.\nAnd in case you haven't noticed, I have a little frog in my throat today. So, apologies,\nyou'll have to bear with my squeaky voice today. Joining me here today, from the\nFederal Reserve System, is my colleague Mark Gould. Mark is the chief payments\nexecutive for Federal Reserve Financial Services.\nBefore we begin our discussion, a few words about today's event. It's part of our\nongoing Dialogue with the Fed series, where our goal is always to connect you with\nexperts and information to better understand the economy. Mark, thanks for joining\nus today to talk about FedNow.\nMark Gould: Thanks, Kathy. It's great to be here. I wish I could remotely send you a\ncup of hot tea, because it sounds like you need it.\nO’Neill Paese: I do need it. And I have a little bit of hot tea to help me out on the side.\nSo thank you. And thanks for spending time with us today. Mark, before we get started,\nI just want to mention that any views shared by me here in this discussion are my own\nviews or not those-- they don't necessarily re�ect those of the Fed system. And I'm\ngathering you probably feel the same.\nGould: The same for me, yes, absolutely.\nO’Neill Paese: All right. Well, let's talk a little bit about FedNow. That's the topic of our\nconversation here today. And consumers are increasingly prioritizing getting\npayments 24 by 7 by 365. And so we introduced FedNow back in July of this year. And\nmy question to you is, tell me a little about FedNow and all of our listeners. And is it\ngoing to be business as usual? Or is it a game changer? How do you see FedNow and its\nimpact on the payment system?\nGould: Yeah. Kathy, thanks for the opportunity to be here. And this is one of my\nfavorite things to talk about. So this is a terri�c opportunity. So let me just say maybe a\nfew words about payments at the Fed generally, because while-- if we were to do word\nassociation with just 100 random people on the street about the central bank or the\nFederal Reserve, most people will probably come up with something related to interest\nrates.\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/dialogue-with-the-fed/fednow-what-you-need-to-know\n\n\fFedNow: What You Need to Know\n\n3/29/2024, 10:22 AM\n\nThey might come up with something related to in�ation, maybe they'd know Chair\nJerome Powell or something like that. But most people don't understand the central\nbank all that well. So there really are three fundamental functions of the central bank.\nOne, of course, is monetary policy. And that's the thing that people most associate with\nthe central bank.\nThe second is maintaining a safe and sound banking system. So having a process for\nsupervision and regulation that assures that your money in the bank is safe. And then\nthe third leg of the central banking stool is �nancial services. And that's what my role\nis. And in �nancial services, we essentially have a range of services that we offer to\nbanks and credit unions of every shape and size across the country. There are\nthousands of banks in the United States.\nAnd those services range from providing currency and coin directly to institutions to\nenable them to service their customer base, offering check clearing services because\nwhile check writing has declined in the United States, there are still lots and lots of\nchecks written every year. In fact, I think the number I recall last year-- I think in the\nFed system, we cleared about $9 trillion worth of checks.\nWe also provide electronic payment services. One of those is called the automated\nclearing house or ACH for short, because at the Fed we have acronyms for everything.\nAnd ACH is really the service that most people think of as direct deposit or bill\npayment. It's that recurring batch payment, type payment is what ACH is most often\nused for.\nAnd then we have a large dollar service called Fedwire, wire transfers for very large\npayments. Most people tend to make maybe only a handful of these in their lifetime\nrelated to maybe buying a house, making a down payment, or things like that. What\nwas missing is the ability to make a payment instantly. So across that portfolio, there's\ntime involved. And there's a certain amount of friction involved in every single one of\nthese services.\nAnd so we launched, a number of years ago now, a public consultation process to\nreally sense from the industry, from the general public, from consumer groups, a real\nbroad swath of America, is there a need for the Fed to offer an instant payment\nsolution? The answer-- and I'm shortcutting quite a long process. The answer was yes.\nAnd we made the determination to proceed. And that's what led to the work leading up\nto this launch this past July.\nO’Neill Paese: So FedNow really is new. You just described the whole portfolio of the\nFed system from checks and cash, which are not very automated all the way up to the\nlatest and greatest in automation. So what are the implications for everyday\nAmericans and businesses? What changes might they see with FedNow?\nGould: Yeah, so I think one thing that I would urge-- I always have to, when I talk about\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/dialogue-with-the-fed/fednow-what-you-need-to-know\n\n\fFedNow: What You Need to Know\n\n3/29/2024, 10:22 AM\n\nthis, I have to temper my excitement and enthusiasm about the future with the reality\nof the present. And so I'm going to try to do my best two-handed response to that,\nKathy.\nAt maturity, when instant payments are ubiquitously available in the United States and\nbroadly used across a range of use cases, I see the potential for instant payments to\ntransform how payments are made in the United States. And I see that in a lot of\ndifferent ways.\nSo for example, if you're just a regular worker, let's say, in a fast food restaurant or a\nservice sector worker. And you're getting paid by the hour. You know, instant payments\n- and this is already happening today by the way in some use cases - instant payments\ncreate the potential for workers to really choose when they want to get paid as opposed\nto waiting till the end of a two-week pay period.\nThat's really important because there's a broad swath of Americans that have worked\nfor, let's say, a week. They're a week away from payday. And they need that emergency\nliquidity. And so today, they might go to a payday lender or something like that. Having\nthe ability to have access to money as you earn it is a capability that I think instant\npayments really enable.\nI think from a business standpoint, it also has the opportunity to just, again, transform\nhow businesses think about liquidity. I think if you're a business person and you think,\nOK, what types of payments would be important for speed, immediacy, and �nality to\nbe important?\nThink about a transaction where goods have been delivered, the service has been\nprovided. And you know and you're waiting for that payment. We have the ability to\nmake that payment just immediately and in seconds. That small business is going to\nbe able to move on to the next job.\nAnd then from a consumer standpoint, again, if you think about-- if I were to open up\nmy banking app on my phone right now, it would show me a balance. But that balance\nis probably not exactly right, because there's money in �ight. There are incoming\ndeposits, there are payments scheduled to be made.\nBut in a world where all payments are instantaneous or close to instantaneous, that\nbalance is going to be an awful lot closer to reality at any moment in time when I look\nat that. I think that's going to be a real enabler for �nancial inclusion in this country as\nwell.\nBecause I think a barrier-- in our research, one of the barriers to people who don't\nhave a bank account, wanting a bank account, is just uncertainty about their ability to\nmaintain a minimum balance and worry that they might incur some fees if they fall\nshort of it. So I see the potential for money to moving instantly to just unlock all kinds\nof potential in the economy. Now, that's the-- I said I was going to do a two-handed.\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/dialogue-with-the-fed/fednow-what-you-need-to-know\n\n\fFedNow: What You Need to Know\n\n3/29/2024, 10:22 AM\n\nThat's the optimistic.\nThe present is we've just launched Fed now. And as I mentioned, there are thousands\nof banks in the United States. As of this morning, I think the number I wrote down, I\nthink we have 252 banks on the platform today. So we have a ways to go, but we're\nscaling quickly. And we want that to-- we want to get to a point where every �nancial\ninstitution in the country is connected as quickly as possible. But we recognize that's\ngoing to take us a little bit of time to get there.\nO’Neill Paese: Yeah, absolutely. And I would-- I'm reminded about the ACH. It started\nin the '60s with the Air Force. And look at how long it took us to get A to all electronic\nACH. That took 20 years. And then to get every bank in the country Connected to ACH\ntook another 20. So this is a generational thing, but I know we're ramping hard to try\nand get as many organizations and �nancial institutions onboarded.\nGould: Yeah, our goal is to not take 20 years. That's not something we want to\nreplicate. But to your point, this is the �rst new rail that we've introduced in about 50\nyears. And so that makes it really exciting. I guess, I'm curious, Kathy, from your\nstandpoint. I mean you've been along for the ride, too.\nWell, this is happening in �nancial services. You and I-- I won't say how long we've\nbeen around the Fed system. But you and I have worked together for a very long time.\nYou were part of the group that led to the launch of FedNow. How did it feel like to you\nwatching this come to life?\nO’Neill Paese: Well, really exciting. I mean, I was involved on the front end of all of\nthis, as you said, when we were doing the request for comment and trying to build the\nbusiness case about should we build a new system or not. And that was hard analysis. I\nremember a lot of dif�cult conversations. But obviously, I think we made the right\ndecision.\nGould: I think that's one of the things that I think maybe is underappreciated about\nthe path to get here is that the Fed System-- we move slowly and deliberately. And so\nwe want to make certain that before we do something that there's a real need for it.\nAnd there's support in the country for it. And that was the deliberative process that we\nwent through.\nLaunching it this year, I will tell you, I was in the room with the team that built this.\nAnd we were watching banks that night-- that �rst night we went live, we were\nwatching our big screen. And we could see banks starting to log in. And that was\nexciting. And then we saw the �rst transaction �ow.\nO’Neill Paese: Yeah.\nGould: And I just sitting here today, thinking back to that, I still kinda get goosebumps\nthinking, yeah, we watched the �rst payment �ow over a new rail. And I turned to the\nperson sitting next to me in the room. And I said, we'll never be closed again.\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/dialogue-with-the-fed/fednow-what-you-need-to-know\n\n\fFedNow: What You Need to Know\n\n3/29/2024, 10:22 AM\n\nO’Neill Paese: Yes, exactly.\nGould: Because this new system, it's 24/7/365, which is unlike any of our other\npayment platforms.\nO’Neill Paese: That's exactly right. Well, you've outlined and we've talked a little bit\nabout the unique role that the Federal Reserve plays in the payment system, but we're\nnot the only ones in the payment system. And for us to be successful, for the United\nStates really to reap the bene�t of FedNow, we need a lot of partners-- �nancial\ninstitutions, others. So can you talk a little bit about efforts to partner with others in\nindustry to get FedNow launched and to market?\nGould: Yeah, you could not be more right about that, Kathy. I mean, the way that I've\ndescribed this is we've invested in bringing FedNow to the market. And we need\neveryone else in the economy to invest in bringing it to life. And that's absolutely the\ncase.\nSo I'll highlight a few different groups, but I won't be able to possibly capture everyone.\nOne group that I want to give credit to, right off the bat, is our early adopters. We\nstarted with-- there were roughly I think 30 banks live that �rst night. And this group\nof banks, I'm just going to tell you, were so excited. I know of one �nancial institution.\nAnd we move to the next business day, basically, in the middle of the night.\nAnd there was a bank somewhere in the Midwest that invited their entire board of\ndirectors to watch their �rst payments �ow that night. I mean, that's the level of\nexcitement in the industry and among our early adopters that, honestly, we can't\nthank our customers enough for that group of early adopters that were really game to\njump on board right away and provide an innovative solution to their customers.\nThe second group that I would highlight that is absolutely key to our success are all of\nthe core processors, the technology providers that banks around the country rely\nupon. There's a relatively small number of dominant players in this space, but there's\nalso a lot of smaller players in this space. And they're really enabling banks to connect\nto FedNow and to other payment platforms.\nAnd so having their support for FedNow and enabling FedNow connectivity to their\nentire customer base is something that's really key for adoption. In fact, it's one of the\nreasons I'm very bullish about our ability to scale quickly is that many banks in this\ncountry rely on a relatively small group of core processors for that type of basic\nconnection to our payment services.\nI'd highlight a third group. And that's really all of the industry associations and other\ntrade groups that we really leverage to provide education and awareness about what\nFedNow is, how it's different, what you need to think about. We've also invested\nheavily in a lot of online resources that they've generously shared with their\nmembership base. I think that's one of the ways that we can get the word out.\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/dialogue-with-the-fed/fednow-what-you-need-to-know\n\n\fFedNow: What You Need to Know\n\n3/29/2024, 10:22 AM\n\nAnd then �nally a group that I've really recently been spending an awful lot more time\nwith is the �ntech community. I think the �ntech community, in many cases, these are\nsmaller companies targeting either speci�c use cases or speci�c opportunities to\nenable banks to connect more quickly or more easily. And I really think that that group\ncould be key, too - not to not just helping to promote connection to FedNow and instant\npayments but also coming up with ways to fully leverage the platform.\nSo, I mentioned this notion of payroll earlier. There's a company I talked with last\nweek, actually, that provides what they call earned wage access. So if you work today,\nyou get paid today platform. And those kinds of ideas, I think, the creative sector of the\neconomy is going to kick in once we reach scale. And I think instant payments, 10\nyears from now, are going to be used in ways that none of us could possibly have\nimagined today.\nAnd the reason that I say that with con�dence is I know that the ACH system, today, is\nbeing used in ways that nobody could have possibly imagined in the late '60s or early\n'70s. And I really believe that same thing will happen with instant payments.\nO’Neill Paese: Oh, I'm sure you're right, absolutely. And we're beginning to see little\nhints of that, aren't we? With some of the banks who are early adopters here.\nThe other one that I know you and I have been working on jointly with is the U.S.\nTreasury. And they were one of the early adopters of FedNow. And conversations\ncontinue with them about possible use cases for them to jump on board. But I think\nthey've expressed their desire to use FedNow going forward in the future. And I know\nyou and I are looking forward to working with them to �gure out what those use cases\nlook like.\nGould: Yeah, I think there's a lot of opportunity there. And again, it's wherever-whether you're the Treasury, a business, a consumer, a nonpro�t, an educational\ninstitution, I mean any entity, anyone who makes or receives a payment in the United\nStates, the question everyone should be asking themselves is, would immediacy\nmatter for this payment? Would having this payment be available in seconds, be\ninstantaneous, and irrevocable, would that be a good thing for our business? And how\ncould we make use of that?\nI think there are just hundreds and thousands of use cases to explore that the-- key\nthough is getting this network built. And so that's one of the reasons that we're so\nfocused right now on getting every �nancial institution in this country connected.\nKathy, it's a little bit like if I was running a shipping company. And you came in and\nyou said, well, I want to mail a package to my friend in Washington D.C. And I said,\nwell, I can get you as far as Minneapolis. That wouldn't really be helpful.\nAnd a payment system is all about scale and network. And we have to have the scale in\norder to build the network effects to really accomplish our goals. Our goal, obviously,\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/dialogue-with-the-fed/fednow-what-you-need-to-know\n\n\fFedNow: What You Need to Know\n\n3/29/2024, 10:22 AM\n\nwas to get to market, but our ultimate goal is, as I said earlier, for instant payments to\nbe ubiquitously available and broadly used for a range of use cases all around the\ncountry.\nO’Neill Paese: Yeah. And I know we'll get there in time. It just takes a little bit of time.\nBut we got a couple of questions ahead of time that I want to start lobbing your way\nbecause they're starting to come through as well on the system. So one question, and\nI've heard this a lot, is with the advent of FedNow, is it going to eliminate the need for\npaper money? Are we going to get rid of cash, �nally?\nGould: Well, yeah. So I'm going to give you a quiz, Kathy. So I'm sitting here in my\nof�ce in San Francisco. And I often hear from people, if I'm out and around town here\nor in Silicon Valley. And I talk about what we do. They say, cash? I mean, didn't\neverybody stop using cash 20 years ago, didn't they?\nAnd I'll ask them a simple question: what do you think the amount of currency in\ncirculation is-- U.S. currency in circulation is today versus 10 years ago? Do you think\nit's about the same, up a little, down a little, up a lot, down a lot? You may already know\nthe answer.\nO’Neill Paese: I do. I can't cheat. Why don't you share it?\nGould: Yeah.\nO’Neill Paese: It's up. We know it's up.\nGould: The amount of US currency in circulation is roughly double today what it was\n10 years ago. When I say that in audiences, speaking sessions, or one-on-one\nmeetings, people are universally �abbergasted. And it's one of the reasons when I talk\nabout this portfolio of payment services that we offer, we're really focused on not just\nspeed and not just resilience, but also choice.\nI think one thing that I've learned is that this is a really big and diverse country with\npeople of all backgrounds and businesses of all sizes. And they need different things\nfrom their payment services. And some people are quite reliant on cash still. And cash\nis a store of value, both in this country and in around the world. It's still quite popular.\nSo do I think-- that's a long way of saying, do I think that the FedNow system being\navailable will lead to cash no longer being used? Now, this is the part where we said\nour views. This is my personal view. That's not in our lifetime. I mean cash is-- in\nmany respects, when you think about all of the innovation that we see in the payment\nspace, it's actually trying to replicate what's good about cash.\nCash is immediate. It's �nal. It's anonymous. It works if the power is out. It works if the\npower is on. I mean, it doesn't matter. And it's universally acceptable. I've never had\nsomeone say no to cash. And so all of those qualities that have made it durable across\ntime I think we'll continue for the foreseeable future. What do you think, Kathy?\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/dialogue-with-the-fed/fednow-what-you-need-to-know\n\n\fFedNow: What You Need to Know\n\n3/29/2024, 10:22 AM\n\nO’Neill Paese: I absolutely agree. I mean, I don't use a lot of cash. I always have some\nwith me, however. But I do agree that more and more and more money is moving\nelectronically, digitally. And that's de�nitely the direction that we're going to go in.\nSo, Mark, let's go back and just level set a little bit for anybody who may have joined us\nlate about FedNow itself and how does it work. This is something banks can use. It's\nnot an app on our phone. Tell us a little bit about how you originate-- how FedNow\nworks between banks.\nGould: Sure. Yeah, so what FedNow is is basically an infrastructure that enables\nmoney to move between �nancial institutions in seconds. And so what this isn't going\nto look like-- if you're a consumer, you won't see a FedNow app or the Federal Reserve\napp on your phone or something like that. This would be a feature in your mobile\nbanking app.\nAnd I'll give you an example that one of our early adopters is using. So they enabled\nthis on their mobile banking platform. And essentially, when a customer input a\npayment, they input the data to make a payment to another person or company on the\nother side of the country.\nThey implemented a system where it can look up, is that other institution a FedNow\nparticipant? If the answer is, yes, it will ask customer, the consumer, would you like to\nmake this payment instantly or would you like to make it over a two or three day\nperiod of time? And customers universally are wanting to make the payment instantly.\nAnd they're seeing payments �ow back into their account instantly as well.\nAnd so it's going to be a choice for customers to make. And every bank will approach\nthis slightly differently, but that's essentially how it works. There's a lot of technology\nbehind the scenes. This is a cloud-based application that our team built that's\navailable 24/7/365.\nSo Kathy if you want to repay me for that dinner that we had two weeks ago at 2:00 in\nthe morning on Saturday, you could. Again, at maturity, once we have everyone signed\nup on the system and the platform fully enabled, it's a kind of payment that you'd be\nable to make around the clock 24/7/365, which is a completely different equation than\nany of our payment services today.\nO’Neill Paese: That's so true. And to me, the other really unique thing about FedNow is\nthat its credit push. So you're just you're not pulling money out of anybody's account.\nYou're pushing money. And I know that there's implications for fraud there. And\npayment fraud is something that we think about all the time. So what are your\nthoughts about FedNow, and fraud, and how are we thinking about fraud for FedNow\nand controlling it?\nYeah, well, I mean, so fraud-- I mean, fraud exists across the economy, across different\npayment platforms. So it's de�nitely something we spend an awful lot of time thinking\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/dialogue-with-the-fed/fednow-what-you-need-to-know\n\n\fFedNow: What You Need to Know\n\n3/29/2024, 10:22 AM\n\nabout. The way that we're approaching it at launch, we enabled a core set of\ncapabilities for banks to implement controls, dollar controls for example.\nAnd we also are requiring every bank on the network to report when they experience a\nfraudulent transaction, which isn't something that we've done in any of our other\nsystems. That will enable us, over time, to build essentially a database of accounts that\nare associated with fraud and that that' bank would be able to block going forward.\nSo we really see this as something that's an all-- it's a whole of industry effort. I think\nbanks need to be investing in fraud prevention and mitigation tools. They absolutely\nare. I think �ntechs are innovating in this space. We will continue evolving our\npractices and capabilities centrally as well. And it's something that we're going to have\nto really focus on.\nI mean, again, going back to cash, the original instant payment, we are innovating on\ncash today new security features to inhibit counterfeiting for the next 10 or 20 years.\nSo that's a focus that likely will never go away.\nO’Neill Paese: Yeah, I can see that. And it will be something-- I mean, we've had to\nlook at fraud in all of our payment rails that we have today and put in place\nmechanisms to control it.\nSo I want to go back and talk a little bit more about �ntechs. You mentioned them\nearlier on. And I know, in some of my conversations, I've heard things like Uber or Lyft\ndrivers being able to get their pay at the end of their shift and be able to buy gas if they\nwant to keep going with FedNow. Have you heard, in any of your discussions with\npeople, more about how the �ntechs might use FedNow?\nGould: Yeah, so we think this early access to wages earned de�nitely is a use case that\nresonated with me, that to your point of an Uber driver getting paid at the end of every\nride or shift as opposed to some other frequency. I think that �ntechs-- because of\ntheir scale and just the nature of those organizations and the talent that they're able to\nrecruit, they're going to be able to move quickly on a particular use case and innovate\naround it.\nAnd when I meet with �ntechs, often, the �rst question I get is, so can we have an\naccount directly with the Fed? And I say, no. That's not how it works in this country. We\nonly provide service directly to �nancial institutions, but that remains-- that still\nleaves a rich set of opportunities for �ntechs to provide enabling capabilities to\n�nancial institutions. And I just think that's a really target rich environment for\n�ntechs.\nAnd it's also an opportunity for banks because if you're a startup, what are you looking\nfor? You're looking for scale. Who has scale? Financial institutions have scale. So it's\nthe opportunity for innovation to meet scale in a way that moves the industry forward.\nO’Neill Paese: Yeah, I can see that. And I know we've been seeing, over time, many\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/dialogue-with-the-fed/fednow-what-you-need-to-know\n\n\fFedNow: What You Need to Know\n\n3/29/2024, 10:22 AM\n\ncompanies in �ntechs. You want to put payments embedded in the technology. People\ndon't want to think about payments. You want to get your Uber or Lyft ride, and get out,\nand not have to deal with making a payment. So I think that's weaving it into the fabric\nof what the �ntechs are doing in terms of technology will be really helpful in the\nfuture.\nGould: And I really think that is the future of payments, Kathy. I mean, I gave a talk\nrecently, a few weeks ago, where I made the comment that I think the future of\npayments is going to be both faster and more embedded. When you take an Uber ride\nor you buy something on Amazon, you don't make a purchasing decision and a\npayment decision.\nSo you're not telling the Uber driver where you want to go and then separately making\na payment decision. It's just all part of one uni�ed experience. And I think that that's\nwhere-- I think that's what the future holds for us. And I think that instant payments\ncan be a true enabler of that.\nO’Neill Paese: Totally agree. So I'm getting a couple of questions coming in here I want\nto �y over your way. The �rst one is, can banks join as send and receive or just receive\nonly? What does it take to get started and signed up with FedNow?\nGould: Yeah, so some banks-- so it is possible to join as receive only. And some banks\nare doing that, I think a little bit to get their feet wet and experiment. And I've had\nbankers ask me my opinion, should I join a send? Can I join as a receive only? And I've\nalways said, look, I mean, the key is to join. And if you join as a receive only, you're\ngoing to start gaining experience. And then eventually, you'll start sending.\nI think it's an important point when I'm asked this question. Not every technology\nprovider is fully supporting yet the whole range of processes that we have with\nFedNow. And so I think that's also a bit of a factor. But it's absolutely possible to join as\na receive only bank and then gain experience that I think will be really valuable.\nO’Neill Paese: Yeah, I agree. So another question we've got-- I know you stated this a\nlittle bit earlier, but how many banks do we have live - and I should say �nancial\ninstitution - and do you have any thoughts about what that trajectory might look like\nover the course of the next year or so?\nGould: Yeah, so I think earlier-- I don't remember the number that I said. I think it's\nabout 250. I just got an update this morning, but it's 250, 252, something like that. We\nlaunched with around 30 institutions in July. And so when I've talked with people in\nthe industry about this, what I've heard from them is surprise. They're surprised at\nactually how quickly we've ramped up that number.\nAnd what I've said to them is my goal is for us to keep surprising them. And that's\nwhat-- we're really working hard at this. And obviously, grateful to all of our customers\nwho have signed up. Honestly, that's the real key to success. We need every �nancial\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/dialogue-with-the-fed/fednow-what-you-need-to-know\n\n\fFedNow: What You Need to Know\n\n3/29/2024, 10:22 AM\n\ninstitution connected, so that use cases have more economic value, because if we were\nto stop at 250 customers out of the thousands of �nancial institutions that we have in\nthis country, then the instant payments aren't going to take off because they just can't\nreach enough people.\nOne question I get asked when we talk about this a lot is, well, why don't you just\nmandate that everybody join? And that actually is what happens in some other\ncountries. And it has happened. And usually in the countries where you've seen\ninstant payment systems really take off, it's been a government mandate.\nAnd I think in some cases, the number of banks in those countries is quite a lot\nsmaller also. Mandating participation is not something that the Fed has the legal\nauthority to do. And so we're really focused on making the case that every �nancial\ninstitution should join because of the opportunity set available.\nAnd I think over time, competitive issues will enter the game too, where if you're a\nbank that enables immediate access to incoming funds and immediate ability to\ntransfer money, say, between accounts even for yourself-- if I want to move money\nbetween �nancial institutions, be able to do it instantly-- that's going to be a\ncompetitive differentiator at some point for banks that have that capability versus\nbanks that don't offer that capability to their customers.\nThat's why I'm so bullish on our ability to eventually reach ubiquity, just recognizing\nthat's not a two-month, six-month, or 12-month effort. It's really something that will\ntake dedicated focus, and patience, and persistence to achieve.\nO’Neill Paese: Understand and agree. And so I know the Federal Reserve, we just\npublished our prices for �nancial services recently. Can you talk a little bit about the\ncost to join FedNow, what are the fees for transactions?\nGould: Yeah, so for a typical �nancial institution, the cost, there isn't speci�cally a cost\nwith us to join, but there is a cost associated with the electronic connections that we\nmaintain with every �nancial institution. But every �nancial institution already has\nthose connections for other services.\nThat's how we provide things like check clearing services, ACH, Fedwire, and even\ncash services. That's how banks order currency and coin from us. The bulk of the\nimplementation cost is really in �nancial institutions own back rooms. And that's\nbetween them and their technology providers, their core providers, and also\nunderstanding how they need to evolve to support 24/7/365 service.\nThat's a larger change for some institutions than others. And the cost for that really\nvaries. There isn't a universal number for that. And large institutions have more\nsystems that they're interfacing with, too. So there's cost for that as well.\nO’Neill Paese: So another question that we've gotten has to do with the ACH. And you\nmentioned it earlier. We've talked a little bit about will cash go away. So what are the\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/dialogue-with-the-fed/fednow-what-you-need-to-know\n\n\fFedNow: What You Need to Know\n\n3/29/2024, 10:22 AM\n\nimplications for ACH? And will the ACH continue to exist �ve or 10 years from now as\nFedNow takes off?\nGould: Well, Kathy, I see a little icon in this that says it's being recorded. And so I live\nin fear that �ve years from now, you're going to pull this out, and replay it, and explain\nto me how I was wrong. So let me just emphasize once again. This is Mark's\nperspective, what I'm about to say. And other people may disagree, including you. So\nI'm going to ask you the same question.\nACH today is really the backbone of the payment system. It is how the vast majority of\npayments are cleared. The vast majority of the dollars clear on the Fedwire system.\nThat's where very, very large systemically important payments clear every single day.\nBut the vast majority of individual payments that affect people like you and me on a\ntypical daily basis, those tend to happen via ACH, which means ACH is deeply\nembedded in the �ber of our �nancial system. So do I see ACH going away anytime\nsoon? No, I do not.\nNow, the cost for ACH is lower than the cost for a FedNow transaction. And so that's\nsomething that I think, over time, we'll need to take into consideration. We need to\nprice our services though to recover our costs. And so that's really the driver of our\npricing decisions.\nNow, having said all of that, I expect-- and in our business case, I guess Kathy as you\nknow, we expect certain payments, certain numbers of ACH payments, certain\nnumber of Fedwire payments, and a certain amount of cash transactions-- we fully\nexpect some of those to transition to FedNow.\nIn fact, that's one of the reasons, a couple of years ago-- we didn't talk about this\nearlier, but it's a couple of years ago-- we made the decision to reorganize �nancial\nservices within the Fed system to put all of our payment services under one uni�ed\numbrella with a single person in charge.\nBecause one of the things that we were a little, that we were thinking about was, we\nwant to encourage payments to �ow to the best channel to meet whatever use case the\noriginator of that payment is seeking to accomplish. In some cases, that might be ACH.\nIn some cases, that might be Fedwire. And in a lot of cases, we think it might be instant\npayments. So we expect to see payments move around between channels. But I will tell\nyou, I also expect the total number of payments to go up signi�cantly.\nNow, this is the most risky prediction that I'm making. This is why I say it's my own\npersonal view. But when payments are easy and they're immediate, easily accessible,\nand ubiquitously you can reach anyone in the country, I think we'll see more payments\nhappen. So, I think the total number of payments will rise, potentially, very\nsigni�cantly. So, we will see transition between legacy payment rails and FedNow, but I\ndo think that the total size of the pie will increase as well. So now, what do you think?\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/dialogue-with-the-fed/fednow-what-you-need-to-know\n\n\fFedNow: What You Need to Know\n\n3/29/2024, 10:22 AM\n\nO’Neill Paese: Well, I knew, I know, and I agree with you. I mean, we've often seen a\ncorrelation between GDP and the payment system. And as the economy is strong and\nthere's a lot of growth in the economy, we do see payments increase. I also believe that\nACH is the workhorse of the payment system. And it really-- it's been in place a long\ntime. It works well. And it accomplishes a lot. So I agree with you.\nGould: I remember early in my career, Kathy, you remember this too. We'd see\ncouriers show up at the loading dock unloading giant reels of tape that we would run\nto clear that night's ACH payments. It sounds like 100 years ago, but I don't think I'm\n100 years old. So it can't be that long.\nO’Neill Paese: No, it isn't, but you're right. And that just goes to show you how the ACH\nhas evolved over time. And we've gone to more settlement windows and faster\nsettlement on ACH. So how do you see FedNow evolving? I mean, I know we got to\nmarket in July with our base product. What are some of the other features or things\nthat we're focused on building and delivering in the future?\nGould: Yeah, well, so there's a couple of things that I'd highlight. And I won't share\neverything, but I will say we have a pretty robust roadmap planned for the next �ve\nyears or so. One thing we touched on already and that's fraud. We view this as a place\nwhere that's always going to be-- I would bet that's always going to be on our\ninvestment list-- building, enhancing capabilities, working with our customers to spot\nnew opportunities and to add new capabilities.\nSo that's something that we plan to continually evolve our thinking and our service\nthere. Another that we're actively thinking about is some kind of a directory service\nthat would enable alias-based payments to occur without having to know everybody's\n�nancial information, account number, routing number, and things like that.\nSo those are a couple of things that we're thinking about. But the number one thing\nthat we're focused on as I said is just building the network, building the reach of the\nsystem so that we can then really see more use cases develop and reach more people\nin the country.\nO’Neill Paese: Well, Mark when we were doing the analysis to determine the business\ncase for FedNow, one of the things we looked at was other countries. And where were\ntheir instant payment systems in other countries. So can you talk a little bit about, how\ndoes FedNow �t in the U.S. Central bank with other countries and other instant\npayment systems?\nGould: So this is something, Kathy, as you know, you and I meet with our colleagues\nfrom other central banks periodically around the world. And every country is unique.\nAnd the U.S. is de�nitely unique among countries that are unique. So our �nancial\nsystem is incredibly complex and very decentralized. Thousands and thousands of\n�nancial institutions, as opposed to some countries might have three or �ve or six\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/dialogue-with-the-fed/fednow-what-you-need-to-know\n\n\fFedNow: What You Need to Know\n\n3/29/2024, 10:22 AM\n\n�nancial institutions. And so getting to ubiquity is a completely different situation.\nSome countries offer direct access to the payment system to non-�nancial institutions.\nAnd so it's really dif�cult to compare in an apples to apples way around the world. But\nwhat we do try to do is learn from our central bank colleagues in other parts of the\nworld about what works, and what they're seeing, what they're experiencing.\nI think the other thing that I would observe is, not every country is starting from the\nsame place. And so there are a lot of countries in the world where their move to instant\npayments came from a starting point where 90% of transactions were made using\ncash. Our starting point is quite different. As you highlighted earlier, the vast majority\nof money movement in this country already happens digitally.\nSo starting points are different. The structure of the �nancial system is different. And\nas I said earlier, our country's ability to mandate participation also is different. And so\nwhere we've seen this-- where we've seen, in the world, instant payments really take\noff is where it's both mandated and it's broadly available, including to non-bank\nparticipants.\nAnd each country has their own reasons for that. But I think a couple of prominent\nexamples I can think of it was to encourage people to move away from a primarily\ncash-based economy, which is quite different, as I said, from our starting point.\nO’Neill Paese: That's so true. The questions are �ooding in now. So I hope you're\nready. We might go to the lightning round here in just a minute. But can you talk a little\nbit about the difference between other faster payment products and FedNow, we won't\nname names here. But there are person-to-person platforms that people use to settle\nup on dinner and things like that. So how do those products differ from FedNow?\nGould: So those products differ from FedNow in one important respect, in that those\ndo not involve the instantaneous, real-time movement of money from one �nancial\ninstitution to another. You can think of those in a lot of cases, and it's hard to make\ngeneralizations, as an experience where it looks like the money has moved from a user\nexperience standpoint, but the money is actually going to be moving later. And so\nthere's a little bit of intraday risk there.\nAnd obviously, people have determined that that's suf�ciently low to enable these\nthings to happen. In our view, actually moving the money instantaneously is a better\nsolution, but that remains to be seen if everyone in the industry agrees with us. I think\nthe important thing as I said earlier is this is really all about having a range of services\nthat provide choice.\nThis is an incredibly big and super diverse country. I remind myself that every day\nwhen I sit in my of�ce, if I look out the window and I form a conclusion about the world\nor the United States based exclusively on what I see out of this particular window, I will\nbe wrong about everything. And that's true about payments. It's true about really\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/dialogue-with-the-fed/fednow-what-you-need-to-know\n\n\fFedNow: What You Need to Know\n\n3/29/2024, 10:22 AM\n\nanything.\nAnd so we really need to make sure that we offer a set of services that is broadly\ninclusive, recognizing that not everyone in the country has a bank account, not\neveryone has full access to the full range of �nancial services available to many others\nin the country. Making sure that we, in our enthusiasm for instantaneous payments,\nthat we not leave anyone behind.\nI think that that's-- I get asked, are checks going away or will we get rid of them? No,\nI've said it, when the whenever the last check is processed in the United States and I\ndon't know when that will be, it'll probably be processed by the Federal Reserve\nbecause we're really trying to provide that backstop to the payment system, with a\nbroadly inclusive set of payment services that meets the needs of this really diverse\ncountry that we have.\nO’Neill Paese: Yeah, I agree. And I know that �nancial inclusion is a major area of\nfocus for us. We want to make sure that all payment rails are available to all people so\nthat we can have �nancial inclusion, people who have equal ability to access the\nsystem. And so I think one of the major enablers of people accessing FedNow are third\nparty processors. And you mentioned before that we've been working with a number\nof them. But can you talk about what they're doing to try and help �nancial institutions\nramp up and come online with FedNow?\nGould: So this group of companies in the United States I would say has been very\nenthusiastic about instant payments. And so as we've worked with them to encourage\nthem to make instant payments available to their customers. We found them to be very\nreceptive, very willing to talk with us, and really working hard.\nI think if there's-- so it's hard to generalize exactly how they make this available to\ntheir customers, but I will say that we found this group of companies to be super, super\nexcited about the potential and very happy to work with us.\nAnd ultimately, like I said, that's how we're going to get to-- that's how we're going to\nget to scale is by making sure that �nancial institutions have access through their\nsystems that they're already operating or through systems they could use to augment\ncapabilities that they have the ability to not just connect but then to fully leverage the\nplatform for innovation on behalf of their customers.\nO’Neill Paese: That's going to be really important because a lot of those smaller banks\nout there just don't have large IT shops and support. So they really rely on those third\nparty processors.\nGould: But I really see that as an opportunity for-- particularly with instant payments\nis the smallest banks in this country. And one of my coworkers reminds me of one\nthat's open twice a week. And it's a very, very, very small institution in this country.\nAnd I always have that institution in mind when I think about, how do they compete?\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/dialogue-with-the-fed/fednow-what-you-need-to-know\n\n\fFedNow: What You Need to Know\n\n3/29/2024, 10:22 AM\n\nHow do they compete against the best resourced �nancial institutions in this country\nthat in a lot of cases are probably across the street?\nAnd so that's one of the reasons why FedNow, I think, is important is to enable the\nsmall, medium sized, regional, super regional banks in this country to provide a set of\nservices that's competitive, even though they may lack the full technology back of�ce\nof perhaps some of their larger competitors.\nO’Neill Paese: And we got another question in is, is there a list of the banks that were\nearly adopters? And I believe that's on our website frbservices.org under the FedNow\ntab.\nGould: Yeah, we have a full-- we're trying to keep this-- it's changing a lot as I said, but\nthere's a current list of current �nancial institutions at that website frbservices.org\nunder the FedNow product tab. And yeah, you can click on that and see who's\nparticipating.\nO’Neill Paese: Great. So one other thing I wanted to ask about, and this is something\nwe hear about too, is international payments and how there's friction. You talked about\nfriction in the payment system earlier. So what do you think is the likelihood that at\nsome point in the future FedNow could be used to interconnect with other countries'\ninstant payment systems and have us �gure out that international payments issue\nonce and for all? What do you think?\nGould: Yeah, this is one of the number one questions I'm asked when I speak and\nattend conferences in different parts of the world. And so you said, at any point in the\nfuture, I think is how you phrased your question. Do I see that as a potential at any\npoint in the future? Absolutely, I'll say that unequivocally.\nThe question is, at what point in the future? And so I think the number one thing that\nwe need to focus on right away and immediately is getting the U.S. �nancial system\nconnected. And then we can start to think about other potential linkages. But do I see\nbene�ts to doing this? Absolutely. And particularly with our major trading partners.\nAnd so I think, exactly how we go about that, what the technology is, how we maintain\nstrict compliance and all of that, that's the complex part. I don't see technology\nstanding in the way of that. But there's a lot of other issues that we'll need to work\nthrough. But I absolutely see that potential in the future. But I would be honest that I\ndon't see that in the immediate near future because the �rst thing that we need to do is\nget this country connected up.\nO’Neill Paese: Absolutely. And so we've got sort of an operational question that's come\nover the wires. Can you recall, meaning pull back, a FedNow payment like you can an\nACH payment?\nGould: We've published our operating rules. And so there are some things that can be\ndone in terms of notifying a bank of a payment made in error. But payments are, as I\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/dialogue-with-the-fed/fednow-what-you-need-to-know\n\n\fFedNow: What You Need to Know\n\n3/29/2024, 10:22 AM\n\nsaid, they are settled, and immediate, and irrevocable in seconds. And so this is a\nsystem as if I was handing you $100 bill. You might be nice and give it back to me, but\nyou wouldn't be obligated to. And so there are some conditions under which banks can\nwork with one another to identify maybe a payment that was sent in error.\nO’Neill Paese: That's great.\nGould: I have a question for you, Kathy.\nO’Neill Paese: All right, I'm ready.\nGould: What's it like being interim president?\nO’Neill Paese: That's quite a shift from FedNow, but you were interim president in San\nFrancisco too, weren't you?\nGould: I was.\nO’Neill Paese: So you and I both have had the chance to play that role. It's an\ninteresting role and I think one that a lot of people maybe don't fully appreciate and\nunderstand. Obviously, the presidents are most well known for what we do with\nmonetary policy. But we've got banking supervision responsibilities, and operations,\nlike what we've talked here about with FedNow.\nSo it's a lot to be the CEO of the organization, and make sure we're working to support\nthe mission of the Federal Reserve more broadly, while carrying out what is probably\none of our more important jobs on monetary policy. It's been an interesting time to be\nan interim president, I'll just say that.\nGould: Yeah, one of the things that I learned in my experience, which was back in\n2018, I always heard FOMC participants talk about-- they were either a voting member,\nas the votes rotate between banks or they described their participation in the FOMC as\nfully participating in the FOMC. And I didn't really know or fully appreciate what that\nwas until I went to a meeting and actually participated in a couple of meetings.\nAnd what I recognized now is it certainly matters who has a vote, because votes\nde�nitely matter in terms of the speci�c decisions that happen on interest rates. But I\ndidn't fully appreciate how everyone at the table actually has the same level of\nin�uence in terms of what they bring to the conversation. And it's something that you\nreally have to-- I think it might be dif�cult to pick up in the transcripts if you were to\njust read every word in the transcripts for meeting after meeting.\nBut in the meeting, I de�nitely noticed how something that one person says triggers\nsomeone else to either potentially agree or maybe disagree strongly with what that\n�rst person said. And that's something that I learned to really appreciate and didn't\nfully-- probably didn't fully understand before actually having the experience.\nO’Neill Paese: Yeah. And the diversity around the table is interesting and amazing.\nAnd I think it's what helps us support the American people and our economy so well.\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/dialogue-with-the-fed/fednow-what-you-need-to-know\n\n\fFedNow: What You Need to Know\n\n3/29/2024, 10:22 AM\n\nSo Mark, we are at 2:25 Central Time. I think it's something much less than that San\nFrancisco time.\nSo we've got �ve more minutes and maybe one more question, if somebody wants to\npull one in from the audience. But I'll ask you one. So you've been through the\ndevelopment of FedNow, and the launch, and getting us ramped up. What surprised\nyou most about the process to bring FedNow to market?\nGould: I think the thing that-- I don't want to say that this surprised me because I knew\nwe could do this, but I think-- maybe the thing that I would say that I'm most pleased\nby, is that I think we surprised the industry with when we launched this. When we\ninitially expressed our intent to launch FedNow, we gave the industry a window, as\nyou'll remember. We said it would be in the 2023 to 2024 timeframe.\nAnd I think that many people, maybe not everyone, but many people in the industry,\nwhen they heard, OK, it's going to be between 2023 and 2024, many people assumed it\nwould be on New Year's Eve 2024 going into 2025. I've asked a couple of people in the\nindustry, what was your guess when you saw that range? One person told me New\nYear's Eve. One person told me 2027. I've gotten a whole bunch of different answers to\nthat question.\nBut I don't know that anybody would have guessed July of 2023. And so I could not be\nmore proud of the team that worked on this. Ken Montgomery, the �rst VP in Boston\nhad been leading a team for the past several years to get this product to market. And\nthey just did a terri�c job of getting it done on time. At a time that I think, like I said, I\nthink we surprised the industry with our ability to get it done in that timeframe.\nBut as we described that, I always have to end with this the notion that, yes, it's in the\nmarket. It's available. And it's not yet ubiquitously available in the United States. And\nthat's why we need every �nancial institution, every business, every nonpro�t, every\nconsumer, really everyone who sends or receives a payment to be thinking about use\ncases where immediacy, �nality, and certainty really matter in sending or receiving a\npayment. Those are the target rich opportunities for instant payments in the future.\nAnd I'm just really excited to see where this all goes.\nO’Neill Paese: Well, thanks, Mark. We're coming to the end of our hour together. And\nso it's time to close. And Mark, thanks so much for talking with me and our audience\nparticipants today about FedNow. And I just ask everybody in the audience to please\nstay connected with us through social media or sign up on our website to be noti�ed\nabout our blogs, newsletters, or other future events. And you'll see more information\nabout that on your screen in just a minute. With that, thanks again for joining us today.\nAnd thanks, Mark, for all of your comments.\nGould: Thanks, Kathy.\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/dialogue-with-the-fed/fednow-what-you-need-to-know\n\n\fFedNow: What You Need to Know\n\n3/29/2024, 10:22 AM\n\n• Open Vault blog: Five Things to Know about FedNow, Right Now\n• Regional Economist: FedNow: A Once-in-a-Generation Payments Innovation for the\nFed\n• FedNow Explorer – Use FedNow Explorer to learn more about instant payments and\nfeatures of the FedNow Service.\nRelated Topics\nFederal Reserve\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/dialogue-with-the-fed/fednow-what-you-need-to-know\n\n\f",

Index\nreadings above 50 percent suggest the manufacturing economy for these areas is\nexpanding.\nHe noted that housing price declines have slowed in several countries, including the\nU.S. and Spain, and prices have started to rise in countries like China and the U.K.\n“In addition, world equity prices have also improved, with the average G-7 equity price\nincrease around 60 percent from its trough, and with an even stronger recovery in the\nBRIC countries,” he said.\n\nThe U.S. Recovery\nBullard said forces driving the U.S. economic recovery include stronger-than-expected\nglobal growth, especially in Asia. Other forces include recovering consumption\nexpenditures, less stress in nancial markets and stabilization in the housing sector.\n\n\f“U.S. consumption seems to be stabilizing,” Bullard said. In nancial markets, he noted\nthat U.S. credit spreads have narrowed and U.S. credit default swap and equity prices\nhave continued to improve, although they have not reached pre-crisis levels.\n“The U.S. housing sector is also stabilizing,” he said, though he noted that while the\nmost recent statistics on private housing indicate that housing starts are picking up,\nthey are at the lowest level in 40 years.\nHe said that real GDP in the U.S. grew 2.2 percent in the third quarter of 2009 from the\nprevious quarter, and that forecasters expect real GDP growth to remain in a positive\nrange of 2.8 percent to 4.7 percent in the near-term horizon. On the employment front,\n“Civilian unemployment remains high, but the pace of job loss has slowed,” he said.\nIn regard to in ation, Bullard said, “While U.S. in ation remains low, in ation uncertainty\ncontinues to be elevated.”\n\nU.S. Monetary Policy\nLooking ahead, Bullard said there are three components to the Fed’s current U.S.\nmonetary policy: the liquidity programs, the near-zero interest rate policy and the asset\npurchase program.\nHe explained that since the liquidity programs are naturally tapering off as the nancial\ncrisis recedes, they are not an in ationary concern.\nRegarding the zero interest rate policy, “Policy rates are near zero in the U.S. and the\nrest of the G-7 countries, something not seen in postwar economic history,” Bullard\nsaid. “Interest rates may remain low for quite some time.”\n“The market’s focus on interest rates is disappointing, given quantitative easing,” he\nsaid. “Markets are still thinking of monetary policy strictly as changes in interest rates—\neven though the Fed has been conducting successful policy this past year through\nquantitative easing. Markets should be focusing on quantitative monetary policy rather\nthan interest rate policy.”\nHe added, “The main challenge for monetary policy going forward will be how to adjust\nthe asset purchase program without generating in ation and still providing support to\nthe economy while interest rates are near zero,” Bullard said.\nBullard said he would like “the FOMC to adopt a state-contingent policy rule that would\nallow for the adjustment of asset purchases as new information on the economy\nbecomes available.”\n\nAsset Price Bubbles\nIn addition to the asset purchase program in relation to monetary policy, Bullard also\naddressed the issue of asset price bubbles.\n“Asset price bubbles are a very serious issue for monetary policy,” he said, adding that\nthis issue has been debated extensively over the past 15 years, and this debate will\nintensify. “This may mean that monetary policy should put more weight on asset prices\ngoing forward. We need better analysis of policy issues with respect to bubbles.”\nHe said the question of “whether ‘easy’ money fuels speculative investment—causing\nlarge and sharp increases and decreases in asset prices, and ultimately, large costs on\nan economy—raises two questions for monetary policy.”\n“Can the Fed identify incipient bubbles in real time? When are policy judgments better\nthan market judgments?” he asked. “If yes, what should the Fed do?”\nHe noted that monetary policy necessarily affects asset prices and interest rates.\n\n\f“Historically this did not appear to create prolonged run-ups in asset prices, but\nchanges in the recovery of employment in the past two recessions led the Fed to keep\ninterest rates low for a long time,” he said. “Both periods featured prolonged increases\nin certain asset prices: for technology in the 1990s and housing in the 2000s. During\nthis time, unemployment hit lows of 3.8 percent in 2000 and 4.4 percent in 2007, and\nin ation was low and stable.”\nIf the fed funds rate target was kept too low for too long in the 1990s and 2000s, “Why\ndidn’t we see more in ation?” he asked. “Yet, without an increase in in ation, asset\nprice misalignments seem to have caused signi cant problems for the\nmacroeconomy.”\nBullard discussed what an appropriate policy response might be once a bubble has\nbeen identi ed. “Given the Fed mandates of maximum sustainable employment and\nstable prices, plus ensuring nancial stability, monetary policy would be a blunt\ninstrument when responding to bubbles because monetary policy actions impact the\nmacroeconomy and cannot be targeted exclusively at a particular sector.”\nHe added, “If the asset prices contain reliable information about future in ation and\noutput, then the Fed might respond to the bubble using monetary policy, but the focus\nwould not be on responding to the bubble per se. Another alternative would be to use\nregulatory, supervisory and lender of last resort powers for nancial stability, but\nnancial institutions would need to be capable of withstanding large shocks to asset\nprices, as well as other shocks.”\nRegarding questions whether U.S. monetary policy is fueling global asset bubbles,\nBullard stressed that the Fed’s priority is the economic recovery of the U.S.\n“U.S. policymakers are unlikely to react to departures of prices from fundamental\nvalues in other countries,” he said. “It is the authorities in other countries who must\ndecide how to respond to their individual country’s departure from fundamentals.”\n###\nWith branches in Little Rock, Louisville and Memphis, the Federal Reserve Bank of St.\nLouis serves the Eighth Federal Reserve District, which includes all of Arkansas, eastern\nMissouri, southern Indiana, southern Illinois, western Kentucky, western Tennessee and\nnorthern Mississippi.

He called for regulatory reform that strengthens—not weakens\n—the Fed’s ability to head off future nancial crises. Bullard also addressed the U.S.\neconomic recovery now under way and cautioned that in ationary expectations appear\nto be on the rise.\n\nMain Street, Wall Street, and Washington, D.C.\nIn his presentation, “The U.S. Economy: A Report from Main Street,” Bullard addressed\nthe history and design of the current Federal Reserve System and how its decentralized\nstructure has provided strong checks and balances to keep power from being too\nconcentrated in Washington, D.C., or New York City.\nBullard reminded the audience that today’s Federal Reserve is actually the nation’s third\ncentral bank. The rst two, the First Bank of the United States (1791-1811) and the\nSecond Bank of the United States (1817-1837), ended up being discontinued.\n“The nation had no central bank during much of the 19th century,” he noted. “The\nevidence from the 19th century is generally regarded as unfavorable—there was far too\nmuch nancial instability. This led to the founding of the Fed following the panic of\n1907.”\nThe current Federal Reserve System was structured on the fundamental principle of\nkeeping monetary policy at arm’s length from the political process. To accomplish this,\nthe System was designed with three distinct but complementary parts: the Board of\nGovernors in Washington, D.C.; a Federal Reserve Bank in New York City, long regarded\nas the nation’s nancial capital; and 11 regional Reserve banks to represent the voice of\nMain Street across the rest of the nation.\n“This regional structure was designed to keep some power out of New York and\nWashington and to ensure input on key policy questions from around the U.S.A.,”\nBullard explained. “It is this structure that has allowed the Federal Reserve System to be\nsuccessful for nearly a century.\n“Ultimate authority still remains in Washington,” he said. “Members of the Board of\nGovernors are appointed by the president of the United States and con rmed by the\nSenate for a term of 14 years. This length of tenure enables Board members to make\ndecisions at arm’s length from the political process and away from election cycles.”\n\n\fThis is similar to the reasoning behind the lifetime tenures provided to justices of the\nSupreme Court.\n“Allowing short-term politics to mix too closely with monetary policy leads to poor\neconomic outcomes,” Bullard said. “This has occurred frequently in the developing\nworld over the last 50 years.”\nHe further explained that, “The Board of Governors has oversight authority for the\nFederal Reserve System, including budgets and key appointments. This includes\nregional bank presidents and rst vice presidents, as well as the chair and vice chair of\nthe boards of directors at each bank.” There is considerable accountability in the\nFederal Reserve System.\nHe pointed out that the Fed is extensively audited, a practice established long before\nrecent calls to “audit the Fed.”\n“Our rough estimate is that about 425,000 hours are spent each year on audits. This is\naccomplished through internal audits, Board of Governors oversight and an external\nauditor,” Bullard said. “The Fed is also subject to auditing by the General Accounting\nO ce (GAO), the investigative arm of Congress,” although these hours are not publicly\navailable.\n“Additional audits are welcome, so long as they do not constitute political meddling,”\nBullard said.\nAnother way to help ensure good economic outcomes, Bullard said, is through open\ndiscussions and debates. “Monetary policy is vigorously debated every day, both inside\nand outside the Fed,” Bullard said.\n\nRegulatory Reform: The Case for More Fed Authority, Not\nLess\nIn the aftermath of the nancial crisis, some have called for diminished Fed regulatory\nauthority. Bullard said that it is instead time for the Fed to have broader authority.\n“The clear lesson is that the Fed had insu cient access to information about the\nnancial landscape going into the crisis, meaning that it did not have a full\nunderstanding of the potential for feedback between the nancial sector and the rest of\nthe economy,” Bullard said.\nHe added, “As the crisis began, all eyes turned to the Fed as the lender of last resort.\nThis always happens in a crisis—only the central bank can play the lender-of-last-resort\nrole,” Bullard said. “Going forward, the Fed will also be at the center of all future crises\nbecause of this lender-of-last-resort role. Therefore, reforms should provide the Fed\nwith direct access to detailed information across the entire nancial landscape.”\n“The Fed had detailed knowledge about only a small part of the nancial landscape: the\nbanking institutions for which it had supervisory authority. Prior to the crisis of 2007,\nthis represented only about 12 percent of total U.S. banks,” he said. The remaining\nbanks were overseen by the Fed’s sister regulatory agencies, the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corp. (FDIC), the O ce of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the\nO ce of Thrift Supervision (OTS), as well as state bank regulators.\n“Banks are only one part of the nancial landscape,” he explained. “Non-bank nancial\nrms turned out to be the most troublesome entities in this crisis.” The Fed had no\noversight authority over these rms.\n“A future Fed, with an appropriately broad regulatory responsibility, may be able to head\noff a future crisis,” he added.\n\n\fThe State of the U.S. Economy and Monetary Policy\nTurning to the state of the economy, Bullard said, “The recession in the U.S. was severe,\nbut the economic recovery is on track.” He pointed to the past two consecutive quarters\nof positive GDP growth but noted the recovery from this severe and very deep recession\nhas a long way to go.\n“Labor markets remain weak and are at best stabilizing,” he said. “Job losses were\nmuch more severe than at any other time in recent history.” He noted that the number of\nhours worked is stabilizing, adding that this is typical behavior during the early phases\nof a recovery.\nOther positive signs include the increase in U.S. housing starts and housing permits\nsince the spring of 2009. “The housing sector is stabilizing,” Bullard said.\n“In addition, nancial market stress has abated substantially since the fourth quarter of\n2008,” Bullard said.\nHowever, in ation expectations are rising, he said, pointing to increasing spreads\nbetween Treasury In ation Protected Securities (TIPS) and Treasury bonds.\n###\nWith branches in Little Rock, Louisville and Memphis, the Federal Reserve Bank of St.\nLouis serves the Eighth Federal Reserve District, which includes all of Arkansas, eastern\nMissouri, southern Indiana, southern Illinois, western Kentucky, western Tennessee and\nnorthern Mississippi.

Any reform proposals have to face this fact.”\nAt the same time, he noted that “Smaller banks did not cause the crisis and do not need\nto be re-regulated. Current regulation works well for the thousands of smaller banks in\nthe U.S. The system features deposit insurance plus prudential regulation. It allows\nfailure, but prevents bank runs and the panic associated with them.”\nThe Fed had detailed knowledge only of part of the nancial landscape: that for which it\nhad supervisory authority. “Yet, all eyes turned to the Fed as the lender-of-last-resort.\nThis always happens in a crisis—only the central bank can play the lender-of-last-resort\nrole,” Bullard said.\n\nThe Reform Proposals\nSince “the Fed will also be at the center of all future crises because of its lender of last\nresort role, the reform response should be to provide the Fed direct access to detailed\ninformation across the entire nancial landscape—not less, as is the focus of current\npolicy discussions,” Bullard said. “Only a few of the current nancial regulatory reform\nproposals are likely to help prevent future crises.”\nBullard summarized several of the reform proposals now under discussion, including\nthe following:\n\nFinancial Services Oversight Council (FSOC)\nThe proposed interagency FSOC would monitor systemic risks posed to the nancial\nsystem, while the Federal Reserve would serve as an agent of the FSOC.\n\n\f“Would this prevent a future crisis? I think the evidence is far from clear,” Bullard said.\n“It seems like it would be di cult for an interagency Council to come to agreement on a\nspeci c risk and an associated action when times are good. In crises, decisions need to\nbe made quickly, not subjected to long committee debates. It is also possible to\noverreact by shutting down a particular practice that, in reality, does not pose a\nsystemic risk.”\nHe added, “The Fed would be better at navigating this type of decision-making, which\noccurs commonly in monetary policy. The Fed is also more politically independent than\nsuch a council could be.\"\n\nExpanded FDIC Receivership Authority\nIn the House bill, the FDIC would be granted expanded authority to put systemically\nimportant rms into receivership.\n“This reform goes in the direction of strengthening market incentives. A resolution\nregime is a way of putting market discipline on very large nancial rms—we could\nallow failure without creating panic,” Bullard said. “The fear of failure would then\nprevent the rms from taking excessive risks and from being able to borrow at low\nrates. Would this prevent a future crisis? It might.”\nHe said that his main concern with this aspect of the bill is how credible the regime\nwould be and how much global cooperation could be expected.\n“If it is not credible and the government is going to come in after all, then it is useless,”\nhe said. “‘Funeral plans’ for the rm in the event of failure do not strike me as credible.”\n\nLimited 13(3) Lending Authority\nAnother portion of the bill involves restrictions on Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve\nAct, which allows the Fed to lend to any individual, partnership or corporation in\n“unusual and exigent circumstances.”\n“In the House bill, signi cant restrictions are placed on Fed lending to non-banks under\nthe ‘unusual and exigent circumstances’ clause,” Bullard said. “Would this prevent a\nfuture crisis? No. This will probably exacerbate a future crisis.”\nWith such a potential restriction, “a future Fed facing a crisis will be more likely to say\nthat it does not have the authority to act, letting the crisis roll on,” he added.\n\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Agency\nIn addition, the House bill creates a separate Consumer Financial Protection Agency\n(CFPA) with rule-writing authority for all banks and non-banks that extend consumer\ncredit.\n“Would this prevent a future crisis? I don’t think so,” Bullard explained. “A fair playing\neld is certainly desirable in all consumer products. But the housing boom was a\nclassic gold rush: most people bought houses because they thought the prices would\nkeep rising. A CFPA would not have changed the gold rush dynamic.”\n\nCreditor Haircuts\nFinally, the House bill would potentially require secured creditors to take a 10 percent\nhaircut if the government has to step in and take over a failing rm.\n“Would this prevent a future crisis? Probably not,” Bullard said. “However, this provision\ndoes go in the direction of enhancing market discipline. Creditors would have greater\nincentives to understand and analyze risk at large nancial rms.”\n\n\fHowever, Bullard questioned why creditor exposure should be limited to just 10 percent,\nciting “lots of evidence that money-at-risk is available.” He said the moral hazard\ncreated by implicit or explicit government credit insurance is a problem.\n###\n\nGENERAL\nHome\nAbout Us\nBank Supervision\nCareers\nCommunity Development\nEconomic Education\nEvents\nInside the Economy Museum\nNewsroom\nOn the Economy Blog\nOpen Vault Blog\nOUR DISTRICT\nLittle Rock Branch\nLouisville Branch\nMemphis Branch\nAgricultural Finance Monitor\nHousing Market Conditions\nSELECTED PUBLICATIONS\nBridges\nEconomic Synopses\nHousing Market Perspectives\nIn the Balance\nPage One Economics\nThe Quarterly Debt Monitor\nReview\nRegional Economist\nST.

            "content": "Search Site\nHome > Newsroom >\n\nSt. Louis Fed's Bullard Discusses \"The Fed at a Crossroads\"\n3/4/2010\nST. CLOUD, Minn. — Fallout from the nancial turmoil of 2008 and 2009 has placed the\nFed at a crossroads on three dimensions, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said in\nremarks today at St. Cloud State University’s 48th annual Winter Institute. “First, the\npolitical independence of the Fed is at risk. Second, regulatory reform legislation\nthreatens to hamstring the Fed’s ability to respond to a future crisis. Third, the Fed\nadopted a near-zero interest rate policy and successfully carried out its stabilization\npolicy through quantitative easing,” he said.\nFed Independence at Risk\nIn his presentation, “The Fed at a Crossroads,” Bullard gave a brief history of the\nfounding of the Federal Reserve System and how its decentralized structure has\nprovided a strong checks-and-balances system against power being too concentrated\non Wall Street or in Washington, D.C.\nIn keeping with the fundamental principle that monetary policy should be at arm’s\nlength from the political process, the Federal Reserve System was designed with three\ndistinct but complementary parts: the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C.; a\nFederal Reserve Bank in New York City, long regarded as the nation’s nancial capital;\nand 11 regional Reserve banks to represent the voice of Main Street across the rest of\nthe country.\n“This regional structure was designed to keep some power out of New York and\nWashington,” Bullard said. “It allows for input on key policy questions from around the\nU.S.A. As a result, this system has been very successful.”\n“The current crisis has created a loud protest from the nation,” he added. “However, it\nwould be ironic indeed if the response to that protest were to further centralize power in\nNew York and Washington.”\nThe importance of maintaining the Fed’s independence from political in uence is\ncrucial to a stable economy, Bullard said, noting, “Politics ebbs and ows. If political\nshifts get translated into monetary policy, the result is more and unnecessary volatility\nin the U.S. economy.”\nHe warned, “In the U.S., erosion of Fed independence could result in a 1970s-style\nperiod of volatility. The consequences for the U.S. and the global economy would be\nlarge. No one would be served well by this outcome.”\nRegulatory Reform Threatens To Hamstring the Fed\n\n\fIn the aftermath of the nancial crisis, some proposals have called for diminished Fed\nregulatory authority. Instead, Bullard said, “The reform response should be to provide\nthe Fed with an appropriately broad regulatory authority so that the central bank is wellinformed about the entire nancial landscape.”\n“A future Fed, with an appropriately broad regulatory responsibility, provides the U.S.\nwith the best chance to head off a future crisis,” he added.\nPrior to the crisis of 2007, the Fed had primary regulatory authority for only about 12\npercent of total U.S. banks, he said. In addition, banks and thrifts represented only a\nfraction of the entire nancial landscape. “As the crisis began, 20 rms accounted for\nabout 80 percent of S&P 500 nancial sector assets in the U.S. About one-third of this\ntotal was in banks. About two-thirds of this total was non-bank nancial rms such as\ngovernment-sponsored enterprises (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac), investment banks,\ninsurance companies, and thrifts.”\n“Non-bank nancial rms turned out to be the most troublesome entities in this crisis,\nand the Fed had no supervisory authority over these entities,” he said. “The bottom line:\nThe Fed had a severely limited view of the nancial landscape as the crisis began.”\n“The Fed had primary regulatory authority for only some of the banks, and none of the\ntroublesome non-bank nancials,” he added. Yet, as the crisis unfolded, “All eyes turned\nto the Fed as the lender of last resort. This always happens in a crisis – only the central\nbank can play the lender-of-last-resort role.”\nMore recently, some suggestions for reform seek to remove the Fed from the\nsupervision of smaller banks, Bullard noted. “Existing regulation works well for the\nthousands of smaller banks in the U.S. Smaller banks did not cause the crisis and do\nnot need to be re-regulated.”\n“The Fed should remain involved with smaller bank regulation so that it has a view of\nthe entire nancial landscape and does not become biased toward the large, mostly\nNew York-based institutions,” he added. “One critical role of regulation is to provide a\nlevel, competitive playing eld for institutions of all sizes. Smaller banks tend to fund\nsmaller businesses, an important source of job growth for the economy.\nUnderstanding this process helps the Fed make sound monetary policy decisions.”\nMonetary Policy by Different Means: Successful Quantitative Easing\nBullard summarized the three components to the Fed’s current U.S. monetary policy\nthat have been used to alleviate the impact of the nancial crisis: the liquidity\nprograms (now mostly ended), a near-zero interest rate policy, and a quantitative easing\npolicy.\n“Policy rates were reduced to near zero across the Group of Seven in late 2008 and\nearly 2009,” he said, reiterating that the FOMC has said it will keep the federal funds\ntarget rate near zero for an extended period. “Any movement on the funds rate target is\ncontingent on both in ation and real economic developments.”\nCalling it “the new face of stabilization policy,” Bullard discussed the Fed’s successful\nimplementation of its more than $1.7 trillion asset purchase program, which is set to be\ncompleted by the end of this month. “The program has been regarded as successful in\nfurther easing monetary conditions after the zero bound was encountered,” he said.\nHe added, “The Fed is very capable of conducting stabilization policy when policy rates\nare near zero. The quantitative policy should be conducted in a manner analogous to\ninterest rate policy. This means adjusting the policy according to incoming information\non the economy.”\n\n\fHe further explained, “The asset purchases are being nanced by reserve creation, or\n‘printing money.’ The monetary base has expanded rapidly,” he said. “In contrast to the\nliquidity programs, the expansion of the monetary base associated with the asset\npurchase program is likely to be very persistent. This has created a medium-term\nin ation risk.”\n###\n\nGENERAL\nHome\nAbout Us\nBank Supervision\nCareers\nCommunity Development\nEconomic Education\nEvents\nInside the Economy Museum\nNewsroom\nOn the Economy Blog\nOpen Vault Blog\nOUR DISTRICT\nLittle Rock Branch\nLouisville Branch\nMemphis Branch\nAgricultural Finance Monitor\nHousing Market Conditions\nSELECTED PUBLICATIONS\nBridges\nEconomic Synopses\nHousing Market Perspectives\nIn the Balance\nPage One Economics\nThe Quarterly Debt Monitor\nReview\nRegional Economist\nST.

            "content": "Search Site\nHome > Newsroom >\n\nSt. Louis Fed's Bullard Addresses \"Containing Risk in the New\nGlobal Financial Landscape\"\n4/15/2010\nNEW YORK — In remarks today to the 19th Annual Hyman P. Minsky Conference, St.\nLouis Fed President James Bullard assessed the state of the regulatory reform\ndebate. In his presentation, “Containing Risk in the New Global Financial Landscape,”\nBullard said, “As the nation’s lender of last resort, the Fed will be at the center of\nmanaging any future nancial crisis and this argues for the Fed playing the lead role in\nthe new regulatory structure. A future Fed with an appropriately broad regulatory\nauthority provides the U.S. with the best chance of avoiding a future crisis.”\nHe also described how current regulatory reform proposals are not adequately\naddressing several key issues that could contribute to future nancial crises. “Only a\nfew of the current nancial reform proposals are likely to help prevent future crises,\nmost are not,” said Bullard. These issues include the susceptibility of non-bank nancial\nrms to “run-like” phenomena; the existence of large nancial rms worldwide that are\n“too big to fail;” the question of how any form of regulation could prevent an entire\nindustry from adopting the same strategies, and addressing government-sponsored\nenterprises (GSEs).\nBeyond Banking, Considering the Entire Financial Landscape\nBullard emphasized the critical need to consider the entire nancial landscape rather\nthan just the banking sector. “The crisis encompassed a far larger segment than just\ncommercial banking,” Bullard said. “Many non-bank nancial rms, outside the banking\nsector, were at the heart of the crisis. These rms were not regulated by the Fed.”\nHe added, “As the crisis started in the fall of 2007, 20 rms accounted for about 80\npercent of nancial sector assets in the U.S.” He noted that about one-third of this total\nwas comprised of bank holding companies, with two-thirds comprised of non-bank\nnancial entities such as the GSEs (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac), investment banks,\ninsurance companies, and thrifts.\n“The non-bank nancials are a ‘who’s-who’ of the most nettlesome entities during the\ncrisis,” he added. “All of these rms faced severe stress during the crisis, regardless of\nthe type of rm or the nature of regulation,” he said. “This is generally true globally as\nwell. All were taken in by the allure of securitized products in various ways.”\nBullard questioned whether current regulatory reform proposals would help prevent a\nsimilar scenario from happening again. “How can we prevent an entire industry from\n\n\fadopting the same strategy?” he asked. “I do not see this being addressed in current\nproposals.”\nThe View from the Fed\nBullard explained that the U.S. has a primary regulator system for the nation’s more\nthan 8,000 commercial banks and thrifts. “The primary regulator has the key authority\nfor the regulation of the bank,” he said. “Before the crisis (as of January 2007), the Fed\nhad primary regulatory responsibility for about 12 percent of the banks, or about 14\npercent by assets.”\nThe remaining 85 percent of banks and assets had non-Fed primary regulators, he\nnoted. Then, as the crisis unfolded, all eyes turned to the Fed as the lender of last\nresort. Due to its narrow regulatory authority, the Fed’s view of the nancial landscape\nwas limited coming into the crisis. “This made it harder to perform its lender-of-lastresort role,” Bullard said, “And, this led to a lot of ad hoc decision-making.”\nA Wall Street-Only Fed?\nBullard called for a strengthened central bank and cautioned against some current\nregulatory reform proposals that seek to create a “Wall Street-only” Fed. “The Fed\nshould remain involved with community bank regulation so that it has a view of the\nentire nancial landscape,” he said. “It is important that the Fed does not become\nbiased toward the very large, mostly New York-based institutions.”\nBullard explained that one critical role of regulation is to “provide a level, competitive\nplaying eld for institutions of all sizes. Community banks tend to fund smaller\nbusinesses, an important source of job growth for the economy. Understanding this\nprocess helps the Fed make sound monetary policy decisions.”\nHe added, “Regulation works well for the thousands of community banks in the\nU.S. The system features deposit insurance plus prudential regulation. The system\nallows failure—capitalism at work—but prevents bank runs and the associated\npanic. Community banks did not cause the crisis and do not need to be re-regulated.”\n“The central bank must be well-informed about the entire nancial landscape in order to\nhead off a future crisis. The reform response should be to provide the Fed with an\nappropriately broad regulatory authority,” Bullard concluded.\n###\nWith branches in Little Rock, Louisville and Memphis, the Federal Reserve Bank of St.\nLouis serves the Eighth Federal Reserve District, which includes all of Arkansas, eastern\nMissouri, southern Indiana, southern Illinois, western Kentucky, western Tennessee and\nnorthern Mississippi.

LOUIS — In remarks today to the Century Club at Washington University’s Olin\nBusiness School, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard discussed the strengthening\nU.S. economy and the need for regulatory reform that enhances the Fed’s regulatory\nauthority and its ability to remain independent from politics.\nIn his presentation, “Assessing the Strength of the U.S. Economic Recovery,” Bullard\npointed to a growing number of economic indicators showing improvement.\n“There are continued signs of recovery. GDP growth has been positive for three\nconsecutive quarters,” Bullard said. “Manufacturing has rebounded, and labor market\nconditions are slowly improving.”\nOne risk to the outlook, according to Bullard, is the fallout from potential sovereign debt\ndefault as conditions continue to deteriorate in Greece and other countries. He pointed\nto the rising costs of sovereign debt protection in Greece, as well as in Portugal, Spain\nand Italy.\nFinancial Regulatory Reform\nTurning to the current debate in Congress about U.S. nancial regulatory reform, Bullard\ncalled for the Federal Reserve to retain its supervisory role. “The Fed should continue to\nsupervise state member banks and bank holding companies of all sizes. Understanding\nthe entire nancial landscape helps the Fed make sound monetary policy decisions,”\nBullard said. He also explained how the Federal Reserve’s regional structure was\ndesigned to keep some power out of New York and Washington and allow for input on\nkey policy questions from around the U.S. “It is important that the Fed remain\nconnected with Main Street America, and not become biased toward the very large,\nmostly New York-based institutions,” he said.\nBullard added that current proposals for auditing monetary policy could diminish the\nindependence of the Fed. He noted that the Fed is already extensively audited and said,\n“erosion of Fed independence could result in a 1970s-style period of volatility. The\nconsequences for the U.S. and the global economy would be large. No one would be\nserved well by this outcome.”\n\n\fGENERAL\nHome\nAbout Us\nBank Supervision\nCareers\nCommunity Development\nEconomic Education\nEvents\nInside the Economy Museum\nNewsroom\nOn the Economy Blog\nOpen Vault Blog\nOUR DISTRICT\nLittle Rock Branch\nLouisville Branch\nMemphis Branch\nAgricultural Finance Monitor\nHousing Market Conditions\nSELECTED PUBLICATIONS\nBridges\nEconomic Synopses\nHousing Market Perspectives\nIn the Balance\nPage One Economics\nThe Quarterly Debt Monitor\nReview\nRegional Economist\nST.

He also repeated his call for regulatory reform that enhances the Fed’s\nregulatory authority and maintains its ability to remain at arm’s length from politics.\nThe State of the U.S. Economy\n“We are seeing continued signs of recovery for the U.S.,” Bullard said in his\npresentation, “The U.S. Economic Situation and Regulatory Reform.” In particular, he\nnoted that real gross domestic product has surpassed pre-crisis levels and is expected\nto reach its 2008 second quarter peak before the end of this year.\n“Real consumption of nondurables and services held steady during the recession and\nhas increased,” Bullard said. “While real investment had declined more than 30 percent\nat one point during the recession, it is now improving.” He added, “We have had ve\npositive employment reports in the past six months, which is evidence that labor\nmarket conditions are slowly improving,” and noted that he expects this trend to\ncontinue going forward through the spring and summer. Bullard also said the U.S. has\nled G-7 economies in productivity improvements since 2007, and that “U.S. monetary\npolicy remains extremely accommodative.”\nOne risk to the outlook is the sovereign debt crisis in Greece, Bullard said. “The crisis in\nGreece has escalated and spread, leading to volatility in world markets,” Bullard\nexplained. “This is causing a ight to safety, depressing U.S. Treasury yields.”\nHe added, “Some of this ight to safety reversed after the announcement of major\ninitiatives by EU governments over the weekend,” and although LIBOR-OIS spreads — a\nmeasure of market stress — have increased during the recent weeks, they are “nowhere\nnear 2008-2009 peaks.”\nBullard also noted that the debt burdens of U.S. states are an order of magnitude lower\nthan typical European sovereign debt burdens.\nTennessee’s Economy\nTurning to Tennessee, Bullard addressed the state’s economic situation.\n“Like nearly all states, Tennessee’s state government is facing a budget crisis in 2010,\nwhich will be more challenging than it was in 2009,” Bullard said, noting that in 2009,\n\n\fTennessee’s total tax revenue was nearly 9 percent lower than in 2007, the year before\nthe recession began.\nBullard noted that in percentage terms, Tennessee’s job losses during the recession\nhave been higher that the U.S. as a whole. “At the beginning of the recession,\nTennessee’s unemployment rate was higher than that of the U.S., and it also rose by\nmore during the recession, reaching nearly 11 percent last summer,” Bullard said. “It has\nsince begun to drift down along with the U.S. unemployment rate.”\nOn the foreclosure front, Bullard said, “The foreclosure wave for the U.S. peaked\nthrough 2009 and began to fall by the end of the year. At its peak, the U.S. foreclosure\nrate was about 3.5 times its 2005 level. Tennessee’s foreclosure rate rose more steadily\nand less sharply and ended 2009 a bit below its high of about 1 percent.”\nFinancial Regulatory Reform\nAs the debate continues in Congress over nancial regulatory reform, Bullard said that\nunder the current system, “Regulation works well for the thousands of community\nbanks in the U.S. This system features deposit insurance plus prudential regulation, and\nalso allows failure — capitalism at work — but prevents bank runs and the associated\npanic.”\nIn addition, Bullard noted, some reform proposals would have created a “Wall Streetonly” Fed.\n“The Fed should remain involved with community bank regulation so that it has a view\nof the entire nancial landscape,” Bullard explained. “It is important that the Fed does\nnot become biased toward the very large, mostly New York-based institutions.”\nHe further explained, “Community banks tend to fund smaller businesses, an important\nsource of job growth for the economy. Understanding the entire nancial landscape\nhelps the Fed make sound monetary policy decisions.”\n“The Federal Reserve’s regional structure was designed to keep some power out of New\nYork and Washington and allow for input on key policy questions from around the U.S.,”\nhe said. “Some proposals for auditing monetary policy would have diminished the\nindependence of the Fed. Allowing short-term politics to mix too closely with monetary\npolicy leads to poor economic outcomes. The consequences for the U.S. and the global\neconomy would be large. No one would be served well by this outcome.”\n\nGENERAL\nHome\nAbout Us\nBank Supervision\nCareers\nCommunity Development\nEconomic Education\nEvents\nInside the Economy Museum\nNewsroom\nOn the Economy Blog\nOpen Vault Blog\nOUR DISTRICT\n\n\fLittle Rock Branch\nLouisville Branch\nMemphis Branch\nAgricultural Finance Monitor\nHousing Market Conditions\nSELECTED PUBLICATIONS\nBridges\nEconomic Synopses\nHousing Market Perspectives\nIn the Balance\nPage One Economics\nThe Quarterly Debt Monitor\nReview\nRegional Economist\nST.

Williams, Special Research Assistant to the\nPresident, provided assistance. I take full responsibility for\nerrors. The views expressed are mine and do not\nnecessarily re ect o cial positions of the Federal Reserve\nSystem.\n\nIt is a great pleasure to be here today to speak to you on\nthe state of the global economy and the policy challenges\nfaced by the Federal Open Market Committee and other\ncentral banks worldwide. I think we can all agree that these\nare di cult times for macroeconomic policymakers. I\nintend to outline some of my main thoughts on the present\nsituation as well as what may be some of the key topics in\nthe policy discussion going forward. Hopefully my\ncomments will set up a vigorous question and answer\nsession.\nAs usual, the remarks I make here today represent my own\nviews and do not necessarily re ect the views of other\nFOMC members.\nMy comments are divided into two parts. In the rst, I\ndiscuss the status of the global macroeconomic recovery\nfrom the very severe shock suffered during the second half\nof 2008. That recovery generally remains on track, but has\nrecently been called into question because of events in\nEurope. I will give several reasons why one might hope that\nthe volatility in Europe does not constitute a\nmacroeconomic shock severe enough to derail the global\nrecovery.\nIn the second part of the talk, I turn to the possibility that a\nnew, more volatile macroeconomic era is upon us. I will\nsuggest that just such an era may be unfolding, for two\nreasons. One is that governments have now taken\n\nJames Bullard\nPresident and Chief\nExecutive O cer\nBio\nCurriculum Vitae\nStaff Contacts\nIDEAS/RePEc Pro le\nPhotos\nVideos\nSubscribe:\nEmail alerts\nRSS\n\"Rationally, let it be said in a\nwhisper, experience is certainly\nworth more than theory.\"\nAmerigo Vespucci\n\n\fnumerous unprecedented actions, and so it will take time\nto transition back toward the types of credible, rules-based\npolicies we know will deliver higher quality macroeconomic\noutcomes in the long run. The other is that there are clear\nlimits to what can be accomplished through regulatory\nreform. These two factors combine to suggest that\nmacroeconomic volatility may be higher in the next few\nyears, as compared with the \"Great Moderation\" years from\nabout 1984 to 2007.\nLet's get started by turning to the state of the economic\nrecovery in the U.S. and globally.\nGlobal Recovery\nIn the U.S., the recession likely ended in the summer of\n2009, although the actual end may not be announced by\nthe NBER dating committee for some time. Growth in real\nGDP is expected to continue through the current quarter,\nmaking for a full year of growth in national income. If\ncurrent consensus private sector forecasts are realized,\nin ation-adjusted national income will surpass its 2008\npeak later this year.\nGlobal growth has returned as well. According to the April\n2010 IMF World Outlook, 2009 was a year in which global\nreal GDP actually contracted. That is something that did\nnot occur in the 1970s, the 1980s, the 1990s, or any year in\nthe current decade before 2009. I had major concerns\nabout the whole global economy being in recession at the\nsame time. Yet, today, global growth is projected to return\nin 2010, at 4.2%, and continue in 2011, at 4.3%.\nIn all, the economic situation in the US and globally is not\nvery different from median forecasts made at the depth of\nthe recession in late 2008 and early 2009. Since that time\nthere have been several moments when it may have\nappeared that the global economic recovery would be\nderailed, but, as it turned out, the recovery has remained on\ntrack so far.\nBut now a new threat to global recovery is looming in the\nform of a sovereign debt crisis in Europe. In part as a\nresponse to the global recession, countries have now\nmoved to larger levels of de cit spending and have\naccumulated higher levels of debt. The ability and\nwillingness of some countries to repay has been called into\nquestion.\nThere are several reasons why this new threat to global\nrecovery will probably fall short of becoming a worldwide\nrecessionary shock.\nTo begin with, this is a question of sovereign debt, and\nsovereign debt crises have been with us for many, many\nyears. There is nothing intrinsic about such crises that they\nneed to become important shocks to the broader, global\nmacroeconomy. Countries do default or restructure their\ndebt from time to time, and the world goes on. To be sure,\n\n\fsuch an outcome is stressful both for the borrowing\ncountry and for the holders of the sovereign debt and can\nlead to substantial volatility in global nancial markets.\nOne example would be the Russian default in 1998. Still, in\nmost cases there is little reason to think that such events\nby themselves have the power to trigger global recessions.\nOf course, it is always possible that \"this time will be\ndifferent\" and maybe it will be, but that would be unusual\ngiven the historical evidence.\nMany have noted that the European sovereign debt crisis is\noccurring against the backdrop of a weakened nancial\nsystem in Europe and the US, and that to the extent the\nholders of troubled debt are these very same weakened\nrms, there may be some prospect for contagion to\nreignite the type of nancial shock last seen in the fall of\n2008. While this is certainly possible, I do not think this is a\nlikely scenario. If we consider CDS prices for major US and\nEuropean banks, we see that they have moved sharply\nhigher in recent weeks, but not to the extreme levels seen\nduring parts of late 2008 and the rst half of 2009.\nWhy should this be the case? I think government\nguarantees are playing a major role here. Governments\nhave made it very clear over the course of the last two\nyears that they will not allow major nancial institutions to\nfail outright at this juncture. Because these too-big-to-fail\nguarantees are in place, the contagion effects are much\nless likely to occur. \"Too big to fail\" is a controversial policy,\nbut it does have its upside in the current situation.\nLet me also stress that the current agreement in Europe\ndoes buy substantial time for European governments to\nenact scal retrenchment programs. It will take time for\nthose programs to be enacted and to gain credibility with\nnancial markets. This is a process that will probably play\nout over years, not weeks. Certainly, governments have to\nact now to gain credibility with markets in the near term,\nbut continuing vigilance is then also needed to keep the\nconsolidation moving. If scal consolidation does not\nwork, then debt restructuring may become the only\nalternative, but, if necessary, that can be accomplished in\nan orderly way over time and with minimal damage to\nglobal markets. Even in an extreme case, I do not see any\nnecessary impediments to the successful operation of a\ncommon currency.\nThe U.S. may actually be an unwitting bene ciary of the\ncrisis in Europe, much as it was during the Asian currency\ncrisis of the late 1990s. This is because of the ight to\nsafety effect that pushes yields lower in the U.S. Of course\nthe U.S. also has its own scal problems that must be\ndirectly addressed in a timely manner if the nation is to\nmaintain credibility in international nancial markets.\nLet me now leave the details of the current crisis to talk\nmore broadly about macroeconomic volatility.\n\n\fThe Return of Volatility\nA large part of successful macroeconomic policy is clear\ndelineation of how the government will act in various\nstates of the world. This means that the government\nimplements a stable, rules-based policy that is well\nunderstood by the private sector. Policies that have this\ncharacter are known, in both theory and reality, to produce\nthe highest quality macroeconomic outcomes.\nIn the last two years, governments and central banks in the\nUS and in Europe have, of necessity, taken actions that\nwould previously have been considered extremely unlikely.\nMarkets and private-sector actors have been surprised,\neven if they have also agreed that some or most of the\nactions were necessary. In my view, this nontraditional\npolicy has eroded some of the credibility for stable, rulesbased policy that had been built up over the last 25 years.\nClearly, this erosion was unintended, because actions were\ntaken in response to crisis; still the effect has been to make\nthe private sector keenly aware of the possibility that\ngovernments may make very aggressive and unusual\npolicy moves. Exactly how governments will behave going\nforward is a question loaded with uncertainty in the\naftermath of this crisis.\nSo, re-establishing credibility for the type of successful\nrules-based policy we were previously accustomed to will\nbe a key challenge over the next several years. We know\nthat it can take a long time to establish credibility. We also\nknow that credible policies are more effective. While the\ncrisis remains fresh, it may not be possible to attain rstbest, full-commitment outcomes for the macroeconomy.\nInstead, policies may for a time be less effective than\notherwise and private-sector actors may remain overly\nsensitive to the prospect of unusual, aggressive policy\nactions. This means that macroeconomic volatility may be\nhigher than normal for a period of time.\nThe now-concluding regulatory reform debate in the US\nalso suggests that the economic environment may remain\nmore volatile. The debate has shown that while some\nissues can be addressed legislatively, many problems\ncannot be addressed effectively either because of political\nconstraints or, more likely, because it is simply not that\nclear which changes in current law might support the best\neconomic outcomes. This suggests that some of the\nproblems we have faced over the last three years will\nsimply remain with us, and so will the volatility that was\nassociated with those problems.\nOne example is the issue of runs on non-bank nancial\nrms. Non-bank nancial rms accounted for about 2/3 of\nthe top 80 percent of the assets in the S&P Financials for\nthe U.S. in late 2007. These were names such as Lehman\nBrothers, Merrill Lynch, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Hartford\nInsurance, American International Group, as well as thrifts\nlike Washington Mutual and Countrywide. This list provides\n\n\fa simple who's-who of the nancial crisis in the U.S. It was\nall part of the shadow banking sector, a less regulated set\nof nancial rms.\nIt is a hallmark of the crisis in the US that these rms\nturned out to be susceptible to run-like phenomena. We\nknow what to do about bank runs—institute deposit\ninsurance plus prudential regulation. There is no palatable\nanalog for runs on non-bank nancial rms. Additional\ncapital requirements do not solve this problem. Since this\nproblem is central to the nancial crisis, and since we do\nnot have a good solution at hand, I expect the problem of\nruns on non-bank nancial rms to remain part of the\nmacroeconomic landscape for the foreseeable future.\nIn summary, then, there are two reasons to think that the\nnext few years may be more volatile than they would\notherwise be. One is that it is harder to run a fully credible\npolicy in the current environment, where governments have\njust taken many unprecedented actions in response to\ncrisis conditions. And another is that there are clear limits\nto available legislative remedies, so that we will be left to\nfend with some of the problems of the crisis going forward.\nConclusion\nI hope these remarks today are enough to generate some\ninteresting discussion. I really appreciate the opportunity to\nbe here and to interact with this exceptional group. While\nthese are challenging times for macroeconomists, I think\nwe are also learning a great deal about how the global\nmacroeconomy works and about policies that may be\nhelpful going forward.

He noted that a new, more volatile macroeconomic era\nmay be emerging in the aftermath of unprecedented government actions taken to\nameliorate the nancial crisis worldwide. On U.S. regulatory reform, Bullard said\nimportant problems will remain unresolved by the proposed legislation.\nThe Global Recovery\n“In the U.S. and globally, the recovery remains on track,” Bullard said in his presentation,\n“Policy Challenges for Central Banks in the Aftermath of the Crisis.” In the U.S., he\nnoted, real GDP is expected to reach its second quarter 2008 peak before year-end.\nGlobally, growth is projected to return in 2010 and continue in 2011, Bullard said. While\nthe current sovereign debt crisis in Europe has raised concerns of nancial market\ncontagion, “There are several reasons why this new threat to global recovery will\nprobably fall short of becoming a worldwide recessionary shock,” Bullard explained.\nHe noted, “Governments have made it very clear over the course of the last two years\nthat they will not allow major nancial institutions to fail outright at this\njuncture. Because these too-big-to-fail guarantees are in place, the contagion effects\nare much less likely to occur.”\nA More Volatile Macroeconomic Era\n“A large part of successful macroeconomic policy is clear delineation of how the\ngovernment will act in various states of the world,” Bullard explained. “During the\nnancial panic of 2008 and 2009, and again today, governments have been forced to\ntake unprecedented actions. While these policy moves were necessary, they have\neroded the credibility for stable rules-based policy built up over the last 25 years.”\nBullard added, “We know that credibility is often established only over a long period of\ntime. One key problem going forward will be how to re-establish credibility for\nmacroeconomic policy. Credible policies are more effective, but may not be possible in\nthe near term. Medium-term policy choices will have to take this into account.”\nThe limitations of current regulatory reform measures now being concluded in the U.S.\ncould also contribute to the volatile economic environment going forward, Bullard said.\n\n\f“There are clear limits to what U.S. regulatory reform is likely to accomplish,” he\nexplained. “Important problems will remain unresolved by the legislation.” As an\nexample, he cited how the reform package does not fully address the non-bank\nnancial rms, also known as the shadow banking sector, which played a huge role in\nthe crisis.\nHe added, “It is a hallmark of the crisis in the U.S. that these rms turned out to be\nsusceptible to run-like phenomena. We know what to do about bank runs—institute\ndeposit insurance plus prudential regulation. There is no palatable analog for runs on\nnon-bank nancial rms. Additional capital requirements do not solve this\nproblem. Since this problem is central to the nancial crisis, and since we do not have a\ngood solution at hand, I expect the problem of runs on non-bank nancial rms to\nremain part of the macroeconomic landscape for the foreseeable future.”\n“New regulations need to take a view of the entire nancial landscape – otherwise,\nmany activities are forced into less regulated entities,” he said. “Pending legislation\ndoes not appear to be su ciently broad in concept to address this concern.”\nMonetary Policy Challenges\nBullard concluded with a look at the current challenges facing policymakers with rates\nremaining near zero in the U.S. and other G-7 countries. “The policy to keep rates near\nzero for an extended period can in uence real activity at the zero lower bound,\naccording to modern monetary theories,” Bullard explained. “The effects depend on the\ncredibility of the promise.”\nHe said this policy does carry the risk that “markets may confuse the policy with the\n‘interest rate peg’ policy, in which rates do not adjust in response to shocks. In\nparticular, multiple equilibria or ‘bubbles’ are possible.”\nBullard noted that the Fed’s near-zero interest rate policy had been supplemented with\nan aggressive quantitative easing policy that has generally been regarded as\neffective. He noted, however, that removing this policy without creating an in ationary\nimpact will depend on perceptions on how and when it will be removed. “In theory, any\ncredible commitment to remove the policy in nite time will work well. In practice,\nmarkets may well lose faith sooner than that.”\n\nGENERAL\nHome\nAbout Us\nBank Supervision\nCareers\nCommunity Development\nEconomic Education\nEvents\nInside the Economy Museum\nNewsroom\nOn the Economy Blog\nOpen Vault Blog\nOUR DISTRICT\nLittle Rock Branch\n\n\fLouisville Branch\nMemphis Branch\nAgricultural Finance Monitor\nHousing Market Conditions\nSELECTED PUBLICATIONS\nBridges\nEconomic Synopses\nHousing Market Perspectives\nIn the Balance\nPage One Economics\nThe Quarterly Debt Monitor\nReview\nRegional Economist\nST.

            "content": "The Global Recovery and Monetary Policy\nJames Bullard 1\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nThe Institute of Regulation and Risk North Asia\nThe Grand Ballroom, Conrad Hotel, Pacific Place, Hong Kong\nJune 15, 2010\n\nI appreciate the opportunity to talk here tonight concerning the economic challenges facing the\nglobal economy. My opening remarks for this panel are intended to be broad-based, covering a\nwide range of issues. Still, I will not be able to cover all topics and so I hope that we can have a\nvigorous question and answer session later, in which I will have a chance to address additional\nconcerns about the status of the global economic recovery generally and U.S. monetary policy\nin particular.\nAs usual, the remarks I make here tonight represent my own views and do not necessarily\nreflect the views of other FOMC participants.\nMy remarks are divided into three parts. First I will comment on the strength of the global\neconomy. Asia has been a leader in the worldwide recovery following the very large global\nshock of late 2008, and I expect that leadership to continue during the remainder of 2010 and\ninto 2011 and beyond. Next, I will turn to the U.S. economy, which is also growing, although\nnot as strongly as some parts of Asia. My expectation is that growth in the U.S. is likely to\ncontinue at the current pace, or perhaps slightly faster, during the remainder of 2010 and into\n2011. Finally, I will turn to the ongoing sovereign debt turmoil in Europe and try to assess a few\nof the implications for the global economy. My sense is that, while the sovereign debt crisis in\nEurope is indeed a serious matter, the global recovery at this point looks very strong and seems\nunlikely to be derailed.\nLet me turn first to the strength of the global recovery.\n\nTHE STRENGTH OF THE GLOBAL RECOVERY\nAccording to the April 2010 International Monetary Fund World Outlook, 2009 was a year in\nwhich global real GDP actually contracted. That is very rare indeed, something that did not\noccur in any year in the 1970s, the 1980s, the 1990s, or in the current decade before 2009.\n1\n\nI appreciate assistance and comments provided by my colleagues at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.\nMarcela M. Williams, Special Research Assistant to the President, provided assistance. I take full responsibility for\nerrors. The views expressed are mine and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve\nSystem. Similar remarks were given at the InterContinental Hotel, Tokyo Bay, Japan “An Evening Dialogue with Dr.\nJames Bullard,” organized by the Institute of Regulation and Risk North Asia\n\n1\n\n\fThat is to say, despite all of the crises and upheavals of various types that occurred during the\npast four decades—the story has nevertheless been one of sustained growth globally up until\n2009. This shows how severe the global financial panic of 2008 really was, and it also suggests\nthat global integration is much stronger than it may have appeared several years ago. I was\nvery concerned that we had encountered the first truly global recession in many years, and that\nwe knew little about how the global economy might behave in such a circumstance.\nAs it has turned out, however, the global economy is now in the middle of a powerful recovery\nled by Asia. The IMF projects global growth will return in 2010 and continue into 2011. They\nforecast that world output will grow at a rate of 4.2 percent in 2010 and 4.3 percent in 2011.\nThat growth is not evenly distributed, to be sure, but should it materialize it will be a great\nimprovement over 2009.\nWith Asia as a leader in the global recovery, a risk is that the Asian economies might falter in\nsome way, causing global growth to slow appreciably. Certainly, many Asian equity price\nindexes have declined substantially over the past two months, including those in China, possibly\npointing to bleaker days ahead. But I would council caution in interpreting the volatile equity\nprice data, as these markets are prone to overreaction and exaggeration. Still, one might worry\nthat some type of “bubble” has formed in the Chinese economy in particular and that a\ndisorderly unraveling of that situation might somehow derail the Asian-led global recovery.\nWhile I am sympathetic to the possibility of “bubble” phenomena in macroeconomics generally\nspeaking, I do not think that we should interpret China in this light at the current juncture. The\nmore sensible interpretation of China is the one that has held sway for many years: It is a\nrapidly developing economy that is importing available production technology from the rest of\nthe world, and creating its own as well, in a manner that leads to substantial gains in\nproductivity, national income, and the national standard of living. Viewed this way, China has\nin the past year simply returned to its rapid growth path and is likely to remain on that path for\na considerable period of time. Is every price in China exactly the one that would be associated\nwith fundamentals in a country with perfectly functioning, perfectly free markets? Probably\nnot. But still, the big picture is that rapid Chinese growth can easily be reconciled with the\nfundamentals, and so the risk of a sudden slowdown in China derailing the global recovery,\nwhile certainly not zero, seems limited.\nLet me now turn to the U.S. economic outlook.\n\nTHE U.S. ECONOMY\nThe macroeconomic recovery in the U.S. remains on track and may be complete in the third\nquarter. U.S. real GDP peaked in the second quarter of 2008. As of the first quarter of 2010,\nreal GDP stands just shy of the 2008 second quarter level, so that growth of about 1.25 percent\nwould be sufficient to allow real GDP to surpass the previous peak. At that point, the U.S.\neconomy would be fully “recovered” from the very sharp downturn of late 2008 and early 2009.\n2\n\n\fTo be clear, the 1.25 percent is a quarterly number, and would be 5.0 percent at an annual rate.\nAlthough I think that 5.0 percent at an annual rate is too much to expect for current quarter\nreal GDP growth, it seems like a reasonable possibility over the next two quarters combined.\nGiven these conditions, I expect the U.S. recovery in GDP to be complete in the third quarter of\nthis year.\nIndeed, U.S. real personal consumption expenditure has already surpassed its previous peak,\nwhich occurred in the fourth quarter of 2007. Real investment has not fully recovered to its\npre-recession peak, but has been improving.\nThe near-recovery in U.S. output has so far not been matched by a similar recovery in U.S.\nemployment. Measures of labor input to production remain far below their peak levels.\nSignificant job gains have occurred during the past several months, but generally speaking the\nincreased level of production in the past year has come through productivity gains, not through\nemployment gains. While productivity gains are welcome, firms will most likely have to hire\nworkers during the remainder of 2010 to keep up with increasing demand.\nLike Asia, the U.S. has experienced an increase in financial market stress during the past two\nmonths, mostly in response to events in Europe. U.S. equity prices have declined substantially.\nThe VIX index, a measure of volatility, is well above its average value over the past two decades.\nThe St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank financial stress index, which had declined more or less\ncontinuously since early 2009, has now turned around and moved sharply higher. At this point,\nI think these movements reflect more worry than reality about the prospects for a slowdown in\nglobal growth. Still, the European sovereign debt situation is serious and there are many\nunanswered questions about how events will unfold.\nThe crisis has produced at least two advantages for the U.S. in the near term. Much as it did\nduring the Asian currency crisis of the late 1990s, the U.S. is benefitting from a flight to safety\neffect in world financial markets, which has driven down U.S. Treasury yields. From a peak yield\nof about 4.0 percent in early April for 10-year Treasury securities, the market has moved below\na 3.2 percent yield on some recent trading days. To the extent this type of movement is\nsustained, it affects all trading in U.S. financial markets and acts like an aggressive and\nsuccessful monetary policy action. If the situation in Europe continues to spark market\nvolatility, the flight to quality will sustain lower yields in the U.S. than would otherwise be the\ncase. The turmoil has also sent commodity prices lower, which, overall, tends to help the U.S.\neconomy.\nThe U.S. dollar has of course strengthened against the Euro during the crisis. On a TWEX basis,\nhowever, the dollar is about where it was one year ago.\n\n3\n\n\fTHE EUROPEAN DEBT CRISIS\nThe key concern in world financial markets has been the extent to which the sovereign debt\ncrisis in Europe portends a global shock, possibly strong enough to upset the picture of global\nrecovery I have been sketching.\nThere is no question that, in part as a response to the events of 2008 and 2009, many\ngovernments in Europe and elsewhere elected to increase deficit spending and thus to increase\ntheir debt as a percentage of GDP. For some countries, starting from weak economic\nconditions, the increase in borrowing was so large as to call into question their ability and\nwillingness to repay in international financial markets. Confidence lost in such markets is\ndifficult to regain, and for this reason I think we can expect market concerns to remain for\nmonths, possibly years, rather than just days or weeks. Governments must take aggressive\naction to earn credibility, and then sustain that effort over a long period of time. I think that a\nwell-run fiscal consolidation can be a net plus for economic growth, as it was in the U.S. during\nthe 1990s.\nTo be sure, sovereign debt crises are not at all unusual in the history of the global economy.\nNations often have incentives to borrow internationally and are not always willing to repay.\nWhile sovereign debt restructuring or outright default is often associated with substantial\nmarket volatility—understandably, since some parties are not getting repaid—the events are\nnot normally global recession triggers. A relatively recent and prominent example was the\nRussian default of 1998.\nThe agreement in Europe to provide funding if necessary through an SPV backed by\ngovernment guarantees and through the IMF has provided time for the affected countries to\nenact fiscal retrenchment programs. Those programs have a good chance of success because\nthe incentive for countries to keep unfettered access to international financial markets is\nsubstantial. Even if a fiscal consolidation program does not go well in a particular country, so\nthat a restructuring of debt has to be attempted at some point in the future, restructuring is\nnot unusual in global financial markets and can be accomplished without significant disruptions.\nOne of the persistent worries during this crisis has been that some of the largest financial\ninstitutions in the U.S. and Europe might be exposed to additional losses and that a type of\nfinancial contagion could occur should conditions worsen. I think this is a misreading of the\nevents of the past two years. U.S. and European policymakers have essentially guaranteed the\nlargest financial institutions. This has been the essence of the very controversial “too big to\nfail” policy. The policy has clear problems, including its inherent unfairness and the fact that\neconomic incentives for institutions that are guaranteed can be badly distorted. But to argue\nthat governments would now give up these guarantees in the face of a new shock that could\nthreaten the global economy seems to me to be far-fetched.\nOne important lesson from the European sovereign debt crisis, well-known in emerging\nmarkets, is that borrowing on international markets is a delicate matter. There can be benefits\n4\n\n\fof such borrowing in some circumstances, but too much can erode credibility and lead to a\ncrisis in the borrowing country. In short, countries cannot expect to borrow internationally and\nuse the proceeds to spend their way to prosperity.\nThe U.S. fiscal situation is difficult as well, with high deficits and a growing debt-to-GDP ratio.\nThe U.S. has exemplary credibility in international financial markets, built up over many years.\nNow that the U.S. economy is about to achieve recovery in GDP terms, it is time for fiscal\nconsolidation in the U.S. Irresponsibly high deficit and debt levels are not helping the U.S.\neconomy and could damage future prospects through a loss of credibility internationally. A\nsubstantial and credible fiscal adjustment could set up the U.S. for a sustained period of\ngrowth, as it did in the 1990s.\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn conclusion, I hope I have provided enough background in these remarks to set up an\ninteresting discussion. I will be happy to comment not only on the content here, but also on\nmany other issues that I was not able to address in these brief remarks. Thank you very much.\n\nREFERENCES\nInternational Monetary Fund. World Economic Outlook (WEO). Rebalancing Growth. April\n2010.\n\n5\n\n\f",

He noted that should economic developments suggest\nincreased disin ation risk, purchases of Treasury securities in excess of those required\nto keep the size of the balance sheet constant may be warranted.\nIn his presentation, “The State of the U.S. Economy and Monetary Policy,” given at a Fed\nExchange conference held in Rogers, Ark., Bullard said that core in ation is at low, but\nstill manageable levels, and that any additional quantitative easing undertaken by the\nFOMC should be a disciplined reaction to further disin ation risks. “Large, sudden\npurchases rarely are optimal,” he said. “ ‘Shock and awe’ is almost never a good way to\nproceed.”\n“Policy actions should be commensurate with the risks that the economy faces. A\nseries of smaller policy actions can add up to a large action, but only if incoming data\nsuggest that as the appropriate course,” he said. “Purchase size should be in proportion\nto the size of any deterioration in the outlook.” A key goal of the program should be to\nkeep core in ation in the U.S. from falling close to levels observed in Japan.\nBullard said that the European sovereign debt crisis has abated somewhat, but remains\na factor in the global economic mix.\n\nGENERAL\nHome\nAbout Us\nBank Supervision\nCareers\nCommunity Development\nEconomic Education\nEvents\nInside the Economy Museum\nNewsroom\n\n\fOn the Economy Blog\nOpen Vault Blog\nOUR DISTRICT\nLittle Rock Branch\nLouisville Branch\nMemphis Branch\nAgricultural Finance Monitor\nHousing Market Conditions\nSELECTED PUBLICATIONS\nBridges\nEconomic Synopses\nHousing Market Perspectives\nIn the Balance\nPage One Economics\nThe Quarterly Debt Monitor\nReview\nRegional Economist\nST.

            "content": "Search Site\nHome > Newsroom >\n\nSt. Louis Fed President Bullard Discusses \"QE2 in Five Easy Pieces\"\n11/8/2010\nNEW YORK CITY – In remarks Monday titled \"QE2 in Five Easy Pieces\" at a meeting of\nthe New York Society of Security Analysts, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard\ndiscussed his perspective on the most recent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)\npolicy decision to pursue additional quantitative easing.\nBullard said that while this policy carries both risks and rewards, he believes the\nbene ts outweigh the risks.\nThe FOMC announced it would purchase Treasury securities at a pace of about $75\nbillion per month through the rst half of 2011. The Committee will review the pace of\nits securities purchases and the overall size of the asset-purchase program on a regular\nbasis, in light of incoming information, adjusting the program as needed to best foster\nmaximum employment and price stability. Bullard outlined his view of this decision in\nve pieces:\n1. Economic Slowdown and Disin ationary Trend\nBullard said that the pace of recovery had slowed, creating a disin ationary trend.\nLabor markets continue to be weak and he expects they will lag the recovery, as has\nbeen the case in the past two recessions.\n2. Lessons from Japan\n“U.S. policy should strive to avoid the possibility of a Japanese-style de ation,” Bullard\nsaid.\nThe Japanese experience indicates that a near-zero nominal interest rate, mildly\nde ationary equilibrium exists and is di cult to escape. In his paper published earlier\nthis year, Bullard argued it may not be prudent to rely on low policy rates alone to keep\nthe U.S. out of the de ationary outcome; he recommended that current interest rate\npolicy be supplemented with additional quantitative easing.\n3. Monetary Policy Should Be Directed at Avoiding Further Disin ation\nBullard said the FOMC must defend its implicit in ation target from the low side as it\nwould from the high side. Since U.S. short-term interest rates are already\napproximately zero, further disin ation would mean rising real interest rates in the face\nof a slowing pace of recovery.\n4. Asset Purchases Can Substitute for Ordinary Monetary Policy\n\n\fWhile asset purchases are sometimes viewed as unconventional, the nancial market\neffects have been entirely conventional: real interest rates declined, in ation\nexpectations rose, the dollar depreciated, and equity prices rose. Bullard said that\nbecause asset purchases put downward pressure on nominal interest rates further out\nthe yield curve along with upward pressure on expected in ation, this policy puts\ndownward pressure on real interest rates.\n5. Maximum Effects on the Real Economy, While Di cult To Disentangle, Should Be\nConventional\nEasing of monetary policy produces its maximum impact on real variables in the\neconomy, including output, consumption, and investment, with a lag of six to 12 months\nand can be di cult to disentangle, as economic performance is in uenced by other\ndevelopments during this period. However, the real effects on the economy from this\npolicy action should be conventional as well.\nBullard also discussed some criticisms raised about QE2:\nOn the program’s lack of effectiveness, he said that the nancial market effects of\nthe program have been about what one would expect from an easing of monetary\npolicy.\nOn in ationary concerns, Bullard said that while this is a legitimate concern, the\n2010 disin ationary trend is worrisome right now. He emphasized that keeping\nin ation near the FOMC’s implicit in ation target is very important for maintaining\ncredibility.\nOn fears that the Fed is monetizing the debt, Bullard said the FOMC is committed\nto returning the Fed balance sheet to pre-crisis levels over time.\nIn addition, Bullard said it is imperative that the U.S. Congress and the President attack\nthe long-run budget problems the nation faces. He said that Europe has given the U.S.\nan important wake-up call on how devastating it can be to leave long-run structural\nde cit problems unaddressed.\nOnce the Fed balance sheet returns to its normal size, Bullard noted, the U.S. Treasury\nDepartment will be left with just as much debt held by the public as before the Fed took\nany of these actions.\n\nGENERAL\nHome\nAbout Us\nBank Supervision\nCareers\nCommunity Development\nEconomic Education\nEvents\nInside the Economy Museum\nNewsroom\nOn the Economy Blog\nOpen Vault Blog\nOUR DISTRICT\nLittle Rock Branch\n\n\fLouisville Branch\nMemphis Branch\nAgricultural Finance Monitor\nHousing Market Conditions\nSELECTED PUBLICATIONS\nBridges\nEconomic Synopses\nHousing Market Perspectives\nIn the Balance\nPage One Economics\nThe Quarterly Debt Monitor\nReview\nRegional Economist\nST.

Mortgage financing, in\nparticular, turned out to be an exceptionally weak link as the crisis unfolded.\nThe U.S. government has often modified the structure of housing finance after a crisis. For example, before\nthe Great Depression, a large fraction of mortgages was relatively short term (five-to-seven years). These\nloans were mostly non-amortizing balloon mortgages, with low loan-to-value ratios of 50-60 percent.\nThe intervention of the government changed those terms in favor of fixed-rate mortgages with longer\nmaturities (20-30 years) and higher loan-to-value ratios (80 percent and above). In 1938, Fannie Mae was\nestablished to create a secondary market to provide liquidity by buying primarily FHA-insured loans. In\n1968, Fannie Mae split into a private corporation (Fannie Mae) and a publicly-financed institution (Ginnie\nMae). To provide competition for the newly private Fannie Mae, Congress established Freddie Mac in\n1970.\nThe extent of Congressional meddling in this market has been astonishing to the point where one can\nbarely identify what the private sector outcomes would be in the absence of intervention.\nTo the extent possible, we need to let the private sector provide the bulk of U.S. housing finance going\nforward, without the incentive-distorting set of government programs and taxpayer guarantees that caused\nour current system to collapse. Those programs meant well, but ended up costing everyone dearly.\nIt makes little sense to try to design programs that subsidize everyone. If everyone is subsidized, then no\none is subsidized.\nWe should perceive the current situation as an opportunity to reform housing finance according to best\nprinciples and sound lending practices. The future of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will depend on the\nnature and structure of the new mortgage finance system.\n\n\fBullard/GSE Conference Opening Remarks | 2\nHere are a few principles that may be used to guide the reform process, and which may be discussed during\nthe conference today:\n•\n\nHousing affordability: To the extent possible, government subsidies to lower-income and first-time\nbuyers should be disentangled from housing finance more broadly defined. Subsidies should be\nregularly reviewed and subject to Congressional approval and appropriation of funds. These\nfunctions could be merged into the structure of the Department of Housing and Urban\nDevelopment along with the government mortgage programs of the FHA and Ginnie Mae.\n\n•\n\nMortgage loan origination: One of the rationales for the GSEs is to enhance the flow of credit to\nspecific sectors of the economy. A key question we need to ask is whether the private market will\nallocate credit more efficiently. In most developed countries, mortgage finance is provided by the\nprivate sector. Ideally, in a well-functioning private system, taxpayers can be sheltered so they are\nnot exposed to insolvency risk.\n\n•\n\nLeverage: Home equity is the best insurance against default. Loan-to-value ratios of 80 percent or\nbelow should be adequate to insure against most house price movements. Homeowners who\nchoose higher loan-to-value ratios could be required to purchase default insurance or to increase\nthe amortization component of their mortgage payments.\n\n•\n\nRecourse: Many European countries had housing booms and busts of a similar magnitude to the\none in the U.S., but they experienced a different pattern of default rates. For example, in Spain\nmortgage debt cannot be discharged in the event of default, and as a result, the default rate is\nmuch lower than in the United States. A possible reform of recourse regulation along European\nlines may improve the pattern of default in the U.S., which is currently regulated at the state level.\n\n•\n\nTransparency, risk, and insurance: The pooling of mortgages into mortgage-backed securities\ncould be constrained to pool loans with similar characteristics (i.e., $150,000 to $200,000 with a\nloan-to-value ratio of 80 percent). In order to avoid one-sided bets, financial intermediaries could\nbe required to purchase insurance or otherwise appropriately hedge their MBS portfolios.\n\nThe research presented at this Conference addresses these important issues and is thus particularly timely.\nThe range of issues we will study today ranges from the evaluation of the role of the GSEs in the expansion\nof the home ownership rate to their role in the purchase of subprime agency debt, as well as several\nproposals to reform their structure and regulation. The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis has long\nsupported fundamental research in economic policy. Our goal has long been to provide perspectives on\nwhether the policies adopted in the past still serve us well today, and on how recent developments at the\nfrontier of research can be applied to improve policy. That is what the St. Louis Fed has aimed to do for the\npast four decades.\nWith that in mind, I welcome the speakers who have agreed to share their insights with us today. I trust\nthat we will all learn quite a lot. Thank you for being here, and have a great conference.\n\nJames Bullard, President and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\n\n\f",

            "content": "Opening remarks by President James Bullard\n“The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau: The Direction and Implications”\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nNov. 29, 2010\nIt is my pleasure to welcome all of you to this panel discussion on the Consumer Financial Protection\nBureau.\nEvery aspect of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 generated\nheated debate, but the hottest debate of all surrounded the creation of the Consumer Financial\nProtection Bureau (the CFPB).\nIt was the choice of Congress to create the CFPB as an “independent bureau housed within the Federal\nReserve.”\nMany have been confused by the concept of an “independent bureau” at the Fed. The legislation states\nthat the CFPB is not to report to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, or to anyone\nelse within the Federal Reserve.\nThe Fed’s only engagement with this independent bureau is to fund it. The law requires that the\nequivalent of 10 percent of Federal Reserve System expenses be transferred to the CFPB in 2011, 11\npercent in 2012, and 12 percent in 2013 (where it will stay fixed in perpetuity).\nI am concerned about this method of funding for the Bureau. The amount of money allocated in the law\nis not based on any careful assessment of what the needs of the Bureau will be as it attempts to fulfill\nthe mandate of the Congress with regard to consumer protection. Nor is there any mechanism for\nchanging these amounts going forward, should market conditions change, or if the needs of the Bureau\nchange.\nThere is no question that the mission of the new Bureau is significant. The Bureau has been given\nresponsibility for writing consumer protection rules and regulations that apply to all banking institutions.\nIt is also required to examine all banks with $10 billion or more in total assets for compliance with these\nconsumer protection rules and regulations.\nAs of the third quarter of 2010, there were 82 insured depository institutions (banks, thrifts and credit\nunions) above this asset threshold. These institutions hold about 73 percent of the nation’s banking\nassets, but there are many other financial assets held outside the banking system.\n\n\fIn part because of this, the Bureau will be responsible for writing consumer protection rules and\nregulations that impact any entity offering a consumer financial product or service.\nTherefore, in addition to banks, the Bureau’s rule-writing authority will extend to institutions that have\nnot historically fallen under federal oversight. These institutions will include check cashers, payday\nlenders, money transmitters, pawn shops and other entities that are viewed as part of the “shadow”\nnetwork of consumer credit.\nFor the thousands of these “shadow” institutions, the Bureau is also charged with conducting\nexaminations and enforcing consumer protection regulations—presumably in close coordination with\nthe state regulatory agencies that have experience in regulating both depository and non-depository\ninstitutions.\nSetting up the Bureau and meeting its Congressional mandates is no small task.\nThe office must be up and running by July 21, 2011 — a substantial undertaking when you look at the\nscope of responsibilities of the Bureau, count the number of reports the Bureau must make to Congress\non an annual basis, and think about all of the competing interests that the Bureau will have to consider\nwhen crafting rules and regulations.\nIn addition, the Bureau is required to set up several functional offices, including a research unit, a\ncommunity affairs unit, a consumer complaints unit, a fair lending office, an office of financial education,\nan office for service member affairs, and an office of financial protection for older Americans.\nI am sure our panelists here today will help us better understand the CFPB. They offer important\nperspectives on what different organizations and constituencies are thinking and saying about the new\nBureau. And in particular, our panelists have important insights on the opportunities and the challenges\npresented by Dodd-Frank and specifically by the formation of the Bureau.\nI want to take this opportunity to thank our panelists in advance for their participation. I really\nappreciate their willingness to take part in this event.\nAgain, welcome, and I hope you enjoy the discussion!\n\nJames Bullard, President and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\n\n\f",

            "content": "Search Site\nHome > Newsroom >\n\nSt. Louis Fed's Bullard: The U.S. Economic Situation and Recent\nMonetary Policy Developments\n12/2/2010\nWASHINGTON, D.C. - In remarks Thursday at a meeting of the National Economists\nClub, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard discussed his perspective on the recent\nFederal Open Market Committee policy decision to pursue additional quantitative\neasing.\nIn his presentation, “The U.S. Economic Situation and Recent Monetary Policy\nDevelopments,” Bullard also addressed some of the risks and criticisms of the FOMC\npolicy decision. Bullard said that while this policy carries both risks and rewards, he\nbelieves the bene ts outweigh the risks.\nOn November 3, the FOMC announced it would purchase Treasury securities at a pace\nof about $75 billion per month through the rst half of 2011. The Committee will review\nthe pace of its securities purchases and the overall size of the asset-purchase program\non a regular basis, in light of incoming information, adjusting the program as needed to\nbest foster maximum employment and price stability.\nBullard stressed the importance of the program’s regular review clause. “When the\nFOMC targets interest rates, a typical move is 25 basis points, and forward guidance is\nlimited,” he said. “This allows the Committee to adjust the policy rate in response to a\nchanging outlook for the economy. The regular review clause allows the QE program to\nbe adjusted in response to incoming data in the same way.”\nBullard described his view of the FOMC decision in ve parts:\n1. Disin ationary Trend\nBullard said that while in ation was close to the implicit FOMC target during the rst\npart of the year, “during 2010, a clear disin ation trend developed.”\n2. Lessons from Japan\n“Japanese experience indicates that a near-zero nominal interest rate, mildly\nde ationary equilibrium exists and is di cult to escape,” Bullard said. “The Japanese\nexperience has generally been regarded as disappointing. U.S. policy should strive to\navoid this possibility.”\nIn his paper published earlier this year, Bullard argued it may not be prudent to rely on a\nnear-zero policy rate alone to keep the U.S. out of the de ationary outcome; he\nrecommended that current interest rate policy be supplemented with additional\nquantitative easing.\n\n\f3. Monetary Policy Should Be Directed at Avoiding a Japanese-style De ationary\nOutcome\nBullard outlined a policy strategy given the slower recovery and disin ationary trend\ncurrently faced by the U.S.\nFirst, he said the FOMC must avoid further disin ation. “Further disin ation with\nshort-term nominal interest rates at zero would mean rising real interest rates in\nthe face of a slowing pace of recovery,” Bullard said.\nSecond, the unintended steady state must be pre-empted. “It would be di cult to\nescape the low nominal interest rate, mildly de ationary equilibrium that Japan\nhas experienced,” Bullard said.\nThird, Bullard said the FOMC must defend its implicit in ation target from the low\nside, which helps maintain longer-run in ation expectations.\n4. Asset Purchases Can Substitute for Ordinary Monetary Policy\n“While asset purchases are sometimes viewed as unconventional,” Bullard said, “the\nnancial market effects have been entirely conventional: real interest rates declined,\nin ation expectations rose, the dollar depreciated, and equity prices rose.”\nBullard said that asset purchases of Treasury securities at longer maturities can\nsubstitute for ordinary monetary policy by putting downward pressure on nominal\ninterest rates further out the yield curve and upward pressure on expected in ation,\nthus, putting downward pressure on real interest rates.\n5. Maximum Effects on the Real Economy Should Also Be Conventional\nAn easing of monetary policy produces its maximum impact on real economic\nvariables, including output, consumption, and investment, six to 12 months after\nimplementation. As with interest-rate targeting policy, disentangling the real effects of\nquantitative easing from other in uences will be di cult, as economic performance will\nbe in uenced by other developments during this period. “Most likely,” Bullard said, “the\nreal effects will be just as conventional as the nancial market effects.”\nBullard also addressed some of the risks and criticisms raised about QE2:\nOn criticisms that the program may not be effective, Bullard said that the nancial\nmarket effects of the program have been about what one would expect from an\neasing of monetary policy.\nOn concerns that QE2 depreciates the dollar, Bullard noted that dollar\ndepreciation is a normal by-product of an easier monetary policy, provided all else\nis held constant in the rest of the world, and that the U.S. has long maintained an\nindependent monetary policy, a exible exchange rate, and open capital markets.\nHe stated that other countries need to have systems in place that can adjust to\nmodest changes in U.S. monetary policy.\nRegarding the rise in nominal interest rates, Bullard said that QE2 puts downward\npressure on nominal rates through securities purchases but that the effects of\nsuccessful policy would put upward pressure on nominal rates. Therefore, Bullard\nargued, looking at the level of nominal rates alone is insu cient to judge the\nsuccess of QE2.\nOn in ationary concerns, Bullard said that while too much in ation is a legitimate\nconcern, the 2010 disin ationary trend is worrisome right now. He emphasized\nthat keeping in ation near the implicit in ation target is very important for\nmaintaining the FOMC’s credibility.\nRegarding arguments for using a commodity money standard, Bullard stated that\nalthough this approach was widely discussed in previous decades when in ation\nwas high and variable, the volatility of commodity prices in recent years has made\nthis approach problematic. He argued that in ation targeting can be seen as the\n\n\fintellectual descendant of commodity money standards. “In ation targeting\nforces accountability for in ation outcomes onto the central bank,” he said.\nOn fears that the Fed is monetizing the debt, Bullard said the FOMC has often\nstated its intention to return the Fed balance sheet to pre-crisis levels over time.\nOnce the FOMC returns the Fed balance sheet to its normal size, Bullard noted,\nthe Treasury will be left with just as much debt held by the public as before the\nFed took any of these actions.\nOn claims that QE mitigates scal problems, Bullard argued that QE has no\nimpact on the longer-run U.S. scal outlook and that this outlook remains very\npoor no matter what the Fed does.\nBullard also highlighted the imperative need for the Congress and the President to\nattack the long-run budget problems the nation faces. He said that Europe has given\nthe U.S. an important wake-up call on how devastating it can be to leave long-run\nstructural de cit problems unaddressed.\n\nGENERAL\nHome\nAbout Us\nBank Supervision\nCareers\nCommunity Development\nEconomic Education\nEvents\nInside the Economy Museum\nNewsroom\nOn the Economy Blog\nOpen Vault Blog\nOUR DISTRICT\nLittle Rock Branch\nLouisville Branch\nMemphis Branch\nAgricultural Finance Monitor\nHousing Market Conditions\nSELECTED PUBLICATIONS\nBridges\nEconomic Synopses\nHousing Market Perspectives\nIn the Balance\nPage One Economics\nThe Quarterly Debt Monitor\nReview\nRegional Economist\nST.

He noted that the policy rate had been near zero for an “extended\nperiod” and that the Fed’s balance sheet was much larger than it had been before the\ncrisis. Regarding the motivation for QE2, Bullard noted last summer’s “disin ation and\ndeclining in ation expectations,” adding that the “Japanese experience with mild\nde ation and a near-zero nominal interest rate has been poor.” Given the near-zero\npolicy rate environment, Bullard said, “asset purchases can substitute for ordinary\n(interest-rate targeting) monetary policy.”\nBullard stated that the policy change had been largely priced into markets ahead of the\nNovember FOMC meeting, and the nancial market effects were conventional. “In\nparticular, real interest rates declined, in ation expectations rose, the dollar\ndepreciated, and equity prices rose,” he said. “These are the ‘classic’ nancial market\neffects one might observe when the Fed eases monetary policy in ordinary times.”\n“This experience shows that monetary policy can be eased aggressively even when the\npolicy rate is near zero,” Bullard said.\n\n\fBullard noted that the effects of monetary policy on the real economy lag from six to 12\nmonths. “Real effects are di cult to disentangle because other shocks hit the\neconomy in the meantime,” which, he added, is a standard problem in evaluating\nmonetary policy.\nThe Situation in 2011\nBullard stated that, relative to last summer, U.S. growth prospects improved by early\n2011. “Private sector forecasters and the FOMC all marked up their forecasts,” he said.\n“Anecdotal reports were more bullish,” showing “pro table businesses with\nconsiderable cash and an improving outlook.” He added, “An improving economy 18\nmonths post-recession is generally a strong positive.”\nNoting the improved economic outlook since QE2 was implemented, “the natural\ndebate is how and when the exit should begin,” Bullard said. “However, additional\nuncertainty has clouded this picture.”\n“In recent weeks, macroeconomic uncertainty has been on the rise from four key\nsources,” Bullard said. The four sources he discussed were:\n1. turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa and the associated uncertainty\npremium in oil prices;\n2. the natural disaster and the damaged nuclear reactors in Japan;\n3. the U.S. scal situation and the possibility of a government shutdown; and\n4. continued uncertainty regarding resolution of the European sovereign debt crisis.\nBullard pointed out that all four situations have the potential to escalate. If escalation\noccurs, he added, how and when to begin normalizing monetary policy would become\nless clear. “Still, the most likely prospect is that all four are resolved without becoming\nglobal macroeconomic shocks,” he said.\nNormalization of U.S. Monetary Policy\nBullard said that U.S. monetary policy cannot remain ultra-accommodative inde nitely.\n“The process of normalizing policy, even once it begins, will still leave unprecedented\npolicy accommodation on the table,” he stated. “The FOMC may not be willing or able\nto wait until all global uncertainties are resolved to begin normalizing policy.”\nBullard noted that normal monetary policy has two parts: “QE accommodation is\nremoved by returning the balance sheet to an ordinary size over time,” and “the policy\nrate begins to approach levels associated with moderate expansion.” Bullard said that\nnormalization will take time and added that it is the most di cult part of the business\ncycle for a central bank.\n“Exit strategy was widely discussed in 2010, and that debate will likely revive during\n2011,” Bullard said.\n\nGENERAL\nHome\nAbout Us\nBank Supervision\nCareers\nCommunity Development\nEconomic Education\nEvents\n\n\fInside the Economy Museum\nNewsroom\nOn the Economy Blog\nOpen Vault Blog\nOUR DISTRICT\nLittle Rock Branch\nLouisville Branch\nMemphis Branch\nAgricultural Finance Monitor\nHousing Market Conditions\nSELECTED PUBLICATIONS\nBridges\nEconomic Synopses\nHousing Market Perspectives\nIn the Balance\nPage One Economics\nThe Quarterly Debt Monitor\nReview\nRegional Economist\nST.

Regarding the motivation for QE2, Bullard noted last summer’s\n“disin ation and declining in ation expectations,” adding that the “Japanese experience\nwith mild de ation and a near-zero nominal interest rate has been poor.” Given the\nnear-zero policy rate environment, Bullard said, “asset purchases can substitute for\nordinary (interest-rate targeting) monetary policy.”\nBullard stated that the policy change had been largely priced into markets ahead of the\nNovember FOMC meeting and that the nancial market effects were conventional. “In\nparticular, real interest rates declined, in ation expectations rose, the dollar\ndepreciated, and equity prices rose,” he said. “These are the ‘classic’ nancial market\neffects one might observe when the Fed eases monetary policy in ordinary times.”\n\n\f“This experience shows that monetary policy can be eased aggressively even when the\npolicy rate is near zero,” Bullard said.\nHe noted that the effects of monetary policy on the real economy lag from six to 12\nmonths. “Real effects are di cult to disentangle because other shocks hit the\neconomy in the meantime,” which, he added, is a standard problem in evaluating\nmonetary policy.\nThe Situation in 2011\nBullard stated that, relative to last summer, U.S. growth prospects improved by early\n2011. “Private sector forecasters and the FOMC all marked up their forecasts,” he said.\n“Anecdotal reports were more bullish,” showing “pro table businesses with\nconsiderable cash and an improving outlook.” He added, “An improving economy 18\nmonths post-recession is generally a strong positive.”\nNoting the improved economic outlook since QE2 was implemented, “the natural\ndebate is how and when the exit should begin,” Bullard said. “However, additional\nuncertainty has clouded this picture.”\nBullard said, “In recent weeks, macroeconomic uncertainty has been on the rise from\nfour key sources.” He noted that “all four situations contain potential for escalation.” If\nescalation occurs, he added, how and when to begin normalizing monetary policy\nwould become less clear. “Still, the most likely prospect is that all four are resolved\nwithout becoming global macroeconomic shocks,” he said.\nBullard discussed a de-escalation scenario for each of the four situations:\nIf further increases in world oil prices remain limited, the uncertainty premium in\noil prices associated with turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa will decline.\nBullard said that oil “prices would have to continue to increase substantially to\nderail U.S. growth prospects signi cantly.”\nIf Japan contains the fallout at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, uncertainty\nregarding the natural disaster and the damaged nuclear reactors there will be\nreduced.\nIf the U.S. Congress funds the government through 2011 and makes some\nprogress on de cit reduction, uncertainty about the U.S. scal situation and the\npossibility of a government shutdown will be lessened.\nIf European governments approve a plan to address continuing sovereign debt\nconcerns, the continued uncertainty regarding resolution of the European\nsovereign debt crisis will be reduced.\nNormalization of U.S. Monetary Policy\nBullard said that U.S. monetary policy cannot remain extremely accommodative\ninde nitely. “Exit strategy was widely discussed in 2010, and that debate will likely\nrevive during 2011,” Bullard said.\n“The process of normalizing policy, even once it begins, will still leave unprecedented\npolicy accommodation on the table,” he stated. “The FOMC may not be willing or able\nto wait until all global uncertainties are resolved to begin normalizing policy.”\nBullard noted that normal monetary policy has two parts: “QE accommodation is\nremoved by returning the balance sheet to an ordinary size over time,” and “the policy\nrate begins to approach levels associated with moderate expansion.” Bullard said that\nnormalization will take time and added that it is the most di cult part of the business\ncycle for a central bank.\nBullard compared this normalization to previous tightening cycles. “Reversing QE\nthrough balance sheet normalization will put upward pressure on interest rates,” which,\n\n\fBullard noted, is a complication that was not present previously. “The Committee can\nsell assets as needed to begin tightening, without raising the policy rate.”\nBullard noted that the Fed pays interest on excess reserves (IOER), which also was not\npresent in previous tightening cycles. “With IOER, the policy rate could be increased\nwithout changing the size of the balance sheet.” As an alternative to paying interest on\nall those reserves, he said, “reserves can also be drained via term deposits and reverse\nrepos.”\nBullard then compared state-contingency in the previous two tightening cycles. “In\n1994, the Fed tightened policy unexpectedly and in uneven amounts,” and the nancial\nmarket effects were considered disorderly, he noted. Policy was then normalized, he\nsaid, and the economy boomed for the rest of the decade. “In 2004, the Fed tightened\npolicy in perfectly even amounts,” and he noted that although the nancial markets\neffects were considered orderly, the nancial crisis is sometimes blamed in part on this\nexcessively smooth approach.\nBullard said that the lessons of 1994 and 2004 will be instructive in developing the right\nexit strategy.\n\nGENERAL\nHome\nAbout Us\nBank Supervision\nCareers\nCommunity Development\nEconomic Education\nEvents\nInside the Economy Museum\nNewsroom\nOn the Economy Blog\nOpen Vault Blog\nOUR DISTRICT\nLittle Rock Branch\nLouisville Branch\nMemphis Branch\nAgricultural Finance Monitor\nHousing Market Conditions\nSELECTED PUBLICATIONS\nBridges\nEconomic Synopses\nHousing Market Perspectives\nIn the Balance\nPage One Economics\nThe Quarterly Debt Monitor\nReview\n\n\fRegional Economist\nST.

            "content": "Opening remarks by President James Bullard\nThe 2011 Homer Jones Memorial Lecture\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nApril 13, 2011\nWelcome to the 22nd annual Homer Jones Memorial Lecture.\nThis lecture is an annual event designed to honor the outstanding contributions of former\nSenior Vice President and Research Director of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Homer\nJones.\nThe lecture was initiated in the aftermath of Homer Jones’s death in 1986 and enjoys the longlasting support and co-sponsorship of many people and organizations, including the St. Louis\nGateway Chapter of the National Association for Business Economics, Saint Louis University,\nSouthern Illinois University at Edwardsville, the University of Missouri at St. Louis, and\nWashington University in St. Louis.\nHomer Jones is often described as Milton Friedman’s professor. Friedman attended Rutgers\nUniversity during the period when Homer Jones was a member of the economics faculty.\nAccording to legend, Homer cultivated Milton’s interest in economics, encouraging Milton’s\nenrollment in graduate school at Columbia University. The rest, as they say, is history—the two\nremained friends and colleagues for years afterward.\nHomer Jones later joined the staff here at the St. Louis Fed. He played a major role in the\nBank’s development as a leader in monetary research and statistics. It is difficult to overstate\nthe importance of this influence, which has extended well beyond his years of service at the St.\nLouis Fed and far beyond the confines of this building.\nAs one example, the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis is internationally known for its extensive\ndata collection and dissemination efforts. Housed under the name Federal Reserve Economic\nData, or FRED, these efforts have their genesis in Homer’s innovative efforts to publish\nmonetary data in a form that did not yet exist at the time. Today, through FRED, we make\nmore than 25,000 data series available and accessible to individuals and organizations\nworldwide.\n\n\fAnother Homer Jones legacy is the St. Louis Fed’s enduring commitment to rigorous,\nindependent economic research. Milton Friedman once wrote that Homer had a great belief in\nthe persuasive power of facts and an unusual patience in pressing his views. It was during\nHomer’s tenure—and, importantly, with the firm support of then-Bank President Darryl\nFrancis—that the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis became known for challenging conventional\nwisdom with rigorous analysis and stubborn facts. That maverick reputation has endured here\never since.\nThose of us in the Federal Reserve System who believe the ability to question and re-examine\nconventional wisdom leads to better policy owe a great debt to Homer Jones. The Fed’s ability\nto absorb and tolerate multiple viewpoints helps prevent groupthink and leads to superior\nmonetary policy and, ultimately, to better macroeconomic performance.\nIt is only fitting for us to use the Homer Jones Memorial Lecture to spotlight others who have\nmade a significant impact on monetary policy and central banking. It is a pleasure for me to\nintroduce this year’s very distinguished speaker, Axel Weber.\nDr. Weber is currently the president of the Deutsche Bundesbank—the central bank of\nGermany—and, in this capacity, also a member of the Governing Council of the European\nCentral Bank (ECB). He has occupied these positions since April 2004. Prior to his service with\nthe Bundesbank and the ECB, President Weber taught at several distinguished academic\ninstitutions and was a member of the German Council of Economic Experts. He also serves on\nthe board of directors of the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland.\nAs many of you know, Dr. Weber has been in the middle of extremely complex policy problems\nduring the global financial panic of 2008 and, more recently, during the ongoing European\nsovereign debt crisis. I want to take this opportunity to thank Axel for his outstanding public\nservice during this critical period. He has provided great leadership and representation for\nGermany, as well as outstanding global leadership, under the most trying of circumstances.\nAxel surprised all of us last month when he announced that he has decided to return to\nacademia and take a one-year position as a guest professor at the University of Chicago,\nbeginning in June. He will surely be missed in the policy arena, but relatively speaking, we are\nnow looking forward to being neighbors.\nI know that we will all learn a lot from Axel in the next year as he has time to reflect on his\nexperience in central banking during one of the most tumultuous periods in recent memory.\nFor this reason, I am very much looking forward to the coming year, and I hope we can get\n\n\fsomething of a sneak preview today on some of the ideas Axel will be working on as he returns\nto academia.\nPlease join me in welcoming Dr. Axel Weber, who will speak to us today about the “Challenges\nfor Monetary Policy in the EMU.”\n\nJames Bullard, President and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\n\n\f",

He also said that key\nglobal uncertainties are likely to dissipate.\n“In recent weeks, macroeconomic uncertainty has been on the rise from four key\nsources,” Bullard said. The sources he discussed were:\n1. Turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa and the associated uncertainty\npremium in oil prices;\n2. The natural disaster and the damaged nuclear reactors in Japan;\n3. The U.S. scal situation and the possibility of a political stalemate; and\n4. Continued uncertainty regarding resolution of the European sovereign debt crisis.\nBullard pointed out that all four situations have the potential to escalate. If escalation\noccurs, how and when to begin normalizing monetary policy would become less clear.\n“Still, the most likely prospect is that all four are resolved without becoming global\nmacroeconomic shocks,” he said.\nRegarding employment, Bullard noted that over the past 12 months, about 138,000\nprivate sector jobs have been added to nonfarm payrolls per month on average. “I\n\n\fexpect this will accelerate during 2011,” he said. “U.S. rms have cash and are looking\nfor opportunities to invest.”\nRecent Developments in U.S. Monetary Policy\nLast November, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announced that the Fed\nwould purchase Treasury securities at a pace of about $75 billion per month through\nthe rst half of 2011—the program commonly known as QE2. The FOMC also stated\nthat it would regularly review the program in light of incoming information and would\nadjust the program as needed.\n“The nancial market effects of QE2 looked the same as if the FOMC had reduced the\npolicy rate substantially,” Bullard said. “In particular, real interest rates declined,\nin ation expectations rose, the dollar depreciated, and equity prices rose. These are\nthe ‘classic’ nancial market effects one might observe when the Fed eases monetary\npolicy in ordinary times.”\nHe added, “This experience shows that monetary policy can be eased aggressively even\nwhen the policy rate is near zero.”\nIn light of higher in ation and in ation expectations recently, Bullard discussed\nheadline and core in ation measures (which refer to overall price index measures and\nmeasures without the food and energy components). He said core in ation is often\nsmoother than headline in ation, but “the ‘core’ concept has little theoretical backing”\nand is “very arbitrary.”\n“Headline in ation is the ultimate objective of monetary policy with respect to prices,”\nBullard said, noting that these are the prices households actually pay. “Core in ation is\nnot an objective in itself,” he added. “The only reason to look at core is as an indicator\nfor headline.”\nHowever, Bullard said that core in ation was consistently below headline in ation from\n2003-2006. Thus, “core was not a good indicator of headline during this period.” He\nnoted that core in ation averaged about 2 percent while headline in ation averaged\nabout 2.9 percent for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and about 2.6 percent for the\nPersonal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index. This difference between\nheadline and core is “substantial over a period of four years,” he said. He attributed the\ndifference during those years to rising energy prices and the expanding economy.\nCommodity Standards and In ation Targeting\nAlthough commodity standards were last discussed in the 1970s when U.S. in ation\nwas high and variable, Bullard noted that today, in ation is quite low. He added, “Tying\nthe currency to commodities when commodity prices are highly variable is\nquestionable.”\nWhile a commodity standard forced accountability on the central bank, “it did not\nalways work because governments sometimes changed the rate between the\ncommodity and the currency,” Bullard said. “In ation targeting is another way to force\nmore accountability to the central bank and anchor longer-term expectations. Make\nthe central bank say what it intends to do,” he said, “and hold the central bank\naccountable for achieving the goal.”\n“In this sense, in ation targeting is the modern successor to a commodity standard,”\nBullard said.\n\nGENERAL\n\n\fHome\nAbout Us\nBank Supervision\nCareers\nCommunity Development\nEconomic Education\nEvents\nInside the Economy Museum\nNewsroom\nOn the Economy Blog\nOpen Vault Blog\nOUR DISTRICT\nLittle Rock Branch\nLouisville Branch\nMemphis Branch\nAgricultural Finance Monitor\nHousing Market Conditions\nSELECTED PUBLICATIONS\nBridges\nEconomic Synopses\nHousing Market Perspectives\nIn the Balance\nPage One Economics\nThe Quarterly Debt Monitor\nReview\nRegional Economist\nST.

In that\ncapacity, I am pleased that the Community Affairs function has continued to sponsor this\nbiennial conference promoting research that helps to inform public policy and the community\ndevelopment industry. I would like to thank the Community Affairs Officers from the Federal\nReserve Banks of San Francisco, Kansas City and Atlanta, as well as the Board of Governors, for\ntaking the lead on planning this conference on behalf of the Federal Reserve System.\nI have spent most of my own career in economic research, and so I have a particular affinity for\nthe effort that goes into all of the analysis presented at this conference. The issues on the\nagenda here are often particularly complicated and vexing ones. The appropriate data for a\ncompletely convincing analysis is often not available. We all rely on you, as researchers, to be\ninnovative and imaginative in devising methods of gaining knowledge in these areas despite the\ndifficulties involved. I appreciate your efforts in this regard.\nIn addition to our continued emphasis on research, during the past several years the\nCommunity Affairs function of the Federal Reserve, supported by the Conference of Presidents,\nhas helped address issues associated with the financial crisis. One example is the System’s\nMortgage Outreach and Research Efforts, or MORE, initiative. Besides fostering research\ncollaboration, the initiative has emphasized public information regarding foreclosure resources.\nFor more background, please see our publication, “Addressing the Impact of the Foreclosure\nCrisis,” or check out our Foreclosure Resource Center at a number of Federal Reserve web sites,\nincluding St. Louis’.\nThe MORE initiative also encouraged joint research and publication efforts within the Federal\nReserve System. The report “REO and Vacant Properties: Strategies for Neighborhood\nStabilization” was a joint product of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston and Cleveland along\n\n\fwith the Board of Governors. The report examines a variety of neighborhood stabilization\nissues and highlights needs for data, technology and collaboration. This report also discusses\npossible solution strategies for communities with high rates of foreclosures and vacant\nproperties.\nAgain, on behalf of the Conference of Presidents, I want to give a special thanks to the\npresenters and discussants here for their extensive effort on these very pressing issues. I hope\nall of you can benefit from the rich exchange of information and ideas throughout the\nconference.\n\nJames Bullard, President and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\n\n\f",

In\naddition, he discussed headline and core in ation and stressed that the key policy goal\nwith respect to prices is headline in ation rather than core. With respect to monetary\npolicy, Bullard said that “higher in ation expectations in conjunction with a zero policy\nrate amount to an easing of nancial conditions” and that “going on hold allows more\ntime to assess the strength of the recovery.” Finally, Bullard brie y discussed the merits\nof commodity standards and in ation targeting, concluding that “in ation targeting is a\nbetter choice in the current environment.”\nCommodity Prices\nWhile there have been substantial increases in commodity prices in recent months,\nBullard noted that energy prices cannot continue to increase inde nitely. “Still, some\nsector prices do continuously move in one direction for a long time,” he added, citing as\nexamples prices for medical care, which have increased, and prices for computer\ntechnology, which have decreased.\nBullard then discussed oil price shocks, citing James Hamilton of the University of\nCalifornia at San Diego, who has argued that certain types of oil price shocks precede\nU.S. recessions.\nBullard said that “increases in oil prices like the ones we have recently experienced\nhave occurred many times in the past without seeming to have much effect on the\neconomy,” and that “it is only the really extreme ones that are reliably related to U.S.\nrecessions.”\n“This gives me some con dence that the U.S. can weather the current price shock\nwithout a signi cant slowdown,” he added.\nCore vs. Headline In ation\nBullard discussed headline and core in ation measures, which refer to overall price\nindex measures and measures without the food and energy components, respectively.\n\n\fHe said core in ation is often smoother than headline in ation, but “the ‘core’ concept\nhas little theoretical backing” and is “very arbitrary.”\n“Headline in ation is the ultimate objective of monetary policy with respect to prices,”\nBullard said, noting that these are the prices that households actually pay. “Core\nin ation is not an objective in itself,” he added. “The only reason to look at core is as an\nindicator for headline.”\nHowever, “from 2003-2006, core in ation was consistently below headline in ation,”\nBullard said. Core in ation averaged about 2 percent while headline in ation averaged\nabout 2.9 percent for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and about 2.6 percent for the\nPersonal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index. He concluded, “Core was not a\ngood indicator of headline during this period.” He added that “energy prices were rising\nand the economy was expanding” during those years.\nU.S. Monetary Policy\n“Since last summer, nancial conditions have eased considerably,” Bullard said, noting\nthat the policy rate has remained near zero but expected in ation has risen. “To the\nextent expected in ation continues to rise, nancial conditions continue to ease,” he\nsaid.\n“Past behavior of the FOMC indicates that the Committee sometimes puts policy on\nhold,” Bullard said. “This gives the Committee more time to assess economic\nconditions.”\nHe added that hold in the current environment would mean:\nthe policy rate remains near zero;\nthe “extended period” language remains intact; and\nthe balance sheet remains at the level as of the time of the decision to go on hold.\nCommodity Standards and In ation Targeting\nAlthough commodity standards were last discussed in the 1970s when U.S. in ation\nwas high and variable, Bullard noted that today, in ation is quite low.

            "content": "Measuring Inflation: The Core Is Rotten\nMoney Marketeers of New York University\nNew York, N.Y.\nMay 18, 2011\n\nIntroduction\nControlling overall inflation is a goal of monetary policy. Measures of overall, or headline,\ninflation attempt to include changes in the prices paid for a wide variety of goods—that is, what\nhouseholds actually have to pay for their daily purchases. This is a sensible notion of precisely\nwhat the central bank can and should control over the medium term.\nMany discussions of monetary policy, even within the central banking community, discuss\nmovements of subsets of prices instead of the overall or headline measure of price changes.\nThe most famous subset is the “core”—all prices except those relating to food or energy. Core\ninflation is the measured rate of increase of these prices. Control of core inflation is not the\ngoal of monetary policy, although it sometimes seems to be given the amount of emphasis put\non this concept in the U.S.\nIn my remarks tonight I will argue that many of the old arguments in favor of a focus on core\ninflation have become rotten over the years. It is time to drop the emphasis on core inflation\nas a meaningful way to interpret the inflation process in the U.S.\nOne immediate benefit of dropping the emphasis on core inflation would be to reconnect the\nFed with households and businesses who know price changes when they see them. With trips\nto the gas station and the grocery store being some of the most frequent shopping experiences\nfor many Americans, it is hardly helpful for Fed credibility to appear to exclude all those prices\nfrom consideration in the formation of monetary policy.\nThere are several key arguments that are commonly used to favor a focus on core inflation in\nmonetary policy discussions. I will argue that all of them are essentially misguided. Because of\nthis, the best the central bank can do is to focus on headline measures of inflation. The\nheadline measures were designed to be the best measures of inflation available—the Fed\nshould respect that construction and accept the policy problem it poses. Many other central\nbanks have solidified their position on this question by adopting explicit, numerical inflation\n\n\ftargets for headline inflation, thus keeping faith with their citizens that they will work to keep\nheadline inflation low and stable. The Fed should do the same.\nLet me stress before I continue that my remarks tonight are my own views and do not\nnecessarily reflect those of others in the Federal Reserve System or on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee.\nLet me turn now to four broad arguments that are often invoked to rationalize a focus on core\ninflation and why I think they are all misguided.\n\n1. The “volatility” argument\nI will start with an easy one, the argument that headline inflation is more volatile than core\ninflation and that, therefore, if monetary policy reacts systematically to headline inflation the\neconomy itself would become more volatile. This could also be termed the “all hell would\nbreak loose” argument.\nYes, it is true that headline inflation tends to be more volatile than subset inflation measures\nthat exclude or downweight the most volatile components. However, I do not think this says\nanything about how policy should or should not react to movements in headline inflation. Any\npolicy response can of course be adjusted appropriately to take into consideration that the\nprice index contains a certain level of volatility. In other words, the policy response can be\noptimized given the inflation index being targeted. Some monetary policy simulations that I\nhave seen in this area simply take an existing policy rule that has been designed for core\ninflation and use the same rule with headline inflation—resulting in increased volatility in goal\nvariables. That type of experiment is just saying that an inappropriate policy rule will produce\nless-than-satisfactory results, which is hardly surprising. 1\nOne might very legitimately turn the headline volatility question on its head. With core\ninflation as the preferred index for monetary policy analysis, the policymaker will tend to react\nto relatively small movements in measured core inflation. In that case, arguably, any policy\n1\n\nThe literature trying to disentangle the recessionary consequences of oil-price shocks themselves from the\nconsequences of the monetary policy response to those shocks is interesting, but inconclusive. The results depend\non many modeling details. See Anna Kormilitsina, 2011, “Oil Price Shocks and the Optimality of Monetary Policy,”\nReview of Economic Dynamics, 14: 199-223, and Sylvain Leduc and Keith Sill, 2004, “A Quantitative Analysis of Oilprice Shocks, Systematic Monetary Policy, and Economic Downturns,” Journal of Monetary Economics, 51: 781808.\n\n\fresponse has to be larger—possibly substantially larger—when even small changes in measured\ncore inflation are observed in order to execute the optimal policy. This may be ill-advised to\nthe extent that small movements in core inflation are in fact simply noise.\nRecent experience offers something to ponder in this regard. While many think that the recent\nfinancial crisis provides an illustration of the merits of the focus on core inflation, I do not see it\nthat way at all. During the second half of 2008 and into 2009, headline inflation measured from\none year earlier fell dramatically and in fact moved into negative territory. This was a signal—\none among many, to be sure—that a dramatic shock was impacting the U.S. economy. Inflation\nwas not immune to this shock. The FOMC reacted appropriately with an aggressive easing of\nmonetary policy. Yet the movements in core inflation during this chilling period were far more\nmuted and sent much less of a signal that action was required.\nThere is also the question of the wisdom of an intermediate target strategy with respect to\ninflation. Since headline inflation is the goal for monetary policy, the introduction of the core\ninflation concept as an intermediate target introduces some slippage between the variable the\nCommittee is reacting to and the ultimate value of the goal variable. The intermediate target\nstrategy works as follows: The Committee makes a policy tool adjustment (such as the policy\ninterest rate), which is designed to target core inflation, which subsequently impacts headline\ninflation. It is not clear that this intermediate target strategy actually maximizes policy\nperformance with respect to the overall price index. For that, much depends on the statistical\nproperties of the relationship between core inflation and headline inflation, and that\nrelationship tends to change over time.\nAnd finally on the topic of the volatility of headline inflation, the headline index can be\nsmoothed in any number of other ways that stop short of ignoring a wide class of important\nprices in the economy. One simple way is to consider headline inflation measured from one\nyear earlier, but there are many others. To the extent that the volatility of headline inflation is\na problem, there are better methods of addressing that than to simply dismiss troublesome\nprices.\n\n2. The “core predicts headline” argument\nOne popular argument for focusing on core inflation is that core inflation is a good predictor of\nfuture headline inflation. I think this is wrongheaded, as well as wrong.\n\n\fLet’s begin with the wrongheaded part. The idea that core predicts future headline is often\nbased on univariate models of the inflation process, that is, ones that try to predict future\nheadline inflation using only a single variable or a simple function of a single variable. I do not\nthink this is a good metric for understanding whether core or headline is the right inflation\nmeasure on which to gauge monetary policy decisions, regardless of whether it holds up in the\ndata or not. Presumably, we would want to use a fully specified model to try to predict\nheadline inflation, the goal variable with respect to prices, in the U.S. The full model would\ninclude measures of expected inflation, developments in the real economy, the stance of\nmonetary policy (including the implicit inflation target), and other variables to help to predict\nfuture headline inflation outcomes. One could throw all of these variables out in favor of a\nsingle variable—core inflation—when trying to predict future headline inflation, but\npresumably then one would have a misspecified model of the inflation process in which a\nsimple function of core inflation is acting as a proxy for all the variables that are supposed to be\nimportant for predicting future headline inflation. In this misspecified model, a simple function\nof core inflation may or may not have been a good predictor of future headline inflation over a\nparticular time period, but so what? I do not think this really tells us anything about whether it\nis a good idea to key policy off of core inflation or not.\nThere is a version of this argument that might make more sense. That version works like this.\nSuppose we have a full model of the inflation process, one that includes expected inflation,\nmeasures of real activity, and measures of the stance of monetary policy. We then add core\ninflation as a variable to this model and assess the marginal predictive value of core inflation\ngiven all other variables. If the marginal value of adding core inflation in this context is positive,\none might then have a claim that core inflation contains some “special” information over and\nabove information coming from the rest of the economy concerning the future course of\ninflation. I have not seen convincing evidence of this type.\nBut let’s go ahead and consider the merely wrong part of this argument. Let’s examine\nwhether today’s core inflation is a good predictor of future headline inflation in the context of a\nunivariate forecasting model. I do not think the evidence is very clear on this question. A\nnumber of choices have to be made to even proceed in this area: the horizon over which to\nforecast—let’s say, one year; the function of core inflation to use, such as a distributed lag, and\nthe length of that lag; the data sample over which to test the hypothesis; and the measures of\ncore and headline inflation to use. One recent research paper in this area investigates PCE\ninflation and standard core PCE inflation (that is, PCE inflation less food and energy\n\n\fcomponents) alongside other types of inflation measures over U.S. data from 1982 to 2005.2 In\nthat paper, standard core PCE inflation performs relatively poorly as a predictor of future\nheadline PCE inflation in most of the models discussed. 3 Alternative measures of inflation do\nbetter, such as the trimmed mean measure produced by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\nAnalysis like this demonstrates that the idea that standard core inflation forecasts future\nheadline is far from an obvious conclusion given the U.S. data.4\nMany intuitive discussions on the issue of core versus headline inflation contain the idea that\nnoise should somehow be stripped out of the headline inflation measure in order to leave only\nthe signal component. The energy price component of the headline price index often\n(depending on the time period) has the lowest signal-to-noise ratio, but the food component\noften does not have the second-lowest signal-to-noise ratio; for this reason it is not clear that\nthe food component should be routinely excluded on this basis. Also, the concept of a signalto-noise ratio contains a notion that the noise component is stationary, whereas much of the\ncontemporary worry about commodity prices is that relative price changes may be much more\npersistent going forward than they have been in the past. That brings us to the “relative price”\narguments for confining attention to core inflation.\n\n3. The “relative price” argument\nThe U.S. economy has many thousands of prices, and these prices are adjusting frequently. This\nis appropriate relative price adjustment. The prices are sending signals to households about\nwhat has become more expensive and less expensive at each moment in time. Think of the U.S.\nhousehold sector as one unified household with a fixed budget constraint. Then if a particular\nprice goes up, generally speaking another price has to fall or, alternatively, the expenditure\nshares on the two goods have to adjust so that the household can still meet its budget\nconstraint. Either way, the household will adjust by changing behavior in response to the\nchanging prices. The price indexes that are constructed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (for\n2\n\nSee Julie K. Smith, 2010, “PCE Inflation and Core Inflation,” unpublished manuscript, Department of Economics\nand Business, Lafayette College.\n3\nSimilar results are discussed in Theodore M. Crone, N. Neil K. Khettry, Loretta J. Mester, and Jason A. Novak,\n2008, “Core Measures of Inflation as Predictors of Total Inflation,” Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia Working\nPaper 08-9.\n4\nSee also the discussion in Daniel L. Thornton, September 2007, “Measure for Measure: Headline versus Core\nInflation,” Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Monetary Trends. Concerning CPI inflation, see Riccardo DiCecio, July\n2007, “Inflation Disconnect?” Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Monetary Trends.\n\n\fthe CPI) and by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (for the PCE price index) already make\nadjustments for this behavior in various ways, especially in chain-weighted indexes that adjust\nexpenditure weights more continuously. In this sense, relative price movements are already\naccounted for in the construction of existing indexes. Therefore, when the entire price index\nrises, it really does mean that there is inflation in the economy. Appealing to the idea of\nrelative price change to explain increases in a price index is inappropriate in most\ncircumstances, at least up to our ability to measure behavior induced by relative price changes\ncorrectly.\nIt is often asserted in discussions of this type that the Fed cannot help the fact that events occur\naround the world each day that affect various prices. Some prices are “out of our control.”\nThis is certainly true, but this is also true for every single price in the price index. Each one is\naffected by real supply and demand factors each day, none of which is susceptible to direct\ninfluence by the Federal Reserve. The only element of control the Fed has is over general\nmovements in the entire price index, and only imprecisely over a period of quarters and years.\nThe key relative price changes in today’s global economy are for energy and other\ncommodities. Crude oil prices, in particular, are substantially higher in real terms than they\nwere a decade ago and constitute a significant fraction of global expenditure. It is often\nasserted that energy prices cannot increase indefinitely; that a one-time rise in energy prices\nonly temporarily contributes to inflation; and therefore that it makes sense to ignore such\nchanges. However, the logic of relative prices suggests that if households are forced to spend\nmore on energy consumption, then they have to spend less on the consumption of all other\ngoods, thereby putting downward pressure on all other prices (and all other expenditure\nshares) in the economy. Ignoring energy prices would then understate the true inflation rate,\nas one would be focusing only on the prices facing downward pressure because of changing\nrelative prices.\nOne might also reasonably question the “temporary” characterization of the shift in energy and\nother global commodity prices. It is certainly true that we should not expect energy prices to\nincrease faster than the general price level without limit. But it is also true that there are wellknown examples of long-term secular trends in certain prices. One example is medical care\nprices, which have generally increased faster than the headline CPI index for decades. Another\nexample is computing technology, where prices have more or less continuously declined per\nunit of computing power, even as other prices have continued to rise. So it is possible—and\nindeed it does happen—that whole sectors of the economy experience relative price change\nover very long periods of time. From this perspective, it is at least a reasonable hypothesis that\n\n\fglobal demand for energy will outstrip increased supply over the coming decades as the giant\neconomies of Asia, particularly India and China, reach Western levels of real income per capita.\nIf that scenario unfolds, then ignoring energy prices in a price index will systematically\nunderstate inflation for many years.\n\n4. Should the central bank target a subset of prices?\nThe last set of arguments in favor of a notion of core inflation is far more sophisticated, but also\nfar less established. Up to now we have taken it for granted that the prices that households\ncare about include all the prices that households actually have to pay. This suggests that our\nexisting headline price indexes are the right ones to look at when considering what is best for\nhouseholds. Yet there is some interesting literature that asks the following question: Can we\nthink of a theoretical world in which the central bank would want to target a subset of the\nprices faced by households, instead of all the prices, on the grounds that this policy would be\npreferred by the households themselves? We could then call changes in this subset of prices\n“core inflation.”\nThe general answer is that this is indeed possible, and I believe future research in this area has\nto proceed in this direction. But these models, while interesting, are not ready for prime time,\nand so I think for now the best we central bankers can do is focus on the best measures of\noverall inflation we have and attempt to stabilize those.\nThe key feature of the literature in this area is that some prices are considered “sticky” (in a\nsense made precise in the research), while other prices are fully flexible.5 For instance, one\ncould posit that the energy price sector is characterized by fully flexible prices, while the rest of\nthe economy is characterized by prices that do not adjust as readily to supply and demand\ndisturbances and therefore are considered sticky. A typical result from the literature is that it is\nthe sticky prices that matter more from the perspective of the households in the model, since\nthose prices are not clearing markets as effectively as they could if prices were fully flexible.\nFor this reason, the central bank might want to focus on a subset of prices, namely the sticky\nones. One could think of changes in these sticky prices as “core inflation.”\n\n5\n\nFor a discussion of some of the issues, see Martin Bodenstein, Christopher J. Erceg, and Luca Guerrieri, 2008,\n“Optimal Monetary Policy with Distinct Core and Headline Inflation Rates,” Journal of Monetary Economics, 55:\nS18-S33.\n\n\fThis idea has a long way to go to gain general acceptability, and it is certainly not widely\nendorsed even within macroeconomics. But at least it is one way to think about why it might\nbe better to focus on a subset of prices instead of the entire price index.\nThere is an international version of this argument as well. 6 In one area of research, there would\nbe a sticky price sector in each country, and each central bank would provide the optimal\nmonetary policy by focusing on the sticky price sector in its own country and ignoring import\nprices. This would divide up the prices in yet a different way, and perhaps one that makes a\nlittle bit of sense: Import prices would be excluded from domestic policy concerns because the\nforeign central bank would already be responding to the prices of its exports in setting its own\npolicy. Still, results like this depend on a lot of particular assumptions.\nI should stress that I have never heard serious discussion of these ideas outside of academic\ncircles. I bring it up only to illustrate that there is interesting research about why it may be\noptimal to focus on a subset of prices instead of a headline price index. But the existing\nliterature tends to draw distinctions that are somewhat different from the way practitioners\nwish to view this issue. Most practitioners do not have in mind trying to divide up prices\nbetween those that are more “sticky” and those that are less so, or between domestic prices\nand import prices.\n\nWhat should we do?\nThe theme of tonight’s remarks has been that U.S. monetary policy needs to de-emphasize core\ninflation. Core inflation is not the ultimate goal of monetary policy. I have considered four\nclasses of arguments for a focus on core inflation and found all of them wanting. For this\nreason I think the best the FOMC can do is to use headline inflation when looking at the price\nside of the dual mandate.\nCore versus headline inflation has been a long-standing issue for the FOMC. The focus on core\ninflation in the U.S. seems to be more entrenched than in many other countries. I have argued\nthat the older ideas justifying this focus have rotted over time—indeed they probably made\nlittle sense from the start. The FOMC needs to get a better playbook on this question so that\n\n6\n\nSee, for instance, Richard Clarida, Jordi Galí, and Mark Gertler, 2002, “A Simple Framework for International\nMonetary Policy Analysis,” Journal of Monetary Economics, 49: 879-904.\n\n\fthe Committee can reconnect with American households, who see price changes daily in many\nof the items the Committee seems to exclude from consideration in making monetary policy.\nThe headline measures of inflation were designed to be the best measures of inflation\navailable. It is difficult to get around this fact with simple transformations of the price indexes.\nThe Fed should respect the construction of the price indexes as they are and accept the policy\nproblem it poses. To do otherwise may create the appearance of avoiding responsibility for\ninflation.\nThere is widespread agreement that headline inflation is the goal variable of monetary policy\nwith respect to prices. Normally one would want to operate directly in terms of the goal\nvariable whenever possible. The concept of core inflation suggests that somehow an\nintermediate target strategy with respect to price inflation is optimal for U.S. monetary policy.\nAs I have outlined in my remarks tonight, I do not think this has ever been convincingly\ndemonstrated. In addition, the U.S. focus on core inflation tends to damage Fed credibility. As\nI noted in the introduction, many other central banks have solidified their position on this\nquestion by adopting explicit, numerical inflation targets in terms of headline inflation, thus\nkeeping faith with their citizens that they will work to keep headline inflation low and stable.\nThe Fed should do the same.\n\nJames Bullard, President and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\n\n\f",

He said core in ation is often smoother than headline in ation, but “the\n‘core’ concept has little theoretical or statistical backing” and is very arbitrary.\n“Headline in ation is the ultimate objective of monetary policy with respect to prices,”\nBullard said, noting that these are the prices that households actually pay. “Core is not\n\n\fan objective in itself,” he added. He said that while the only reason to look at core is as\nan intermediate target for headline, “its use as an intermediate target is questionable.”\nBullard also said that too much attention to core in ation can mislead policy. For\nexample, from 2003-2006, while core in ation averaged about 2 percent, it was\nconsistently below headline in ation. “Core was not a good indicator of headline during\nthis period,” he said. During those years, he added, energy prices were rising and the\neconomy was expanding.\nBullard cited his recent speech, “Measuring In ation: The Core Is Rotten,” and talked\nabout how many of the older arguments in favor of a focus on core in ation have\n“rotted” over time. Therefore, he said, “U.S. monetary policy should de-emphasize core\nin ation, and increase the focus on headline in ation.” De-emphasizing core would\n“reconnect the FOMC with American households and businesses who know price\nchanges when they see them.”\nIn addition, Bullard said that the Fed lags behind many other central banks in adopting\nan explicit, numerical in ation target in terms of headline in ation. “The FOMC should\nadopt such a target,” he said. Having an explicit target for headline in ation “would\nallow discussion of other measures of in ation in the context of a clearly stated\nultimate goal with respect to the price side of the dual mandate.”\nCommodity Standards and In ation Targeting\nAlthough commodity standards were last discussed in the 1970s when U.S. in ation\nwas high and variable, Bullard noted that today, in ation is quite low. He said, “Tying\nthe currency to commodities when commodity prices are highly variable is\nquestionable.”\nWhile a commodity standard forces some accountability on the central bank, in the\npast “it did not always work because governments sometimes changed the rate\nbetween the commodity and the currency,” Bullard said.\n“In ation targeting is another way to force more accountability to the central bank and\nanchor longer-term in ation expectations,” he said. “Make the central bank say what it\nintends to do, and hold the central bank accountable for achieving the goal.”\n“In this sense, in ation targeting is the modern successor to a commodity standard,”\nBullard said.\nU.S. Monetary Policy\nBullard also discussed monetary policy after the Fed’s current quantitative easing\nprogram ends. “Past behavior of the FOMC indicates that the Committee sometimes\nputs policy on hold,” he said. He noted that hold in the current environment would\nmean:\nthe policy rate remains near zero;\nthe “extended period” language remains intact; and\nthe balance sheet remains at the level as of the time of the decision to go on hold.\nA pause “gives the Committee more time to assess economic conditions,” Bullard said.\n\nGENERAL\nHome\nAbout Us\nBank Supervision\n\n\fCareers\nCommunity Development\nEconomic Education\nEvents\nInside the Economy Museum\nNewsroom\nOn the Economy Blog\nOpen Vault Blog\nOUR DISTRICT\nLittle Rock Branch\nLouisville Branch\nMemphis Branch\nAgricultural Finance Monitor\nHousing Market Conditions\nSELECTED PUBLICATIONS\nBridges\nEconomic Synopses\nHousing Market Perspectives\nIn the Balance\nPage One Economics\nThe Quarterly Debt Monitor\nReview\nRegional Economist\nST.

Having an explicit target for headline in ation “would\nallow discussion of other measures of in ation in the context of a clearly stated\nultimate goal with respect to the price side of the dual mandate.”\nCommodity Standards and In ation Targeting\nAlthough commodity standards were last discussed in the 1970s when U.S. in ation\nwas high and variable, Bullard noted that today, in ation is quite low. He said, “Tying\nthe currency to commodities when commodity prices are highly variable is\nquestionable.”\nWhile a commodity standard forces some accountability on the central bank, in the\npast “it did not always work because governments sometimes changed the rate\nbetween the commodity and the currency,” Bullard said.\n“In ation targeting is another way to force more accountability to the central bank and\nanchor longer-term in ation expectations,” he said. “Make the central bank say what it\nintends to do, and hold the central bank accountable for achieving the goal.”\n“In this sense, in ation targeting is the modern successor to a commodity standard,”\nBullard said.\nU.S. Monetary Policy\nBullard also discussed monetary policy after the Fed’s current quantitative easing\nprogram ends. “Past behavior of the FOMC indicates that the Committee sometimes\nputs policy on hold,” he said. He noted that hold in the current environment would\nmean:\nthe policy rate remains near zero;\nthe “extended period” language remains intact; and\nthe balance sheet remains at the level as of the time of the decision to go on hold.\nA pause “gives the Committee more time to assess economic conditions,” Bullard said.\n\nGENERAL\nHome\nAbout Us\nBank Supervision\n\n\fCareers\nCommunity Development\nEconomic Education\nEvents\nInside the Economy Museum\nNewsroom\nOn the Economy Blog\nOpen Vault Blog\nOUR DISTRICT\nLittle Rock Branch\nLouisville Branch\nMemphis Branch\nAgricultural Finance Monitor\nHousing Market Conditions\nSELECTED PUBLICATIONS\nBridges\nEconomic Synopses\nHousing Market Perspectives\nIn the Balance\nPage One Economics\nThe Quarterly Debt Monitor\nReview\nRegional Economist\nST.

He stated that three of the four key uncertainties that have plagued the\nU.S. economy since February have been largely or partially resolved, while one of them\n—the U.S. scal situation—is still on the table. “Once this last uncertainty is resolved,\nthe path to faster growth may be open,” he said.\nBullard also shared his views on the implications of a housing bubble for the economy.\n“If the U.S. economy was distorted by a housing bubble in the last decade, as many\nbelieve, then the appropriate comparison of today’s output level is to the non-bubble,\nfundamental level of output that would have been produced,” he said.\nMonetary Policy on Hold at “Ultra-Easy”\n“The Fed has taken extraordinary steps in recent years to try to run an effective countercyclical monetary policy,” Bullard said. These steps include a policy rate near zero,\nextended period language for the near-zero policy rate, and expansion of the size of the\nbalance sheet. He noted that with the end of asset purchases associated with the\nFed’s second round of quantitative easing, “the size of the balance sheet remains at a\nhigh level.”\n“The large balance sheet could generate signi cant in ation if accommodation is not\nremoved at an appropriate pace,” Bullard said. “The in ationary threat has driven\nin ation expectations higher over the last year, and actual in ation has followed.” He\nadded that given the near-zero policy rate, this means real short-term rates have\ndeclined. “That is, the policy stance has become even easier over the last year.”\nBullard noted that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has not taken action to\nreduce the size of the balance sheet and remove this in ationary threat. “I conclude\nthat monetary policy remains ‘ultra-easy’ for now. This is an appropriate setting for\nmonetary policy today,” he said.\n\n\f“However, I expect that the economy will improve during the second half of the year and\ninto 2012,” Bullard said. “As it does, the FOMC will have to monitor the situation closely\nin order to remove accommodation at an appropriate pace.”\nThe Second Half of 2011\nBullard said that as four key uncertainties unwind, U.S. economic performance is likely\nto improve. He outlined the state of the uncertainties, each of which in principle could\nbe large enough to derail global economic growth.\n1. The situation in Japan has stabilized and supply disruptions stemming from that\nsource are expected to be minimal during the second half of 2011.\n2. Energy and commodity prices, especially oil prices, have declined from their highs\nearlier this year, and turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa has moderated.\nConsumers did not react to $4/gallon gasoline as negatively as they did in 2008.\n3. European authorities have made some progress on Greece with the\nannouncement of a new agreement in recent days. Financial stress indicators\nhave not reacted as negatively to ongoing negotiations in Europe as they did in\nthe April-May 2010 period.\n4. The U.S. scal situation remains unresolved.\nThe U.S. Fiscal Situation\n“It is essential that the Congress and the President come to an agreement on the U.S.\nbudget and the projected level of U.S. debt going forward,” Bullard stated. “There is a\nsubstantial opportunity to put the U.S. scal situation on rmer footing, and remove a\ncloud of uncertainty hanging over U.S. macroeconomic prospects.”\nRegarding the Fed’s role, Bullard said that “the Fed by law cannot buy debt directly from\nthe Treasury.” Rather, the Fed can conduct open market operations only after the\nTreasury oats the debt in the primary market, he noted. “Hitting the debt ceiling\nmeans the Treasury cannot oat debt in the primary market,” he said. “Therefore, the\nnotion sometimes oated in nancial markets that the Fed can simply step in if\nnecessary is incorrect.”\nBullard said, “The Fed has no options should the debt ceiling not be raised. This is as it\nshould be, because otherwise the central bank would be thwarting the will of the\nCongress.” He noted that this is a point Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has emphasized.\n“Should a general crisis ensue, the Fed can of course provide liquidity to markets as it\ndid in 2008 and 2009. But that is not a substitute for the Treasury raising funds by\nissuing paper,” Bullard said. “The Fed cannot remedy a failure to raise the debt ceiling.”\nHow to Think About a Bubble\n“The U.S. economy has been struggling to recover from a very large shock suffered\nduring late 2008 and early 2009,” Bullard said. Many analysts believe that a housing\n“bubble” collapsed, where “a bubble means that there was overinvestment in housing—\ndriven by self-ful lling beliefs alone concerning future housing prices being ever higher,”\nhe said. “The data on housing prices certainly seems to support this hypothesis.”\nBullard said a bubble implies that too many resources were dedicated to the housing\nsector—both directly to the sector and to related businesses that support the sector—\nduring the 2001-2007 period. In this scenario, such resource misallocation “temporarily\ncontributed to more rapid GDP growth than would have occurred otherwise, but was\nultimately unsustainable as the bubble collapsed and caused a large recession,” he\nsaid.\nU.S. real GDP grew about 2.4 percent per year on average from 2001-2007, Bullard\nnoted. As a simple example illustrating the implications of a bubble, he talked about\n\n\ftwo economies. The fundamental economy—that is, the one without a bubble—grows\nsteadily at 1.75 percent. The bubble economy, on the other hand, temporarily grows at\na faster rate, but ultimately crashes and returns to the fundamental growth rate.\nBullard noted that most analysis he has seen compares the current level of output to\nthe peak level of output that was produced during the previous decade. However, he\nsaid, “If the bubble explanation is correct, we should be comparing today’s output level\nto the level suggested by the underlying, non-bubble, fundamental economy that would\nhave existed over the last decade.”\nAlthough this example is only meant to be suggestive, Bullard said, “This gives a very\ndifferent perspective on where the economy is today.”\n\nGENERAL\nHome\nAbout Us\nBank Supervision\nCareers\nCommunity Development\nEconomic Education\nEvents\nInside the Economy Museum\nNewsroom\nOn the Economy Blog\nOpen Vault Blog\nOUR DISTRICT\nLittle Rock Branch\nLouisville Branch\nMemphis Branch\nAgricultural Finance Monitor\nHousing Market Conditions\nSELECTED PUBLICATIONS\nBridges\nEconomic Synopses\nHousing Market Perspectives\nIn the Balance\nPage One Economics\nThe Quarterly Debt Monitor\nReview\nRegional Economist\nST.

            "content": "Opening remarks by President James Bullard\nDialogue with the Fed: Beyond Today’s Financial Headlines\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nSeptember 12, 2011\n\nGood evening and welcome to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis’ “Dialogue with the Fed”\ndiscussion. I would also like to welcome those who are joining us by video conference from one\nof our branch cities: Memphis, Tennessee. We appreciate the time you are taking to join us\ntonight.\nThe St. Louis Fed is one of 12 Federal Reserve banks in the United States. Our reach extends\nwell beyond St. Louis—the 8th District encompasses all or part of seven surrounding states. In\naddition to our Bank headquarters here in downtown St. Louis, we have branches in Little Rock,\nArkansas; Louisville, Kentucky; and, as I just mentioned, Memphis, Tennessee. During recent\nyears we have undertaken a major renovation project here in St. Louis driven in large part by\nthe desire to meet enhanced security requirements following 9/11. As part of that renovation,\nwe modernized our facilities including the Gateway Conference Center, which we are using this\nevening. I am pleased that, as this project progressed, we were able to make the decision to\nremain in our downtown location, which we have occupied since the early 1920s.\nAt the time of the Federal Reserve’s creation in 1913, there was a strong belief that the U.S.\ncentral bank should be structured in such a way as to guard against its being overly influenced\nby the moneyed interests of New York and the political interests of Washington DC. The\nfounders of the Fed very much wished to keep some of the power outside of the nation’s\nfinancial and political centers. The result was a decentralized structure with a Board of\nGovernors in Washington, an important Bank in New York, and 11 independent Reserve banks\nacross the country, such as this one. These banks represent Main Street America in discussions\nabout setting monetary policy.\nAs President of this Reserve Bank, I serve—along with the Presidents of the other 11 Reserve\nbanks and Governors of the Federal Reserve Board—as a member of the Federal Open Market\nCommittee, the group within the Federal Reserve that is responsible for monetary policy in the\nUnited States. The Federal Open Market Committee will meet later this month for a 2-day\nmeeting and again in November and December. I have little doubt that, as always, an intense\nand spirited discussion about the course of future monetary policy will occur.\n\n\fOne of the primary concerns for the FOMC and for the nation is the subpar performance of the\nU.S. economy during the first half of 2011. The July GDP report indicated that the recent\nrecession was generally deeper than previously estimated and that growth since the recession\nended in mid-2009 has been weaker than previously thought. This has raised the specter in the\nminds of some that the U.S. economy is about to return to recession. However, I think the\nmost likely path for the economy going forward is one of modest, albeit unspectacular, growth,\nand that the chances of recession are only modestly higher than they were earlier this year.\nAnd, while disappointing economic performance certainly makes the case for an aggressive\nmonetary policy, the FOMC has in fact provided that aggressive policy. The federal funds rate,\nthe main policy rate of the FOMC, has been near zero since December of 2008. The near-zero\nrate policy has been supplemented with an additional promise to keep the rate near zero at\nleast through the middle of 2013, almost two more years. In addition, the Fed’s balance sheet\nhas been expanded to an unprecedented size as the Committee has authorized the outright\npurchase of agency mortgage-backed securities and, more recently, Treasury securities, with\nnewly-created base money. In sum, the stance of monetary policy has been appropriately\ncalibrated to try to meet, as best we can, the unusual macroeconomic circumstances.\nNow, with further slowing in the economy, some call for further monetary accommodation. Let\nme stress that no decision has been made on this difficult question. However, should such a\ndecision be made, I think it is time for the Committee to discard one-time policy changes with\nfixed end dates. The Committee in the past never contemplated announcing several hundred\nbasis point moves to be completed at a date certain. Yet that is how the Committee behaves\ntoday.\nResearch indicates quite clearly that optimal monetary policy should continuously respond to\never-changing economic conditions. As the federal funds rate was set meeting-by-meeting\nbefore December 2008, so any future policy path should be state-contingent and not of\npremeditated size or duration. In addition, any policy path should be reviewed carefully and\nseriously at each meeting for possible adjustment given the incoming data. In short, optimal\nmonetary policy is not a one-time action or event, but a rule that takes the state of the\neconomy and maps it into a setting for a policy instrument. To the extent the Committee can\nreturn to this principle, monetary policy will come closer to delivering the best outcomes that\ncan be achieved through this channel.\nThe current economy is challenging, but I have confidence in the U.S. economic system and the\nFOMC—its objectivity and the scholarship and dedication of all of its members. Those of us\n\n\fwho sit on the Committee have a wide-ranging collection of viewpoints, but I consider that a\nstrength. It’s exactly this diversity that helps us make the best monetary policy decisions for\nAmerica.\nThe intricacies of the economy are technical and complex. One of the lessons of the financial\ncrisis is that we must work harder to communicate about monetary policy and the economy.\nThe Federal Reserve has taken steps in this direction. The Chairman’s new press conferences\nprovide a new avenue of communication. Here in the 8th District, we provide extensive\neconomic education workshops and programs to teachers. More than 3,000 teachers have\naccessed our programs already in 2011. Moreover, 35,000 students from 43 different states\nwere enrolled in the online courses offered by our economic education team. I encourage you\nto go to our web site to learn about the many other ways we are connecting with groups and\nindividuals across the District. Tonight’s “Dialogue with the Fed” is part of this information\nexchange with the public.\nIn a moment, Julie Stackhouse, the Bank’s Senior Vice-President in charge of banking\nsupervision, will discuss lessons learned from the financial crisis. In October, Bill Emmons, an\neconomist who has studied banks, financial markets and the economy for the past 20 years, will\ndiscuss the implications of the federal deficit. And in November, the Bank’s Director of\nResearch, Chris Waller, will discuss the ramifications of the lingering high unemployment rate in\nthis country. Obviously, I like to leave the toughest discussions to my staff. We trust these\ntopics are of interest to you and look forward to your feedback.\nAgain, from all of us here at the Federal Reserve, thank you for joining us this evening.\n\nJames Bullard, President and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\n\n\f",

            "content": "Search Site\nHome > Newsroom >\n\nSt. Louis Fed's Bullard Discusses America's Investment Problem\nand Monetary Policy\n9/26/2011\nNEW YORK CITY - On Monday, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James\nBullard delivered remarks titled “America’s Investment Problem and Monetary Policy”\nas part of a panel discussion on “Policy Making After the Crisis.”\nBullard talked about the recovery in U.S. GDP and noted that its components, except for\ninvestment, have largely recovered to their 2007 peak. “This looks like the collapse of a\nreal estate bubble,” he stated. However, most analysis does not take the idea of a\ncollapsed bubble su ciently into account when discussing the nature of the U.S.\nrecovery, he said. “Taking the bubble view more seriously has implications for the\nexpected pace of the U.S. recovery and for the likely fundamental potential growth rate\nof the U.S. economy.” This, in turn, has important implications for U.S. monetary policy,\nBullard noted. “The behavior of in ation over the last year supports the idea that the\nfundamental output gap has been smaller than recognized, and that asset purchases\nare a potent tool for in uencing in ation and in ation expectations,” he concluded.\nRegarding the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC’s) options for conducting\ncountercyclical monetary policy in a near-zero policy rate environment, Bullard said that\n“the Fed’s balance sheet policy—outright purchases and sales—is the most natural and\neffective tool for this purpose.” He stated that the FOMC should decide on any future\nasset purchases on a meeting-by-meeting basis and should also indicate the likelihood\nthat it will continue on its current path at the following meeting. The FOMC’s\ncommunications tool—which is the main alternative to asset purchases—“has some\npotential drawbacks,” he said.\nThe Recovery in GDP\nBullard noted that most of the main components of real GDP are at a higher level today\nthan they were in the fourth quarter of 2007, which marked the previous business cycle\npeak. While consumption, government expenditures, imports and exports have all\nrecovered, investment remains about 16 percent below its level in the fourth quarter of\n2007.\nBullard added that real investment in nonresidential structures and real private\nresidential investment are especially low compared to the business cycle peak. While\nGDP would be an estimated 4.2 percent higher if the investment component had\nrecovered to the extent that consumption has, he said that “it is not reasonable to think\nthat these particular areas of investment should robustly expand in the aftermath of a\ncollapsed real estate bubble.”\n\n\fThus, Bullard said that the previous business cycle peak is not a good benchmark for\nGDP growth. “It is not reasonable to expect the economy to climb rapidly back to the\n2007 Q4 peak since part of that peak was due to arti cial growth driven by bubble\nbehavior,” he said. “A more reasonable interpretation is that fundamental potential\ngrowth in the U.S. has been somewhat lower than previously thought.” He added that\nthe behavior of in ation during the past year provides some evidence for this.\nMonetary Policy\n“The FOMC’s asset purchase program clearly drove both in ation and in ation\nexpectations higher and closer to the Committee’s implicit target over the last year,”\nBullard said. Given that actual real economic performance was weaker than the FOMC\nanticipated last fall, according to the July 29 GDP report, “this should have meant less\nin ation, not more,” he stated.\n“This suggests that the output gap may have been considerably smaller than previously\nthought, and perhaps also that the output gap has considerably less in uence on\nin ation than commonly thought,” Bullard said. “The larger in uence on actual in ation\ncomes from in ation expectations,” which have tended to be higher over the past year,\naccording to TIPS measures, he noted.\nBullard also shared his views on the FOMC’s policy tools going forward. “The\nCommittee needs to be able to conduct a systematic countercyclical monetary policy\nduring the period of near-zero policy rates,” he said. He noted that “asset purchases are\na potent tool and must be employed carefully” and cited the increase in in ation and\nin ation expectations during the past year, despite many measures of economic\nperformance indicating a relatively weak economy. “The meeting-by-meeting approach\nwould allow the Committee to carefully monitor and adjust any program,” he stated.\nBullard said the FOMC could use the promised date of the rst interest rate increase,\nwhich is the so-called communications tool, as the primary policy tool during the\nupcoming period of near-zero policy rates. According to some models, he said, the\nCommittee could in uence nancial market conditions and provide monetary\naccommodation by shifting the promised date. He noted that while the\ncommunications tool may work inside models, it has some important caveats for the\napplication of policy. For example, he said it is not clear how credible the\nannouncements would be. “If the economy is actually performing quite well at the\npoint in the future where the promise begins to bite, then the Committee may simply\nabandon the promise and return to normal policy,” he said. “But this behavior, if\nunderstood by markets, would cancel out the initial effects of the promise, and so\nnothing would be accomplished by making the initial promise.”\nBullard talked about another drawback to the communications tool, which he also\ndiscussed in his paper, “Seven Faces of ‘The Peril,’” published in 2010. “Simply\npromising to keep the policy rate near-zero for longer and longer periods of time may\nencourage a Japanese-style outcome in which the policy rate simply remains near zero\nand markets come to expect a mild rate of de ation,” he said. “This possibility has\nclear support in the theoretical literature but is too often ignored in policy discussions.”\n\nGENERAL\nHome\nAbout Us\nBank Supervision\nCareers\n\n\fCommunity Development\nEconomic Education\nEvents\nInside the Economy Museum\nNewsroom\nOn the Economy Blog\nOpen Vault Blog\nOUR DISTRICT\nLittle Rock Branch\nLouisville Branch\nMemphis Branch\nAgricultural Finance Monitor\nHousing Market Conditions\nSELECTED PUBLICATIONS\nBridges\nEconomic Synopses\nHousing Market Perspectives\nIn the Balance\nPage One Economics\nThe Quarterly Debt Monitor\nReview\nRegional Economist\nST.

First, he said,\n“Going forward, policy should strive to be more rules-based and less discretionary than\nit has been in the last three years.” Second, he said that monetary policy can affect the\neconomy through in ation and expected in ation, which would affect real interest\nrates. The FOMC could in uence expected in ation via outright asset purchases, he\nexplained, adding that a “meeting-by-meeting approach would allow the Committee to\ncarefully monitor and adjust any program.” Third, he said the FOMC should remain\naware of the Japanese example, whereby relying solely on promises of low policy rates\nfor longer and longer periods of time may be a path to a Japanese-style outcome, and\nthus, may be counterproductive. In addition, he said that tying a promise of low policy\nrates to unemployment outcomes, for example, could pull monetary policy off course\nfor decades.\nSluggish Economic Growth\nBullard noted that while the pace of economic recovery has been disappointing, most\ncomponents of real GDP, such as real consumption expenditures, have recovered to or\nbeyond their levels in the fourth quarter of 2007. Investment, however, remains about\n16 percent below its 2007 Q4 level, in large part because of weakness in residential\ninvestment and investment in nonresidential structures. “This looks like a collapsed\nreal estate bubble,” Bullard said. He added that if the investment component of GDP\nhad recovered to the extent that consumption has recovered, GDP would be an\nestimated 4.2 percent higher. However, he said that “it is not reasonable to think that\nthese particular areas of investment should robustly expand in the aftermath of a\ncollapsed real estate bubble.”\n\n\fBullard said that he still expects modest and improving economic growth over the next\nyear, although the current sluggish growth does leave the U.S. economy vulnerable to\nfurther negative shocks. He stated that monetary policy would need to respond\nappropriately should further weakness in the economy develop. He stressed that\nalthough the FOMC cannot currently operate through its preferred channel—that is,\nshort-term nominal interest rates—the Committee still has tools that it can use should\nfurther monetary policy action be warranted. He then discussed some guidelines\nconcerning monetary policy going forward in this period of near-zero interest rates.\nEmbrace Rule-Like Behavior\nBullard said that most of the monetary policy actions pursued during the period of nearzero nominal interest rates have not been consistent with notions of optimal policy\ndeveloped over the past several decades. Instead, he noted, recent actions have been\ncharacterized by one-time policy announcements with xed end dates. To be sure,\nmost of the economic literature from the past 30 years has emphasized that “a policy is\nnot a one-time action but a rule mapping economic circumstances into changes in the\npolicy instrument both today and in the future,” he said.\n“The Committee in the past did not contemplate announcing several hundred basis\npoint interest rate moves with a xed end date. Yet that is how the Committee behaves\ntoday,” Bullard said. He further explained that instead, the Committee adjusted the\npolicy rate meeting-by-meeting in reaction to economic events and also announced a\ncontinuation value, or bias, concerning future policy announcements—an approach that\nhe said served the FOMC well for decades.\nIn today’s environment, Bullard said that “the Committee can still control in ation\nthrough an appropriate balance sheet policy,” and the principle of adjusting policy\nmeeting-by-meeting applies here as well. “A meeting-by-meeting balance sheet policy\nconstitutes a rules-based policy because the Committee would make adjustments in\nresponse to economic events, just as in the interest rate targeting world,” Bullard said.\nIn contrast, the policy approach in recent years—announcing large dollar amounts, xed\nend dates and rapidly changing tactics—seems fairly discretionary, he stated.\n“Returning to a more rules-based approach may provide needed stability to the U.S.\nmacroeconomy.”\nMonetary Policy Transmission\nWith nominal interest rates so close to zero, Bullard said that monetary policy can be\ntransmitted through in ation and expected in ation. When the policy rate is near zero,\nhigher expected in ation leads to lower real interest rates. He noted that a monetary\nauthority’s outright purchases of government debt are considered in ationary, and this\nis supported by international evidence throughout history. “This channel can be used to\nhelp keep in ation near target during the current unusual circumstance, and to help\nprovide some support to the nation’s economic recovery,” he said.\nBullard stressed that “outright asset purchases are a potent tool and must be employed\ncarefully” and cited the increase in in ation and in ation expectations during the past\nyear, despite many measures of economic performance indicating a relatively weak\neconomy. (For evidence of the effectiveness of the FOMC’s second large-scale asset\npurchases program, see Bullard’s recent commentary.) Thus, for this policy, he said\nthat “the Committee still has to judge tradeoffs between in ation and support for the\nrecovery.”\nSome Alternative Approaches\n\n\fBullard said the FOMC could use the promised date of the rst interest rate increase,\nwhich is the so-called communications tool, as the primary policy tool during the\nupcoming period of near-zero policy rates. According to some models, he said, the\nCommittee could in uence nancial market conditions and provide monetary\naccommodation by shifting the promised date. He noted that while the\ncommunications tool may work inside models, it has some important caveats for the\napplication of policy. For example, he said it is not clear how credible the\nannouncements would be. “If the economy is actually performing quite well at the\npoint in the future where the promise begins to bite, then the Committee may simply\nabandon the promise and return to normal policy,” he said. “But this behavior, if\nunderstood by markets, would cancel out the initial effects of the promise, and so\nnothing would be accomplished by making the initial promise.”\nBullard talked about another drawback to the communications tool, which he also\ndiscussed in his paper, “Seven Faces of ‘The Peril’,” published in 2010. “Simply\npromising to keep the policy rate near-zero for longer and longer periods of time may\nencourage a Japanese-style outcome in which the policy rate simply remains near zero\nand markets come to expect a mild rate of de ation,” he said. Despite clear support for\nthis possibility in both the theoretical literature and the Japanese data, Bullard stated\nthat it continues to be ignored too often in policy discussions.\nAnother option to the communications tool would be for the FOMC to tie a promise of\nnear-zero policy rates to actual economic outcomes, such as the unemployment rate,\nBullard said. However, he noted that some advanced economies have experienced the\nsituation where unemployment rose and stayed high; this has occurred in Europe during\nthe past 30 years, for example. “If such an outcome happened in the U.S., and\nmonetary policy was explicitly tied to unemployment outcomes, monetary policy could\nbe pulled off course for a generation,” he stated.\n\nGENERAL\nHome\nAbout Us\nBank Supervision\nCareers\nCommunity Development\nEconomic Education\nEvents\nInside the Economy Museum\nNewsroom\nOn the Economy Blog\nOpen Vault Blog\nOUR DISTRICT\nLittle Rock Branch\nLouisville Branch\nMemphis Branch\nAgricultural Finance Monitor\n\n\fHousing Market Conditions\nSELECTED PUBLICATIONS\nBridges\nEconomic Synopses\nHousing Market Perspectives\nIn the Balance\nPage One Economics\nThe Quarterly Debt Monitor\nReview\nRegional Economist\nST.

            "content": "Opening remarks by President James Bullard\n36th Annual Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Fall Conference\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nOct. 20-21, 2011\n\nIt is my pleasure to welcome you to the St. Louis Fed’s fall conference. This is the 36th year for\nthis conference. I want to thank B. Ravikumar and Juan Sanchez for putting this very\nprovocative program together. I am looking forward to the stimulating discussion these papers\nare sure to inspire over the next day and a half.\nAt the St. Louis Fed, we have long tried to provide perspectives on whether the policies\nadopted in the past still serve us well today and whether recent developments at the frontier of\nresearch can be fruitfully applied to improve policy. This agenda has become especially\nimportant in the last few years, as the Fed and central banks around the world have struggled\nto devise appropriate policy responses to the current macroeconomic situation.\nIn polite economist society, there has long been a distinction between what is known as\n“frontier” research and what is sometimes called “policy” research. In my view, this has been\nand continues to be a false dichotomy. There is no such distinction: “Policy” and “frontier”\nresearch are two sides of the same coin. We need to understand both how fundamental\nmechanisms in the economy operate as well as how current data can be interpreted in terms of\nfundamental theory.\nIn short, advanced economic theory has to be made more relevant for actual policy, and actual\npolicy has to understand and embrace the difficult ideas advanced in the theoretical world. The\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis has long been a leader in supporting basic research at the\nintersection of economic theory and economic policy.\nWe are fortunate this year to have an outstanding group of speakers whose research expands\nour understanding of key contemporary issues in macroeconomics. This year’s conference\ncovers a wide range of topics: From economic fluctuations to sovereign debt; from international\ntrade to innovation and long-run growth.\nOn the more current and shorter-term macroeconomic issues, we have papers examining\n•\n\noptimal monetary and fiscal policy at the zero lower bound,\n\n\f•\n•\n•\n•\n\nthe role of self-fulfilling prophecies in business cycles and in the sovereign debt crisis in\nEurope,\nthe role of demand shocks in business cycle fluctuations,\nwhy global trade dropped so much during the Great Recession, and\nthe implications of the tax treatment of debt on financial leverage.\n\nWe also have a group of papers studying longer-term macroeconomic issues, including\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nthe role of informational frictions in finance and development,\nunderstanding innovation policy,\nthe relationship among health investment, consumption, and wealth, and\nhow the allocation of talent affects long-term growth.\n\nI know that these papers and the ideas they contain will contribute importantly to the\nmacroeconomic discussion in the coming years as the papers are eventually published and the\nresults become more widely known in the profession. The St. Louis Fed is proud to provide this\nforum for discussion and analysis of the leading issues of the day.\nLet me again welcome all of you to the St. Louis Fed’s fall conference. Thanks very much for\ncoming, and now let’s get to work!\n\nJames Bullard, President and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\n\n\f",

LOUIS – Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard delivered\nremarks titled “The U.S. Macroeconomic Situation and Monetary Policy” on Tuesday at\nan event sponsored by the CFA Society of St. Louis.\nRegarding the macroeconomic outlook, Bullard said the U.S. economy has avoided the\n“recession scare” of August. “Despite drops in con dence, hard data on the U.S.\neconomy continues to show moderate growth,” he said. Bullard noted that the Federal\nOpen Market Committee (FOMC) in recent months has warned about “substantial\ndownside risks,” mostly coming from Europe. If the European situation worsens, he\nsaid, the Fed can re-open some of the liquidity facilities used during 2008-2009.\nDuring his discussion on monetary policy, Bullard said that “outright asset purchases\nare a potent tool and must be employed carefully.” He also talked about the Fed’s\ncommunications tool and the idea of tying a promise of near-zero policy rates to a\nnumerical unemployment outcome. “Tying monetary policy directly to the level of\nunemployment is unwise,” he concluded.\nThe Recession Scare\nBullard noted that in August 2011, forecasters marked up the probability of a U.S.\nrecession occurring in the second half of the year. He attributed most of this to the\nJuly 29 gross domestic product (GDP) report, which included downward revisions to\nrecent GDP data.\nWhile the debt ceiling debate and the European sovereign debt crisis have lowered\nconsumer and business con dence, Bullard said that household and business behavior\ndid not change enough to validate the recession predictions. He explained that Europe\nis generally viewed as too distant to force a major change in households’ behavior, and\nlarge businesses tend to have growth strategies in Asia rather than Europe.\nThe European Situation\nIn regard to the European situation, Bullard said that “events in Europe pit a slowmoving political process against a fast-moving nancial crisis.” While “results are\nunpredictable at this point,” he said, “European leaders tend to be very supportive of\nkeeping the ‘European Project’ of ever-greater European integration moving forward.”\nRecent Monetary Policy\n\n\fWhile outright asset purchases are a potent monetary policy tool, Bullard said they\nmust be used carefully because “increases in the size of the balance sheet entail\nadditional in ationary risks if accommodation is not removed at an appropriate pace.”\nHe noted that in ation and in ation expectations rose during the past year, despite\nmany measures of economic performance indicating a relatively weak economy. “With\nthe policy rate at zero, this means real short-term rates have declined,” he said. (For\nevidence of the effectiveness of the FOMC’s second large-scale asset purchases\nprogram, see Bullard’s recent commentary.)\nBullard said that “a meeting-by-meeting balance sheet policy constitutes a rules-based\napproach because the Committee would make adjustments in response to economic\nevents, just as in the interest rate targeting world.” In contrast, he said, “the policy\napproach of the last several years, with announcements of large dollar amounts, xed\nend dates, and rapidly changing tactics, seems fairly discretionary.”\nAlternative Approaches\nShould further monetary accommodation be necessary, Bullard said the FOMC could\nuse the promised date of the rst interest rate increase, which is the so-called\ncommunications tool, as the primary policy tool during the upcoming period of nearzero policy rates. He noted that while shifting the promised date in order to in uence\nnancial market conditions may work inside some models, this tool has some\nimportant caveats for the application of policy.\nFor example, Bullard said it is not clear how credible the announcements would be.\nNon-credible announcements would simply “fall at,” he added. “If the economy is\nactually performing quite well at the point in the future where the promise begins to\nbite, then the Committee may simply abandon the promise and return to normal policy,”\nhe said. “But this behavior, if understood by markets, would cancel out the initial\neffects of the promise, and so nothing would be accomplished by making the initial\npromise.”\nBullard also discussed two possible alternatives to in ation targeting—targeting the\nprice level and targeting the level of nominal income. He said that according to some\nliterature, price-level targeting would provide better outcomes than in ation targeting.\nTargeting the level of nominal income is an older idea, he stated. Fed Chairman Ben\nBernanke has said the FOMC would continue using its exible in ation targeting\nframework, Bullard noted.\nAnother policy option would be for the FOMC to tie a promise of near-zero policy rates\nto actual economic outcomes, such as a numerical unemployment outcome, Bullard\nsaid. However, he noted that most proposals for using this tool tie monetary policy to\nan actual unemployment rate but an anticipated in ation rate. “This asymmetry is hard\nto justify,” Bullard explained.\nFurthermore, “unemployment rates have a checkered history in advanced economies\nover the last several decades,” Bullard said. He cited the example of Europe, where\nunemployment rose and has simply remained high during the past 30 years. “If such an\noutcome happened in the U.S. and monetary policy was tied to a numerical\nunemployment outcome, monetary policy could be pulled off course for a generation,”\nhe said.\nBullard noted that labor market policies (e.g., unemployment insurance, worker\nretraining) have direct effects on the unemployed. In contrast, he said, “monetary policy\nis a blunt instrument which affects the decision-making of everyone in the economy.”\nIn particular, low interest rates hurt savers, he stated. “It may be better to focus on\nlabor market policies to address unemployment instead of monetary policy.”\n\n\fGENERAL\nHome\nAbout Us\nBank Supervision\nCareers\nCommunity Development\nEconomic Education\nEvents\nInside the Economy Museum\nNewsroom\nOn the Economy Blog\nOpen Vault Blog\nOUR DISTRICT\nLittle Rock Branch\nLouisville Branch\nMemphis Branch\nAgricultural Finance Monitor\nHousing Market Conditions\nSELECTED PUBLICATIONS\nBridges\nEconomic Synopses\nHousing Market Perspectives\nIn the Balance\nPage One Economics\nThe Quarterly Debt Monitor\nReview\nRegional Economist\nST.

The event was\nheld during the annual meeting of the American Economic Association/Allied Social\nScience Associations.\nIn his remarks, Bullard discussed business cycle stabilization using scal rather than\nmonetary policy. The former attempts to react to aggregate shocks to the economy\nthrough changes in taxes and spending, while the latter reacts to aggregate shocks by\ntargeting the nominal interest rate or by in uencing in ation and in ation expectations\nthrough quantitative easing when the interest rate is at the zero lower bound.\nBullard noted that over the two decades leading up to the nancial crisis, the\nconventional wisdom concerning macroeconomic stabilization was that scal policy\nwas in fact not a good tool. Shorter-run stabilization issues should be handled by the\nmonetary authority while scal authorities should focus on a stable taxing and\nspending regime to achieve economic and political goals over the medium and long\nrun.\nIn late 2008, the Federal Open Market Committee set the policy rate at 0 to 25 basis\npoints, effectively at the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates. This led many to\nconclude, erroneously in Bullard’s view, that the burden for short-term macroeconomic\nstabilization had shifted to scal policy. Thus, the last three years have detoured from\nthe conventional wisdom.\nThere has been a very active literature on when the scal approach to business cycle\nstabilization would be useful and effective. Bullard cited a paper by Michael\nWoodford[1] in which Woodford notes that “while a case for aggressive scal stimulus\ncan be made under certain circumstances, such policy must be designed with care if it\nis to have the desired effect.” The literature assumes that monetary business cycle\nstabilization policy is ineffective once the zero lower bound is encountered. In addition,\nthe types of policy experiments considered in this literature involve extra government\nspending and taxation only during the period when the zero bound is a binding\nconstraint and nancial markets are in considerable turmoil.\nGiven current conditions, Bullard pointed out three caveats related to the assumptions\nin Woodford’s paper:\n\n\f1. The political process is ill-suited to make the types of timely and subtle decisions\nthat are called for based on the literature.\n2. Bullard emphasized that, in fact, “monetary policy has been quite effective, even\nwhile the policy rate has been at the zero lower bound.” Thus, he said, “it is not\nnecessary or desirable to turn to scal stabilization policy.”\n3. While the literature says that taxes should be collected simultaneously with the\nincrease in government spending, the actual policy for many countries involved\nheavy reliance on government borrowing. Increased debt would be interpreted in\nthe literature as delayed taxes.\nBullard also discussed issues related to debt sustainability and argued that low interest\nrates may not be a good indicator of the probability of a debt crisis.\nBullard concluded that “the turn toward scal approaches to stabilization policy has run\nits course, and that the conventional wisdom that existed in the decades prior to 2007\nis being re-established in the U.S.” Therefore, “stabilization policy should be left to the\nmonetary authority, which can operate effectively even at the zero lower bound,” Bullard\nsaid. And, scal authorities should set the tax and spending programs in a way that\nmakes economic and political sense for the medium to longer term. In particular, “a\nstable tax code aligned with a stable plan of government spending would allow\nbusinesses and households to plan for the future in the most effective way,” Bullard\nnoted.\n[1] Woodford, M. 2011 “Simple Analytics of the Government Expenditure Multiplier.”\nAmerican Economic Journal: Macroeconomics 3: 1-35.\n\nGENERAL\nHome\nAbout Us\nBank Supervision\nCareers\nCommunity Development\nEconomic Education\nEvents\nInside the Economy Museum\nNewsroom\nOn the Economy Blog\nOpen Vault Blog\nOUR DISTRICT\nLittle Rock Branch\nLouisville Branch\nMemphis Branch\nAgricultural Finance Monitor\nHousing Market Conditions\nSELECTED PUBLICATIONS\nBridges\nEconomic Synopses\n\n\fHousing Market Perspectives\nIn the Balance\nPage One Economics\nThe Quarterly Debt Monitor\nReview\nRegional Economist\nST.

            "content": "Death of a Theory\nExecutive Summary\nIn this article, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard discusses business cycle\nstabilization using fiscal rather than monetary policy. He concludes that the turn in recent years toward\nfiscal approaches to stabilization policy has run its course and that the conventional wisdom of the past\nseveral decades is reasserting itself. In short, the conventional wisdom says that stabilization is the realm\nof monetary policy and that fiscal policy should focus on medium- and longer-run goals.\nMacroeconomic stabilization policy means reacting in a timely manner to aggregate shocks that hit the\neconomy and in a way that smoothes out an otherwise rocky ride for the economy’s businesses and\nhouseholds. Fiscal policy attempts to do this through changes in taxes and government spending, and\nmonetary policy attempts to do this by targeting the nominal interest rate or, when the interest rate is near\nzero, by influencing inflation and inflation expectations primarily through quantitative easing.\nBullard notes that over the two decades leading up to the financial crisis, the conventional wisdom was\nthat fiscal policy was not a good tool for macroeconomic stabilization. Conventional wisdom suggested\nthat shorter-run stabilization issues should be handled by the monetary authority and that fiscal authorities\nshould focus on a stable taxing and spending regime to achieve economic and political goals over the\nmedium and longer run. This state of affairs lasted, broadly speaking, until the fall of 2008.\nAt that point, the short-term nominal interest rate targeted by the Federal Open Market Committee was\npushed nearly to zero, where it remains to this day. This led many to conclude that the burden for shortterm macroeconomic stabilization had, as a result, shifted to fiscal policy. Indeed, over the past three\nyears, we have seen numerous attempts at stabilization policy by fiscal authorities in the U.S. and around\nthe globe. Bullard argues that the net effect of these attempts has been to confirm much of the\nconventional wisdom regarding fiscal stabilization policy that existed prior to the financial crisis.\nMuch research has been published on when the fiscal approach to business cycle stabilization would be\nuseful and effective. Bullard cites a paper by Michael Woodford 1 in which Woodford notes that “while a\ncase for aggressive fiscal stimulus can be made under certain circumstances, such policy must be\ndesigned with care if it is to have the desired effect.” This line of research assumes that monetary\nbusiness cycle stabilization policy is ineffective and unable to influence real interest rates once the policy\nrate is near zero. In addition, the types of policy experiments considered in this research involve extra\ngovernment spending and taxation only during the period when the policy rate is near zero and financial\nmarkets are in considerable turmoil, and not any longer than that.\nThree key issues related to the assumptions in Woodford’s paper lead Bullard to doubt the merits of\npossible fiscal stabilization programs for the present circumstances. These three issues are:\n1. The types of fiscal policy interventions recommended in the research are fairly intricate and must\nbe designed carefully if they are to have the desired effect. However, the conventional wisdom\non fiscal stabilization policy emphasizes that political processes in the U.S. and elsewhere are not\nwell-suited to make timely and subtle decisions like these.\n\n1\n\nMichael Woodford, 2011. “Simple Analytics of the Government Expenditure Multiplier.” American Economic\nJournal: Macroeconomics 3: 1-35.\n\n\f2. Bullard emphasizes that monetary stabilization policy has been quite effective, even while the\npolicy rate has been near zero. This is because the monetary policy authority can use many other\ntools to influence inflation and inflation expectations. Thus, a turn toward fiscal stabilization\npolicy is not necessary.\n3. Although the research says that taxes should be collected simultaneously with the increase in\ngovernment spending, the actual fiscal stabilization policy for many countries has involved heavy\nreliance on government borrowing. This increased debt would be interpreted as promised future\ntaxes. However, shifting the taxes into the future can undo most or all of the benefits that might\notherwise come from the fiscal stabilization program.\nIn light of increased debt in the West, Bullard discusses issues related to debt sustainability. According to\nresearch on the topic, “too much debt” for a sovereign nation will be defined by the point where the\ntemporary benefits of default exactly offset the value of continued access to international credit markets.\nThe research says markets will understand the incentive to default and, thus, will not lend to a nation\nbeyond this point. Bullard argues that debt yields alone are not the best way to evaluate whether a nation\nis borrowing too much; that is, low interest rates may not be a good indicator of the probability of a debt\ncrisis. A look at the data for selected European countries, such as Greece and Portugal, from 2000 to the\npresent confirms this.\nBullard concludes that the conventional wisdom on stabilization policy is being re-established in the U.S.\nStabilization policy should be left to the monetary authority, which can operate effectively even with a\nnear-zero policy rate. Fiscal authorities should set the tax and spending programs in a way that makes\neconomic and political sense for the medium to longer term. In particular, a stable tax code that is aligned\nwith a stable plan of government spending would allow businesses and households to plan for the future\nin the most effective way.\n\n\f",

            "content": "Inflation Targeting in the USA 1\nUnion League Club of Chicago, Breakfast@65West\nChicago, Ill.\nFeb. 6, 2012\n\nThe FOMC Sets an Inflation Target\nAt the January meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) took an important step\nforward by naming an explicit, numerical inflation target for the U.S. of 2 percent, as measured\nby the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index. In taking this action, the Federal\nReserve has joined many central banks around the world that have set explicit inflation targets\nover the past two decades. This step has been a goal of Chairman Bernanke’s since he joined\nthe Fed nearly a decade ago. I want to congratulate the Chairman on this accomplishment,\nwhich I believe will serve the nation well for years to come.\nIn a targeting context, inflation means headline inflation. It does not make sense to ignore\nsome inconveniently volatile prices, like those for gas or food, when discussing the inflation rate\nactually faced by U.S. households. 2 By the headline PCE measure, U.S. inflation is running\nsomewhat above target right now, at 2.4 percent measured from one year ago. This rate has\nbeen moderating in recent reports. Inflation is up sharply when compared with the autumn of\n2010, when PCE inflation measured from one year earlier hit a low of about 1.2 percent. We\nare double that rate right now.\nInflation targeting emphasizes control over inflation as the key long-term goal of monetary\npolicy. This makes sense because the central bank can only influence inflation and not any real\nmacroeconomic variable in the long run. As is well known, the actions of the FOMC can also\ntemporarily influence the direction of the economy in the short run, but only temporarily. This\ninfluence can be used to help mitigate short-run gyrations in economic activity, thus smoothing\nout an otherwise bumpy ride for U.S. households and businesses. This is often described as\nmonetary stabilization policy. The amount of smoothing that can actually be accomplished\nthrough this channel is meaningful, but not particularly large, a fact which is often lost in\n1\n\nAny opinions expressed here are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of others on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee. I thank my staff for helpful comments, including Riccardo DiCecio, Cletus Coughlin, Karen\nBranding, Chris Waller, Dan Thornton and Marcela Williams.\n2\nFor more on this theme, see James Bullard, “Measuring Inflation: The Core is Rotten,” Federal Reserve Bank of St.\nLouis Review, July/August 2011, 93(4), pp. 223-233.\n\n\fcontemporary discussions. Putting an explicit inflation target together with a sensible\nstabilization policy is often called flexible inflation targeting. This is the policy that has been\nadopted by the FOMC and that follows the practice of many other central banks around the\nworld during the last twenty years.\nFlexible inflation targeting enables central banks to conduct a stabilization program and make it\nas effective as it can be made without departing from the longer-run goal of keeping inflation\nlow and stable. This reflects a conventional wisdom borne of the 1970s, namely, that allowing\ninflation to rise and accelerate not only is not helpful for the macroeconomy, but is actually\nvery damaging. During the 1970s, U.S. inflation eventually rose to double-digit levels, and this\nwas accompanied by especially poor macroeconomic performance on the real side of the\neconomy. The lesson for U.S. policymakers and many others around the world has been that\nhigh inflation just causes problems and does nothing to help address fundamental\nmacroeconomic issues.\nTo run the flexible inflation targeting program, one needs a concept of where the economy\nwould ideally be operating versus where it is actually operating. This leads us to the topic of\noutput gaps.\n\nOutput Gaps: The Wrong Idea\nThe recent recession has given rise to the idea that there is a very large “output gap” in the U.S.\nThe story is that this large output gap is “keeping inflation at bay” and is fodder for keeping\nnominal interest rates near zero into an indefinite future. If we continue using this\ninterpretation of events, it may be very difficult for the U.S. to ever move off of the zero lower\nbound on nominal interest rates. This could be a looming disaster for the United States. I want\nto now turn to argue that the large output gap view may be conceptually inappropriate in the\ncurrent situation. We may do better to replace it with the notion of a permanent, one-time\nshock to wealth.\nThe key to the large output gap story is the use of the fourth quarter of 2007 as a benchmark\nfor where we expect the economy to be today. The idea is to take that level of real output,\nassume the real GDP growth rate that prevailed in the years prior to 2007, and project out\nwhere the “potential” output of the U.S. should be. By that type of calculation, we are indeed\nstunningly far below where we should be, perhaps 5.5 percent below, using data through the\n\n\ffourth quarter of 2011.3 What is more, we have made little progress in closing the gap defined\nin this way, because real GDP has only grown at modest rates since the recession ended in the\nsummer of 2009. And furthermore, using current GDP forecasts from, say, the Blue Chip\nconsensus, we have little prospect for closing the gap any time soon.\nIs this really the right way to think about where the U.S. economy should be? I do not think it is\na defensible point of view. Let me give you some of my perspectives.\nMost analysts seem to agree that the middle part of the 2000s was characterized by a “bubble”\nin the housing sector. Housing prices were high and rising fast compared to nominal GDP. It is\nnot prudent to extrapolate a bubble into the indefinite future and claim that such a calculation\nprovides a good benchmark. Yet, that is what we are doing when we extrapolate fourth quarter\n2007 real GDP. Furthermore, we normally have the good sense not to do this in other\neconomic situations.\nThink about the tech bubble of the late 1990s and early 2000s. The NASDAQ index peaked at\nabout 4800 on a monthly average basis in March 2000. In the month just passed, January 2012,\nit averaged about 2744, which is 57 percent of its peak value. In fact, with the type of\ncalculation usually done for real GDP, which extrapolates growth rates, the NASDAQ would be\nmiles below its “potential.” Of course, most observers and market participants do not say that\nthe NASDAQ is far below its potential value today. Instead, most say that there was clearly a\nbubble in the NASDAQ during the late 1990s and early 2000s, and that today’s valuations are\nmore sensible than the ones that were in vogue during the bubble period.\nWhen I put the case this starkly, I think many would agree that establishing a benchmark by\nextrapolating from the previous peak of a variable, when that variable was clearly influenced by\na bubble, is a mistake. It gives a distorted view of the situation.\n\nA Level Shock\nA better interpretation of the behavior of U.S. real GDP over the last five years may be that the\neconomy was disrupted by a permanent, one-time shock to wealth. 4 In particular, the\nperceived value of U.S. real estate fell substantially with the 30 percent decline in housing\n3\n\nThis value can be calculated based on the Congressional Budget Office potential output series.\nMacroeconomists like me often use the word “permanent,’’ even though nothing is really permanent. Think of\npermanent as “exceptionally persistent.”\n\n4\n\n\fprices after 2006. This shaved trillions of dollars off of the wealth of the nation. Since housing\nprices are not expected to rebound to the previous peak anytime soon, that wealth is simply\ngone for now. This has lowered consumption and output, and lower levels of production have\ncaused a significant disruption in U.S. labor markets.\nSo what’s the point, you ask? Well, to me, the important difference is what happens after the\nshock.\nFor those who take the “large output gap” view, the expectation is for real GDP to grow rapidly\nafter the recession comes to an end, as the economy catches up to its potential. It is like a\nrubber band, there is supposed to be a bounce back period of rapid growth. In fact, most\nanalysts have been looking for exactly this effect since the summer of 2009. It has not\nhappened. This has led to a lot of analysis concerning special factors and headwinds that might\nbe inhibiting the “bounce back” effect.\nThe wealth shock view puts a different expectation in play. The negative wealth shock lowers\nconsumption and output. But after the recession ends, the economy simply grows from that\npoint at an ordinary rate, neither faster nor slower than in ordinary times. It is more like an\nearthquake which has left one part of the land higher than another part. There is no\nexpectation of a “bounce back” to a higher level of output after the recession ends. This is\ncloser to what has actually happened since mid-2009. Output has grown at a moderate rate,\nbut not a rapid rate, since the recession ended.\nIn the wealth shock view, there is no “large output gap” rationale for keeping interest rates\nnear zero. There is only an economy growing at normal rates following a large shock to wealth.\nI mentioned that a wealth shock significantly upsets labor market relationships. This is because\noutput declines, so less labor is required. It takes a long time for those displaced by the shock\nto find new working relationships. I would expect to see high unemployment and only slow\nimprovement in labor markets following the wealth shock.\nOne might say that the peak in U.S. housing prices represented an overvaluation, and in my\nview, that would be right. Valuing the physical capital stock of the nation is always a tricky\nproposition. The entire stock, on the order of three times GDP, or $45 trillion, cannot\nmeaningfully be marketed all at once. Still, we do observe bits and pieces of the physical\ncapital stock being bought and sold at any point in time, and those prices can help us notionally\nvalue the entire portfolio. Those prices of bits and pieces could be driven by beliefs alone—\nsuch as the belief that housing prices only go up—and become temporarily detached from\n\n\ffundamental supply and demand factors. This may make it appear that real estate is worth\nmore than it really is, and lead many to make what in retrospect are poor economic decisions,\nsuch as taking on too much debt and consuming too much.\nMany prices in the economy may at times seem to be far away from anything that could be\nrationalized purely by supply and demand. But housing prices are special in that they represent\nvaluations on a significant fraction of the wealth of the nation, defined as the value of the\nphysical capital stock. To have those prices fall hard and stay down without much prospect for\nrapid recovery is a one-time, permanent wealth shock. This is a different type of shock than the\nones that have caused previous postwar U.S. recessions.\n\nThe Costs of Near-Zero Rates\nI have argued that the large output gap view may be keeping us all prisoner—tethering our\nexpectations for output, in effect, to the collapsed bubble in housing. It is setting a very high\nbar for the U.S. economy, one that may not be appropriate given the nature of the shock that\nthe economy has suffered. Importantly, it may influence the FOMC’s near-zero rate policy far\ninto the future, since output is continually viewed as falling short of the high-bar benchmark.\nBut the near-zero rate policy has its own costs. If we were proposing to remain near-zero for a\nfew quarters, or even a year or two, one might argue that such a policy matches up well with\nthe short-term business cycle dynamics of the U.S. economy. But a near-zero rate policy\nstretching over many years can begin to distort fundamental decision-making in the economy in\nways that may be destructive to longer-run economic growth.\nIn particular, the lengthy near-zero rate policy punishes savers in the economy. Because of life\ncycle effects, most of the asset holding in the economy is done by older Americans. Recent\nreadings from the TIPS market suggest a 10-year real rate of return of minus 30 basis points or\nso, and a five-year real rate of return of about minus 120 basis points. These are extraordinarily\nlow—substantially negative—real rates of return over very long time scales, and they are driven\nin part by FOMC policy.\nThese low rates of return mean that some of the consumption that would otherwise be enjoyed\nby the older, asset-holding households has been pared back. In principle, the low real interest\nrates should encourage younger generations to borrow against their future income prospects\nand consume more today. However, this demographic group faces high unemployment rates\n\n\fand tighter borrowing constraints, which may limit its ability and willingness to leverage up to\nfinance consumption. Consequently, the consumption of the older generations may be\ndamaged by the low real interest rates without any countervailing increase in consumption by\nother households in the economy. In this sense, the policy could be counterproductive.\nAgain, these broader effects of a low real interest rate policy might not be so critical in an\nenvironment where the low yields last for a few quarters, but they may be significantly more\nimportant as the length of time is stretched out over many years.\n\nConclusion\nThe FOMC has adopted an explicit, numerical inflation target. This is an important\ndevelopment, as it may prevent the U.S. from repeating the mistakes of the 1970s, in which a\nmisreading of the size of the output gap led the Fed to maintain easy monetary policies for far\ntoo long.\nInflation targeting in the U.S. will be flexible, matching a desire to keep inflation low and stable\nin the long run with the challenge of providing some business cycle stabilization in the shorter\nterm. One of the key issues in stabilization policy is the benchmark against which economic\nperformance is measured.\nI have argued that the “large output gap” benchmark, in which current economic performance\nis continually compared to the bubble-influenced mid-2000s, may not be realistic. Instead, one\nmay want to interpret the recent U.S. experience as a one-time, permanent shock to wealth.\n\nJames Bullard, President and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\n\n\f",

The paper is part of\nthe 2012 U.S. Monetary Policy Forum.\n\n*\n\nThis version: 23 February 2012. I appreciate helpful comments from the St. Louis Fed research\nstaff, especially Bill Emmons, Carlos Garriga, and Rajdeep Sengupta. Any views expressed are\nmy own and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n\f1\n\nTwo trend lines\n\nI am pleased to be here at the U.S. Monetary Policy Forum to comment on\nthis very nice paper by Michael Feroli, Ethan Harris, Amir Su…, and Ken\nWest. It represents the best of what this Forum is about. In particular, it\nbrings together judgments from academia, the private sector, and the policy\nworld to better inform all of us on a key issue. I certainly learned a lot from\nthis paper and I recommend it to all of you if you have not already read it.\nLet me …rst lay out a big picture issue as I see it and then turn to a few\nmore speci…c comments on the paper.\nIt has become commonplace in the past several years to refer to the mid2000s as a real estate price “bubble” that has burst.1 This metaphor is, in\nfact, so commonplace that it has ceased to be controversial. In this paper,\nfor instance, the authors lament (p. 14), “What started as a localized bubble\nand bust has been transformed into a national problem.”Housing prices now\nseem to have been far too high in the middle part of the past decade, driven\nin large part by the widespread belief that “house prices never fall.”\nIf households and businesses had viewed the high prices as mere noise,\nand therefore not changed their economic decision making very much, the\nfall in housing prices would not have been such a critical event. But that is\nnot what happened.\nInstead, the high real estate prices were taken very seriously. Households consumed more and borrowed more than they otherwise would have;\ndevelopers built homes at an aggressive pace; Wall Street developed new\n…nancially engineered products to feed the boom; and ancillary industries\nthrived. When house prices fell by 30 percent and remained low, the widespread belief that “house prices never fall” was shattered. Households were\nleft with debt levels much higher than they intended to take on, housing con1\n\nFor economists, I prefer the language “sunspot” equilibrium to refer to a sustainable,\nmarket-clearing situation in which the real allocation of resources is driven by beliefs\nalone. In the macroeconomics literature, “bubble” equilibria are often socially desirable,\nas for instance in much of monetary theory, while “sunspot” equilibria are often socially\nundesirable, as they involve excess volatility. However, in common parlance the bubble\nlanguage overwhelms all attempts at distinctions.\n\n1\n\n\fFigure 1: Decomposing Real GDP.\nstruction fell dramatically, Wall Street was nearly destroyed, and abetting\nindustries had to scale back aggressively. The size of the shock severely disrupted labor market relationships, pushing unemployment to exceptionally\nhigh levels. It takes a long time for those displaced by the shock to …nd new\nworking relationships.\nThe belief that drove the bubble cannot be reconstituted, and therefore\nwe say that the bubble has collapsed.2 It is neither feasible nor desirable to\nrein‡ate such a damaging bubble. The authors explicitly (p. 13) “... make\nno presumption that it would be socially optimal to have a booming housing\nmarket” and state that “... we expect ... and probably want ... relatively\nlow investment post-boom.”\nA simple way to view what is at stake is to consider Figure 1, which simply\nplots two decompositions of real GDP.3 On the left hand side is a linear trend\n2\n3\n\nSee also Bullard (2012a, 2012b).\nFor additional discussion, see Thoma (2012).\n\n2\n\n\fcomputed from 1947 to the present, and on the right hand side is a HodrickPrescott (HP) …lter computed over the same time period.4 In order to see\nthe implications for recent GDP movements, only the past ten years are\nplotted here. On the left, the current level of GDP is far below trend. On\nthe right, the current level of GDP is at or even above the trend line. Both\ntrend lines are atheoretical, statistical constructs: At best, they can give us\nonly a rough notion of where we think the macroeconomy should be if it\nwas behaving normally. Still, the policy messages are very di¤erent from the\ntwo graphs. Pictures like the one on the left suggest that, three-and-a-half\nyears after Lehman-AIG, we remain in crisis mode. Actual output is far from\nnormal, and we must maintain emergency measures into the distant future.\nPictures like the one on the right give a di¤erent message. They suggest\nthat the business cycle adjustment dynamics are already complete. While\nthe current level of output is unsatisfactory, it is because of the trend, not\nbecause of inadequate business cycle adjustment. Policy should be focused\non improving the trend line, because attempts to push the economy “back\nto trend” through conventional business cycle stabilization policies will not\nbe very e¤ective.\nBecause the HP …lter is atheoretical, it cannot really substitute for a\ncareful theory that can tell us how to decompose trend from cycle.5 But\nthe …lter does attempt to isolate business cycle frequency movements in key\nmacroeconomic variables. If the adjustment is taking a long time, the …lter\nascribes more and more of the data movement to the trend component.\nI interpret much of the analysis in the current paper as consistent with\nthe second view. The authors describe a variety of evidence consistent with\na collapsed real estate bubble. They provide estimates that suggest that the\nactual stock of housing may be much larger than the desired stock. They\n4\n\nThe smoothing parameter for the HP …lter was set to 1; 600.\nNew Keynesian theory as described by Woodford (2003) is an example of a theory\nthat provides such a decomposition. In that theory, the gap that matters for monetary\npolicy is the distance between actual output under sticky prices and the ‡exible price level\nof output. The ‡exible price level of output would ‡uctuate continuously in response to\nshocks hitting the economy.\n5\n\n3\n\n\fdescribe an economy that is not returning to a simple trend line with the\nvigor that might have been expected given past experience. They give good\nexplanations as to why this has happened. And they describe additional\nadjustment processes that are likely to take years to unfold. All of this\nsounds like medium- and long-term adjustment as described by the HP trend\nin Figure 1.\n\n2\n\nThe state of the economy and the housing\nmarket\n\nOne of the more striking …gures presented in the paper is Chart 6, which\ndescribes real household debt. The chart (see Figure 2) shows that, unlike\nall other recovery periods, this one has been marked by a reduction in real\nhousehold levels of indebtedness. This is commonly called deleveraging, and\nit makes sense since the bubble story describes a household sector that borrowed too much based on an optimistic assessment of future house prices.\nOne of the fundamental tensions in current U.S. macroeconomic policy is the\ntendency to push against the need to reduce household debt levels. I believe\nthat this is because we— collectively as economists and policymakers— are not\nused to recessions in which debt levels were too high. It has never happened\nbefore according to the chart. Consequently, we get seemingly paradoxical\npolicy. Monetary policy has kept interest rates low to encourage borrowing—\nin the context of an economy with too much borrowing. Fiscal policy has\nloaded on debt— in e¤ect borrowing on behalf of households who are already\noverindebted.\nChart 9 in the paper (Figure 3 here) shows the developments in multifamily versus single family housing starts. This will surely continue to be\none of the key stories in housing during the coming years. My sense is that\nthe housing debacle of the past …ve years may have scared o¤ a generation\nof potential homeowners. The current cohorts of new home buyers likely\nsee homeownership as a fundamentally riskier proposition than earlier cohorts and therefore may be far more likely to rent rather than own. It seems\n4\n\n\fFigure 2: Real Household Debt.\nChart 6 in Feroli et al. (2012).\n\n5\n\n\fFigure 3: Housing starts, single-family and multifamily.\nChart 9 in Feroli et al. (2012).\n\npossible to write down models that would predict such a shift in the wake\nof a crisis that revealed a far riskier price landscape than previously understood. Such a theory might suggest a more permanent shift to renting than\ndescribed in this paper.\nAs for the ugly part of the housing situation, Figure 4 provides an additional perspective.6 According to estimates by my sta¤, there are about\n75.3 million homeowners in the U.S. as of the third quarter of 2011. About\ntwo-thirds of these, 49.4 million, had some mortgage debt outstanding on the\nhouse. These households collectively had $712 billion of equity to support\n$9,882 billion of mortgage debt as of the third quarter of 2011. Figure 4\nshows the average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio from 1970 to the present. The\nLTV averaged 58.4 percent between 1970 and 2005, but shot up to 90 percent\nduring the crisis and has remained there. This picture makes it particularly\nclear that homeowners were borrowing during the bubble phase not expecting house prices to fall appreciably. If we think of the 58.4 percent LTV as\nbeing the desired steady state, homeowners would have to pay down mort6\n\nThese estimates are due to Bill Emmons at the St. Louis Fed.\n\n6\n\n\fFigure 4: Estimated average loan-to-value ratio of mortgaged homeowners.\nLatest data point: Q3.2011.\n\ngage debt collectively by $3,695 billion, about one-quarter of one year’s GDP.\nAs the authors suggest via other means, it will take a long time to get back\nto that type of steady-state situation. Figure 4 shows just how badly households have been knocked o¤ of their historical norms. This picture suggests\na persistent shift, not simply an ordinary business cycle dynamic around an\nunchanged trend line.\n\n3\n\nHousing and monetary transmission\n\nThe authors argue that monetary policy is less e¤ective in the current situation than it might otherwise be. Their argument is based on the idea\nthat borrowing constraints play an important role in the economy and that\n‡uctuating housing valuations alter collateral constraints. Monetary policy\ncan have e¤ects on agents in the economy that are not constrained, but it\nwill have more di¢ culty reaching— or may not be able to reach at all— those\nhouseholds that are sharply constrained. This is an interesting hypothesis\n7\n\n\fbecause of a subtle di¤erence from earlier arguments concerning monetary\npolicy impotence. Earlier arguments sometimes emphasized the idea that\nonce the central bank encounters the zero lower bound, its ability to a¤ect\ninterest rates is lost. However, QE has generally been viewed as e¤ective\nboth in the U.S. and abroad during the past several years, and the authors\npost no quibble with the ability of the central bank to continue to drive real\ninterest rates lower through unconventional policy actions. Indeed, according\nto the TIPS market, the real yield on 5-year securities is about minus 110\nbasis points, and the real yield on 10-year securities is about minus 25 basis\npoints. These are exceptionally low yields over very long time horizons.7\nThe authors instead argue that, while the central bank can in‡uence\nyields, those that can respond to the lower yields have done so already and\nthose that cannot will not be in‡uenced by further policy actions because\nthey are backed up against sharply binding collateral constraints. I think\nthis is an interesting and plausible hypothesis.\nWealth e¤ects could in‡uence the economy not only through collateral\nconstraints but also through distributional e¤ects. I want to mention one paper that has tried to quantify the consequences of severe declines in housing\nand other asset values of the magnitude observed during 2008-2009 across\nage cohorts in the economy.8 The paper is by Andrew Glover, Jonathan\nHeathcote, Dirk Krueger, and Víctor Ríos-Rull, and is entitled “Intergenerational Redistribution and the Great Recession.” The basic idea is to use a\ncalibrated stochastic general equilibrium overlapping generations model to\nquantify the e¤ects. In the model, as in the data, asset-holders tend to\nbe older and su¤er greatly when the shock disrupts the economy. Younger\nhouseholds bene…t from the lower prices of assets, including housing assets,\nbut this e¤ect is largely swamped by the e¤ects on the older households.\nAccording to the paper, a recession of the magnitude observed during 20082009 is nearly welfare-neutral for the younger generations, but causes a large\n7\n\nFor more on the e¤ectiveness of quantitative easing, see the papers from the St. Louis\nFed conference, “Quantitative Easing,” June 30, 2011, available at the St. Louis Fed web\nsite: http://research.stlouisfed.org/conferences/qe/.\n8\nSee Glover et al. (2011).\n\n8\n\n\fwelfare loss for older generations, equivalent to about 10% of consumption\nfor households over 70. This paper suggests that distributional consequences\nare probably more important than commonly appreciated.\nFeroli et al. (2012) present fascinating evidence from U.S. states to get\nat the idea that areas with more intense housing busts also face problems\nthat inhibit a rebound in economic activity (e.g., see Figure 5). I found this\nevidence very interesting and informative. It seems clear that the states with\nthe largest house price declines are also the states with the slowest recoveries.\nIn the earlier stages of the housing debacle, regionalism in house prices was\nwidely cited in a sort of virtuous way. Former Chairman Greenspan, for instance, at one point described certain housing markets as “frothy.”But now,\nwith the data in hand, the authors are able to demonstrate with much more\nclarity the di¤ering impact of the housing bubble collapse across locations.\n\n4\n\nSummary\n\nThe bottom line of the paper is in some ways unsurprising: The situation in\nU.S. housing markets represents a quantitatively signi…cant headwind. Still,\nI think the paper provides one of the better statements that I have seen\ndescribing the nature of the likely problems and the magnitudes involved.\nThe authors counsel that improvement is likely to be very slow and that, in\nany case, there is no presumption that a booming housing market would be\ndesirable in the aftermath of the collapse of the bubble. The desired physical\nhousing stock is lower than the actual stock, according to the estimates in\nthe paper, and likely by a substantial margin. Taken literally, this means\nthat households would like to reduce square footage and remove amenities in\nexchange for lower levels of debt. The only realistic way for that to happen\nis to allow the natural depreciation in the housing capital stock to catch up\nwith household desires. Unfortunately, that is a long process.\nThank-you for listening and thanks for the opportunity to comment on\nthis interesting paper.\n\n9\n\n\fFigure 5: Auto sales for high and low credit quality within large and small\nhouse price decline states.\nChart 22 in Feroli et al.

However, he said, “It is neither feasible nor\ndesirable to attempt to re-in ate the U.S. housing bubble of the mid-2000s.”\nConcerning the Fed’s new monetary policy tools, Bullard said that “increases in the size\nof the balance sheet entail additional in ationary risks if accommodation is not\nremoved at an appropriate pace.” He also discussed the Fed’s communications tool\nand the idea of tying a promise of near-zero policy rates to a numerical unemployment\noutcome. The communications tool may have credibility problems, he said, and “a noncredible announcement would simply be unhelpful.”\nIn ation Targeting in the U.S.\nIn a targeting context, in ation refers to headline (rather than core) in ation, Bullard\nsaid. The headline PCE price index is targeted, he explained, because “it does not make\nsense to ignore some inconveniently volatile prices, like those for gasoline and food”\n(as is the case with core in ation). He noted that while headline PCE in ation\nmeasured from one year ago is somewhat above the 2 percent target, it has been\ndeclining recently.\nWhile control over in ation is the key long-term monetary policy goal, “the actions of\nthe FOMC can also temporarily in uence the direction of the economy in the short run,”\nBullard said. The latter can help smooth macroeconomic uctuations and is called\nmonetary stabilization policy, he explained.\nThe FOMC has adopted a exible in ation targeting policy, which combines an in ation\ntarget with a sensible stabilization policy, Bullard stated. “Flexible in ation targeting\n\n\fenables a central bank to conduct stabilization policy without compromising the longerrun goal of keeping in ation low and stable,” he added. The lesson learned from the\n1970s experience, when double-digit in ation was accompanied by poor\nmacroeconomic performance, was that “allowing high in ation just causes problems\nand does nothing to address fundamental macroeconomic issues,” he said. 1\nBrighter Prospects for the U.S. in 2012\nBullard noted that last August, forecasters marked up the probability of a U.S. recession\noccurring in the second half of 2011. He attributed most of this to the July 29 gross\ndomestic product (GDP) report, which included downward revisions to GDP data. While\nthe debt ceiling debate and the European sovereign debt crisis lowered consumer and\nbusiness con dence, household and business behavior did not change enough to\nvalidate the recession predictions, he said.\nBullard explained that while U.S. households remain nervous about the European\nsituation, Europe is generally viewed as too distant to force a major change in\nhouseholds’ behavior. “So, despite drops in con dence last summer, hard data on the\nU.S. economy continued to show moderate growth,” he said, adding that household\ncon dence has increased since then.\nRegarding Europe, Bullard noted that the European Central Bank offered three-year\nre nancing at low rates on broadened collateral in December and recently offered a\nsecond tranche, worth about $713 billion. “At least for now, this has calmed European\nmarkets relative to last fall,” he stated.\nU.S. Housing Markets\nIn discussing the collapsed housing bubble, Bullard noted that most components of\nU.S. GDP – except for the components of investment related to real estate – have\nrecovered to their levels in the fourth quarter of 2007. “It is therefore not reasonable to\nclaim that the ‘output gap’ is exceptionally large,” he said.\nBullard also stated that it is not feasible or desirable to attempt to re-in ate the bubble.\nFor instance, he said, “the crisis has likely scared off a cohort of potential homeowners,\nwho now see homeownership as a much riskier proposition than renting.” The crisis\nhas also left U.S. households with more debt than they had intended, he said, adding\nthat “this is the rst U.S. recession in which deleveraging has played a key role.”\nOn the topic of too much debt, he noted that U.S. homeowners have about $9.9 trillion\nin mortgage debt outstanding against $712 billion of equity. According to Bullard,\nhouseholds would have to pay down this debt by about $3.7 trillion to return to a\nnormal loan-to-value ratio of 58.4 percent, assuming a normal ratio based on the\naverage LTV ratio from 1970-2005. The amount is roughly equal to one-quarter of one\nyear’s GDP. “This will take a long time,” he said. “It is not a matter of business cycle\nfrequency adjustment.”\nMonetary Policy Tools\nRegarding asset purchases, Bullard said that increases in the size of the Fed’s balance\nsheet entail additional in ationary risks if accommodation is not removed at an\nappropriate pace. He noted that in ation and in ation expectations rose during the\npast year and a half, despite many measures of economic performance indicating a\nrelatively weak U.S. economy.\nWhile the FOMC could use the promised date of the rst interest rate increase – the\ncommunications tool – as the primary policy tool during the upcoming period of nearzero policy rates should further monetary accommodation be necessary, Bullard said\nthis tool has some important caveats. For example, he said it is not clear how credible\nthe actual announcements would be. “If the economy is performing well at the point in\n\n\fthe future where the promise begins to bite, then the Committee may simply abandon\nthe promise and return to normal policy,” he said. “But this behavior, if understood by\nmarkets, would cancel out the initial effects of the promise, and so nothing would be\naccomplished by making the initial promise.”\nAnother policy option would be for the FOMC to tie a promise of near-zero policy rates\nto actual economic outcomes, such as a numerical unemployment outcome, Bullard\nsaid. However, he noted that most proposals for using this tool tie monetary policy to\nan actual unemployment rate and an anticipated in ation rate. “This asymmetry is hard\nto justify,” he stated.\nFurthermore, “unemployment rates have a checkered history in advanced economies\nover the last several decades,” Bullard said. He cited the example of Europe, where\nunemployment rose and has simply remained high during the past 30 years. “If such an\noutcome happened in the U.S. and monetary policy was tied to a numerical\nunemployment outcome, monetary policy could be pulled off course for a generation,”\nhe added.\nBullard noted that labor market policies (e.g., unemployment insurance, worker\nretraining) have direct effects on the unemployed. In contrast, he said, “monetary policy\nis a blunt instrument which affects the decision-making of everyone in the economy.”\nIn particular, low interest rates hurt savers, he stated. “It may be better to focus on\nlabor market policies to address unemployment instead of monetary policy.”\n###\n1\n\nFor more discussion, see Bullard’s Feb. 6, 2012, speech \"In ation Targeting in the\n\nUSA.\"\n###\n\nGENERAL\nHome\nAbout Us\nBank Supervision\nCareers\nCommunity Development\nEconomic Education\nEvents\nInside the Economy Museum\nNewsroom\nOn the Economy Blog\nOpen Vault Blog\nOUR DISTRICT\nLittle Rock Branch\nLouisville Branch\nMemphis Branch\nAgricultural Finance Monitor\nHousing Market Conditions\nSELECTED PUBLICATIONS\n\n\fBridges\nEconomic Synopses\nHousing Market Perspectives\nIn the Balance\nPage One Economics\nThe Quarterly Debt Monitor\nReview\nRegional Economist\nST.

            "content": "Monetary Policy and the U.S. Economy in 2012 1\n15th Annual Credit Suisse Asian Investment Conference\nHong Kong\nMarch 23, 2012\nIntroduction\nMacroeconomic prospects in the U.S. are looking somewhat brighter in 2012. This is providing\nthe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) with an opportunity to pause in its aggressive\neasing campaign, to allow the Committee the chance to assess developments in the economy\nand observe the effectiveness of recent policy actions. This opportunity to pause is quite\nimportant because the Committee is taking a substantial, but calculated, risk with the Federal\nReserve balance sheet.\nTo be sure, there have been many policy actions to ease financial conditions in recent years. In\nJanuary 2008, the Committee sharply and pre-emptively lowered the policy rate as the global\nfinancial crisis gathered steam and seemed to be hampering real economic performance. In\nDecember 2008, the Committee lowered the policy rate effectively to zero, where it remains to\nthis day. In 2009, the Committee authorized the purchase of mortgage-backed securities. In\n2010, in response to a possibly deflationary outlook, the Committee launched QE2, the outright\npurchase of about $600 billion in U.S. government debt. 2 In 2011, after the completion of QE2,\nthe Committee authorized a modern version of “Operation Twist,” in particular, selling $400\nbillion in short-term Treasuries in exchange for the same amount of longer-term bonds. The\nCommittee also began the use of explicit dates to describe the possible length of the near-zero\nrate policy. In January 2012, with Operation Twist still in motion, the Committee named an\nexplicit numerical inflation target of 2 percent for the first time, provided more information\nconcerning the individual forecasts of Committee members on key macroeconomic variables,\nand extended the period of a likely near-zero policy rate to late 2014.\nThis litany illustrates the determination of the Committee and of Chairman Bernanke to provide\nsupport to the U.S. economy in the face of one of the largest macroeconomic disturbances in\nmodern economic history. Indeed, the policy has been successful in the sense that the U.S. has\n\n1\n\nAny opinions expressed here are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of others on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee. I thank my staff for helpful comments.\n2\nThese policies have more than tripled the size of the Fed’s balance sheet since September 2008.\n\n\fnot slipped into the scenario of a falling price level, which sometimes occurs after shocks of this\nmagnitude.\nBut now, with the Committee on pause, it may be a good time to take stock of whether we may\nbe at a turning point. Many of the further policy actions the Committee might consider at this\njuncture would have effects extending out for several years. As the U.S. economy continues to\nrebound and repair, those policy actions may create an overcommitment to ultra-easy\nmonetary policy. The ultra-easy policy has been appropriate until now, but it will not always be\nappropriate.\nThe FOMC has often been criticized historically for overstaying policy stances that might have\nmade sense at one juncture but are no longer appropriate as macroeconomic conditions\nchange. This occurs in part because of the lags in the effects of policy, the difficulty in\ninterpreting real-time data, much of which is subsequently revised, and the sheer uncertainty\nof macroeconomic developments. With numerous monetary policy actions still on the table,\nand others still affecting the economy with a lag, it may be especially difficult to remove policy\naccommodation at the appropriate pace and at the appropriate time. One may want to\napproach such a situation with caution.\n\nBrighter Prospects\nThe U.S. economy may achieve 3 percent growth in real GDP in 2012. This is not a high growth\nrate by historical standards in the U.S., but the outlook has improved markedly compared to\nlast summer. As many of you know well, during August 2011, the U.S. macroeconomic outlook\ndeteriorated significantly to the point where many observers were worried that the U.S.\neconomy would move into a recession state. The U.S. avoided the recession outcome, but I\nthink it is instructive to remind ourselves of this period and what has changed since then.\nThere were many cross currents at play during the recession scare. One was the ongoing\nadjustment to the tragedy in Japan, which disrupted supply lines and altered production\nschedules significantly during 2011. Another was the debate in the U.S. Congress concerning\nthe debt ceiling. The European sovereign debt crisis was entering a new, more difficult phase,\nwith Italian debt yields in particular rising sharply. And in the middle of these important\ndevelopments, on July 29, the U.S. GDP data for the previous several years was marked down\nsharply. The data revisions suggested that the U.S. recession of 2008 and 2009 was deeper\nthan previously understood, and that the recovery was weaker. When forecasters put the new\n2\n\n\fdata into their models, the result was a sharply lower profile for U.S. growth during the second\nhalf of 2011 and continuing on into 2012. This, combined with the other factors, seemed to\nsuggest that recession probabilities had increased dramatically.\nAs it turned out, the U.S. was not on the precipice of recession last summer. U.S. GDP growth\nwas stronger in the third quarter compared to the first half of 2011, and improved further\nduring the fourth quarter of the year. What changed?\nCertainly much progress occurred in restoring supply chains and production schedules in the\naftermath of the tragedy in Japan. In addition, a temporary fix for the U.S. debt ceiling problem\nwas agreed upon. However, in my view, the most important factor has been the reduction of\ntensions in global financial markets. Two important contributors to reduced stress have been\nthe introduction by the European Central Bank (ECB) of the Long-Term Refinancing Operation\n(LTRO), and the relatively successful navigation of Greek debt restructuring. In response to\nthese developments, global financial markets have, at least for now, substantially marked down\nthe probability of a significant financial crisis in Europe.\nThe ECB’s LTRO program has substantially increased the size of the ECB’s balance sheet. The\nECB’s lending program to European banks is based on an expanded set of collateral criteria.\nWhile most central bank lending is viewed as temporary, this funding program continues for\nthree years and could in principle be extended depending on macroeconomic conditions in\nEurope in the future. This seems to indicate that the ECB balance sheet will remain at a high\nlevel for a considerable period of time. One way to view this is that monetary conditions in\nEurope have become substantially easier in the wake of the LTRO program.\nWhile easier monetary conditions have helped change the climate in global financial markets,\nfundamental problems remain. Too much borrowing and spending on the part of sovereign\ngovernments cannot be repaired by such actions. Debt problems are acute, and only resolute\naction to better match national revenues with expenditures will allow nations to avoid the fate\nof Greece.\nThis applies to the U.S. as well, where most difficult decisions with respect to budgets, taxes\nand debt have been delayed until after the 2012 elections in November. I remain concerned\nthat financial market uncertainty about possible fiscal actions after the election might derail the\nU.S. economy during 2012.\n\n3\n\n\fOkun’s Guideline\nPart of the improvement in the U.S. macroeconomic outlook has occurred in labor markets.\nUnemployment has declined to 8.3 percent, and the latest figures on growth in nonfarm payroll\nemployment have been encouraging.\nThe unemployment declines have been viewed by some as a puzzle. In 2011, a year of\nlackluster economic growth, U.S. unemployment declined fairly substantially. This would seem\nto violate “Okun’s law,” which suggests that economic growth has to be reasonably robust\nbefore the unemployment rate will decline. This is, in fact, the source of some statements in\nfinancial markets and elsewhere that the pace of economic growth in the U.S. is too slow to\nmeaningfully improve labor markets.\nYet labor markets have indeed improved, so what’s going on? Probably the most important\nconsideration is that—as in the film “Pirates of the Caribbean”—Okun’s “law” is not so much a\nlaw but more like a “guideline.”\nAnother consideration is that Okun’s guideline is not as linear as it is often made out to be. A\nlook at the time series of U.S. unemployment since the mid-1980s indicates that recessions are\ndefinitely times when unemployment increases sharply, while expansions are times when\nunemployment declines slowly. In other words, the relationship between unemployment and\nGDP growth is very sharp during downturns, but more muddled during expansions. This might\nsuggest that the nation does not need rapid growth to see a reduction in unemployment—it\nonly needs to see some positive growth.\n\nTrend Output in the U.S.\nWhile unemployment has moved in surprising ways in the last year, so has another variable:\ninflation. Inflation in the U.S. has moved higher from its lows during the fall of 2010. Headline\nconsumer price index and headline personal consumption expenditures inflation, measured\nfrom one year ago, are both above the Committee’s inflation target of 2 percent. Both have\nbeen moderating in recent reports. But because inflation increased during a period in which\nreal economic performance was not stellar, it may be that the output gap is smaller than\ncommonly estimated.\nThe idea that the output gap—somehow measured—is large, is one of the defining features of\nmany arguments for continued extraordinary monetary policy in the U.S. And, to be sure, the\n4\n\n\fmacroeconomic shock that the U.S. suffered along with the rest of the world in 2008 and 2009\nwas very large, and the corresponding monetary policy actions have also been large and\naggressive, as I outlined in the introduction to this talk.\nBut the features of some output gap estimates do not seem to correspond with reality. Many\nestimates suggest that in the fourth quarter of 2007, the quarter during which the recession\nbegan in the U.S., output was only just at potential instead of above potential. And many\nestimates of potential are essentially indistinguishable from linear extrapolations of 2007:Q4\ninto the indefinite future. By that metric, the U.S. output gap indeed remains large. However, I\ndo not think that is a reasonable metric. Not even close.\nThe U.S. economy suffered through what is commonly called a housing bubble during the mid2000s. That bubble burst. Housing prices in the U.S. now appear to have been far too high\nduring the mid-2000s, driven by the widespread belief that “house prices never fall.” When\nhouse prices finally fell by 30 percent or more in many areas, the widespread belief was\nshattered. Households were left with debt levels much higher than they intended to take on,\nand other areas of the economy—including finance, construction and transportation—were\nsignificantly affected. It is neither feasible nor desirable to re-inflate such a damaging bubble.\nOur normal measures of potential output do not have any concept of such a “bubble.” In\neffect, the typical measures simply take all of the upside of the housing bubble on board, calling\nthat the normal level of output to which we should aspire. That is nothing less than a call to reinflate the housing bubble. But the housing bubble will not return unless the widespread belief\nthat “house prices never fall” returns. With house prices in the U.S. down 30 percent in the\naggregate and unlikely to rise very much, it seems quite unlikely that the U.S. housing bubble\nwill re-inflate.\nWhat should we do about this issue, since conventional metrics do not make any allowance for\nthe housing bubble? I suggest using available theory to separate trend from cycle in an\nappropriate way. Absent that, I suggest using a Hodrick-Prescott filter that removes trends and\nleaves business cycle frequency movements in the data. Such a filter suggests that the U.S.\noutput gap today is much smaller than commonly believed.\nDealing with the output gap issue is a delicate matter. The discussion today has an eerie 1970s\nfeel to it, in which many argued that the output gap was large and that monetary policy had to\nremain very aggressive to close the gap. The result was a global inflation debacle that took\nseveral decades to completely contain. Some say that if inflation increases, then we know how\n5\n\n\fto combat it. That is true, but the hard-learned lesson of the 1970s was that if the inflation\ngenie is let out of the bottle, it can be extremely difficult to get it back into the bottle.\n\nFed Communications\nAt its January meeting, the FOMC extended the date at which it currently expects to move the\npolicy rate off zero to late 2014. The FOMC also for the first time released individual\nprojections of the future policy path considered best for the economy.\nOne important lesson from these projections is that the uncertainty surrounding the future\npolicy path is profound. Some policymakers thought it might be necessary to raise interest\nrates within the next one or two years, while others thought the increase could be postponed\nfor many more years. The confidence interval surrounding the date of the first interest rate\nincrease is so wide it has to be expressed in years.\nThis very wide confidence interval may seem stunning, but I think in a way it is not surprising. If\nwe know one thing about the U.S. economy, we know that it can behave in unpredictable ways.\nThe amount of uncertainty surrounding U.S. economic performance is profound, and attempts\nto project macroeconomic outcomes more than 6 to 12 months into the future are unlikely to\nmeet with much success. The amount of uncertainty attached to a projection of U.S. economic\nperformance into 2014 reinforces the idea that much will change between now and then, and\nthat policy will have to change as well to meet new macroeconomic conditions.\nThe forecasts themselves by the individual members of the FOMC are a step forward for Fed\ntransparency. Chairman Bernanke has led the way toward more and more transparency for the\nU.S. central bank. This is a definite improvement in Fed communications.\nHowever, despite this improvement, I believe the projections will have to be done differently at\nsome point in the future. The notion of individual forecasts for Committee members is not the\nmost convenient method of conveying information to interested observers. The forecasts as\nthey stand are merely projections of a few macroeconomic variables instead of a more fulsome\ndiscussion of all aspects of the U.S. economy. The policy assessments are for the policy rate\nonly, in an environment where balance sheet policy has taken center stage.\nI think the Committee should consider publishing a Monetary Policy Report similar to those put\ntogether on a regular basis by other central banks. This would be a single report of the staff,\ncontaining a longer and more comprehensive discussion of the state of the U.S. economy and\n6\n\n\fthe likely direction going forward. The policy assumption should be the market expectation at\nthe time the report is put together. Such a report would allow commentary on aspects of\nmacroeconomic performance that are unlikely to ever be addressed through a mechanism like\nthe current Summary of Economic Projections.\nThe more fulsome discussion of macroeconomic developments that would be part of a U.S.\nMonetary Policy Report would also help with another issue, which is how the Committee might\nbetter convey how it might react in future states of the world. Since there are many such\nfuture states, it may be misleading to try to delineate how the reaction might occur through the\nuse of a few variables or simple “thresholds.” Such a simple description would likely set up an\nexpectation that the Committee would act if a threshold was crossed, when no such\nexpectation was intended or desired by the Committee. A full discussion in a report could lay\nout these nuances in a way that could be better digested by markets.\n\nConclusions\nThe FOMC is currently on pause. At the March meeting, the Committee updated its assessment\nof the economy, but otherwise left the policy statement largely unchanged.\nThe Committee has, as I discussed at the outset, pursued an aggressive easing strategy over a\nperiod of several years. This strategy seems to have been the right one so far, but it will not\nalways be the right strategy. Some of the further actions that could be undertaken at this\njuncture would have effects far into the future, in an environment of continual improvement\nand repair for the U.S. economy. The ultra-easy policy has served us well in a difficult\nenvironment, but overcommitting to the ultra-easy policy could well have detrimental\nconsequences for the U.S. and, by extension, the global economy.\n\nJames Bullard, President and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\n\n7\n\n\f",

Based on some existing research that analyzes open economies, Bullard said\nthere are good reasons to think the global output gap is a relevant indicator for\ndomestic in ation. “This might help explain why current U.S. in ation is higher than\nwould be predicted based on a closed economy analysis,” he concluded.\nShould the U.S. Consider Global Output Gaps?\nBullard noted that some critics of Federal Open Market Committee policy suggest the\nFed is encouraging global in ation, despite the fact that U.S. in ation is relatively low.\nThe spirit of this criticism is that the Fed may not be appropriately weighing global\nconditions. “The Fed is charged with controlling U.S. in ation,” he noted, adding, “but\npossibly global in ation will drive U.S. prices higher or cause other problems.”\nMuch monetary policy analysis focuses on the U.S. output gap, Bullard noted. He then\nposed the question of whether the U.S. should focus on a global output gap in light of\nthe criticism. According to some recent research, he said, “the global perspective on\nthe output gap might give a better indication of global conditions, and possibly a better\nindication of U.S. in ation prospects.”\nBullard said that his past criticisms of gap-based analyses of in ation dynamics still\napply. For instance, “empirical relationships between gaps and in ation are shaky,” he\nsaid. “Still, the idea of ‘global output gaps’ is one way to frame the recent criticism of\nthe Fed and promote fruitful debate.”\nGlobal Output Gaps\nU.S. in ation has increased during the past 18 months even though most measures of\nthe U.S. output gap have remained very wide, Bullard noted. “Typical estimates suggest\nin ation should have remained low or even moved lower during 2011,” he said.\n\n\fRegarding this in ation puzzle, he noted that “one explanation could be that the output\ngap is not nearly as wide as commonly supposed.”1\nOn the other hand, “an alternative explanation is that the U.S. output gap is not the\nrelevant output gap for U.S. in ation,” Bullard said, suggesting that perhaps the global\noutput gap is what really matters. “The global output gap is probably much narrower or\neven positive; this would then be interpreted as putting upward pressure on U.S.\nin ation,” he added.\nRegarding the dollar bloc, Bullard noted that in ation has been a threat especially for\ncountries that have quasi- xed exchange rates with the dollar. “Those countries are\nchoosing to import U.S. monetary policy to some extent,” he stated.\nBullard presented some possible measures of a global output gap, with the idea being\nthat the weighted average of the output gaps for advanced economies and emerging\nmarkets may be positive. “This may suggest upward, not downward, pressure on U.S.\nin ation from this source,” he said.\nSome Economic Theory and Empirical Evidence\nBullard discussed some models currently available in economic research that analyze\nthe relationship between global output gaps and domestic in ation. In these models,\nhe said, the monetary authorities in one country can ignore the output gap in other\ncountries only if in ation is de ned as “domestic (producer) price in ation” and\nexchange rates are perfectly exible. However, “these conditions are often not met in\nreality,” he said.\nBullard added that output gaps have measurement issues. For instance, he said that\nglobal output gaps are even more di cult to measure than domestic output gaps.\n“However, the idea of generally robust emerging markets suggests that one might be\nless worried that the global output gap is very large,” he said.\nWhile foreign output gaps will matter for domestic in ation dynamics in the models,\nBullard examined whether the theory can explain actual outcomes. He found mixed\nevidence regarding the impact of global output gaps on domestic in ation. He cited\none study, however, that suggests globalization might be more important going forward\nthan it was in the past. “Thus, the global output gap idea may be the ‘wave of the\nfuture’ rather than an explanation for past economic outcomes,” he said.\n###\n1\n\nSee Bullard’s March 23, 2012, speech “Monetary Policy and the U.S. Economy in 2012”\nfor additional comments on the output gap.\n\nGENERAL\nHome\nAbout Us\nBank Supervision\nCareers\nCommunity Development\nEconomic Education\nEvents\nInside the Economy Museum\nNewsroom\n\n\fOn the Economy Blog\nOpen Vault Blog\nOUR DISTRICT\nLittle Rock Branch\nLouisville Branch\nMemphis Branch\nAgricultural Finance Monitor\nHousing Market Conditions\nSELECTED PUBLICATIONS\nBridges\nEconomic Synopses\nHousing Market Perspectives\nIn the Balance\nPage One Economics\nThe Quarterly Debt Monitor\nReview\nRegional Economist\nST.

LOUIS – Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard discussed “The\nU.S. Monetary Policy Outlook” on Thursday during the 13th Annual InvestMidwest\nVenture Capital Forum.\nBullard said that brighter prospects for the U.S. economy provide the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC) with the opportunity to pause in its aggressive easing\ncampaign. “An appropriate approach at this juncture may be to continue to pause to\nassess developments in the economy,” he stated. Concerning the FOMC’s\ncommunications tool, the “late 2014” language describing the length of the near-zero\nrate policy may be counterproductive, he said. “The Committee’s practice of including\ndistant dates in the statement sends an unwarranted pessimistic signal concerning the\nfuture of the U.S. economy.”\nRegarding the output gap and housing markets, “the U.S. output gap may be smaller\nthan typical estimates suggest,” Bullard said, adding that typical estimates count the\n“housing bubble” as part of the normal level of output. However, he said, “It is neither\nfeasible nor desirable to attempt to re-in ate the U.S. housing bubble of the mid2000s.”\nMonetary Policy on Pause\nAt the March 2012 meeting, the FOMC updated its assessment of the economy, but\notherwise left the policy statement largely unchanged, Bullard noted. Given that\nincoming data have generally indicated somewhat better-than-expected\nmacroeconomic performance so far in 2012, “past behavior of the Committee suggests\na ‘wait-and-see’ strategy at this juncture,” he said.\nBullard discussed some of the policy actions that the FOMC has taken in recent years\nto ease nancial conditions. “The ultra-easy policy has been appropriate until now, but\nit will not always be appropriate,” he said. Many of the further policy actions the FOMC\nmight consider at this juncture would have effects that extend out for several years,\nBullard stated. “As the U.S. economy continues to rebound and repair, additional policy\nactions may create an over-commitment to ultra-easy monetary policy.”\nBullard noted that labor market policies (e.g., unemployment insurance, worker\nretraining) have direct effects on the unemployed. In contrast, he said, “monetary policy\nis a blunt instrument which affects the decision-making of everyone in the economy.”\nIn particular, low interest rates hurt savers, he stated. “It may be better to focus on\n\n\flabor market policies to directly address unemployment instead of taking further risks\nwith monetary policy.”\nBrighter Prospects for the U.S.\nBullard noted that last August, forecasters marked up the probability of a U.S. recession\noccurring in the second half of 2011. He attributed much of this to the July 29 gross\ndomestic product (GDP) report, which included downward revisions to GDP data. In\naddition, he noted that the European sovereign debt crisis worsened then. However, he\nsaid, “Since last fall, the outlook has improved.”\nRegarding Europe, Bullard noted that the European Central Bank (ECB) offered threeyear re nancing at low rates on broadened collateral in December and offered a second\ntranche in February. “At least for now, this has calmed European markets relative to last\nfall,” he stated, adding that the ECB policy does not address longer-term problems.\nOutput Gaps and U.S. Housing Markets\nIn discussing the collapsed housing bubble, Bullard noted that most components of\nU.S. GDP – except for the components of investment related to real estate – have\nrecovered to their levels in the fourth quarter of 2007. “It may not be reasonable to\nclaim that the ‘output gap’ is exceptionally large,” he said.\nBullard also stated that it is not feasible or desirable to attempt to re-in ate the bubble.\n“The crisis has likely scared off a cohort of potential homeowners, who now see home\nownership as a much riskier proposition than renting,” he said. The crisis has also left\nU.S. households with more debt than they had intended, he said, adding that “this is the\nrst U.S. recession in which deleveraging has played a key role.”\nOn the topic of too much debt, he noted that U.S. homeowners have about $9.9 trillion\nin mortgage debt outstanding against $712 billion of equity. According to Bullard,\nhouseholds would have to pay down this debt by about $3.7 trillion to return to a\nnormal loan-to-value ratio of 58.4 percent, assuming a normal ratio based on the\naverage LTV ratio from 1970-2005. The amount is roughly equal to one-quarter of one\nyear’s GDP. “This will take a long time,” he said. “It is not a matter of business cycle\nfrequency adjustment.”\nRecent Monetary Policy\nWhile the FOMC could use the promised date of the rst interest rate increase – the\ncommunications tool – as a policy tool should further monetary accommodation be\nnecessary, Bullard said this tool has an important downside. Although the 2014\nlanguage in effect names a date far in the future at which macroeconomic conditions\nare still expected to be exceptionally poor, “neither the Fed nor any other forecaster has\na clear idea of what macroeconomic conditions will be like at that time,” he said. “This\nis an unwarranted pessimistic signal for the FOMC to send,” he added.\n\nGENERAL\nHome\nAbout Us\nBank Supervision\nCareers\nCommunity Development\nEconomic Education\n\n\fEvents\nInside the Economy Museum\nNewsroom\nOn the Economy Blog\nOpen Vault Blog\nOUR DISTRICT\nLittle Rock Branch\nLouisville Branch\nMemphis Branch\nAgricultural Finance Monitor\nHousing Market Conditions\nSELECTED PUBLICATIONS\nBridges\nEconomic Synopses\nHousing Market Perspectives\nIn the Balance\nPage One Economics\nThe Quarterly Debt Monitor\nReview\nRegional Economist\nST.

            "content": "Opening remarks by President James Bullard\nThe 2012 Homer Jones Memorial Lecture\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nApril 11, 2012\nWelcome to the 23rd annual Homer Jones Memorial Lecture. Each year we host this event to\nhonor the outstanding contributions of Homer Jones, a former Senior Vice President and\nResearch Director of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.\nThe St. Louis Fed started the lecture series after Homer Jones’ death in 1986. The lecture series\nenjoys the long-lasting support and co-sponsorship of many people and organizations, including\nthe St. Louis Gateway Chapter of the National Association for Business Economics, Saint Louis\nUniversity, Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville, the University of Missouri at St. Louis\nand Washington University in St. Louis.\nHomer Jones is sometimes described as “Milton Friedman’s teacher” because Jones taught\nFriedman when Friedman was an undergraduate at Rutgers University in the late 1920s-early\n1930s. Then, as now, it was a tumultuous time for macroeconomists.\nJones had come to Rutgers after studying at the University of Chicago, where he was a student\nof legendary Chicago professor Frank Knight. Also on the Rutgers faculty at the time: Arthur\nBurns, future Fed Chairman.\nAccording to Friedman, Jones was one of the primary influences in Friedman’s choice to study\neconomics, as opposed to mathematics or statistics. In Friedman’s 1976 reminiscence, he says\nJones opened his eyes “… to the broader reaches of economics and to the beauties and\nintricacies of economic theory.” 1 The rest, as they say, is history—the two remained friends\nand colleagues for years afterward.\nIn 1958, Homer Jones joined the staff here at the St. Louis Fed. He is remembered for many\nthings at the Bank, but his role in the Bank’s development as a leader in monetary research and\nstatistics stands out. Although many talented and dedicated people have greatly expanded\nupon Homer’s original efforts to make the St. Louis Fed a leader in the dissemination of\neconomic data, it is difficult to imagine that we would have been as successful as we have been\n1\n\nSee Milton Friedman, 1976, “Homer Jones: A Personal Reminiscence,” Journal of Monetary Economics 2: 433-436.\n\n\fwere it not for Homer Jones’ vision. He was, in a sense, a proponent of transparency before\ntransparency was cool.\nToday, the St. Louis Fed is internationally known as an institution that is unparalleled in data\ndissemination. Housed under the name Federal Reserve Economic Data, or FRED, these efforts\nhave their genesis in Homer’s innovative idea to publish monetary data in a form that did not\nyet exist at the time. Today, through FRED, we make more than 45,000 data series available\nand accessible to individuals and organizations worldwide—and it’s optimally priced for the\nbudding researcher: free. I think Homer would be extremely proud of what we have\naccomplished in this area.\nThe St. Louis Fed’s unwavering commitment to rigorous, independent economic research is\nanother legacy of Homer’s that we honor today. Homer had a staunch belief in the persuasive\npower of facts and—it is said—dogged patience in pressing his views.\nThose of us in the Federal Reserve System who believe that the ability to question and reexamine conventional wisdom leads to better policy outcomes owe a great debt to Homer\nJones. The Fed’s ability to absorb and be open to multiple viewpoints helps prevent groupthink\nand leads to superior monetary policy and, ultimately, to better macroeconomic performance.\nIt is only fitting for us to use the Homer Jones Memorial Lecture to spotlight others who have\nmade a significant impact in the world of academic research, central banking and global\nfinance. It is a pleasure for me to introduce this year’s distinguished speaker, Mohamed A. ElErian.\nDr. El-Erian is currently the CEO and co-CIO of PIMCO. He rejoined PIMCO at the end of 2007,\nafter serving two years as president and CEO of Harvard Management Company. Dr. El-Erian\nalso served as a member of the faculty of the Harvard Business School. Prior to joining PIMCO,\nhe worked for 15 years at the International Monetary Fund and later moved on to become a\nmanaging director at Salomon Smith Barney/Citigroup in London.\nDr. El-Erian has published widely on international economics and finance topics. His book,\nWhen Markets Collide, won the Financial Times/Goldman Sachs 2008 business book of the year\nand a “book of the year” award from The Economist magazine. In 2010, he gave one of the\nprestigious Per Jacobsson Foundation Lectures at the IMF. He was named to Foreign Policy’s\nlist of the “Top 100 Global Thinkers” in 2009, 2010 and 2011.\n\n\fDr. El-Erian serves on many boards and committees, including the National Bureau of Economic\nResearch and the Peterson Institute for International Economics. He holds a master’s degree\nand doctorate in economics from Oxford University.\nDr. El-Erian will speak to us today about the “Evolution, Impact and Limitations of Unusual\nCentral Bank Policy Activism.”\nPlease join me in welcoming Dr. Mohamed A. El-Erian.\n\nJames Bullard, President and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\n\n\f",

            "content": "Demographics, Redistribution, and Optimal In‡ation\nJames Bullard\n\nCarlos Garriga\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\n\nChristopher J. Waller\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\n\n30 May 2012\n\nAbstract\nWe study the interaction between population demographics, the desire for intergenerational redistribution in the economy, and the optimal in‡ation rate in a deterministic life-cycle economy with capital. Young cohorts do not initially have any assets\nand wages are the main source of income; they prefer relatively low real interest rates,\nrelatively high wages, and relatively high rates of in‡ation. Older generations work\nless and prefer higher rates of return from their savings, relatively low wages, and relatively low in‡ation. In the absence of intergenerational redistribution via lump-sum\ntaxes and transfers, the constrained e¢ cient competitive equilibrium entails optimal\ndistortions on relative prices. We allow the planner to use in‡ation to try to achieve\nthe optimal distortions. In the economy changes in the population structure are interpreted as the ability of a particular cohort to in‡uence the redistributive policy. When\nthe old have more in‡uence on the redistributive policy, the economy has a relatively\nlow steady state level of capital and a relatively low steady state rate of in‡ation. The\nopposite happens as young cohorts have more control of policy. These results suggest\nthat aging population structures like those in Japan may contribute to observed low\nrates of in‡ation or even de‡ation.\nJEL codes: E4, E5, D7\nKeywords: monetary policy, in‡ation bias, de‡ation, central bank design\nThis paper was prepared for the conference “Demographic Changes and Macroeconomic Performance,”\nsponsored by the Bank of Japan and the Institute for Monetary and Economic Studies, May 30th and 31st,\n2012. The views presented here are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the views of the\nFederal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n1\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\n1.1\n\nOverview\n\nCan observed low in‡ation outcomes be related to demographic factors such as an aging\npopulation? A calculation which we will label “back-of-the-envelop”(BOTE) based on some\nbasic economic theory might suggest that the answer is “no.” Suppose we think of the net\nreal interest rate r in a model with capital. We might guess that in steady state r = + n;\nwhere is the net depreciation rate and n is the net population growth rate. Suppose we also\nassume that money and capital pay either the same real rate of return or closely related real\nrates of return,1 and that the real return on money is the negative of the net in‡ation rate\n: Now suppose the rate of population growth increases to n0 ; creating a new steady state\nwith a more youthful population. By itself, this must mean that the real return to capital\nincreases to r0 and that the in‡ation rate decreases to\n\n0\n\n: This would seem to suggest that\n\ncountries with relatively young populations would have relatively low in‡ation rates, all else\nequal, and conversely that countries with relatively old populations would have relatively\nhigh in‡ation rates, all else equal.\nHowever, the BOTE calculation does not seem to square with some of the facts.

A moving average of the consumer price in‡ation rate is\nplotted using the left scale. A measure of the youthfulness of the population, the fraction\nof the population aged 15 to 40 years, is plotted on the right scale. In each case, very\nroughly speaking, the more youthful economies are associated with higher in‡ation, while\nthe more elderly economies are associated with lower in‡ation.2 This evidence, while far\nfrom de…nitive, is at least suggestive and does run counter to the BOTE “standard theory”\ncalculation.\nIn this paper, we provide one reconciliation of the BOTE calculation with the suggestion\nfrom the data shown in Figures 1 and 2 that aging populations are associated with lower\nlevels of in‡ation. The theory we study has all the elements of the BOTE calculation but\nalso considers the desire for redistribution within society. We model this desire as a social\nplanner’s problem in which the planner only has access to in‡ation or de‡ation as a tool\nfor redistribution. We show that the solution to the social planner’s problem associates\nrelatively elderly populations with relatively low in‡ation.\n\n2\n\nThe mid-1970s moving average in‡ation rate in Japan is truncated at 10 percent in order to allow a\nbetter view of the two data series.\n\n3\n\n\f1.2\n\nRedistributional tension\n\nIn canonical macroeconomic models, the representative agent assumption is used to capture\nthe “average” behavior of key variables, including in‡ation. When using the representative\nhousehold approach, policy implicitly ignores the redistributive e¤ects of …scal and monetary\ninterventions. While it is possible to incorporate various forms of heterogeneity into canonical\nmodels, attempting to understand redistribution policies for demographic reasons forces us\nto abandon the representative agent framework and move to a general equilibrium life-cycle\nframework.\nAccordingly, in this paper we use an overlapping generations model with capital to study\nthe redistributional tensions associated with monetary and …scal policy. As in Bullard and\nWaller (2004), in‡ation dictates the real rate of return on money and thus the portfolio\nchoices of each generation. Via a standard Tobin e¤ect, higher in‡ation can induce a substitution from money to capital. But why is there a tension across generations from this? The\ntension can be understood by considering the decision-making of a given individual at time t.\nA high wage rate at time t, which we can represent as fl (kt ), increases lifetime income of the\nyoung cohort. In‡ation reduces the rate of return of money balances and individuals shift\nportfolio decisions towards capital. The increasing capital accumulation increases wages of\nyoung workers but reduces the rate of return on capital, fk (kt+1 ), for the older cohort of\nsavers. Consequently, young workers like in‡ation when they are young but dislike it when\nthey are old. Thus, if a single generation could choose the in‡ation rate at each point in\ntheir lives, they would choose relatively high in‡ation when they were young and relatively\nlow in‡ation (or de‡ation) when old. Clearly, the generations existing side-by-side with this\none generation would not appreciate such a policy and would oppose it. Consequently, how\nagents resolve this con‡ict between generations is important for understanding policy choices\nand the institutional design of the central bank. Bullard and Waller (2004) considered three\ninstitutional arrangements for resolving this con‡ict, among them a “policy committee”that\nallows older and younger cohorts to solve a Nash bargaining problem.3 Their main …nding\nis that the behavior of in‡ation hinges critically on key details of the institutional design.\nThe objective of this paper is to understand the determination of central bank objectives\nwhen population aging shifts the social preferences for redistribution and its implications\nfor in‡ation. Our starting point builds on Bullard and Waller (2004), but unfortunately,\nit is di¢ cult to follow their approach since it is not possible to specify the entire spectrum\n3\n\nBullard and Waller did not focus directly on demographic e¤ects.\n\n4\n\n\fof institutional arrangements that could be implemented. We take a di¤erent approach in\nthis paper. Rather than specifying particular political decision-making rules, we use a direct\nmechanism to decide the allocations. This means we will solve a social planner’s problem in\nwhich the weights assigned to each generation are population weights. Thus, a baby boom\ncorresponds to putting more weight on the young of a particular generation relative to past\nand future generations. This mechanism can replicate any steady state allocation arising\nfrom a political economy model with population growth or decline.\nFor every level of social redistribution there exists an optimal level of capital. When the\nyoung have more in‡uence in the planner’s optimization problem, wages are high and the\nreturn from capital is low, and when the old have more in‡uence in the planner’s optimization\nproblem, wages are low and the return from capital is high. A critical feature of the planning\nproblem we study is whether or not the planner can redistribute resources via lump-sum taxes\nor transfers. In the absence of lump-sum redistribution, we show that the planner might wish\nto use in‡ation or de‡ation to change the relative price of capital to induce young households\nto hold the right amount of capital. In general, the constrained redistributive solution is not\nfully e¢ cient. That is, the implied level of savings is either too low or too high compared\nwith the unconstrained e¢ cient solution. In this sense, in‡ation or de‡ation will turn out to\nbe an imperfect substitute for a full system of lump-sum taxes and transfers.\nWe emphasize that in contrast with Bullard and Waller (2004), the unconstrained socially\ne¢ cient level of savings is always dynamically e¢ cient. This is because in the unconstrained\ncase the social planner has access to a full system of lump-sum taxes and transfers. However,\nthe constraints on redistribution— the planner only has access to in‡ation or de‡ation as a\nredistribution tool— behave as binding participation constraints that cause the e¢ cient level\nof capital to deviate from the socially e¢ cient one. These deviations are due to the relative\nimportance of each group and the underlying distribution of resources.4\nThe mechanism presented in the paper follows the work of Garriga and Sánchez-Losada\n(2009) , who considers the implementation of constrained e¢ cient solutions in economies with\nwarm-glow or joy-of-giving preferences. The rational for intergenerational redistribution is\nalways present in life cycle model that abstracts from lump-sum taxes and transfers. Garriga\n(2001) shows depending on the relative importance of present versus future generations it\nis optimal to tax/subsidize capital. Dávila (2012) uses a similar approach in a steady state\n4\n\nJudd (1985) considers a redistributional trade-o¤ between wage earners and capital earners. In that\neconomy the optimal redistribution is independent of the relative weight of each group in the social welfare\nfunction. In terms of monetary policy, in that economy the central bank should set the nominal interest rate\nto zero.\n\n5\n\n\fanalysis to show that capital taxation can still be optimal even in the absence of government\nexpenditure. This mechanism is usually absent in economies with dynastic agents. Dávila,\nHong, Krusell, and Ríos-Rull (2012) also use a similar set up in an economy with incomplete\nmarkets and uninsurable income risk.\n\n2\n\nEconomy\n\n2.1\n\nEnvironment\n\nConsider a standard two-period overlapping generations growth model with capital. Time\nis discrete and double in…nity t = :::; 2; 1; 0; 1; 2; :::. Each period a number of identical\nhouseholds are born, and population grows at an exogenous rate Nt = (1+n)Nt\n\n1\n\nwhere N0 =\n\n1. Agents live for two periods and have perfect foresight. Young agents are endowed with one\nunit of time that can be devoted to market work. These agents consume goods every period\nand consumption bundles are compared using a standard utility function U (c1;t ; c2;t+1 ) =\nu(c1;t ) + u(c2;t+1 ) where the utility function satis…es standard properties. There is an initial\nold agent that consumes at t = 0:\nThis economy produces consumption and investment goods with a standard neoclassical\ntechnology F (Kt ; Nt ). The production function has constant returns to scale and satis…es\nstandard properties. Capital depreciates at the rate . Output per worker can be written as\nf (kt ) where kt = Kt =Nt . The economy aggregate resource constraint is given by\nNt c1;t + Nt 1 c1;t\n\n+ Kt+1 = F (Kt ; Nt ) + (1\n\n) Kt\n\n(1)\n\n+ (1 + n) kt+1 = f (kt ) + (1\n\n) kt :\n\n(2)\n\n1\n\nor, in per capita terms,\nc1;t +\n\n2.2\n\n1\nc1;t\n1+n\n\n1\n\nThe e¢ cient allocation of resources\n\nConsider the allocation of resources determined by a social planner.

Note that it is possible for\nt\n\n> 1 for some arbitrary generation t but for exposition it is convenient to assume that\n\ndiscounting is geometric; that is,\n\nt\n\n1. The socially e¢ cient allocation of resources is\n\n=\n\nthen the solution to a standard optimization problem\nV (k0 ) = max\n\n1\nX\n\nt\n\n1\n\nu(c1;t ) +\n\nu(c2;t )\n\n(4)\n\nt=0\n\nsubject to\nc1;t +\n\nc2;t\n+ (1 + n)kt+1 = f (kt ) + (1\n1+n\n\n)kt :\n\n(5)\n\nThe objective function has been rewritten to illustrate the redistributive trade-o¤s between\nexisting old cohorts and the new young. A higher value of\n\nplaces more weight on the new-\n\nborn and future generations, and less in the current individuals. The …rst-order conditions\nof the optimization program imply\nu0 (c1;t ) = (1 + n)u0 (c2;t )\n\n(6)\n\nand\n(1 + n)u0 (c1;t ) = u0 (c1;t+1 ) [1\n\n+ f 0 (kt+1 )] :\n\n(7)\n\nBoth conditions are standard. The …rst expression equates the marginal rate of substitution\nof the young and the old at a given point in time. When\n\n= ; both individuals receive\n\nthe same amount of per capital consumption. When the weight on the young cohort is\nlarger, c1;t > c2;t : The second expression is the standard Euler equation but comparing the\nmarginal rate of substitution between a newborn in period t and t + 1 to the marginal rate of\ntransformation. Combining both expressions, the model implies the standard Euler equation\nfrom the two-period overlapping generations model:\nu0 (c1t ) = u0 (c2t+1 ) [1\n\n+ f 0 (kt+1 )] :\n\n(8)\n\nIn steady state, the allocation of resources perfectly separates the production process\n(determination of the capital stock and employment) since the steady state stock of capital\nk s is determined solely from (7),\nf 0 (k s ) = (1 + n)\n7\n\n1\n\n+\n\n1;\n\n(9)\n\n\fwhile steady state consumption cs1 and cs2 solve\nu0 (cs1 ) =\ncs1 +\nSince\n\ncs2\n1+n\n\n(1 + n)u0 (cs2 )\n\n+ ( + n)k s = f (k s ):\n\n(10)\n(11)\n\n< 1, the economy always satis…es the condition for dynamic e¢ ciency. Note that for\n\nthe extreme case of\n\n= 1; the economy satis…es the golden rule f 0 (k ) = n+ . Many analyses\n\nof this model ignore the role of social discounting, implicitly setting\n\n= 1; and maximize the\n\nsavings rate subject to the steady state resource constraint. However, this particular case of\nthe Pareto frontier is not useful for the study of intergenerational redistribution when the\nrelative importance of one group increases.\nIf one restrains the analysis to only steady state allocations, then (9)-(11) yield a unique\nsolution for any value of . It is clear from (9) that for\n\n> 1, k s > k and the economy\n\nhas more capital than prescribed by the golden rule. This is the case studied by Bullard\nand Waller (2004) who looked only at political economy allocations rather than a planner\nallocation. It is in this sense that any political economy allocation occurring in steady state\nof their model can be replicated by an appropriate choice of\n\nconfronting a social planner.\n\nHowever, since we want to study the dynamic behavior of in‡ation following a baby boom and\nbust, we cannot constrain our analysis to steady states. This forces us to study allocations\nfor which\n\n2.3\n\n1.\n\nImplementation of the e¢ cient problem: Lump sum transfers\n\nMarkets can achieve the same allocation as the social planner. However, that requires a\ntransfer resources across cohorts using lump-sum taxation. The optimization problem of the\nrepresentative newborn is given by\nmax u(c1;t ) + u(c2;t+1 )\n\n(12)\n\nc1;t + st = wt lt + T1;t ;\n\n(13)\n\nsubject to\n\nand\nc2;t+1 = (1\n\n+ rt+1 )st + T2;t+1 :\n\n8\n\n(14)\n\n\fThe optimality conditions imply\nu0 (wt lt\n\nst + T1t ) = u0 [(1\n\n+ rt+1 )st + T2;t+1 ] (1 + rt+1 ):\n\nThe optimal interest rate determined by the intergenerational discount rate can be implemented by shifting resources across cohorts at a given period t. That ensures that the young\ncohort saves the right amount, implementing the fully e¢ cient solution. The market clearing\ncondition for capital implies (1 + n)kt+1 = st : The government budget constraint implies\nT1;t +\n\nT2;t\n= 0:\n1+n\n\n(15)\n\nThis economy is not particularly useful, because neither …scal or monetary policy is used\nto implement the e¢ cient solution. In the absence of redistributional policy this is no longer\ntrue. In this case, the direct mechanism needs to respect the distributional restrictions\nimplied by the market. However, a constrained planner can internalize the impact of the\ndecisions on factor prices. This solution should be superior to the one in which the direct mechanism does not take into account the e¤ect of aggregates on factor prices. The\nconstrained e¢ cient solution implies a wedge in market decisions (for instance, in‡ation or\ncapital taxation). The optimal wedge (positive or negative) is determined by the social\ndesirability to redistribute resources across cohorts.\n\n2.4\n\nConstrained e¢ cient allocations: Ramsey\n\nIn the e¢ cient allocation, the social planner has access to lump-sum taxes and transfers.\nSince the use of lump-sum taxes and transfers are rarely used in practice, we follow the\ntraditional Ramsey approach and assume that the social planner: (1) does not have access\nto lump-sum taxes and transfers and (2) faces the same market prices as agents. This\nassumption implies that the only way to increase consumption for a given cohort is to\nmanipulate the incentives to save and the implied relative prices. By taking into account\nthe e¤ects on relative prices the planner does not need to manipulate the allocations that\nmuch. Consider\nV (k0 ) = max\n\n1\nX\n\nt\n\n1\n\nu(c1;t ) +\n\nu(c2;t )\n\n(16)\n\nt=0\n\nsubject to\nc1;t = fl\n\nst 1\n1+n\n9\n\nl\n\nst ;\n\n(17)\n\n\fand\nc2;t = 1\n\nst 1\n1+n\n\n+ fk\n\n(18)\n\nst 1 ;\n\nwhere (1 + n)kt+1 = st . This optimization problem is equivalent to the Ramsey problems\ndescribed in Garriga (2001) when the government expenditure is set equal to zero, or to the\nsteady state analysis when the planner faces no intergenerational con‡ict,\n\n= 1, as in Davila\n\n(2012).\nLet\n\n1;t\n\nand\n\n2;t\n\nrepresent the Lagrange multipliers of the distributional constraints (17)\n\nand (18) respectively. It is important to stress that each resource constraint e¤ectively\nprovides an entitlement for each individual and thus\n\n1;t\n\nand\n\n2;t\n\nare endogenous weights\n\na¤ecting the distribution of resources. The …rst-order conditions of this problem for every\nperiod t yield\n\nu0 (c1;t )\n(1 + n)\n=\n0\nu (c2;t )\n\nThe endogenous weights are the same\n\n1;t\n\n=\n\n2;t\n\n1;t\n\n(19)\n\n:\n\n2;t\n\nonly if the planner does not have redistri-\n\nbutional con‡icts. When a particular cohort controls more resources, its endogenous weight\nis lower making it easier to transfer resources from that cohort to the other. In short, intergenerational redistribution trades o¤ the relative importance of each cohort, , with the\ncohort’s ownership of resources, .\nThe intergenerational decision of savings (capital) is more complicated:\n\n1;t\n\n=\n\n1;t+1 fl;k\n\nst 1\n1+n\n\nl\n+\n1+n\n\n2;t+1\n\n1\n\n+ fk\n\nst 1\n1+n\n\n+ fk;k\n\nst 1\n1+n\n\nst\n: (20)\n1+n\n\nAn increase in savings reduces consumption of the current generation c1;t . The additional\nsavings (1) increases future consumption of the generation that saves the resources by the\nmarginal product of capital, (2) increases the wages of future newborn cohorts at t + 1, and\n(3) reduces the future rate return of all savings.

In the absence\nof intergenerational redistribution, the only way to induce additional savings is to subsidize\n10\n\n\fcapital.\nThis expression can be rewritten in wedges form\nst\nt 1\nt 1\n+ fk;k s1+n\n1\n+ fk s1+n\nu0 (c1;t )\n1+n\n=\n;\n0\n)\nst 1\nl\nu0 (c2;t+1 )\n1 + uu(c0 (c1;t+1\nf\nk;k\n)\n1+n\n1+n\n1;t\n\nwhere fk;k k =\n\n(22)\n\nfl;k l: The constrained e¢ cient solution is fully e¢ cient only when fk;k = 0.\n\nOtherwise, the e¢ cient solution implies an optimal wedge (positive or negative) in savings\ndecisions.

Several\ninstruments can manipulate the relative rate of return of savings (for example, in‡ation or\ncapital taxation). To illustrate the importance of these wedges, we compute some numerical\nexamples that show comparable …ndings to Bullard and Waller (2004).\n\n3\n3.1\n\nMoney and capital\nPricing an additional asset\n\nSince the optimal intergenerational redistribution determines the equilibrium interest rate,\nwe can also think about these parameters as the determining factors in an economy where\ncapital and money are perfect substitutes. Thus, the equilibrium return on capital pins\ndown the real rate of return on money and thus the in‡ation rate. In this economy, one can\nimagine the per capita money growth rate evolving according to Mt+1 (1 + n) = (1 + zt )Mt .\nThe real rate of return on money is given by (1 +\n\nt)\n\n1\n\nwhere\n\nt\n\nis the net in‡ation rate in\n\nperiod t. Arbitrage then implies that\nfk (kt ) =\n\n1\n1+\n12\n\n=\nt\n\n1+n\n:\n1 + zt\n\n(31)\n\n\fWe do not explicitly model the reason agents hold money in this economy. Rather we think\nof this exercise as being able to price an asset that is held in zero net supply. This is similar\nin spirit to Woodford’s (2003) “cashless”economy.\nSince the rate of return from capital is the same as money, it is possible to write the\nconsumer’s budget constraint as\nc2;t+1 =\n\nvt+1\nst+1 ;\nvt\n\n(32)\n\nwhere vt+1 =vt = 1 + n=(1 + z) = 1 + . Replacing the expression in the budget constraint\nimplies\n(1 + )c2t+1 = st+1 :\n\n(33)\n\nThe optimal wedge takes a di¤erent form, but it a¤ects the relative price of consumption.\nArbitrage between money and capital ensures that the economy implements the constrained\ne¢ cient stock of capital. This model ties the constrained e¢ cient level of capital to the\nimplied in‡ation rate that would have to prevail to equate rates of return on assets.\nIt is important to emphasize that the optimal rate of in‡ation is derived from the primitives of redistribution and not the other way around. If we impose the arbitrage condition\ninto the planner’s problem, the optimal capital stock would be determined by z. In this\ncase, the e¤ects of savings in the stock of capital become irrelevant because the exogenous\narbitrage condition would determine the e¢ cient stock of capital, and the level would not\nnecessarily be consistent with the intergenerational discount factor :\n\n3.2\n3.2.1\n\nNumerical example\nFunctional forms and optimality\n\nThe numerical example compares the solution of the unconstrained e¢ cient problem with the\nconstrained one.

The reason is that as more weight is placed on the\nfuture young, the current cohort must save more and reduce its consumption. This increases\nthe endogenous component\nFor low values of\n\n2\n\nand prevents the economy from achieving the e¢ cient solution.\n\nthe model predicts the opposite e¤ect. The economy is not dynamically\n\nine¢ cient in the classical sense, r < n + , but the market solution can have too much or\ntoo little capital relative to the e¢ cient (dynamically e¢ cient) level.\nThe redistributional constraints have important implications for the cross section of consumption. Figure 4 compares the share of consumption of the young cohorts as a fraction of\n\n15\n\n\ftotal consumption.\nFigure 4: Consumption Share Young Cohort\n0.65\nEfficient\nConstrained\n\nConsumption Young(%)\n\n0.6\n\n0.55\n\n0.5\n\n0.45\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n1\n1.1\n1.2\nIntergenerational Discounting (\nλ)\n\n1.3\n\nIn the presence of lump-sum transfers, a larger value of\n\n1.4\n\n1.5\n\nimplies a greater share of\n\nconsumption for the young. However, in the constrained e¢ cient steady state, the relative\nweight of old cohorts,\n\n2;t ,\n\nincreases. As a result, the young cohorts’share of consumption\n\ndecreases. The reason is that the only way to achieve a higher capital stock is to decrease\nconsumption of the young. The absence of intergenerational transfers prevents increasing\nboth consumption and capital simultaneously.\n\n16\n\n\fFigure 5 shows the implied wedge consistent with the high savings rate\nFigure 5: Optimal Wedge\n\nWedge (<1= tax | >1= Subsidy)\n\n2\n\nEfficient\nConstrained\n\n1.8\n\n1.6\n\n1.4\n\n1.2\n\n1\n\n0.8\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n1\n1.1\n1.2\nIntergenerational Discounting (\nλ)\n\n1.3\n\n1.4\n\n1.5\n\nIn the market economy, young cohorts can only be induced to save more and reduce the\ncurrent consumption when the return from capital is higher than the marginal product of\ncapital. When the economy has too much capital relative to the e¢ cient level, the optimal\nstrategy is to reduce the return of savings of the old cohorts.\nThe notion of in‡ation or de‡ation should be viewed relative to the e¢ cient magnitude,\n. It is possible to construct examples where the constrained e¢ cient in‡ation rate is\nnegative\nof\n\n< 0 or\n\nwe have (\n\n> 0. The role of redistributional policy implies that for di¤erent ranges\n<\n\n) <\n\n( ) <\n\n(\n\n). When population growth is positive the\n\n>\n\nequilibrium interest rate is always positive r = n, and the redistribution is accomplished\nby changing the optimal rate of de‡ation z < 0. When the size of the population shrinks\n(i.e., after a baby boom), then r = n < 1 and the e¢ cient rate of in‡ation can be positive\nor negative depending on the distributional factor . Figure 6 summarizes the annualized\n\n17\n\n\fin‡ation rate implied by the model.\nFigure 6: Annualized In‡ation (n<0)\nx 10\n\n-3\n\nEfficient\nConstrained\n20\n\nInflation\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n1\n1.1\n1.2\nIntergenerational Discounting(\nλ)\n\n1.3\n\n1.4\n\n1.5\n\nIn this economy, the monetary equilibrium implies r < 1; and as a result the crossing\nline between e¢ cient and constraint implies\n\n> 0: The relevant result is not the level of\n\nin‡ation but the relative preference for di¤erent individuals in the population. This economy\nillustrates the basic trade-o¤ between the young and old. The young prefer higher in‡ation\n(or less de‡ation) and the old cohorts prefer the opposite. This trade-o¤ is clear in the\ne¢ cient economy and the constrained e¢ cient economy, but the relative di¤erence in both\neconomies is due to the absence of intergenerational transfers. When the old cohorts are\nrelatively more important, the optimal in‡ation rate is determined by the size of the capital\nstock. Ideally, it would be optimal to have more capital, but the young are the ones that\nneed to give up consumption to achieve the needed level of savings. Since this would violate\ntheir budget constraint, the resulting policy implies de‡ation (redistribution towards the\nold), but the magnitude is not as large as in the e¢ cient case because of the binding role of\nthe redistributional constraints.\nThe level of in‡ation depends on the growth rate of population. With stationary population, n = 0, the interest rate is always above one and the optimal in‡ation is always negative\nas can be seen in Figure 7.\n\n18\n\n\fFigure 7: Annualized In‡ation (n=0)\nEfficient\nConstrained\n0.01\n\n0.005\n\nInflation\n\n0\n\n-0.005\n\n-0.01\n\n-0.015\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n1\n1.1\n1.2\nIntergenerational Discounting( λ)\n\n1.3\n\n1.4\n\n1.5\n\nThe model also predicts that the young cohorts have a preference for a lower negative\ngrowth of money, whereas the old cohorts prefer a higher rate of de‡ation. The quantitative\nmagnitudes depend on the parameterization, but the qualitative tension between young and\nold cohorts is consistent with the political economy equilibrium of Bullard and Waller (2004).\nThe revenue/loss raised by the optimal wedge is rebated to the old cohort. Figure 8\ncompares the tax/transfers paid by the old generation for both economies.\nFigure 8: Taxes and Transfers\n1\n\nEfficient\nConstrained\n\n0\n-1\n\nTaxation\n\n-2\n-3\n-4\n-5\n-6\n-7\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n1\n1.1\n1.2\nIntergenerational Discounting (\nλ)\n\n19\n\n1.3\n\n1.4\n\n1.5\n\n\fFor a given value of ; the e¢ cient economy always has more redistribution than the\nconstrained e¢ cient one. When both economies achieve similar capital stock levels, the role\nof redistribution becomes less important, and the consumption shares of each cohort are\nnearly the same.\n\n4\n\nTransitional dynamics\n\nThe steady state calculations are only useful to illustrate the static trade-o¤. By de…nition,\nthe young and the old cohort have to face the same prices. The current young might earn\na high wage today, but will be an old cohort tomorrow earning a low rate of return. In the\ntransition path the stock of capital changes, therefore, the prices faces by a given generation\nat time t will be di¤erent to those face by the next generation at t + 1:\nThe intuition is clear from the Euler equation of the constrained e¢ cient problem\nc1;t =\n\nt+1\nt\n\n) Akt+11 ] + c2;t+1 1\n\nc1;t+1 [(1\n\n+\n\n2\n\nAkt+11 :\n\n(39)\n\nAn increase in savings reduces the consumption of the current young c1;t ; increases the\ncompensation of the future young cohort, c1;t+1 ; via wages and decreases the return from\nsavings of the young cohort next period, c2;t+1 : Because the current young and the future\nold are the same individuals, the relative weight\n\nt\n\ncancels.\n\nThe Euler equation of the e¢ cient solution is very di¤erent, but has the same economic\ninterpretation. The intergenerational redistribution is done directly, and as a result market\nprices are not distorted:\nc1;t =\n\nt+1\nt\n\nc1;t+1 1\n\n+ Akt+11 :\n\n(40)\n\nIt is clear from the expression that an increase of the relative weight of future cohorts,\nt+1 = t\n\n> 1; will reduce consumption of the current generation (increase in savings) relative\n\nto future generations. The increasing savings are sustained by intergenerational transfers.\nA simple way to capture the e¤ects of demographic changes is to adjust the relative\nimportance of a given cohort in the social welfare function. When current generations become\nrelatively more important than future generations, the capital stock will increase. A higher\ncapital stock reduces the return of savings and it increases workers’compensation.\nIn the experiment we adjust the initial discount rate\n\nso both economies start with the\n\nsame stock of capital. Therefore, the constrained economy is e¢ cient with an optimal wedge\n20\n\n\fequal to zero. The implied in‡ation is determined by the arbitrage condition between capital\nand money. We consider two di¤erent sequences of intergenerational weights f t g: In case\n\n1 the relative importance of young cohorts increases during a short number of periods. In\ncase 2, the high\n\nis maintained during a larger number of periods. The di¤erence sequences\n\nillustrated in Figure 9 summarize the behavior of the model in these two cases.\n\nFigure 9: Intergenerational Discount Rate\nCase 2: Persistent\n1.6\n\n1.4\n\n1.4\n\nIntergenerational Discounting\nλ) (\n\nIntergenerational Discounting\nλ) (\n\nCase 1: Transitory\n1.6\n\n1.2\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n1.2\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n0.4\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\nThe interpretation we wish to use is that the young cohorts become temporarily more\nimportant in the determination of the optimal policy. The change is transitory and eventually\nreverts back the initial level. The change in the social discount rate has implications for\nsavings and consumption. The initial steady state is no longer optimal at the new discount\nrates f t g: The implicit baby boom generates a change in policy. To incentivize the savings\n\nthe rate of return of money has to decrease (this is the standard Tobin e¤ect in this model).\nThe implied policy generates a hump-shaped response from in‡ation.\n\n21\n\n80\n\n90\n\n\fFigure 10: Annualized In‡ation\nCase 1: Transitory\n\nCase 2: Persistent\n\n0.015\n\nx 10\n\n-3\n\nEfficient\nConstrained\n\n14\n12\nEfficient\nConstrained\n\nInflation (Annualized)\n\nInflation (Annualized)\n\n0.01\n\n0.005\n\n0\n\n-0.005\n\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n-2\n-4\n-6\n\n-0.01\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\nFigure 10 summarizes the evolution of annualized in‡ation along the transition path. Both\neconomies increase the in‡ation rate relative to the initial steady state. The persistence\nof in‡ation is entirely determined by :5 Along the transition path the increase in savings\nincreases the compensation of working generations and reduces the return from savings\nfor the existing old. In the e¢ cient economy, the optimal in‡ation rate can be sustained\nvia intergenerational policy. The constrained economy has more limitations regarding the\ntransfer resources across generations. Market prices are the only mechanism for the young\nindividuals to save the right amount. As a result, the constrained in‡ation rate is lower\nduring the boom, but higher during the bust. The underlying income distribution between\nwage earners and the asset-holding generation places bounds on the optimal policy.\nThe increase in the savings rate reduces the return from capital and increases the workers\ncompensation. Figure 11 summarizes the evolution of real interest rates as a percentage\n\n5\n\nThe nature of the two-period problem requires an assumption of a high depreciation rate, and we used\n= 1: Given that all the capital depreciates from one period to the next one, the dynamics in terms of\nquantities per period are very fast. We think the same dynamics would hold in more elaborate general\nequilibrium life cycle settings, but the computational cost would be higher.\n\n22\n\n80\n\n90\n\n\fchange of the initial steady state.\nFigure 11: Interest Rates\nCase 2: Persistent\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\nInterest Rates (% Change)\n\nInterest Rates (% Change)\n\nCase 1: Transitory\n0.2\n\n0\n\n-0.1\nEfficient\nConstrained\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.3\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.5\n\nEfficient\nConstrained\n\n0\n\n-0.1\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.3\n\n-0.4\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\nThe path of interest rates is entirely driven by the sequence of f t g: In the constrained\n\ne¢ cient economy, the optimal in‡ation rate is not su¢ ciently high to encourage a higher\nsavings rate. As a result, the interest rate does not fall as much during the boom and\nworkers compensation cannot increase to the e¢ cient levels.\n\n5\n\nConclusions\n\nWe study the interaction between population demographics, the desire for redistribution in\nthe economy, and the optimal in‡ation rate in a deterministic economy with capital. In\nthe economy we study changes in the population structure are interpreted as the ability of\na particular cohort to in‡uence redistributive policy. The intergenerational redistribution\ntension is intrinsic in life-cycle models. Young cohorts have few assets, and wages are the\nmain source of income. Old generations work less and prefer a high rate of return from their\nsavings. When the government has access to lump-sum taxes and transfers, redistributive\npolicy does not have to resort to distortionary measures (such as capital taxes, or in‡ation).\nWhen lump-sum transfers are not possible but we allow the planner to use in‡ation or\nde‡ation to achieve as much of the redistribution as possible, there exists a competitive\nequilibrium with a constrained-optimal redistributive policy. The equilibrium entails optimal\ndistortions on relative prices that are necessary to achieve the constrained e¢ cient allocation.\nWhen the old have more in‡uence over this redistributive policy, the economy has a lower\n23\n\n90\n\n100\n\n\fsteady state level of capital, a higher steady state real rate of return, and a lower or negative\nrate of in‡ation. By contrast, when the young have more in‡uence the economy has more\ncapital than the e¢ cient level, wages are relatively high and the market solution requires a\nlow rate of return from money holdings, that is, a relatively high in‡ation rate.\nWhen demographics are changing, the constrained e¢ cient solution will entail an entire\ntransition path that will alter capital stocks, in‡ation, real wages, consumption, and other\nkey macroeconomic variables. In particular, a “baby boom”can generate temporarily higher\nin‡ation, and aging population dynamics will put downward pressure on in‡ation or even\nlead to de‡ation. This seems to be broadly consistent with the very rough evidence presented\nin Figures 1 and 2.\nIn this paper, we have allowed a planning problem to “stand in”for the political processes\nthat society uses to make decisions concerning redistributional policy. Some more concrete\nexamples of political processes are studied in Bullard and Waller (2004), including a “policy\ncommittee” that uses Nash bargaining to come to a social decision. In this paper, by contrast, the planner optimally chooses in‡ation or de‡ation to do as much of the desirable\nredistribution as possible given that in‡ation or de‡ation only provides a partial substitute\nfor a fully operational lump-sum tax and transfer scheme. The society could use other types\nof distortionary taxes to achieve similar goals, so we interpret the …ndings here as providing\nan assessment of the marginal contribution of in‡ation or de‡ation in this process taking the\nexisting distortionary tax system as …xed and immutable.\nTaken at face value, the results in this paper contribute to the debate concerning the\nobservation of mild de‡ation in Japan along with an aging population structure. The results\nsuggest that the aging population may be optimally associated with lower in‡ation as part of\nthe constrained e¢ cient equilibrium. We think it will be interesting to study this hypothesis\nfurther in models that can more realistically quantify these e¤ects.\n\nReferences\nBullard, J. and Waller, CJ (2004) Central bank design in general equilibrium.

LOUIS – Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard discussed “The\nAftermath of the Housing Bubble” on Tuesday during an event jointly hosted by the\nBipartisan Policy Center’s Housing Commission and the Jack Kemp Foundation.\nDuring his presentation, Bullard discussed current monetary policy in the U.S. and the\neconomic outlook. He also discussed the collapse of the U.S. housing bubble and its\nimplications for the economy. “Recovery from this event is ongoing and will ultimately\ntake many years,” he said, noting that households are saddled with far too much\nmortgage debt compared with historical norms. “Monetary policy has been ultra-easy\nduring this period, but cannot reasonably encourage additional borrowing by\nhouseholds with too much debt,” he added.\nCurrent U.S. Monetary Policy\nMany analysts of the U.S. economy are pointing to a “global slowdown,” Bullard said.\nFor example, the Euro-area unemployment rate has increased over the past year, and\nChinese economic data has indicated slower growth than anticipated so far this year.\nWhile the U.S. data has been mixed in recent weeks, Bullard noted that “the outlook for\n2012 has not changed signi cantly so far,” with many expecting a stronger second\nquarter than rst quarter in terms of real GDP growth and a stronger second half of\n2012 than rst half.\nRegarding labor market conditions, Bullard said, “The recent nonfarm payrolls report\nwas disappointing, but not enough to substantially alter the contours of the U.S.\noutlook.” He added that seasonal adjustment factors may be disturbing the normal\ninterpretation of the data; when looking at non-seasonally adjusted data, employment\ngrowth from one year earlier is better in 2012 than in either 2010 or 2011.\nBullard noted that the situation in Europe has driven U.S. interest rates lower. “Both\nnominal and real interest rates have fallen substantially over the last year in the U.S.,” he\nsaid.\n“One possible FOMC strategy is to simply pocket the lower yields and continue to waitand-see on the U.S. economic outlook,” he said, adding that “current policy is already\nvery easy, as the policy rate remains near zero and the balance sheet remains large.”\nFurthermore, while the global problems are being driven by the continued turmoil in\nEurope, “a change in U.S. monetary policy at this juncture will not alter the situation in\nEurope,” Bullard stated.\n\n\fU.S. Housing Markets\nIn discussing the collapsed U.S. housing bubble, Bullard noted that most components\nof U.S. GDP – except for the components of investment related to real estate – have\nrecovered to or past their levels of the fourth quarter of 2007. “It is therefore not\nreasonable to claim that the ‘output gap’ is exceptionally large,” he said.\nThe “large output gap” view of the recent U.S. economy faces several di culties,\nBullard said. For instance, it suggests that GDP growth should be very rapid, that\nin ation should be much lower, and that the housing bubble did no lasting damage to\nthe economy.\nOn the other hand, the “lower trend growth” view provides a more natural explanation of\nevents, Bullard said. Based on this view, GDP growth is expected to be relatively slow,\nin ation can remain near the Fed’s in ation target of 2 percent, and the housing bubble\ndid lasting damage to the economy. “In short, this view suggests that most of the\nbusiness-cycle adjustment has already taken place, and that what remains is a slow\nrate of trend growth due to longer-term adjustment processes still taking place in real\nestate,” he concluded.\nBullard then spoke about the aftermath of the bubble. “It is neither feasible nor\ndesirable to attempt to re-in ate the housing bubble. The bubble did a lot of damage\nand should not be repeated,” Bullard said. “Policy should be directed to encouraging\nmarket-based adjustment as quickly as possible,” he added, noting that “allocating\nlosses to one group or another is not helpful in a macroeconomic sense.” He also said\nthat the housing bubble collapse may have shifted preferences for home ownership,\nwith the rent-versus-own decision shifting decidedly in favor of renting.\nThe crisis has also left U.S. households with more debt than they had intended, Bullard\nsaid, adding that “this is the rst U.S. recession in which deleveraging has played a key\nrole.” It will take a long time for homeowners with mortgage debt to return to the\nnormal loan-to-value ratio of roughly 60 percent, he said, noting that “it is not a matter\nof business-cycle frequency adjustment.”\nBullard also discussed some geographic aspects of the housing bubble, noting that in\nMarch 2006, mortgage conditions (as measured by the percentage of mortgages 30plus days past due or in foreclosure) were pristine. While mortgage distress peaked in\n2010, mortgage conditions remained distressed in March 2012 throughout much of the\nU.S.\n“We should expect and plan for slow adjustment in housing markets,” Bullard said.\n\nGENERAL\nHome\nAbout Us\nBank Supervision\nCareers\nCommunity Development\nEconomic Education\nEvents\nInside the Economy Museum\nNewsroom\nOn the Economy Blog\n\n\fOpen Vault Blog\nOUR DISTRICT\nLittle Rock Branch\nLouisville Branch\nMemphis Branch\nAgricultural Finance Monitor\nHousing Market Conditions\nSELECTED PUBLICATIONS\nBridges\nEconomic Synopses\nHousing Market Perspectives\nIn the Balance\nPage One Economics\nThe Quarterly Debt Monitor\nReview\nRegional Economist\nST.

In particular,\nhe noted that the policy rate remains near-zero, the large Fed balance sheet remains in\nplace, “Operation Twist” is still ongoing and will alter the balance sheet composition\nthrough the end of this year, and the calendar-date guidance regarding the rst increase\nin the policy rate remains in effect.\n“In short, current monetary policy remains ultra-easy and is likely appropriately\ncalibrated to the current situation,” Bullard said.\nHe noted that “most analysis suggests Fed actions have helped produce very low\nnominal and real interest rates across the yield curve.” Based on his own calculations,\nBullard estimated that yields would normally be considerably higher given current\nmacroeconomic conditions. Part of the explanation for the low rates, he stated, is that\ncontinued turmoil in Europe has caused U.S. interest rates to fall due to a “ ight-tosafety” effect.\nIn further discussion regarding the European sovereign debt crisis, Bullard said that it\ndoes not have easy solutions and noted that the crisis is fundamentally about countries\nthat have borrowed too heavily on international debt markets. “This is not a problem\nthat monetary policy can remedy,” he emphasized, adding that “attempts to use\n\n\fmonetary policy to x scal problems have historically ended with substantial\nin ation.” Therefore, he stated, “Debt problems take a long time to work out, so we\nshould expect a drawn-out adjustment process in Europe.”\nIn discussing the effects of European turmoil on the U.S., Bullard said that recent\nspillover has come mostly in the form of lower U.S. interest rates and that, so far,\nnancial stress in the U.S. has increased only modestly. While U.S. nancial rms have\nhigher levels of capital now than they did in 2008, he said, “In the event of a severe\nnancial shock, the Fed could re-open liquidity facilities pioneered during 2008-2009.”\nRegarding U.S. labor markets, Bullard noted that they have improved over the last year,\ndespite relatively slow economic growth. In particular, the unemployment rate has\nfallen by 0.8 percentage points (from 9 percent in May 2011 to 8.2 percent in May\n2012). “This is relatively fast compared to U.S. macroeconomic history over the last 25\nyears,” he stated.\nOn U.S. in ation, Bullard noted that it is close to the FOMC’s 2 percent target by many\nmeasures and that expected in ation is near target as well. Despite some claiming that\n“price level targeting” would make a difference, Bullard pointed out that “the U.S. price\nlevel appears to be quite close to an appropriate price level path.” Furthermore, the U.S.\nprice level has not strayed from an appropriate path as it did in Japan during the 1990s\nand in the U.S. during the 1930s, he said.\nRisks to Current Fed Policy\nBullard then discussed some of the possible risks to the FOMC’s current policy. “The\nultra-easy monetary policy has been appropriate so far, but could reignite a 1970s-type\nexperience globally if pursued too aggressively,” he said, noting that the 1970s era\nincluded four recessions in 13 years, double-digit in ation and double-digit\nunemployment. “The lesson was clear,” Bullard said. “Do not let the in ation genie out\nof the bottle.”\nRegarding other potential risks, including concerns that the FOMC has done too little,\nBullard said, “If anything, the Committee may be trying to do too much with monetary\npolicy, risking monetary instability for the U.S. and the global economy.” He added that\nshould the U.S. economy encounter further negative shocks, “the Committee can\nrespond as appropriate to a signi cant deterioration relative to the current forecast.”\nBullard then explained the risks inherent in considering changes in monetary policy to\nimprove the U.S. employment outlook, noting that it is important to remember that\n“monetary policy is a blunt instrument which affects the decision making of everyone in\nthe economy.” Given that labor market policies (e.g., unemployment insurance, worker\nretraining) have direct effects on the unemployed, “It may be better to focus on labor\nmarket policies to directly address unemployment instead of taking further risks with\nmonetary policy,” he said.\nAnother potential risk is distortions in the economy, Bullard said, noting that the nearzero rate policy has been in place for more than three years now, and it is projected to\nremain in place for several more. “The near-zero rates cause other distortions in the\neconomy, including punishing savers,” he said.\nFed Communications\n“The FOMC has increased the degree of transparency surrounding monetary policy in a\nvariety of ways since the 1990s,” Bullard said. For example, in January 2012, the FOMC\nbegan releasing participants’ forecasts of the future path for the policy rate.\nAlthough the economy is described by many variables, Bullard noted that the Fed’s\ncurrent communication strategy operates with only a few variables. “The FOMC could\n\n\finstead publish a quarterly document akin to the Bank of England’s ‘In ation Report,’” he\nsaid.\n“A report of this type could potentially lay down a benchmark ‘Fed view’ on the key\nissues facing the U.S. economy,” Bullard said, adding that “FOMC participants could\npoint out where their views differ from the benchmark.” Furthermore, he said, the\nrelease of the report could be coordinated with Chairman Bernanke’s quarterly press\nbrie ngs. Such a report could provide “a broader discussion of the U.S. outlook,”\nBullard said.\n\nGENERAL\nHome\nAbout Us\nBank Supervision\nCareers\nCommunity Development\nEconomic Education\nEvents\nInside the Economy Museum\nNewsroom\nOn the Economy Blog\nOpen Vault Blog\nOUR DISTRICT\nLittle Rock Branch\nLouisville Branch\nMemphis Branch\nAgricultural Finance Monitor\nHousing Market Conditions\nSELECTED PUBLICATIONS\nBridges\nEconomic Synopses\nHousing Market Perspectives\nIn the Balance\nPage One Economics\nThe Quarterly Debt Monitor\nReview\nRegional Economist\nST.

            "content": "The Global Economy and the European Sovereign Debt Crisis\nOMFIF Golden Series Lecture\nLondon\nJuly 10, 2012\nIntroduction\nRecent readings on the global economic outlook have been tepid. Europe taken as a whole is in\na recessionary state, and the uncertain effects of the ongoing sovereign debt crisis continue to\nweigh on the medium-term outlook. Global investors are dividing Europe once again into\nmember states, a sort of market-based disintegration of the continent. The U.S. is growing, but\nat a sluggish pace. Recent data from China suggest a slower pace of growth than might have\nbeen expected earlier this year. Commodity prices have fallen to lower levels during recent\nmonths in part in response to the slowing global economy. Inflation readings have generally\nbeen lower. This constellation of data is causing considerable unease in global financial\nmarkets and in policymaking circles. Much of the unease can be traced to the increasing\nrealization that the European sovereign debt crisis may be more traumatizing and more\nintractable than previously understood.\nIn this talk, I will begin with the policy situation in the U.S., and I will argue that among many\nfactors affecting the U.S. in the medium term, the ongoing European crisis is the most pressing\none from the U.S. point of view. Accordingly, I will then turn to discuss some aspects of the\npresent European debate on the crisis, including the notion of exit from the eurozone and the\npossibility of a grand bargain outcome with increased political and fiscal cooperation within\nEurope. I will also discuss increased economic growth as a helpful tonic for the crisis. I will\nstress that while growth is certainly desirable, increased government spending today followed\nby higher future taxes is not likely to produce more rapid growth. I will conclude that the most\nlikely way forward continues to be a long period of debt paydown and sluggish growth, both in\nEurope and the U.S., and that the most pressing policy issue is to accept this path and prevent\nany additional problems from developing as we press ahead.\nMy remarks here today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of others on the\nFederal Open Market Committee.\n\n\fThe U.S. Situation\nThe U.S. economy remains on a modest growth path. The housing bubble and the ensuing\nfinancial crisis probably did some lasting damage to the economy, suggesting that the output\ngap in the U.S. is not as large as commonly believed and that the growth rate of potential\noutput is modest. This helps explain why U.S. growth continues to be sluggish, why U.S.\ninflation has remained close to target instead of dropping precipitously and why U.S.\nunemployment has fallen over the last year—from a level of 9.1 percent in June 2011 to 8.2\npercent in June 2012. This pace of improvement in unemployment has not occurred since the\nmiddle of the 1990s. The most recent labor market data for the U.S. were somewhat weaker\nthan expected, with the unemployment rate remaining at 8.2 percent and the total private\nsector payroll jobs added coming in at 84,000. However, the hours figures were somewhat\nmore encouraging, and unemployment claims remain below the threshold value of 400,000.\nAccordingly, this report, by itself, is not sufficient to change my forecast of modestly improving\neconomic growth during the second half of 2012 along with a slow and intermittent decline in\nunemployment.\nU.S. monetary policy has been aggressively easy for more than four years, and all the policy\nactions remain in effect today. The Committee lowered the policy rate substantially in the\nbeginning of 2008. Later that year, the policy rate was lowered to near-zero, where it remains\nto this day. In addition, the Committee embarked on balance sheet policy, buying mortgagedbacked securities beginning in 2009 and buying Treasuries through the QE2 program beginning\nin the last months of 2010. The Fed’s balance sheet remains exceptionally large today due to\nthese outright purchases. The Committee took additional actions in 2011, offering forward\nguidance on the length of time the policy rate is currently anticipated to remain near-zero and\nintroducing a new Operation Twist program aimed at lowering Treasury yields at longer\nmaturities.\nThe Twist program was extended at the June 2012 meeting, in part as a reaction to incoming\ndata suggesting a slower pace of growth in the U.S. and globally. Some estimates have\nsuggested that the Twist extension is akin to a 25-50 basis point reduction in the policy rate in\nnormal times. Given the lags in the effects of monetary policy, it will now take some time to\nsee the impact of this action and to see whether or not the economy can meet the current set\nof expectations on performance during the remainder of 2012.\nThe U.S. economy is also being held back by significant uncertainties both within the U.S. and\nglobally. Uncertainty is inhibiting both household and investor behavior. The U.S. fiscal\n2\n\n\fsituation is similar to that of some countries in Europe and requires dramatic and sustained\nattention. The political compromise in the U.S. has been to delay action until after the\nNovember election, but markets tend to pull the uncertainty forward. Housing activity in the\nU.S. remains well below the levels experienced during the bubble period and seems likely to\nimprove only slowly over the coming years. The U.S. healthcare system is about to engage in a\nmajor transformation, the effects of which are opaque. But even more pressing is the situation\nin Europe. The crisis is contributing to recession, adding a dragging factor on U.S. and Asian\nperformance. There is a financial sector dimension which periodically threatens to expand into\na more generalized financial crisis. It has been difficult for many in the U.S. to envision how the\nsituation will develop going forward.\n\nThe Incentives for Exit\nDebt problems take a long time to work out. We know from individual household situations\nthat many with excessive debt enter into multiyear programs that force a routine level of debt\npaydown and force saving while curtailing consumption. Households can and do sell assets if\nthey have them, and might search for extra income if opportunities are available. Like\ncountries, they can be cut off from credit markets, and rebuilding reputations can take time.\nThere simply are no real shortcuts in this process. The general advice for households has been\nto use credit wisely, borrowing only to make key personal investments that have a clear\nprobability of paying off or to smooth consumption. When the discussion turns to\nmacroeconomics, these principles are sometimes forgotten in a blizzard of analysis, but I think\nthey basically apply.\nOne of the principal issues facing policymakers inside Europe (and worrying those outside) is\nexit from the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). Exit is often portrayed as a crisisproducing event, as it would suggest the use of alternative and presumably much weaker\ncurrencies to pay back external debt. In this sense, it would be a way to partially default, as is\nalways the case with surprise inflation and devaluation. Markets are reacting by pricing in\nsome probability that such an event could occur, even though the official line is that it cannot.\nThe EMU was formed from a subset of EU countries, and so some countries famously remain\noutside the EMU—the leading example being the U.K. Since not all countries joined, it would\nseem that the experiment might have allowed exit from the EMU, but it did not. In addition,\nthere are European nations that are euroized (using the euro) even though they are not part of\n3\n\n\fthe EMU. These arrangements give me pause concerning the meaning of exit from the EMU—\nclearly some countries never joined and others have joined in a de facto sense.\nThe EMU can be viewed as a club, and members enjoy benefits that do not accrue to\nnonmembers. The value of being a member was originally to get German credibility on\nmonetary policy. Countries choosing not to join calculated that they could run an equally\neffective monetary policy to the Germans and so decided not to join. The value of club\nmembership was highest for countries with the least amount of credibility on monetary policy.\nThe initial success of the EMU was stunning, driving yields on all EMU member debt essentially\nto German levels. This created a great environment for investment and stability within the\nEMU.\nThe logic of exit suggests that if the club is valuable, member countries will not want to leave,\njust as they desired to get in initially. Survey evidence seems to indicate that these incentives\nto stay in the club remain strong today. Still, the common refrain that no country can ever be\nallowed to leave the EMU is altering the incentives for nations to take the actions necessary to\nmaintain membership. This is one of the main penalties that in principle should be enforcing\nthe equilibrium behavior among the members of the club. Russell Cooper of the European\nUniversity Institute and Penn State University has recently written extensively on this topic. 1\nThe incentive effects for club membership are critical in another way. For countries that are\nalready members, taking on country credit risk through mutualization is also damaging their\nincentives to remain in the club. They enjoy the benefits of membership, but the calculus could\nchange if they see too many disadvantages from the policies undertaken to keep the union\ntogether. Countries can, in principle, remain on the outside and also do well, as Sweden has\ndemonstrated.\nIn short, my view is that the incentive effects for a member country to remain in the EMU must\nbe considered very carefully going forward. Policies should be designed with an eye toward\nthese incentives, and can no longer assume that the political processes will back the EMU in all\ncircumstances.\n\n1\n\nSee Russell Cooper, 2012, “Exit from a Monetary Union through Euroization: Discipline without Chaos,” NBER\nWorking Paper No. 17908.\n\n4\n\n\fGrand Bargains\nFrom the beginning of the sovereign debt crisis, analysts, policymakers and financial market\nparticipants have craved a simple and sharp solution to the problem. My earlier remarks\nsuggested that debt problems are unlikely to have quick solutions and, therefore, that we\nshould expect a long and slow resolution process peppered with bouts of increased financial\nstress. Still, there is one possibility for a grand bargain that makes some sense and that has\nbeen increasingly discussed in policy circles. This is the notion that Europe has reached a\n“Hamilton moment.”\nThomas Sargent, in his Nobel prize lecture, discussed some of the parallels between the U.S.\ncolonies at the time of the ratification of the U.S. constitution and the current situation in\nEurope. 2 Alexander Hamilton was a proponent of a more powerful national government for the\nmember states, then bound together by the Articles of Confederation. The states had\nconsiderable debts. In a famous compromise, the new and stronger national government\nassumed the states’ debts under certain conditions. Could something similar happen in today’s\nEurope? Certainly there are many calling for greater fiscal and political union.\nA common refrain in U.S. policy circles is that while some EMU countries have considerable\ndebt problems, Europe as a whole has sufficient resources to contain the situation. The debtGDP ratio for the EMU as a whole is 87 percent, not that different from and arguably better\nthan the U.S., depending on how U.S. obligations are counted. A stronger “national”\ngovernment for Europe could hold and service that level of debt. Member states could transfer\ntoday’s debts to the European level, likely in exchange for balanced-budget amendments or\nsimilar binding restrictions on future borrowing and a ceding of greater power to the Europeanwide government. Powers of the European Parliament, in particular taxing authority, might be\nincreased.\nPut starkly as a grand bargain like this, what Sargent termed a “political revolution,” such a deal\nseems remote at the current juncture. But the basic building blocks of a deal are in place, as\nthey were in Hamilton’s time. Much of the current maneuvering in Europe has elements of this\ntype of bargain: In particular, the discussion of a fiscal compact and ideas concerning debt\nmutualization. This makes me put some probability on a sunnier outcome for the situation. On\nthe downside, however, I do not have the sense as an outsider to Europe that there is sufficient\n\n2\n\nThomas Sargent, 2012, “U.S. then, Europe now,” manuscript, New York University. Delivered as the Nobel\nLecture, Dec. 8, 2011.\n\n5\n\n\fpolitical support for a ceding of sovereign authority to the European level. This is making me\nkeep my baseline case as one of a slow paydown of debt in an environment of slow growth.\n\nGrowth and Fiscal Stabilization Policy\nIt is often noted that more rapid economic growth would help solve a lot of problems—and I\nhave to agree. My reading of the literature concerning economic growth is that growth\ndepends on innovation, improvements in technology, human capital and other long-run factors.\nIt is not really a matter of government spending in the abstract or of monetary policy. I am\nworried that a growth agenda interpreted as a government spending agenda instead of a focus\non the factors actually driving economic growth will not succeed and may make problems\nworse.\nI have been disappointed in the debate concerning fiscal stabilization policy in the U.S. over the\npast several years, and I have written about it extensively in recent months. 3 We have a\nleading theory of how fiscal stabilization policy could work in some circumstances, a theory that\nrespects what is known and has been learned concerning fiscal stabilization policy over the last\nseveral decades. 4 My sense is that there is a mismatch between what the theory suggests\nmight be reasonable policy in the current environment and what is generally proposed in policy\ndiscussions. Critically, the theory suggests that the stance and efficacy of monetary policy is a\nkey feature in determining the success of a fiscal expansion, a topic addressed only in the rarest\nof macroeconomic quarters. Perhaps the broadest point is to say that according to the leading\ntheory, a certain type of fiscal expansion can substitute for a missing monetary policy (missing\nbecause of the zero lower bound), and is not a complement to monetary policy. The policy\ndiscussion almost always treats the two as complements, perhaps in the spirit of “throwing\neverything at the problem.”\nOne very concrete version of this would proceed as follows. If you think, as I do, that monetary\npolicy can be effective even with the policy rate at the zero lower bound, then one should not\ntalk about fiscal supplements to that policy because, according to the theory, that would not\nmake sense. Further, if monetary policy is appropriately calibrated given the current\nmacroeconomic situation, as I believe it is in the U.S., then we have the countercyclical policy\nwe need in place. For those who think, on the other hand, that monetary policy is not effective\n3\n\nSee James Bullard, 2012, “Death of a Theory,” Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Review, 94(2): 83-101.\nSee Michael Woodford, 2011, “Simple Analytics of the Government Expenditure Multiplier,” American Economic\nJournal: Macroeconomics, 3(1): 1-35.\n4\n\n6\n\n\fonce the zero lower bound is encountered, the focus should be exclusively on fiscal stabilization\npolicy, and supplements from monetary policy would be a distraction. However, the basic fiscal\nintervention required is a tax-financed increase in expenditure, not a deficit-financed one. Even\nthis will have the intended effects only if implemented in a relatively precise way.\nIn short, while more rapid economic growth is very much a desirable outcome, I am doubtful it\ncan be achieved through traditional fiscal expansion. In the medium term, it may be possible to\nundertake structural reforms both in the U.S. and in Europe and improve growth prospects,\nsomething I would very much favor, but that should not be expected to improve the crisis\nsituation in the very near term.\n\nSummary\nThe global economy is facing a slowdown combined with an ongoing sovereign debt crisis in\nEurope. I have argued that among the many cross-currents and uncertainties facing the U.S.\neconomy, the most important one is the continued uncertainty emanating from the European\nsituation.\nI have also presented some comments on aspects of the crisis. In my view, the notion of the\nincentives of nations to leave the EMU has received too little attention up to now, perhaps on a\njudgment that the debt situations could be managed without raising such a possibility. In the\ncurrent environment, these incentives have to be calculated and taken seriously. While I have\nsome sympathy for the idea that Europe may be facing its own “Hamilton moment” and, thus,\nthat the outlines of a grand bargain solution to the sovereign debt crisis may be faintly visible,\nas of now I continue to put low probability on such an outcome. I have also stressed that I am\nvery supportive of efforts to increase the pace of economic growth both in Europe and the U.S.,\nbut that I do not think growth prospects can be meaningfully improved through traditional\nfiscal expansion. Instead, I think structural reforms which improve medium-term growth\nprospects are more likely to be successful.\n\nJames Bullard, President and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\n\n7\n\n\f",

            "content": "Search Site\nHome > Newsroom >\n\nSt. Louis Fed's Bullard Discusses Price Level Targeting, Nominal\nGDP Targeting, Too Much Debt\n10/4/2012\nMEMPHIS, Tenn. – Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard gave\nremarks Thursday night on “Price Level Targeting: The Fed Has It About Right” at the\nEconomic Club of Memphis.\nDuring his presentation, Bullard discussed the large shock to the U.S. economy in 20082009 and what should have happened if monetary policy reacted in just the right way to\nthe shock. In Bullard’s view what should have happened, in fact, is what actually\nhappened. Given that “price level targeting” can be the optimal policy according to\nsome leading theories, he said that one possible monetary policy response was for the\nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to maintain the price level on its established\npath. “The FOMC has in fact essentially behaved as if it was price level targeting. In\nthis sense, policy since 2008 looks close to optimal,” he said, calling this “a singular\nachievement of recent monetary policy.”\nBullard also discussed the aftermath of the large shock to the economy. “As the dust\nhas settled since 2008, it has become more and more apparent that U.S. real GDP is\ngrowing along a different path than the bubble-induced, pre-crisis path,” he said. He\nnoted this is consistent with key ndings of Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff, who\nanalyzed nancial crises over the past 800 years and concluded that post- nancial\ncrisis economies grow more slowly.\nBullard said that the Reinhart-Rogoff effect has implications for future monetary policy.\nFor example, “Attempting to target nominal GDP without adjustment for the ReinhartRogoff effect could be a policy disaster,” he said.\nIn light of too much debt in the economy, Bullard noted that alternative theories of\noptimal policy include the idea that surprise in ation is a way to partially default on\ndebt. However, “That type of policy choice would likely impair U.S. credit markets into\nthe distant future,” he said.\nPrice Level Targeting and the Actual Price Level\nIn looking closer at price level targeting, Bullard cited a leading theory that has been\nextensively analyzed by Michael Woodford and co-authors. Bullard stated that the main\nidea in the theory is that prices are “sticky” and therefore do not adjust immediately to\nchanges in supply and demand conditions. He noted that optimal monetary policy\ncorrects for this de ciency. “When the economy is hit by a shock, the optimal policy\nreturns the price level back to its previous path.” Thus, he said that the behavior of the\naggregate price level might be viewed as a “signature” of optimal monetary policy.\n\n\fThe advice from Woodford’s model, Bullard said, is that policymakers should take care\nto keep the price level on an established path when a large shock hits the economy.\nIndeed, this basic advice seems to have been implemented in the U.S., he stated, noting\nthat the current U.S. price level is not far from the path established during the mid1990s. “This could be interpreted as ‘monetary policy has done exactly what it was\nsupposed to do in response to the large shock,’” he said. Bullard explained that the\nFOMC simply kept in ation close to 2 percent even in the face of the large shock, rather\nthan explicitly stating that maintaining the price level path was an ultimate goal.\nThe Reinhart-Rogoff Effect and Nominal GDP Targeting\nBullard said that some shocks may be so large and so unusual that they cause\nespecially severe damage to the economy. To that end, Reinhart and Rogoff showed\nthat the aftermath of major nancial crises tends to be marked by many years of\nslower-than-normal growth. Bullard noted that this seems to have happened in the U.S.\n“Before 2007, growth was likely arti cially high due to the housing bubble. After 2009,\ngrowth has likely been slowed by deleveraging,” he said.\nBullard then discussed the implications of the Reinhart-Rogoff effect for nominal GDP\ntargeting. “Nominal GDP includes both the price level and real GDP in one aggregate; it\ndoes not separate the two,” he explained. “The aggregate price level seems to be right\nabout on target. Real GDP, on the other hand, seems to have been markedly in uenced\nby the Reinhart-Rogoff effect,” he said, observing that real GDP has grown slowly in\nrecent years.\nIn fact, simply comparing nominal GDP with its 1990-2008 trend might lead one to\nconclude that U.S. monetary policy has been far off track—that is, way too tight—in\nrecent years, Bullard said. However, “The one variable the Fed can control in the\nmedium and long term, the aggregate price level, is exactly on track,” he stated. “The\nproblem is the failure to adjust nominal GDP for the Reinhart-Rogoff effect.” After\nadjusting appropriately for the Reinhart-Rogoff effect, he noted, nominal GDP is also\nabout on target.\n“Attempts to push nominal GDP higher would push the price level off its path, violating\nthe signature of optimal monetary policy,” Bullard said.\nThe Problem of Too Much Debt\nBullard noted that while monetary policy is supposed to “ x” the “sticky price” distortion\nin Woodford’s model by keeping the price level on its path in the face of disturbances,\nrelying only on that model to try to understand the current U.S. situation might not be\nwise. “The actual U.S. economy seems to have a very different problem: too much\ndebt,” he said.\nBullard said that in ation is sometimes seen as a way to partially default on existing\nnominal debts; if actual in ation is higher than anticipated, the debtor ends up paying\nless to the lender in real terms. In this scenario, he said, “The partial default would\noccur against savers, mostly older U.S. households, and against foreign creditors.”\nSuch a policy would not be without future costs, Bullard emphasized. “A partial default\ntoday through higher in ation would be paid for via higher in ation premiums in future\nborrowing,” he said. “Creditors would want to protect themselves against the\nunpredictable central bank that might surprise them with a burst of in ation. Nominal\ninterest rates would be higher than otherwise into the distant future.”\nThus, “it is unlikely that partial default through in ation is good policy,” even in models\nwhere there can be “too much debt,” Bullard said. “This type of policy would likely\nimpair U.S. credit markets for many years,” he emphasized.\n\n\fGENERAL\nHome\nAbout Us\nBank Supervision\nCareers\nCommunity Development\nEconomic Education\nEvents\nInside the Economy Museum\nNewsroom\nOn the Economy Blog\nOpen Vault Blog\nOUR DISTRICT\nLittle Rock Branch\nLouisville Branch\nMemphis Branch\nAgricultural Finance Monitor\nHousing Market Conditions\nSELECTED PUBLICATIONS\nBridges\nEconomic Synopses\nHousing Market Perspectives\nIn the Balance\nPage One Economics\nThe Quarterly Debt Monitor\nReview\nRegional Economist\nST.

LOUIS – Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard gave remarks\nThursday night on “Shadow Interest Rates and the Stance of U.S. Monetary Policy,” as\npart of the Ninth Annual Corporate Finance Conference held at the Olin Business\nSchool at Washington University in St. Louis.\nPinning down the stance of monetary policy in a zero lower bound environment is very\nchallenging. During his presentation, Bullard posed the question of whether current\nU.S. monetary policy is “too easy.” He cited recent research by Leo Krippner, a nancial\nmarket economist at the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, which suggests that current\nU.S. monetary policy may be considerably easier than commonly understood. “In\nparticular, the current U.S. policy stance may be substantially easier than the policy\nstance recommended by commonly-used monetary policy feedback rules,” Bullard said.\nA Shadow Policy Rate\nThe level of nominal short-term interest rates is conventionally taken to indicate the\nstance of policy, Bullard said, noting that lower values are described as “easier” policy.\nHowever, given that the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC’s) policy rate has\nbeen near zero since December 2008, how should the monetary policy stance be\ndescribed? Bullard said that when the policy rate is near zero, a “shadow short-term\nrate” can be understood as a metric for the stance of monetary policy.\nKrippner calculates such a shadow rate, which is currently about -5 percent. It\naveraged -5.12 percent from August 2010, when Chairman Ben Bernanke indicated that\nadditional asset purchases may be needed, to the end of October 2012. Krippner’s\ncalculation is a modi ed version of the approach by the late Fischer Black, who was a\nleader in mathematical nance.\nImplications for U.S. Monetary Policy\nBullard noted that in recent years, it has become popular to describe the desired level of\nthe policy rate by using versions of Taylor-type policy rules. One such rule is often\ncalled the Taylor (1999) rule. These rules relate the current value of the policy rate to\nmacroeconomic variables (e.g., in ation and the output gap or unemployment gap).\n“Most policy rules in this class currently recommend a negative policy rate,” he said.\nSince the recommended short-term rate cannot be negative, he explained, one\ninterpretation is that unconventional policies have been needed to try to achieve the\nrecommended policy rate.\n\n\fUsing the Krippner calculation of a shadow short-term nominal interest rate as a\nmeasure of actual policy, Bullard compared this shadow rate with the recommended\npolicy rate from a standard policy rule. “According to these estimates, the shadow\npolicy rate is currently more than 300 basis points lower than the rate recommended by\nthe Taylor (1999) rule,” he said. “This suggests that actual U.S. monetary policy may\ncurrently be easier than the recommendations from that particular rule.”\nAnother implication, he said, is that policy may have been too tight relative to this\nrecommended policy rate in 2009, at which point the FOMC had not yet taken many of\nits unconventional policy actions, such as forward guidance and QE2. “The actual\npolicy stance as measured by the shadow rate has recently been more volatile than\nduring the pre-2008 era,” Bullard added. “This may be because monetary policy has\nbeen harder to interpret during the period of the zero lower bound.”\nThe Value of Unconventional Policy\nAccording to Bullard, the Krippner study provides one way to evaluate the FOMC’s\nrecent unconventional policy actions. “Signi cant unconventional policy actions at\ntimes seem to conform well with movements in the shadow policy rate,” Bullard said,\nnoting that times of less conformity may indicate an ineffective policy action.\nHe added, “The accumulation of policy actions since 2008 has generally been\nassociated with a continuing decline in the level of the shadow rate—that is, an easier\nand easier policy stance.” He also noted that Krippner’s results are consistent with\nother estimates (e.g., those of San Francisco Fed President John Williams in a 2011\nEconomic Letter).\n“Current policy may be easier than often perceived,” Bullard said. “These ndings are\ninteresting and I encourage further and more detailed analysis in this area.”\n\nGENERAL\nHome\nAbout Us\nBank Supervision\nCareers\nCommunity Development\nEconomic Education\nEvents\nInside the Economy Museum\nNewsroom\nOn the Economy Blog\nOpen Vault Blog\nOUR DISTRICT\nLittle Rock Branch\nLouisville Branch\nMemphis Branch\nAgricultural Finance Monitor\nHousing Market Conditions\nSELECTED PUBLICATIONS\n\n\fBridges\nEconomic Synopses\nHousing Market Perspectives\nIn the Balance\nPage One Economics\nThe Quarterly Debt Monitor\nReview\nRegional Economist\nST.

            "content": "Opening remarks by President James Bullard\nThe 2013 Homer Jones Memorial Lecture\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nApril 3, 2013\nWelcome to the 24th annual Homer Jones Memorial Lecture. Each year we host this event to\nhonor the outstanding contributions of Homer Jones, a former senior vice president and\nResearch director of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.\nThe Bank began the lecture series after Homer Jones’ death in 1986. The lecture series enjoys\nthe long-lasting support and co-sponsorship of many people and organizations, including the St.\nLouis Gateway Chapter of the National Association for Business Economics, Saint Louis\nUniversity, Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville, the University of Missouri at St. Louis\nand Washington University in St. Louis.\nHomer Jones is sometimes described as “Milton Friedman’s teacher” because Jones taught\nFriedman when Friedman was an undergraduate at Rutgers University in the late 1920s and\nearly 1930s.\nThen, as now, it was a tumultuous time for macroeconomists.\nJones had come to Rutgers after studying at the University of Chicago, where he was a student\nof legendary Chicago professor Frank Knight. Also on the Rutgers faculty at the time: a young\nArthur Burns, future Fed chairman.\nAccording to Friedman, Jones was one of the primary influences in Friedman’s choice to study\neconomics, as opposed to mathematics or statistics. In Friedman’s 1976 reminiscence, he says\nJones opened his eyes “to the broader reaches of economics and to the beauties and intricacies\nof economic theory.” 1 The rest, as they say, is history—the two remained friends and\ncolleagues for years afterward.\nIn 1958, Homer Jones joined the staff here at the St. Louis Fed. He is remembered for many\ncontributions at the Bank, but his role in the Bank’s development in monetary research and\nstatistics stands out. The Bank’s research function became a national and international leader\nin the then-rapidly advancing “monetarist” approach to monetary policy. The famous\n1\n\nSee Milton Friedman, 1976, “Homer Jones: A Personal Reminiscence,” Journal of Monetary Economics 2: 433-436.\n\n\fAndersen/Jordan paper published during this era became one of the most widely cited papers\nin all of macroeconomics. 2 And Homer Jones insisted on freely available data to encourage\nresearch on critical economic policy issues.\nToday, the St. Louis Fed is internationally known as an institution that is unparalleled in data\ndissemination. The Bank’s Federal Reserve Economic Data, or FRED, has its genesis in Homer\nJones’ innovative idea to publish monetary data in a form that did not yet exist at the time.\nToday, through FRED, we make more than 61,000 data series available and accessible to\nindividuals and organizations worldwide.\nThe St. Louis Fed’s unwavering commitment to rigorous, independent economic research is the\nkey legacy of Homer Jones that we honor today. Those of us in the Federal Reserve System\nwho believe that the ability to question and re-examine conventional wisdom leads to better\npolicy outcomes owe a great debt to Homer Jones. The Fed’s ability to absorb and be open to\nmultiple viewpoints helps prevent groupthink and leads to superior monetary policy and,\nultimately, to better macroeconomic performance.\nIt is only fitting for us to use the Homer Jones Memorial Lecture to spotlight others who have\nmade a significant impact in the world of academic research, central banking and global\nfinance. It is a pleasure for me to introduce this year’s distinguished speaker, R. Glenn\nHubbard.\nProfessor Hubbard was named dean of the Columbia University Business School in 2004. A\nColumbia faculty member since 1988, he is also the Russell L. Carson Professor of Finance and\nEconomics.\nProfessor Hubbard is affiliated with research programs in monetary economics, public\neconomics, corporate finance and industrial organization at the National Bureau of Economic\nResearch. Additionally, he is a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and a\nmember of the International Advisory Board of the MBA Program of Ben-Gurion University.\nProfessor Hubbard’s research spans tax policy, monetary economics, corporate finance and\ninternational finance. In addition to writing more than 100 scholarly articles in economics and\nfinance, Professor Hubbard is the author of two leading textbooks on money and financial\nmarkets and the principles of economics. He is also the co-author of The Aid Trap: Hard Truths\n\n2\n\nSee Leonall C. Andersen and Jerry L. Jordan, 1968, “Monetary and Fiscal Actions: A Test of Their Relative\nImportance in Economic Stabilization,” Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Review, November: 11-24.\n\n\fAbout Ending Poverty, and Healthy, Wealthy, and Wise: Five Steps to a Better Health Care\nSystem.\nIn government, Professor Hubbard served as deputy assistant secretary of the U.S. Treasury\nDepartment for Tax Policy (from 1991 to 1993), and he was chairman of the U.S. Council of\nEconomic Advisers under President George W. Bush. While serving as CEA chairman, he also\nchaired the Economic Policy Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and\nDevelopment.\nIn the corporate sector, Professor Hubbard is currently a director of ADP, BlackRock Closed-End\nFunds, KKR Financial Corporation and MetLife. He is a life member of the Council on Foreign\nRelations, a co-chairman of the Committee on Capital Markets Regulation and the Study Group\non Corporate Boards, and a past chairman of the Economic Club of New York.\nPlease join me in welcoming R. Glenn Hubbard.\n\nJames Bullard, President and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\n\n\f",

            "content": "Opening remarks by President James Bullard\n2013 Federal Reserve System Community Development Research Conference\nResilience and Rebuilding for Low-Income Communities: Research to Inform Policy and\nPractice\nWashington, D.C.\nApril 11, 2013\nI am delighted to be here today representing the Federal Reserve System’s Conference of\nPresidents through my chairmanship of the Conference’s Committee on Research, Public\nInformation, and Community Affairs.\nThe Conference of Presidents strongly supports the Federal Reserve System’s outreach and\nresearch efforts in the community development arena. These efforts involve the skills of\nemployees in many different divisions within the Federal Reserve and in many different\nlocations across the U.S.A. An especially important role that the Fed’s Community\nDevelopment function plays is in connecting the nation’s central bank with Main Street\nAmerica. At the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, and indeed throughout the Federal Reserve\nSystem, we have heard first-hand how both longer-term changes in the economy and the\nlingering damage from the 2007-2009 recession continue to challenge many households and\nbusinesses.\nThe broad level of performance of the U.S. economy is, of course, vital to the well-being of\nindividual families and local communities. However, it is also clear that even good\nmacroeconomic performance is not a panacea because it does not ensure that all families and\ncommunities are included, or more fully included, in all aspects of the economy. Although\n“economic inclusion” or “financial inclusion” cannot be guaranteed, the Federal Reserve System\ncan be a positive force in providing opportunities and knowledge that can help families and\ncommunities find ways to more fully participate in the economic success of the nation. Better\nresults on inclusion may ultimately create an economy that makes the fullest possible use of its\nrich array of available talent.\nThe Community Development function tries to make progress on this financial inclusion\nobjective by focusing on five areas:\n•\n•\n\nHousehold financial stability;\nNeighborhood revitalization and stabilization;\n\n\f•\n•\n•\n\nSmall-business start-up, growth and sustainability;\nThought leadership to achieve scale, sustainability and impact; and\nCommunication of lessons learned.\n\nThe Fed’s Community Development function is actively engaged in each of these areas. A few\nexamples might include the Kansas City Fed’s “Grow Your Own” initiative to focus on\nopportunities for entrepreneurship in rural America. The San Francisco Fed combined\nthoughtful research and outreach through the publication of “Investing in What Works for\nAmerica’s Communities.” At the St. Louis Fed, we recently launched the Center for Household\nFinancial Stability to research family balance sheets and how those matter for strengthening\nhouseholds and the economy. Several Reserve banks and the Board of Governors have come\ntogether to produce the “Connecting Communities” audio-conference series to address cuttingedge topics among community development practitioners. And many Reserve banks, including\nmy own, have been instrumental in “Bank-On Save-Up” campaigns to offer thousands of\nunbanked Americans nationwide pathways to wealth-building financial services.\nThese examples indicate how the Fed’s Community Development function is helping to address\nthe key issues by convening stakeholders, identifying emerging ideas, and—consistent with my\nacademic bent—conducting primary and applied research.\nThe theme for this conference is “Resilience and Rebuilding.” The 2007-2009 recession\ndisrupted the economic life of the nation. Families and communities have been challenged\nwith job losses, foreclosures, reduced or limited compensation, and high debt. The pressure on\npublic and private safety nets has accordingly been high. These events have tested and\ncontinue to test the resilience of many households and communities. A primary challenge is\nhow to increase this resilience going forward so that a given shock has a lessened adverse\neffect in the future than it had in the past.\nThis conference is not restricted to resilience—it’s also about rebuilding for a brighter future.\nImproved labor market performance and better workforce preparation are central to a better\nfuture for the U.S. economy. Small-business development and sustainability will also be\ncentral; much of the expansion in the labor market comes from this group. Researchers have\nmuch to learn about small businesses and the flows of credit that affect their growth and\ndevelopment.\nAlthough the Fed’s Community Development function at its broadest level is about promoting\ninclusion in the American dream, we do so with careful awareness of policy pitfalls. Not so long\n\n\fago, the American dream was intimately associated with homeownership. In the stark light of\nrecent events, many households found that the reality of homeownership was a nightmare\nrather than something idyllic. Poor public policy undoubtedly contributed to the housing\nbubble and the resulting recession. Due in large part to his research background, my\npredecessor, Bill Poole, foresaw and warned about many of the problems that resulted from\nthe badly overleveraged government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\nResearch can play a major role not only in the design of wise policies, but also in avoiding the\ncontinuation of unwise policies. Many of the papers on the program of this conference focus\non evaluating effectiveness of public policies. Rigorous and detached assessments of policy\nthat combine theory with empirical analysis can yield important inputs for decision makers.\nOn behalf of the Conference of Presidents, let me commend the Atlanta Fed and the Board for\ntheir excellent work in pulling together this conference. Some of you may know that the Board\nof Governors, starting in 1999, has been rotating through the Reserve banks for its partners in\norganizing this important event every other year. St. Louis is up in 2015. Thankfully, our team\nwill be able to build upon the great ideas and lessons provided by others, most especially the\nexcellent example the Board and Atlanta have provided this year.\nThank you and welcome to the 2013 Community Development conference on “Resilience and\nRebuilding.”\n\nJames Bullard, President and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\n\n\f",

There were more than 10,000 community bank charters 20 years\nago. As of the end of 2012, there were approximately 6,000 community bank charters. Over\nthat same time period, the percentage of banking assets in community banks also changed\ndramatically. Twenty years ago, community banks held nearly 50 percent of all banking assets\nin the United States. Today, they hold 17 percent, while 83 percent of the assets are held by\nthe largest 84 banks with more than $10 billion in total assets.\nThe past five years have further challenged community banks, with nearly 500 bank failures\nover that time. These failures were handled in a relatively routine fashion, with little fanfare\nand little damage to banking services in affected areas. It was capitalism at work: Those banks\nwith poor business results had to admit defeat by market forces and close their doors. There\nwere no bailouts for these business owners.\nThose community banks that survived and thrived through the crisis and its aftermath retain an\nimportant role in the U.S. economy. For example, although community banks account for only\n20 percent of all loans made by commercial banks, they account for 52 percent of the small\nbusiness and farm loans. And, equally as important, community banks are a community\npartner. They have a stake in the economic health of the communities they serve.\nThe future of community banks is important—to both the economy and the communities they\nserve. At the St. Louis Fed, we support increased research on community banking and\nencourage policymakers to be cognizant of the value of these institutions.\nI know that state bank commissioners have been an important partner in encouraging quality\nresearch on the topic of community banking. We place a high value on our shared supervisory\nresponsibilities with the states—that relationship is clearly reflected in our audience today as\nwe have more than half of the state commissioners in the audience with us today.\n\n\fI would also like to express my sincere appreciation for the strong support of Chairman\nBernanke and Governor Jay Powell. Both are keenly interested in matters affecting community\nbanks.\nMy next official duty is to introduce Chairman Bernanke. Chairman Bernanke has come to the\nright city at the right time. As I understand it, Washington has shut down and is no longer\nplaying baseball, the Chairman’s favorite sport. St. Louis has not shut down and continues to\nplay baseball; so, consider St. Louis your home for baseball, Mr. Chairman.\nBen Bernanke began his second term as Fed Chairman on Feb. 1, 2010. Prior to his\nappointment, he was the Chairman of the President’s Council of Economic Advisers from June\n2005 to January 2006. The Chairman is a Fellow of the Econometric Society and of the\nAmerican Academy of Arts and Sciences. As most of you know, the Chairman has continued to\noffer exceptional leadership for the Federal Reserve during the very trying times of recent\nyears. I really appreciate the Chairman coming to address this conference.\nPlease join me in welcoming Ben Bernanke.\n\nJames Bullard, President and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\n\n\f",

            "content": "Opening remarks by President James Bullard\n38th Annual Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Fall Conference\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nOct. 10-11, 2013\nIt is my pleasure to welcome you to the St. Louis Fed 2013 Fall Conference. This is the 38th year\nfor this conference. I want to thank Alex Monge and YiLi Chien for putting this very provocative\nprogram together. I am looking forward to the stimulating discussion these papers are sure to\ninspire over the next day and a half.\nAt the St. Louis Fed, we have long tried to provide perspectives on whether the policies\nadopted in the past still serve us well today and whether recent developments at the frontier of\nresearch can be fruitfully applied to improve policy. This agenda has become especially\nimportant in the past few years, as the Fed and central banks around the world have struggled\nto devise appropriate policy responses to the current macroeconomic situation.\nIn polite economist society, there has long been a distinction between what is known as\n“frontier” research and what is sometimes called “policy” research. In my view, this has been\nand continues to be a false dichotomy. There is no such distinction: “Policy” and “frontier”\nresearch are two sides of the same coin. We need to understand both how fundamental\nmechanisms in the economy operate as well as how current data can be interpreted in terms of\nfundamental theory.\nIn short, advanced economic theory has to be made more relevant for actual policy, and actual\npolicy has to understand and embrace the difficult ideas advanced in the theoretical world. The\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis has long been a leader in supporting research at the\nintersection of economic theory and economic policy.\nWe are fortunate this year to have an outstanding group of speakers whose research expands\nour understanding of key contemporary issues in macroeconomics. This year’s conference\ncovers a wide range of topics: from the labor market to financial markets, from macroeconomic\ndynamics and monetary policy to the lifecycle behavior of households.\n\n\fConcerning current and near-term macroeconomic issues, this year’s agenda includes papers\nexamining:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nthe behavior of the federal funds market;\ninterest rate risk exposure for banks in the U.S.;\nthe distribution of firms ranked by their degree of financial soundness;\nmoney and the role of financial intermediation;\na New Keynesian macroeconomy with important labor market frictions;\nthe effects of leverage restrictions on financial intermediaries; and\nthe effects of large-scale asset purchases in an environment with endogenous collateral\nconstraints.\n\nWe also have a group of papers focusing on the lifecycle behavior of households. The topics in\nthis section include:\n•\n•\n\ninequality in health spending across income groups; and\nthe links between home production, retirement and labor supply elasticities.\n\nI know that these papers and the ideas they contain will contribute importantly to the\nmacroeconomic discussion in the coming years as the papers are eventually published and the\nresults become more widely known in the profession. The St. Louis Fed is proud to provide this\nforum for discussion and analysis of the leading issues of the day.\nLet me again welcome all of you to the St. Louis Fed Fall Conference. Thanks very much for\ncoming, and now let’s get to work!\n\nJames Bullard, President and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\n\n\f",

However, with\nrecent sharp declines following the nancial crisis and\nrecession of 2007-2009, it has suddenly become a salient\ntopic, and one that gets discussed even in non-economic\nsettings. For us macroeconomists, to get one of our\nvariables into kitchen table discussions is really\nexhilarating. We are right up there with Jimmy Fallon! We\nare not used to this, and I am not sure we can comfortably\ntake in all of the excitement.\n\nAt its broadest level, the debate about the labor force\nparticipation rate is a debate about the nature of the U.S.\neconomy over the 4½ years since the end of the recession\nin the summer of 2009. Should we characterize the\neconomy as substantially back to normal following the very\nsevere recession? Or, has little progress really been made,\nso that the economy remains far from its potential? There\nare clear lines of argument on both sides, sometimes\nblurring political boundaries. Some suggest that the\nextraordinary policy response since the end of the\nrecession has been largely ineffectual, perhaps citing the\nvery at employment-to-population ratio since 2009,2 and\nthat their own suggested policy responses would have\nproduced better outcomes. Others emphasize the risk\nassociated with the extraordinary policy response, perhaps\nciting the Fed's now $4.1 trillion balance sheet and the\nnation's relatively high debt-to-GDP ratio. Still others argue\nthat the economy has recovered as well as can be\nexpected in the wake of a major nancial crisis, perhaps\nciting a recovery in real consumption expenditures, an\nimproved housing market, a recovery in equity price\nvaluations, and substantially lower unemployment. This\nlast group might point to the euro area as an example of an\neconomy that has suffered through a double-dip recession\nover the past several years, eventually leading to\nunemployment rates exceeding 12 percent, while the U.S.\navoided this fate.\n\nLabor market performance is at the heart of the debate\nover how to characterize the state of the U.S. economy.\nWhile unemployment in the U.S. was at 10 percent in the\nfall of 2009, it has now declined to 6.6 percent on the latest\n\n\freading and has generally declined much faster than many\nforecasters anticipated. In tandem with this rosy\ndevelopment, however, there has been a substantial\ndecline in labor force participation. Some say that the\ndecline in labor force participation is a bad omen for U.S.\nmacroeconomic performance, with labor market dropouts\nre ecting frustration with the state of the economy. I will\ncall this the \"bad omen\" view. Under this interpretation, the\ndecline in the unemployment rate does not really re ect an\nimproving labor market, and policymakers should look\nelsewhere to measure labor market outcomes. Others,\nhowever, argue that the decline in labor force participation\nsimply re ects changing demographics in the U.S.\neconomy, and that different demographic groups have\ndifferent propensities to participate in market work. As we\nhave different numbers of people in these different\ndemographic groups, we should naturally expect the\naggregate labor force participation rate to change. I will\ncall this the \"demographics\" view. Under this interpretation,\nthe unemployment rate remains about as good an indicator\nof overall labor market health as ever, and recent sharp\ndeclines in the unemployment rate should indeed be taken\nas indicative of an improving economy and an improving\nlabor market.\n\nIn sum, the \"bad omen\" view sees the recent declines in\nlabor force participation as suggestive of a very weak labor\nmarket and discounts the signal coming from recent\nfaster-than-expected declines in unemployment. The\n\"demographics\" view sees recent declines in labor force\nparticipation as more benign and takes the signal coming\nfrom recent faster-than-expected declines in\nunemployment at face value. Since the FOMC has explicitly\ntied monetary policy choices to labor market performance,\nit is of considerable importance which view is more nearly\ncorrect.\n\nIn my talk today, I will offer three perspectives on these\nquestions. First, I will simply summarize the data on labor\nforce participation and give some background on why this\nvariable has suffered in relative obscurity until now.\nSecond, I will summarize my views on some of the\navailable literature concerning labor force participation as\nit exists today. This literature is, in my opinion, generally\nsupportive of the demographics view, although there are\ndifferent strands and many issues are not satisfactorily\nresolved. Third, I will talk about the future of research in\nthis area, which is to move to more sophisticated\napproaches to labor force participation. The more\nsophisticated class of models might be based on the socalled \"home production\" literature. I will not bore you with\nthe details of this approach, but I will point out that future\nprogress in this area has to get more serious about the\nincentives of households to supply labor to market work\n\n\fversus non-market work.\n\nThe Labor Force Participation Rate\n\nThe labor force participation rate is a ratio. In the\nnumerator is the labor force, the sum of all persons\nemployed or unemployed. We think of this group as\nparticipants in the market workplace. Many have jobs, and\nthe rest are looking for jobs. In the denominator is the\ncivilian non-institutional population 16 years of age or\nolder.\n\nThe concept is to divide the population into three groups:\nemployed, unemployed and out of the labor force. This last\ngroup could also be called \"non-participants\" because they\nare neither working nor are they searching for market work.\n\nHere are some round numbers to keep in your head. The\nemployed group is currently on the order of 145 million\npeople. The unemployed group is on the order of 10 million\npeople. And the non-participant group is on the order of 91\nmillion people. The groups are of very different size, and in\nparticular, the non-participant group is large relative to the\nunemployed group. A quirk of this way of organizing the\ndata is that people routinely report moving from nonparticipation to market work without reporting themselves\nas unemployed.3 In other words, at least o cially, they\nwere not working and were not searching for a job but\nnevertheless they ended up working at a job in the next\nreporting period. Evidently, they were not really properly\ncategorized as \"non-participants.\" I have always found this\nto be an unsatisfactory aspect of this method of data\norganization.\n\nMany discussions of contemporary unemployment\nforecasts focus on the extent to which non-participants will\nrejoin the labor market. The late 1990s, for example, was\nan era when many workers seemed to come off the\nsidelines into the workplace because of an exceptionally\nstrong economy. At the St. Louis Fed, we have constructed\nunemployment forecasts in recent years assuming that\nmovements from non-participation to employment would\nbe minimal while unemployment was at relatively high\nlevels. This has served us well, as we have more accurately\npredicted declines in unemployment in the past year than\nmany other forecasters.\n\nIf you know only one aspect of the data on labor force\nparticipation, it should be this: Labor force participation\nused to be relatively low, it rose during the 1970s, 1980s\nand 1990s, peaking in 2000, and it has generally been\n\n\fdeclining since 2000.\n\nFrom 1948 to 1966, the labor force participation rate was\nrelatively low and relatively stable, averaging 59.1 percent.\nThat's substantially lower than today's value of 63 percent.\nIt is important to note that we normally consider the U.S.\neconomy to have performed relatively well during this\nperiod, especially during the long expansion of the 1960s.\nEvidently, low labor force participation does not equate\nwith weak economic growth. Surely this is because the\nfactors driving economic growth are different from the\nfactors driving labor force participation.\n\nAfter about three decades of trending up, the labor force\nparticipation rate peaked in the rst half of 2000 at 67.3\npercent. The rate of increase was slower in the 1990s than\nit was in the 1970s or 1980s. The peak was more than 8\npercentage points higher than the average level during\n1948-1966. Many of the studies of labor force participation\nduring this period focused on the increasing participation\nrates of women. However, whatever effects came from that\nsource, or any other source, the labor force participation\nrate could not continue to increase forever. Households are\nmaking choices about how much labor to supply given\ncurrent wages and work environments, and women newly\njoining the labor force would nd the right level of\nparticipation and stop there.\n\nSince 2000, the labor force participation rate has generally\nbeen declining. The pace of decline was particularly sharp\nduring the recession of 2007-2009, but the participation\nrate also declined steadily in the early 2000s and since the\nend of the recession in mid-2009.\n\nThe general picture, then, is one of a hump shape in U.S.\naggregate labor force participation during the postwar era.\nA satisfactory theory has to account for this hump shape.\nOne way to build such a theory is to appeal to\ndemographics. The nation's workforce had a younger\npro le as the baby boom generation came of age, and will\nhave an older pro le as the baby boom generation\ncontinues to retire. Since different age groups have\ndifferent propensities to participate, this suggests a\npromising avenue to explain the labor force participation\ndata.\n\nI dare say that the demographic explanation is the gut\ninstinct of many macroeconomists. This is why labor force\nparticipation sits in the backseat of many macroeconomic\nmodels. Many, including me, might reason that a good\ndemographic model combined with more women in the\nlabor force during the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s could\nexplain a very large fraction of the hump-shaped\n\n\fmovements in aggregate labor force participation over the\npostwar era. If such a model were tted to the data, only a\nsmall amount of variation in the participation rate would\nremain to be explained. That small remaining amount of\nvariation might be attributable to business cycle effects\n(\"cyclical\") or it might just be noise about the fundamental\nhump-shaped trend. Relatively minor cyclical effects on\nlabor force participation would likely be too small to have\nmajor macroeconomic implications given everything else\ngoing on in a macroeconomic model. Consequently, the\nthinking would go, maybe we do not need to worry too\nmuch about the labor force participation rate.\n\nBut this is all just in the heads of macroeconomists. Let me\nnow turn to some of the recent research on labor force\nparticipation to see the extent to which such a theory has\nactually been devised.\n\nRecent Research on Labor Force Participation\n\nLet's start with the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The BLS is,\nof course, very close to the data and it does routinely\nproject labor force participation over the medium term. In\ngeneral, its medium-term forecasts from the mid-2000s\nproved to be too high, meaning its forecast labor force\nparticipation rate was considerably higher than values\nactually observed. More recent medium-term BLS\nforecasts have a declining rate of participation over the\nnext decade or so, all the way down to 61.6 percent in\n2022.4 Recall that today's participation rate is 63 percent,\nso the projection is that the rate would continue to decline\nby around 15 basis points per year. According to BLS\nprojections,5 more than 70 percent of this decline is due to\npure demographic factors; that is, changes in population\nshares by age groups, assuming unchanged participation\nrates for each group.6\n\nTo the extent that this forecast pans out, the basic\ndirection for the labor force participation rate is down, not\nup. Those waiting for an upward swing in labor force\nparticipation as the economy continues to expand will be\ndisappointed, on average, if this forecast comes to pass. I\nread the BLS work as supportive of the demographics\nhypothesis described above.\n\nA recent contribution by Shigeru Fujita (2013) at the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia provides some\nadditional insight concerning the decline in aggregate U.S.\nlabor force participation since 2000. Fujita's calculations\nsuggest that about 65 percent of the decline in the\nparticipation rate was due to retirements and disability.\nFujita points out that the empirical evidence suggests\nmembers of these groups have only a small probability of\n\n\freturning to the labor force. If we limit attention only to a\nperiod of relatively high economic stress, such as 2007:Q1\nto 2011:Q2, we do see more of the decline in participation\nattributable to discouraged workers, but even then, this is\nonly about 25 percent, according to Fujita's calculations.\nOver a less stressful period, such as 2012:Q1 to 2013:Q2,\nthe entire decline in the aggregate labor force participation\nrate is attributable to retirements, with no effect at all\ncoming from an increase in discouraged workers. I read\nFujita's contribution as also supportive of the\ndemographics hypothesis.\n\nTroy Davig and José Mustre-del-Río (2013) at the Kansas\nCity Fed provide some analysis of the \"shadow\" labor\nsupply to gain insight into whether this group is likely to\nreturn to the labor force. The shadow group is de ned as\nthose who want a job but are not actively seeking one. The\nauthors document that this group is demographically\nsimilar to the unemployed. They suggest that any impact\non aggregate labor force participation from this group is\nlikely to be small, because ows from this group to\nunemployment are small and less likely to occur as the\nrecovery continues. I read this as also supportive of the\ndemographics view.\n\nA somewhat older paper by Stephanie Aaronson, Bruce\nFallick, Andrew Figura, Jonathan Pingle and William\nWascher, published in 2006, examined the decline in labor\nforce participation following the 2001 recession and tried\nto ascertain how much of the decline at that time was\ncyclical. It is perhaps important to recall that there was an\nearlier debate on declining labor force participation, long\nbefore the deep recession of 2007-2009. The paper\ncontains as part of the analysis an empirical model of the\ntrend labor force participation rate that includes\ndemographic factors. If that trend model is projected\nforward to today from 2006, it predicts nearly exactly the\nlabor force participation rate observed in 2012 and 2013.\nWhat a great piece of out-of-sample forecasting! I read this\nas supportive of the demographics view. This model also\nprojects continued decline in the labor force participation\nrate in the years ahead.\n\nMarianna Kudlyak (2013), at the Richmond Fed, follows up\non the empirical model proposed by Aaronson, et al.\n(2006). Again, the model contains key demographic\ninformation such as age, gender and birth-year cohort\neffects. The model suggests that current aggregate labor\nforce participation rates are not far off from the model's\npredicted trend participation rate. Again, I read this as\nsupportive of the demographic view.7\n\n\fChris Erceg and Andy Levin (2013) have an interesting\nInternational Monetary Fund working paper on the\nintersection between the labor force participation rate and\nmonetary policy. Their paper is a \"thinking outside the box\"\nexercise. In what I have presented so far, there is a certain\ninevitable logic. I said that the data on labor force\nparticipation cry out for an explanation based mostly on\nincreasing labor force participation by women and slowly\nchanging demographics. The existing literature more or\nless provides such an explanation. Erceg and Levin instead\nask whether there are other ways to think about this issue.\nThey present evidence from U.S. states on prime-age\nadults and suggest that the declines in labor force\nparticipation for this particular group were mostly cyclical.\nThe authors then ask how monetary policy might be\nconducted in a world where labor force participation has\nan important cyclical component. They suggest that the\nparticipation decision should get more attention in\nmonetary policy research, a point on which I will agree\nbelow.\n\nI do not nd the evidence on cyclical versus structural\nchanges in labor force participation in Erceg and Levin as\npersuasive as the other empirical work I have reviewed.8\nLabor force participation for prime-age males, for instance,\nhas also been on a secular decline for many years.\nNevertheless, the Erceg and Levin points about how to\nconduct monetary policy in a world with important cyclical\ncomponents in labor force participation are well made.9\n\nSome papers get somewhat higher estimates of the\nfraction of the decline in labor force participation since\n2000 due to cyclical factors. For instance, Daniel Aaronson,\nJonathan Davis and Luojia Hu (2012) use still another\nempirical model with demographic factors included and\nconclude that more than half of the decline in aggregate\nlabor force participation from 2000 to 2011 is due to\ncyclical factors. Willem Van Zandweghe (2012) tries an\nalternative method of decomposing the data from 20072011 and concludes that more than half of the decline is\ncyclical. Julie Hotchkiss and Fernando Rios-Avila (2013)\nhave an approach that emphasizes non-linear factors\nfollowing the severe 2007-2009 recession, and they\nconclude that nearly all of the decline in aggregate labor\nforce participation following the recession was cyclical.\nLeila Bengali, Mary Daly and Rob Valletta (2013) look at the\ncorrelation in the changes in employment and labor force\nparticipation in state-level data to gain insight, concluding\nthat a substantial cyclical component exists in the\nobserved aggregate decline in labor force participation.\n\nI am not necessarily swayed by these alternative\napproaches or results. But it certainly does show that there\nare many ways to cut the data and interpret the ndings.\n\n\fThis leads me to my nal remarks, namely, where should\nthe literature on labor force participation go next?\n\nHome Production as the Future\n\nI have reviewed some interesting economic literature on a\ntopic that has been hot, not just among economists, but\nalso among politicians, media, nancial markets and even\nothers who are not normally close students of\nmacroeconomic developments. Much of the literature I\nhave reviewed uses the same basic idea: Certain\ndemographic groups have a certain propensity to\nparticipate in market work, and one of the main things we\nneed to do as economists is project the number of people\nin each of these groups in order to determine a reasonable\nestimate of the expected (or \"normal\" or \"trend\") labor\nforce participation rate in the U.S. economy. Much of the\nliterature concludes that demographics have contributed\nsubstantially to the observed decline in U.S. labor force\nparticipation since 2000.\n\nStill, the literature as a whole is a bit hollow. Simply saying\nthat people in certain demographic groups tend to make\nthe participation decision one way or another does not do\nenough to analyze the incentives of household labor supply\ndecisions. The more we know about the details of the\nhousehold labor supply choices, including choices to\nparticipate in market work, the better we can predict the\nimpact of policy on labor force participation. Furthermore,\nwe would like these decisions to be part of the\nmacroeconomic model, as Erceg and Levin suggest.10\n\nThere is one strand of the literature that does provide a\nmore complete picture of household incentives to supply\nlabor and participate in labor markets. It is the literature on\nso-called \"home production.\" We do not need to get into the\ndetails here, but the idea is simple. Think of a household as\nthe owner of capital and labor. The household members\ncombine their home capital—refrigerators, ovens,\ndishwashers, cars, houses—with their labor time to\nproduce home goods, such as a trip, a meal or some child\ncare.11 These goods are not acquired in the market and are\nnot counted in GDP, but they matter to the household. The\nhome labor provided does not count in the aggregate\nstatistics on labor supply. The household then has to make\ndecisions about how much time to supply to market work\nversus work at home, including how many members of the\nhousehold should participate in market work.12 If we add\nto a household production model more explicit treatment\nof household retirement decision-making as well as of\ndecisions by younger households to acquire human capital,\nwe would get to a more complete model of the labor force\n\n\fparticipation rate.\n\nThis approach is much more detailed regarding household\ndecision-making than the research I have described today.\nBut the extra complexity comes with a bene t, as the\napproach also allows macroeconomists to better\nunderstand the factors driving household labor supply\ndecisions in terms of actual options inside the home, as\nwell as with respect to the informal labor market. More\ndetailed models in this direction will likely be necessary in\nthe future if we want to move the debate on labor force\nparticipation forward.13\n\nConclusion\n\nMy topic for today has been the aggregate labor force\nparticipation rate in the U.S. While the unemployment rate\nhas declined in recent years, labor force participation has\nalso been declining, perhaps suggesting that\nunemployment is not as reliable an indicator of\nmacroeconomic performance as it may have been in the\npast. I gave three perspectives on labor force participation:\nFirst, I reviewed the data; second, I reviewed the literature;\nand third, I suggested directions for future research.\n\nThe post-WWII data on aggregate U.S. labor force\nparticipation show a hump-shaped pattern. Participation\nrose in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, before peaking in\n2000 and heading into decline up until the present day.\nCurrent BLS projections suggest that this decline will\ncontinue over the coming decade. The rise is often\nattributed in part to the maturing of the baby boom\ngeneration as well as the increase in the number of women\nworking. The decline has often been attributed to the aging\nof the U.S. labor force. A satisfactory model has to account\nfor the rise and fall over many decades. A demographicallybased model would seem to have a good chance of\nsuccess in explaining this data.\n\nI have reviewed some of the available literature on this\ntopic. My view of the literature is that carefully constructed\nempirical models of the hump-shaped trend in the U.S.\nlabor force participation rate do a good job of explaining\nthe data. These models suggest that the current\nparticipation rate is not far from the predicted trend. This\nmeans, in turn, that the cyclical component in labor force\nparticipation is likely to be relatively small. To the extent\nthese models are correct, then the observed\nunemployment rate remains as good an indicator of overall\nlabor market health as it has been historically. In particular,\nthe recent, relatively rapid declines in unemployment can\nbe understood as representing an improving labor market.\nThis is the judgment that should inform monetary policy\n\n\fgoing forward.\n\nThe literature is not completely satisfactory, however. I\nconcluded my talk with a brief discussion of how\nresearchers might do a better job of including household\ndecision-making inside the economic model. This would\nallow us to better understand what motivates or disincents\nlabor force participation. I look forward to seeing research\npushing in this direction in the future.\n\nJames Bullard, President and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\n\nEndnotes\n1\n\nThe views expressed here are my own and do not\nnecessarily re ect the views of others on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee.

            "content": "Opening remarks by President James Bullard\nThe 2014 Homer Jones Memorial Lecture\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nApril 2, 2014\nWelcome to the Homer Jones Memorial Lecture.\nThis year, we are in a festive mood—and not just because our hometown St. Louis Cardinals are\nfavorites to repeat as National League champions. We’re also in a festive mood because of\nthree other celebrations.\nFirst, we are celebrating the 250th anniversary of the city of St. Louis, founded in 1764 by Pierre\nLaclède and Auguste Chouteau. Second, the Federal Reserve System celebrates its 100th\nanniversary this year. If you have not done so, I encourage you to visit the Fed’s website at\nwww.federalreservehistory.org to learn more about the nation’s central bank and how it has\nshaped, and was shaped by, key events in our nation’s economic history. The third cause for\ncelebration is that this year is the 25th annual Homer Jones Memorial Lecture—a quarter\ncentury of lectures. The Homer Jones lecture is one of the Bank’s signature events. We hold\nthis lecture each year to honor the lasting contributions of a former Research director of the\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, Homer Jones.\nThe St. Louis Fed started the lecture series after Homer Jones’ death in 1986. The lecture series\nenjoys the long-lasting support and co-sponsorship of many people and organizations, including\nthe St. Louis Gateway Chapter of the National Association for Business Economics, Saint Louis\nUniversity, Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville, the University of Missouri at St. Louis\nand Washington University in St. Louis.\nHomer Jones is sometimes described as “Milton Friedman’s teacher” because Jones taught\nFriedman when Friedman was an undergraduate at Rutgers University in the early 1930s. Then,\nas now, it was tumultuous times for macroeconomics.\nJones had come to Rutgers after studying at the University of Chicago, where he was a student\nof legendary Chicago professor Frank Knight. Also on the Rutgers faculty at the time: Arthur\nBurns, future Chairman of the Federal Reserve.\nAccording to Friedman, Jones was one of the primary influences in Friedman’s choice to study\neconomics, as opposed to mathematics or statistics. In Friedman’s 1976 reminiscence, he says\nJones opened his eyes “… to the broader reaches of economics and to the beauties and\n\n\fintricacies of economic theory.” 1 The rest, as they say, is history—the two remained friends\nand colleagues for years afterwards.\nIn 1958, Homer Jones joined the staff here at the St. Louis Fed. He is remembered for many\nthings at the Bank, but his role in the Bank’s development as a leader in monetary research and\nstatistics stands out.\nAlthough many talented and dedicated people have greatly expanded upon Homer’s original\nefforts to make the St. Louis Fed a leader in the public dissemination of economic data, it is\ndifficult to imagine that we would have been as successful as we have been were it not for\nHomer Jones’ vision. Bank products like FRED, Mobile FRED, ALFRED, GeoFRED, CASSIDI,\nFRASER and IDEAS are certainly modern inventions, but they all had their genesis in Homer’s\ninnovative efforts to keep the public better informed about its central bank and the U.S.\neconomy. Homer was, in a sense, the original guru of Federal Reserve transparency.\nAnother legacy of Homer Jones is the St. Louis Fed’s unwavering commitment to rigorous,\nindependent research. Homer had a staunch belief in the persuasive power of facts and—it is\nsaid—dogged patience in pressing his views. Those of us in the Federal Reserve System who\nbelieve that the ability to question and re-examine conventional wisdom leads to better policy\noutcomes owe a great debt to Homer Jones. The Fed’s ability to absorb and be open to\nmultiple viewpoints helps prevent groupthink and leads to superior monetary policy and\nultimately to better macroeconomic performance.\nThis year’s speaker is Robert E. Lucas, Jr. He is the John Dewey Distinguished Service Professor\nin Economics at the University of Chicago.\nProfessor Lucas has made fundamental contributions in many areas of macroeconomics,\nincluding business cycle theory, asset pricing, monetary economics, the welfare cost of business\ncycles and the determinants of economic growth. He is a Fellow of the Econometric Society; a\nmember of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences; and a member of the National\nAcademy of Sciences.\nIn 1995, Professor Lucas received the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences. The Nobel Committee\ncited his work “… for having developed and applied the hypothesis of rational expectations, and\nthereby having transformed macroeconomic analysis and deepened our understanding of\neconomic policy.”\n\n1\n\nSee Friedman, Milton. “Homer Jones: A Personal Reminiscence.” Journal of Monetary Economics, November\n1976, 2(4), pp. 433-6.\n\n\fIt is perhaps especially fitting that Professor Lucas has agreed to give this particular Homer\nJones lecture, on the 100th anniversary of the Federal Reserve and the 25th anniversary of the\nHomer Jones lecture. His undergraduate major, also at the University of Chicago, was in\nhistory, and he initially began graduate studies in history at the University of California at\nBerkeley. His turn toward economics instead of history was an important one for him, for us\nand for the world. But I know his love of history has not faded over the years.\nPlease join me in welcoming Bob Lucas, who will speak to us today about “Liquidity: Meaning,\nMeasurement, Management.”\nJames Bullard, President and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\n\n\f",

            "content": "Welcoming remarks by President James Bullard\nResearch Symposium: The Balance Sheets of Younger Americans\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis—The Center for Household Financial Stability\nMay 8-9, 2014\nWelcome, and thank you for joining us for the 2nd annual balance sheet research symposium\nsponsored by the Center for Household Financial Stability, which the St. Louis Fed launched in\nMay of last year.\nThe center is pleased to co-sponsor today’s event with our Research department, where I got\nmy start here at the St. Louis Fed, as well as with the center’s partner, the Center for Social\nDevelopment at Washington University. The Washington University center will offer its own\nwelcome just before the dinner reception at 5:00.\nAs most of you know, our Center for Household Financial Stability is researching family balance\nsheets with the aim of strengthening both families and the economy. Because of the financial\ncrisis and Great Recession, our framework and analysis must now not only consider what\nfamilies save and own, but what they owe as well—their entire balance sheet. Indeed, the\nGreat Recession has been called a “balance sheet recession,” so it’s critical for us to understand\nthe role that balance sheets played in bringing down families and the economy and the role\nthat these balance sheets will play in building them back up.\nToday’s symposium is focused on younger Americans, those in their 20s and 30s, because our\nresearch and the research of others have shown that, compared with middle-aged and older\nAmericans, young people lost the most wealth from the recession and have been, by far, the\nslowest to recover it. Moreover, since 1989, while middle-aged Americans have increased their\nwealth by about two-thirds and older Americans have nearly doubled their wealth, younger\nAmericans have actually lost about 10 percent of their wealth in real terms. Not surprisingly,\nstudies, including some of our own, suggest that younger Americans are not likely to surpass\nthe wealth accumulated by their parents or grandparents—a historical first.\nSo that’s why we’re here—to better understand what’s going on with the balance sheets of\nyounger Americans and to draw out the implications of the research presented here for future\nresearch, community development and public policy.\nSpeaking of public policy, we are taking our findings to Washington. As a follow-up to this\nsymposium, the center—in partnership with the New America Foundation and a group called\nYoung Invincibles—is sponsoring a policy symposium titled “Millennials After the Great\n\n\fRecession” on Oct. 16 and 17 in D.C. We’ll examine not just balance sheets but issues that\nimpact, and are impacted by, balance sheets—unemployment and under-employment,\nworkforce development, work-family balance, cradle to college education, health care and\ntechnology. The challenges are many and significant, and we hope to look at them holistically.\nStay tuned.\nLooking further ahead, to next April, the Federal Reserve System will host its biennial\ncommunity development research conference, this one around the timely theme of economic\nmobility. In partnership with the Fed’s Board of Governors, we will play a leadership role in this\nimportant conference. For further information, please see the Call for Papers in your packets.\nWe hope you’ll consider submitting an abstract or paper.\nOver the next two days, you will be exposed to a thought-provoking lineup of papers and\nspeakers. During a break, you might also want to pick up a copy of the essay from the St. Louis\nFed’s 2012 annual report, which is dedicated to this topic.\nI’m eager to listen and learn, as I’m sure you are. Let’s get started, and thank you again for\njoining us.\nJames Bullard, President and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\n\n\f",

            "content": "Welcoming remarks by James Bullard, President and CEO\nSecond Annual Community Banking in the 21st Century Conference\nThe Federal Reserve System and Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS)\nSt. Louis, Mo.\nSept. 23, 2014\nGood morning, and welcome to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis for the second annual\nCommunity Banking Research and Policy Conference, hosted by the Federal Reserve System\nand the Conference of State Bank Supervisors.\nLast year, we had the privilege of hosting a very successful inaugural conference, which\nprovided a unique opportunity to hear and discuss not only cutting-edge research in the\ncommunity banking space, but also to hear the views of community bankers, policymakers and\nregulators regarding pressing issues and the future of community banking. The response of\nattendees was very positive. As a result, the Fed and CSBS unanimously decided to hold the\nconference on an annual basis here in St. Louis, the heartland of community banking.\nCommunity banks are important to the Federal Reserve’s Eighth District. There are more than\n625 community banks in the District (of which 127 are state members) and 522 holding\ncompanies. Two community bankers serve as directors on the board of our head office, and\nseveral community bankers serve on the boards of our branch offices, which are in Little Rock,\nArk., Louisville, Ky., and Memphis, Tenn. As with other Reserve banks, community bankers\nadvise us on a variety of matters through our Community Depository Institutions Advisory\nCouncil. Services flow both ways as we are very involved in providing information and training\nto community banks through a variety of programs. In fact, this fall we will pilot a revitalized\nlearning program for bank directors, based on the popular “Basics for Bank Directors”\ncurriculum written by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.\nOur supervision of community banks is a partnership with state regulators. Here in the Eighth\nDistrict, we have the opportunity to work with Candace Franks from Arkansas (who is also this\nyear’s CSBS chair), Manny Flores from Illinois, Dennis Bassett from Indiana, Charles Vice from\nKentucky, Jerry Wilson from Mississippi, Debra Hardman from Missouri and Greg Gonzales from\nTennessee. I know my colleagues across the Federal Reserve System place great value on the\ninformation and insights they gain from maintaining regular and substantive engagements with\nstate bank commissioners.\n\n\fCommunity banks are important to the economy of the Eighth District, but we all know that\ntheir business model is under pressure. The research presented at the inaugural conference\npushed our understanding of the opportunities and challenges facing community banks.\nLooking at the agenda for the next two days, I have no doubt that this year’s research and panel\ndiscussions will do the same. One important measure of success is the degree to which we\nbroaden the dialogue on community banking and promote further thinking in this sector. We\nhad a significant increase in the number of paper submissions this year, and believe we’ll see\neven more in the upcoming years.\nI’ve always believed that good research leads to good policy. Or, said another way, there cannot\nbe good policy without quality research. I would like to thank all of you who have focused your\nresearch on the community banking industry and look forward to another great conference.\n\n\f",

            "content": "Opening remarks by James Bullard, President and CEO\n39th Annual Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Fall Conference\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nOct. 9-10, 2014\nIt is my pleasure to welcome you to the St. Louis Fed 2014 Fall Conference. This is the 39th year\nfor this conference. I want to thank Bill Dupor and Yongseok Shin for putting this very\nprovocative program together. I am looking forward to the stimulating discussion these papers\nare sure to inspire over the next day and a half.\nAt the St. Louis Fed, we have long tried to provide perspectives on whether the policies\nadopted in the past still serve us well today and whether recent developments at the frontier of\nresearch can be fruitfully applied to improve policy. This agenda has become especially\nimportant in the past few years, as the Fed and central banks around the world have struggled\nto devise appropriate policy responses to the current macroeconomic situation.\nIn polite economist society, there has long been a distinction between what is known as\n“frontier” research and what is sometimes called “policy” research. In my view, this has been\nand continues to be a false dichotomy. There is no such distinction: “Policy” and “frontier”\nresearch are two sides of the same coin. We need to understand both how fundamental\nmechanisms in the economy operate as well as how current data can be interpreted in terms of\nfundamental theory.\nIn short, advanced economic theory has to be made more relevant for actual policy, and actual\npolicy has to understand and embrace the sometimes difficult ideas advanced in the theoretical\nworld. The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis has long been a leader in supporting research at\nthe intersection of economic theory and economic policy.\nWe are fortunate this year to have an outstanding group of speakers whose research expands\nour understanding of key contemporary issues in macroeconomics.\nThis year’s agenda includes papers on a host of macroeconomic topics, including:\n•\n\nA paper on new ways to measure product market frictions and the role these distortions\nplay in explaining the so-called “labor wedge;” and\n\n\f•\n\nA paper on using disaggregated data to assess the ability of demand stimulus to increase\ninflation.\n\nWe will hear about research on labor markets and education, including:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nA paper concerning the Affordable Care Act’s likely effect on household incentives and\nwork-schedule decisions;\nWork on changes in U.S. job-to-job flow patterns following the Great Recession and the\nassociated implications for unemployment;\nA paper on how financial shocks have diminished the ability of labor markets to match\nidle labor with vacancies; and\nResearch on the impact of state-level higher education subsidies on the education and\nmigration decisions of young people.\n\nWe also have a set of papers concerning banking regulation issues, including:\n•\n•\n•\n\nA paper examining circumstances under which mandatory disclosure requirements on\nbanks may be beneficial;\nWork looking at banking sector regulatory reforms that can promote competition and\nlead to greater voluntary transparency; and\nResearch on whether it is ever beneficial to require banks to hold more than their\notherwise-preferred level of government bonds.\n\nI know that these papers and the ideas they contain will contribute importantly to the\nmacroeconomic discussion in the coming years as the papers are eventually published and the\nresults become more widely known in the profession. The St. Louis Fed is proud to provide this\nforum for discussion and analysis of the leading issues of the day.\nLet me again welcome all of you to the St. Louis Fed 2014 Fall Conference. Thanks very much\nfor coming, and now let’s get to work!\n\n\f",

            "content": "Welcoming Remarks by James Bullard, President and CEO\nThe 2015 Homer Jones Memorial Lecture\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nJune 3, 2015\nWelcome to the Homer Jones Memorial Lecture.\nIt was June 1990. The average U.S. household owned five radios; the “worldwide web” was a\nterm associated with either spiders, spies or organized crime; 1 the first season of The Simpsons\nrecently ended; the inflation rate was just under 4 percent; and the Maestro—Alan\nGreenspan—deftly ruled the roost at the Fed. At just that moment, Athanasios Orphanides took\na position as an economist at the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\nWhile it is true that shortly afterward, the U.S. economy entered a recession—never mind that!\nAthanasios in 1990 began a remarkable career that has emphasized both outstanding research\nand excellent policy advice. As he rose through the ranks of economists at the Board of\nGovernors, he took his role as an insider on U.S. monetary policy seriously and used it to\nprovide insight both to policymakers and to academics. To get an idea of the flavor of his work,\nconsider his 2004 Journal of Money, Credit and Banking paper titled “Monetary Policy Rules,\nMacroeconomic Stability, and Inflation: A View from the Trenches.” It was trench warfare\nindeed, and Athanasios was on the front line.\nFast-forward to May 2007. Athanasios departed the Federal Reserve. A Greek Cypriot, he was\nappointed to the governorship of the Central Bank of Cyprus. Cyprus at that point had just won\nentry into the eurozone, and one of the first tasks Athanasios faced was to transition the island\neconomy to the new currency. Membership in the eurozone also meant that Athanasios\nbecame a member of the powerful Governing Council of the European Central Bank, the\nEuropean counterpart of the Federal Open Market Committee. He held this position until 2012,\nlong enough to help shape the euro area response to the deepest economic and financial crisis\nsince the 1930s and to deal directly with the 2011-2012 European sovereign debt crisis, vestiges\nof which remain with us today.\n\n1\n\nSee http://www.infoplease.com/year/1990.html.\n\n\fGiven this unusual career history, it may well be that Athanasios Orphanides is the only person\non the planet who has attended Federal Open Market Committee meetings as well as European\nCentral Bank Governing Council meetings. Accordingly, he can provide a unique perspective on\nglobal monetary policy.\nThis is the 26th annual Homer Jones Memorial Lecture. The lecture series began in 1987,\nshortly after Homer’s death. The lecture series has persisted, first, because of the initial efforts\nof Homer’s former colleagues and friends at the St. Louis Fed and elsewhere in the community,\nand, second, because of the long-lasting support of many people and organizations. These\ninclude the St. Louis Gateway Chapter of the National Association for Business Economics, Saint\nLouis University, Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville, the University of Missouri at St.\nLouis and Washington University in St. Louis.\nHomer Jones is often described as “Milton Friedman’s teacher.” This is because Jones taught\nFriedman when Milton was an undergraduate at Rutgers University in the early 1930s. At that\ntime, macroeconomics was in its infancy, and monetary policymakers struggled to come to\ngrips with their newfound powers—and their limitations. Eventually, Milton and Homer, each in\ntheir own way and employing different methods, would help to fundamentally transform the\nscience and practice of monetary economics and monetary policy.\nJones had come to the Rutgers faculty after studying at the University of Chicago, where he was\na student of legendary Chicago professor Frank Knight. Also on the Rutgers faculty at the time:\nArthur Burns, future chairman of the Federal Reserve.\nAccording to Friedman, Jones was one of the primary influences in Friedman’s choice to study\neconomics, as opposed to mathematics or statistics. In Friedman’s 1976 reminiscence, he says\nJones opened his eyes “to the broader reaches of economics and to the beauties and intricacies\nof economic theory.” 2\nMilton Friedman went on to graduate study in economics at Columbia, and in 1958 Homer\nJones came to the St. Louis Fed as director of research. Homer Jones became the founding\nfather of the tradition of rigorous economic research, not just at the St. Louis Fed but for the\nFederal Reserve System as a whole. Homer’s original efforts to make the St. Louis Fed a leader\n\n2\n\nSee Friedman, Milton. “Homer Jones: A Personal Reminiscence.” Journal of Monetary Economics, November\n1976, 2(4), pp. 433-6.\n\n\fin monetary research and statistics bear an imprint today on an array of Bank products,\nincluding FRED, mobile FRED, ALFRED, GeoFRED, CASSIDI, FRASER and IDEAS.\nThe most important legacy of Homer Jones is the St. Louis Fed’s unwavering commitment to\nrigorous, independent research. Independence of views continues to be a critical component of\nU.S. monetary policy. The Fed’s ability to absorb and be open to multiple viewpoints helps\nprevent groupthink and leads to superior monetary policy and ultimately to better\nmacroeconomic performance. Those of us in the Federal Reserve System who believe that the\nability to question and re-examine conventional wisdom leads to better policy outcomes owe a\ngreat debt to Homer Jones.\nWe are pleased and honored today to welcome Athanasios Orphanides to give the 2015 Homer\nJones Memorial Lecture. He has moved on from sunny Cyprus and is currently Professor of the\nPractice of Global Economics and Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s\nSloan School of Management. Orphanides is also a Research Fellow of the Centre for Economic\nPolicy Research, a Senior Fellow of the Center for Financial Studies, a Research Fellow of the\nInstitute for Monetary and Financial Stability, and a member of the Shadow Open Market\nCommittee.\nAthanasios has published extensively in professional, peer-reviewed journals and co-edited\nthree books. Much of his work has focused on the difficulty of making good monetary policy\nchoices in real time. The difficulty of interpreting real-time data has often led to questionable\nmonetary policy decisions, according to his research. For example, Orphanides has attributed\nthe Great Inflation of the 1970s to policymakers’ misreading of trends in productivity in the\nearly 1970s. His widely-cited professional publications include co-authored work with current\nSan Francisco Fed President John Williams, “Imperfect Knowledge, Inflation Expectations, and\nMonetary Policy”; 3 an American Economic Review article titled “Monetary Policy Rules Based\non Real-Time Data”; and a Journal of Monetary Economics article titled “The Quest for\nProsperity without Inflation.” He also co-authored an important historical article that I highly\nrecommend, “The Reform of October 1979: How It Happened and Why,” with David Lindsey\nand Robert Rasche in the St. Louis Fed Review. He obtained his Ph.D. in economics from MIT.\nPlease join me in welcoming Athanasios Orphanides, who will speak to us today about “Fear of\nLiftoff: Uncertainty, Rules and Discretion in Monetary Policy Normalization.”\n3\n\nPublished in The Inflation-Targeting Debate, Ben S.

            "content": "Neo-Fisherianism\n\nJames Bullard\nPresident and CEO, FRB-St. Louis\nExpectations in Dynamic Macroeconomic Models\nUniversity of Oregon\n13 August 2015\nEugene, Oregon\nAny opinions expressed here are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n\fIntroduction\n\n\fPurpose of the talk\nThis talk considers “neo-Fisherianism,” a topic of academic\ninterest, especially within the macroeconomics learning\nliterature.\nThe direct links between this topic and current monetary\npolicy are limited.\nNeo-Fisherianism may, however, prove to be an important\nconsideration for monetary policy in the medium and longer\nterm.\n\n\fBackground\nThe Fisher equation is central to macroeconomics.\nBenhabib, et al., (2001) combined the Fisher equation with a\nTaylor-type policy rule and the ZLB.\nThey argued that global analysis reveals a second,\n“unintended” steady state characterized by near-zero shortterm nominal interest rates and low or negative inflation.\nBullard (2010) argued that unmitigated ZIRP may cause\nconvergence to this unintended steady state.\nThe learning literature says otherwise.\n\n\fNeo-Fisherianism\nThe idea that the Fisher equation could dictate the\nconvergence dynamics over the medium or longer term has\ncome to be called “Neo-Fisherian.”\nThe core idea is that maintaining and committing to ZIRP for\na sufficiently long period of time could lead to low inflation\nexpectations and low actual inflation.\n Garcia Schmidt and Woodford (2015, slides) verify this\npossibility under RE in a standard NK model.\n\nFor a discussion, see John Cochrane’s blog, “The NeoFisherian Question,” November 6, 2014, and July 14, 2015.\n\n\fThis talk\nJapan has been the poster child for the low nominal interest\nrate, low inflation (LL) steady state for two decades.\n This motivated the original BSU (2001) “perils” paper.\n\nIn this talk I will look informally at the state of more recent\nempirical evidence for convergence to the LL steady state\nacross key developed economies.\nThis evidence is arguably pointing toward LL convergence.\nThe macro learning literature results tend to be at odds with\nthis empirical evidence.\n\n\fBenhabib, Schmitt-Grohe, and Uribe\n\n\fWhat Benhabib, et al. (2001) said\nPolicymakers control a short-term nominal interest rate.\nPolicymakers are rigidly committed to a Taylor-type rule\nwith inflation as the single argument.\n (How does this mesh with unconventional monetary policy?)\n\nThe rule obeys the Taylor principle: The policy rate responds\nmore than one-for-one with deviations of inflation from\ntarget near the “targeted” steady state.\nThe zero lower bound constrains the policy rate from below.\nResult: Models with these features have a LL steady state.\n\n\fThe U.S. and Japan through the lens of BSU (2001)\n\nSource: OECD’s Main Economic Indicators and author’s calculations. Last observation: June 2015.\n\n\fHow relevant is the LL steady state?\nFinancial markets tend to put high weight on the possibility\nof convergence to LL.\n August 10, 2015 news item: A survey at a recent gathering of\nWall Street professionals said 78 percent are “more worried\nabout deflation than inflation.”\n\nThe learning literature and policymakers tend to put low or\nzero weight on convergence to LL.\n The LL steady state tends to be unstable under standard\nlearning analyses—a sort of “victory” for the learning\nliterature.\n\n\fSome sample academic literature\nWerning (2012): NK model has no LL steady state included,\nyet analyzes R=0 and associated dynamics.\nGarcia Schmidt and Woodford (2015, slides): LL in NK\nmodel is a RE curiosum, and a reasonable departures from\nRE suggest it is not a relevant medium-term outcome.\nEvans (2013): Alternative NK model with LL as a locally\nstable “stagnation regime” under learning.\nSchmitt-Grohe and Uribe (2013): Alternative NK model\nunder RE includes LL in which raising the policy rate raises\ninflation.\n\n\fSlaves to the NK abstraction?\nDepartures from the NK model may fit the data better.\nThe stability properties of these equilibria under learning are\nunknown.\nAndolfatto and Williamson (2015): Assume RE. Allow for\nliquidity premia on bonds and possible asset shortages. LL\ncan be persistent.\nCaballero and Farhi (2015): Assume RE. Shortage of safe\nassets. LL can be persistent.\nEggertsson and Mehrotra (2014): “Secular stagnation” under\nRE.\n\n\fThe Recent Time Series Evidence\n\n\fThe recent time series evidence\nLet’s consider a schematic representation of the two BSU\nsteady states.\nAssume an inflation target of 2 percent across countries.\nAssume a short-term steady state real interest rate of 1\npercent for all countries.\nUse headline inflation measured from one year earlier from\nthe OECD main economic indicators for comparability.\n inflation rates have been smoothed using a MA(5) filter.\n\nIn these charts, the policy rate is on the left axis and inflation\nis on the right axis, and the difference in scale is the real rate.\n\n\fJapan\nJapan has spent a lot of time near the LL steady state since\n1995.\nJapan did not have an inflation target until recently.\nAbenomics dates from the political rise of Shinzo Abe\nbeginning in late 2012.\nThe BOJ “QQE” program has arguably had an important\nimpact and may be moving inflation closer to the 2 percent\ntarget.\n\n\fJapan\n\nSource: OECD’s Main Economic Indicators and author’s calculations. Last observation: June 2015.\n\n\fU.S.A.\nThe U.S. had inflation above target as of January 2012, but\nhas since seen inflation decline.\nThe Fed pursued unconventional monetary policy following\nthe crisis, once beginning in 2010 and again beginning in\n2012.\nThe most recent program ended in 2014.\nThose programs have left the Fed with a $4.5 trillion balance\nsheet.\n\n\fUnited States\n\nSource: OECD’s Main Economic Indicators and author’s calculations. Last observation: June 2015.\n\n\fEuro area\nEuro area inflation was above target as of 2012, but has also\ndeclined since that time.\nThe ECB generally resisted unconventional monetary policy,\neither forward guidance or quantitative easing, until this year.\nKey motivation: Inflation was falling far below target.\nThe current ECB QE program is expected to continue until\nSeptember 2016.\nMain development in the global economy in the last two\nyears is that the Euro Area has begun to look more like\nJapan.\n\n\fEuro area\n\nSource: OECD’s Main Economic Indicators and author’s calculations. Last observation: June 2015.\n\n\fUnited Kingdom\nThe United Kingdom generally has been thought to be less\naffected by neo-Fisherian concerns.\nInflation has generally been above target since 2008.\nRecently, however, inflation has fallen to low levels.\n\n\fUnited Kingdom\n\nSource: OECD’s Main Economic Indicators and author’s calculations. Last observation: June 2015.\n\n\fSweden\nLet’s look at some smaller open economies.\nThe Riksbank raised rates to combat rising inflation during\n2011 and 2012, but inflation then fell considerably below\ntarget.\nInflation has stabilized at zero over the last two years, and the\nRiksbank has experimented with negative policy rates\nrecently.\n\n\fSweden\n\nSource: OECD’s Main Economic Indicators and author’s calculations. Last observation: June 2015.\n\n\fSwitzerland\nThe Swiss economy has arguably been almost as close to the\nLL steady state as Japan over the last decade.\nSwiss inflation has been zero or negative for 3.5 years.\nThe SNB has also experimented with negative policy rates.\n\n\fSwitzerland\n\nSource: OECD’s Main Economic Indicators and author’s calculations. Last observation: June 2015.\n\n\fLessons from this evidence\nThe policy rates in these countries have been near zero for\nmost or all of the last 6.5 years.\nConventional NK theory suggests higher inflation should\nhave materialized, and on a time scale far shorter than 6.5\nyears.\nLet’s assess whether these countries are closer today to the\ntargeted steady state or the LL steady state.\nLet’s use Euclidean distance in the policy rate and the\ninflation rate.\n\n\fDistances from steady states in June 2015\nHigh s.s.\n\nLow s.s.\n\nUnited States\n\n3.52\n\n0.97\n\nJapan\n\n3.04\n\n2.20\n\nEuro area\n\n3.68\n\n1.05\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\n3.23\n\n1.10\n\nSweden\n\n3.77\n\n0.94\n\nSwitzerland\n\n5.13\n\n1.15\n\nSource: OECD’s Main Economic Indicators and author’s calculations. Last observation: June 2015.\n\n\fDistance from the LL steady state\nThe table indicates that as of June 2015, all countries are\nbetter described as close to the LL steady state than the\ntargeted steady state.\nSome of this is because policy rates remain near zero.\nOne could interpret recent QQE in Japan and QE in Europe\nas indicating that policymakers intend to remain at the zero\npolicy rate for quite some time into the future.\nThis commitment may be long enough to strengthen neoFisherian dynamics.\n\n\fFurther Considerations\n\n\fBottom line\nThe bottom line is that a case can be made that the LL steady\nstate has, in an empirical sense, a basin of attraction.\nThis conflicts with the general result from the learning\nliterature that the LL steady state is locally unstable.\nThere are of course many other possibilities.\nThe standard NK model may not be the right abstraction, as\nEvans, Andolfatto-Williamson, Caballero-Fahri, EggertssonMehrotra, Schmitt-Grohe-Uribe and others suggest.\nAlso, other global factors may be important. One is the price\nof oil.\n\n\fOil price shock in 2014 has affected inflation\n\nSource: Energy Information Administration and Haver Analytics. Last observation: week of August 7, 2015.\n\n\fExtent of the oil price effect on measured inflation\nI have argued in interviews and commentary that the Fed\nshould look through the oil price shock and expect inflation\nto rise in the coming quarters and years.\nA rigorous measure of smoothed inflation like the Dallas Fed\ntrimmed-mean PCE inflation rate suggests headline inflation\nmay be closer to target soon.\nThe Atlanta Fed’s “sticky price CPI inflation” measure is\nsomewhat above target. True believers in NK theory would\ntarget sticky price inflation (see Eusepi et al., 2011).\n One has to adjust for differences in CPI vs. PCE inflation.\n\n\fSmoothed measures of U.S. inflation\n\nSource: FRB Atlanta and FRB Dallas. Last observation: June 2015.\n\n\fSmoothed measures of inflation were lower in 2010\nIn the summer of 2010, I began arguing via the “seven faces”\npaper that inflation was “too low.”\nAt that time, even smoothed measures of inflation had fallen\nbelow 1 percent.\nThis is apparent in the previous chart.\nToday, smoothed measures of inflation look less threatening,\nbolstering the case that policymakers may be wise to expect\ntemporary influences on headline inflation to abate.\n\n\fInflation expectations\nThe neo-Fisherian story requires that inflation expectations\ntend to fall as the ZIRP policy continues.\nCentral banks like the Fed have put heavy weight on the idea\nthat actual inflation expectations are well-anchored.\nOne way to look at inflation expectations is to consider TIPSbased measures.\n For many countries considered here, 10-year expected inflation\nis below 2 percent. The exception is the U.K.\n\n\fInflation expectations generally below target\n\nSource: Bloomberg. Last observation: August 11, 2015.\n\n\fLonger-term bond yields\nThe neo-Fisherian story would also suggest that nominal\nbond yields should decline over time as expected inflation\nand possibly inflation risk premia would tend to move lower\nas convergence occurred.\nThis may be happening.\n\n\fBond yields\n\nSource: Financial Times. Last observation: week of August 7, 2015.\n\n\fSummary\n\n\fSummary\nPolicymaker conventional wisdom and NK theory both\nsuggest low nominal rates should cause inflation to rise.\nThe simple empirical evidence reviewed here suggests this is\nnot happening even after 6.5 years of ZIRP.\nThere are still reasons for maintaining faith in the\nconventional wisdom, including a major oil price shock and\narguably anchored inflation expectations.\nThe general result from the learning literature on the local\ninstability of the LL steady state seems unhelpful—it predicts\na natural return of inflation.\n\n\fFuture policy\nEven if the Fed begins normalization this year, U.S. and other\nrates will still be exceptionally low over the medium term.\nThese very low rates may be pulling inflation and inflation\nexpectations lower via the neo-Fisherian mechanism.\nFor now, I am willing to argue that current inflation is low in\npart due to temporary commodity price movements, and that\ninflation expectations remain well anchored.\nIf the neo-Fisherian effect is strong in the quarters and years\nahead, however, we will need to think about monetary policy\nin alternative ways.\n\n\fReferences\nD.

            "content": "Welcoming Remarks by James Bullard, President and CEO\nThird Annual Community Banking in the 21st Century Research and Policy Conference\nThe Federal Reserve System and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS)\nSt. Louis, Mo.\nSept. 30, 2015\nGood afternoon, and welcome to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The St. Louis Fed is\nproud to serve as the host site for the third annual Community Banking in the 21st Century\nresearch and policy conference. It is jointly sponsored by the Federal Reserve System and the\nConference of State Bank Supervisors.\nLast year, in addition to hearing some of the latest research on community banking from a wide\nrange of academic institutions and regulatory agencies, we also engaged in a spirited debate on\nthe opportunities and challenges facing community banks. Perhaps not surprisingly, regulatory\nburden was at the forefront of the discussion.\nThe energy from last year’s event helped inform much of the debate that has already taken\nplace in 2015.\nFor example, last December, the federal regulatory agencies conducted their first of six\nmeetings under the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996. Under\nthe law, agencies are required, every 10 years, to conduct a review for the specific purpose of\nidentifying outdated, unnecessary or unduly burdensome regulations.\nMany of the individuals who either attended last year’s conference or were part of the\nconference program were actively involved in these discussions. We have received numerous\ncomments from the four meetings that have taken place so far, and look forward to seeing the\noutcomes from these meetings next year.\nThere have been additional actions. Importantly, in April, the Fed announced that it was\nincreasing the asset-size threshold for small bank holding companies and savings and loan\nholding companies from $500 million to $1 billion. This change means that more holding\ncompany organizations are not subject to consolidated capital requirements, making it easier\nfor parent companies to borrow to finance certain transactions.\nIn addition, some changes to call report requirements were announced several weeks ago by\nthe Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council. The Federal Reserve is conducting its\n\n\fown review of the call report and other areas and is searching for additional burden-reducing\nchanges that may be applicable in the future.\nFrom my own perspective, more could be done. There appear to be some areas where we have\nsufficient information and experience to warrant additional action.\nFor example, we may want to consider the transaction value threshold under which a property\nrequires an appraisal by a state-certified or licensed appraiser. The current limit of $250,000\nhas been in place since 1994, when it was increased from $100,000. Inflation adjustment alone\nsuggests that the threshold in 2015 should be higher. Based upon a sample of community bank\nexaminations recently performed in the St. Louis Fed’s District, we estimate the number of\nrequired appraisals would decline significantly. Appraisals on properties in rural areas are often\nof limited value, especially when the nearest appraiser may be a significant distance away. In\nmany rural communities, bankers know local land values better than anyone outside, and likely\neven inside, their market. This is a reality of rural markets.\nAs another example, serious consideration should be given to mandatory escrow requirements\nfor taxes and insurance premiums on mortgages that are held in a community bank’s portfolio.\nRecent amendments to Regulation Z were helpful in that they provided a number of\nexemptions for certain types of loans made in rural or underserved areas. However, these\nexemptions do not go far enough. More can likely be done to address escrow requirements for\ncommunity banks in locations that hold mortgages in portfolio.\nWe have touched upon these and other issues in past conferences, and I look forward to a\nhealthy debate during this year’s conference.\nI want to express my appreciation to our conference co-sponsors and to all of the researchers,\ncommunity bankers and regulators who make this conference possible. This conference has\ngained a lot of momentum in the three years since it first launched, and I expect that to\ncontinue.\nBefore we move on to the research portion of our program, however, it is my great pleasure to\nintroduce Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen.\nJanet Yellen became chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System on Feb. 3,\n2014. She is the first woman to hold this position in the history of the Fed. She is an outstanding\nresearch economist with a long and influential research record, much of which was established\nduring her time as a professor at the University of California at Berkeley, one of the premier\neconomics departments in the world. Prior to her appointment as chair, she provided stellar\n2\n\n\fpublic service as a member of the Board of Governors, the vice chair of the Board of Governors,\nchair of the Council of Economic Advisers, chair of the Economic Policy Committee of the\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and as president and chief executive\nofficer of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. She is a member of both the Council on\nForeign Relations and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\nPlease join me in welcoming my esteemed colleague and chair of the Federal Reserve, Janet\nYellen.\n\n3\n\n\f",

Since 2007-2009, the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) has pursued a very aggressive\nmonetary policy strategy. This strategy has been\nassociated with a signi cantly improved labor market,\nmoderate growth, and in ation relatively close to target, net\nof a large oil price shock.\nA key question now is how to think about monetary policy\ngoing forward.\nThe FOMC has long suggested that the appropriate exit\nstrategy from the highly accommodative monetary policy\nfollowing the 2007-2009 recession would be slow and\n\nRSS\n\"Rationally, let it be said in a\nwhisper, experience is certainly\nworth more than theory.\"\nAmerigo Vespucci\n\n\fgradual, and would proceed in several well-de ned steps.\nIn the rst step, the Committee tapered and then ended its\nquantitative easing (QE) program during 2014. In the\nsecond step, the Committee waited for further\nimprovement in labor markets and signaled that the policy\nrate would soon move off the zero lower bound, albeit in\nsmall increments that would leave substantial monetary\npolicy accommodation in place. In the third step, still in the\nfuture, the Committee would begin to gradually shrink the\nbalance sheet, most likely through an end to\nreinvestments. The fourth step, well in the future, would\nsee the balance sheet closer to pre-crisis levels and the\npolicy rate more consistent with the Committee view of its\nlonger-term level.\nThe liftoff of the policy rate from near zero might be viewed\nby some as a momentous event, since the Committee has\nnot changed this element of monetary policy since\nDecember 2008, nearly seven years ago. Still, it would be a\nrelatively minor part of the normalization story I have\noutlined. It is, after all, just one portion of a long-running\nrecovery process from the events of 2007-2009. Eventually,\none would surely expect to see nominal interest rates at\nmore normal levels to be consistent with a pre-crisis\nequilibrium in which in ation is at target and labor markets\nare functioning well.\nOn the eve of policy rate normalization, however, the\ngeneral view outlined above is being challenged from\nseveral directions. In this talk, I will provide my own\ncharacterization of some of these challenges in what I\nhope is an easy-to-digest format.\nI will describe four broad categories of thinking about\ncurrent U.S. monetary policy. None of these four broad\nthemes are strictly identi ed with any one individual or\norganization, but instead represent threads of argument\none often hears in nancial market commentary, academia,\nand policymaking circles. Of these four approaches, the\nrst will be what I think is a \"classic\" interpretation of\ncurrent events based on traditional ideas of successful\ncentral banking practice. This is the central banking\northodoxy referenced in the title of this talk. The other\nthree approaches are mildly heretical. Each claims that an\naspect of the orthodoxy is clearly de cient in the current\npolicy environment. Each has some appeal, but also\nimportant drawbacks. Each departs from the classic view\nby arguing that \"this time is different.\"\nMy conclusion will be that each challenge to orthodoxy is\ninteresting and potentially helpful, but ultimately has one or\nmore drawbacks that make the orthodox view my favored\nbasis for near- and medium-term monetary policy\ndecisions.\nI will begin by rst describing my version of central banking\northodoxy. This part of the talk will be familiar to those\nwho have followed recent speeches of mine on the state of\n\n\fmonetary policy.2 I will then move on to the three\nchallenges to this orthodoxy that I wish to discuss. These\nchallenges are: (1) A weakening Phillips curve relationship\nthat can lead to arguments for a more intense focus on\nin ation relative to the orthodox view; (2) very low real\ninterest rates that can undermine the part of the orthodox\nview that claims monetary policy is very accommodative\ntoday; and (3) citation of ongoing globalization as a\npossible reason to heed foreign economic developments\ndistinctly and separately when making domestic monetary\npolicy decisions. I will explain all of these challenges to\northodoxy as I proceed through these arguments.\n\nA Simple Description of Central Banking Orthodoxy\nWhat I am calling the \"classic\" or \"traditional\" way to view\ncurrent U.S. monetary policy emphasizes the cumulative\nsuccess that has been achieved so far with respect to\nCommittee goals. The Committee has clear objectives\nassociated with labor market performance and in ation.\nRegarding in ation, the Committee set an o cial target of\n2 percent beginning in 2012. Concerning labor market\nperformance, the Committee, through its most recent\nSummary of Economic Projections (SEP), has indicated\nthat an unemployment rate of around 4.9 percent is likely\nto be consistent with longer-run equilibrium.3 The value of\nthe longer-run unemployment rate has drifted down\nrecently—it was 5.6 percent within the last few years.4\nIs the Committee achieving these objectives? The classic\nview emphasizes that indeed, these Committee objectives\nare close to being met.\nThe unemployment rate is currently 5.1 percent and has\nbeen on a downward trend. Given the large amount of\nuncertainty around the concept of a long-run or natural rate\nof unemployment, the current 5.1 percent value is\nstatistically indistinguishable from the Committee's\nstatement of the likely long-run level. In the last two\nexpansions, unemployment fell well into the 4 percent\nrange, and, barring a major recessionary shock,\nunemployment is likely to fall to similar levels in the\nquarters and years ahead. This is likely regardless of the\ndate of liftoff, because monetary policy will remain\nexceptionally accommodative even after normalization\nbegins. In short, the Committee has already hit its objective\non this dimension.5 In addition, labor markets are likely to\ncontinue to improve going forward, barring a major\nnegative shock.\nMany have argued that other dimensions of labor market\nperformance should be considered in the current\nenvironment. I think this is fair, since labor markets were\nseverely disrupted in 2007-2009. Indicators such as job\nopenings and initial unemployment insurance claims look\nvery good, while other indicators like part time for\neconomic reasons and long-term unemployment seem not\n\n\fas good. One way to get a handle on this issue is to\nconsider a labor market conditions index. Such an index\ncan be constructed by combining many different indicators\nof labor market performance into a single index number,\nand then taking that index number as a better and more\ninformed judgment of the state of the labor market than\nthe unemployment rate alone. We have calculated the level\nof such an index.6 The current level of the index is well\nabove its average level since 1976. Labor markets might be\nviewed as even better than normal according to this\nmetric.7\nWhat about the in ation side of the mandate? In ation is\ncertainly low today; in fact, near zero on a year-over-year\nbasis due in part to the very large decline in oil prices\nbeginning in 2014. In addition, recent oil price volatility\nsuggests stabilization of oil and related commodities\nprices may still be some ways in the future. While the drop\nin oil prices is a net positive for the U.S. economy, the\nsharp downward movement does inhibit year-over-year\nreadings on headline in ation. The classic view has an\nanswer for this—it suggests looking through large oil price\nshocks, either positive or negative.\nAccordingly, at this particular juncture, it may be more\nuseful to consider the Dallas Fed's trimmed mean PCE\nin ation measure. This measure is running at about 1.7\npercent year-over-year, about 30 basis points below the\nFOMC target. This is low, but still reasonably close to\ntarget.\nThe classic view, as I am outlining it here, would then say\nthat unemployment of 5.1 percent and underlying in ation\nof 1.7 percent constitute values that are exceptionally\nclose to the objectives of the Committee. This is so much\nso that based on a quadratic objective in deviations of\nunemployment and in ation from target, today's\ncombination of labor market performance and in ation\nperformance is about as good as it has ever been in the\npostwar era.8\nWhile the metrics concerning Committee objectives are\nclose to normal, the policy settings are not. The Committee\nhas used two tools in the last seven years to conduct\nmonetary policy. One tool has been to set the policy rate to\na near-zero value, where it remains today. The Committee's\nSEP indicates that participants view the longer-run level of\nthe policy rate to be about 3.5 percent, so that the current\npolicy rate is more than 325 basis points lower than the\nlong-run level. The other tool has been quantitative easing.\nAs a result of several rounds of QE, the Fed's balance sheet\nhas increased from a pre-crisis value of about $800 billion\nto about $4.5 trillion today.\nThese considerations—objectives met, but policy settings\nfar from normal—suggest a policy path that will return the\neconomy to the well understood pre-crisis equilibrium.\nBased on central bank orthodoxy, the most prudent course\n\n\fof action is to begin to normalize the policy rate slowly and\ngradually, under the interpretation that the Committee will\nstill be providing considerable monetary accommodation\nto the economy to guard against potential pitfalls and risks\nas the quarters and years ahead unfold. By adopting this\nprudent approach to monetary policy strategy, policy tools\nwill eventually be returned to the toolbox, and the\nCommittee may be able to lengthen the expansion longer\nthan it may otherwise extend.\nI have set up this simple classic view because I think that,\non balance, this view suggests the best path forward for\nU.S. monetary policy. But there are certainly other views\nwith considerable merit, and I will now turn to a discussion\nof these alternatives. All of the alternatives depart from an\nimportant aspect of the classic view. Again, I would\nhesitate to associate these alternatives with speci c\nindividuals or organizations, as most or all of us (including\nme at times) appeal to parts of these arguments when\ndiscussing contemporary monetary policy.\n\nStrict In ation Targeting\nThe classic view I have outlined places heavy emphasis on\nthe attainment of Committee goals with respect to labor\nmarket outcomes. A possible challenge to the classic view\nis that labor markets have been overemphasized, and that\nit is the low in ation outcomes that are more critical today.\nThis brings us to a second way to think about current U.S.\nmonetary policy strategy and the rst of the mildly heretical\nviews. I will provocatively label this view \"strict in ation\ntargeting,\" a term often applied to Taylor-type monetary\npolicy rules that place no weight on real variables like\noutput or unemployment gaps.\nHow could labor market outcomes be overemphasized?\nOne version of this view is that Phillips curve relationships\non which much of modern central banking practice rely\nhave either broken down completely or are badly damaged,\nmeaning that further expansion of the economy and tighter\nlabor markets in the quarters and years ahead are unlikely\nto lead to more in ation.9 This being the case, one may\nwish to pursue substantially more monetary policy\naccommodation than otherwise—one may, for instance,\nkeep the policy rate near zero longer.\nAnother version of this story is that the normal Phillips\ncurve relationship remains intact, but the in ation rate\nitself contains all the information one needs to determine\nthe extent of slack in the economy. That is, one may be\nable to reverse engineer the degree of slack in the\neconomy by considering the in ation rate alone. One does\nnot really need to know that much about the Phillips curve\nand its mysteries. The Phillips curve is temporarily dormant\n—it may or may not reassert itself in the future—and we can\nwatch in ation for signs of life in the in ationunemployment nexus.\n\n\fEither way, whether one thinks the Phillips curve has\nbroken down or is merely dormant, a student of the current\nU.S. economy taking this broad view may tend to cite\nin ation alone as the key indicator on which monetary\npolicy should rely, and hence I label this view \"strict\nin ation targeting.\" We could think of an advocate of this\nview as employing a Taylor-type rule in which the\ncoe cient on the unemployment gap has been set to zero.\nIn short, in this alternative view, policy rates should be\nnormalized only when in ation threatens. It challenges the\nclassic view by dispensing with or substantially\ndiscounting the empirical evidence on labor market\nimprovement as a reason to begin policy normalization.\nSince I am not an advocate of the Phillips curve as an\norganizing principle for monetary economics, the strict\nin ation targeting approach has some appeal for me.\nTaken to its logical extreme, one could greatly deemphasize current data on economic growth and labor\nmarket performance, focusing instead on in ation\ndevelopments alone in considering monetary policy\nstrategy.\nNevertheless, I do see an important drawback with this\nview. This type of argument might work better if the policy\nrate was not near zero, but instead was only mildly below\nits long-run level. But to use this alternative to the classic\nview to justify a very low policy rate near zero implies a\nvery large elasticity between the policy rate and the\nin ation gap.10 One would be saying, in effect, that\nbecause a smoothed measure of in ation such as the yearover-year Dallas Fed trimmed mean PCE was somewhat\nbelow the in ation target (let's say 50 basis points below),\nthe policy rate itself must be set 325 basis points below its\nnormal value. The ip side would be, in the context of strict\nin ation targeting, that when a smoothed measure of\nin ation is 50 basis points above target, the policy rate\nwould need to be set to something like 325 basis points\nabove its normal value, on the order of a 7 percent policy\nrate. Few would have this kind of sensitivity of the policy\nrate to in ation developments in mind when interpreting\nevents using this view, but that is the implication of strict\nin ation targeting in the current environment. Given the\nnatural variation in actual in ation, such a large elasticity\nwould probably be unwise, as it might imply rapid\nadjustment of the policy rate in response to relatively\nbenign in ation developments, possibly causing additional\nvolatility in the economy. For this reason, I think it may be\nunwise to follow this particular alternative to the classic\nview.\n\nLow Real Interest Rates\nThe classic view as I have formulated it does not say\nanything about real interest rates. It implicitly assumes that\npolicy can be conducted with a standard Taylor-type policy\n\n\frule in which the intercept term represents a constant longrun or normal value for the policy rate. This is indeed the\nway Taylor-type rules were initially proposed and t to\nmacroeconomic data. Still, we have to be cognizant of the\nevidence, and current real interest rates on government\ndebt and related instruments are exceptionally low.11\nAnother alternative and mildly heretical way to think about\ncurrent U.S. monetary policy is to appeal to time-varying\nreal interest rates, and to argue that the intercept term in\nthe Taylor-type rule is exceptionally low in the current era.\nTo see this, consider a generic Taylor-type monetary policy\nrule without too many bells and whistles. The rule is stated\nin linear terms, with in ation gaps and output or\nunemployment gaps as key arguments. Let us suppose for\npurposes of discussion that these gaps are zero—in ation\nis at target and unemployment is at its long-run level, so\nthese terms go away completely. Then the Taylor-type rule\nsimply says that the policy rate should be equal to its longrun or steady state level, often referred to as r*.\nAnd what is this r*? It is simply the sum of the short-term\nreal rate and the in ation target. That is, the Taylor rule\ncollapses to a Fisher relation, stating that the current value\nof the nominal policy rate is equal to the real rate plus\n(expected) in ation which is equal to the in ation target at\nthe steady state.\nThe real interest rate argument is that r* is actually a very\nlow value in the current macroeconomic environment. Let\nus suppose that the relevant short-term real interest rate is\nminus 2 percent. Then, given an in ation target of 2\npercent and gaps which are zero, the recommended policy\nrate from a Taylor-type rule in this class would be zero.\nThis provides an argument rationalizing today's near-zero\npolicy rate. In other words, yes, in ation and unemployment\nare near target, implying that the policy rate should also be\nnear r*, but r* is itself zero, so everything is exactly\nrationalized.\nWhat should we make of this alternative view?\nFirst, this argument as stated is saying that monetary\npolicy is not accommodative right now, contrary to\nconventional wisdom.12 Most observers of monetary policy\nseem to believe (via the orthodox view given earlier) that\nmonetary policy is exceptionally accommodative and that\nit will continue to be accommodative going forward. This\nprovides one reason why the low real rates view is\nsomewhat heretical. In other contexts, many might say that\nit is the central bank actions themselves which are driving\nreal interest rates to very low levels.\nSecond, there are many competing methods for computing\nthe real interest rate. One method would emphasize labor\nforce growth and the pace of technological improvement.\nAnother method would draw on economic theory and use\nconsumption growth rates. Using these and other methods\n\n\ffrom the literature suggests that one can reasonably reach\na wide variety of conclusions about the appropriate\nestimate of the real interest rate.13\nFor both of these reasons, the implied level of\naccommodation and the measurement uncertainty\nsurrounding the estimation of the real interest rate, I think\nthis alternative view suggests an unwise modi cation to\nthe classic orthodoxy.\n\nGlobalization\nThe classic view as I outlined it did not make reference to\nevents outside U.S. borders. This may be viewed as a\nshortcoming in an age of globalization. The nal challenge\nto the classic view is to go global.\nIt may seem obvious that increasing reference to foreign\neconomic events will be part of U.S. monetary policy going\nforward. But it has not been as popular as one might think,\nat least in portions of the international monetary policy\ncoordination literature.14 In models, the ideas are clear.\nThere are many countries with independent monetary\npolicies. Each country is its own New Keynesian economy\nwith its own shocks. Exchange rates are exible. Monetary\npolicymakers in each country attempt to stabilize their own\neconomies as well as they can by reacting appropriately to\nthe shocks in their own country. A general conclusion from\nmy reading of the literature is that in this situation, there\nwould be little to gain from international monetary policy\ncoordination. Roughly speaking, if policymakers in each\ncountry pursue the best domestically oriented stabilization\npolicy available to them, the global equilibrium will be as\ngood, or nearly as good, as the fully optimal outcome that\ncould be attained through an appropriate coordination of\nmonetary policy.\nWhat does this mean in practical terms? \"Domestically\noriented stabilization policy\" means policymaker reaction\nfunctions include only domestic variables, and these\ndomestic variables contain all the information needed to\npursue optimal policy, regardless of what is occurring in\nthe rest of the world. Alternatively, one could imagine\nmonetary policymakers in each country incorporating, in\naddition to their own output gaps and in ation gaps,\nforeign output gaps in their Taylor-type rules as they\nconduct monetary policy. The policymakers would then be\nadjusting their own policy rates in reaction to domestic\nin ation developments, domestic real developments, and,\nseparately and distinctly, foreign real developments. The\nbaseline result from an important class of models is that\nthis situation does not lead to a better global equilibrium,\nand all countries would be just as well off focusing only on\ndomestic in ation and domestic real developments. Why?\nThe short answer is that it is the job of the foreign central\nbank to use stabilization policy in reaction to shocks in its\nown economy. That, in conjunction with the exible\n\n\fexchange rate regime, makes it unnecessary for the\ndomestic policymaker to react to foreign shocks.\nOf course, this is just one set of models. But as a baseline,\nI think this provides food for thought concerning\nglobalization and monetary policy. The models I am\nreferring to are \"fully globalized\" as the economies involved\nare simply carbon copies of one another with different\nshocks. Even within this environment of full globalization,\nthe gains from international policy coordination may be\nsmall.\nThere is another angle on the role of foreign developments\nin domestic monetary policy. This is the literature on socalled global output gaps.15 This literature argues that the\noutput or resource gap that is most relevant for domestic\nin ation may actually be a global gap, which is sort of an\naverage of output gaps across countries. In other contexts,\nI have explored the idea that especially for China and the\nU.S., which are linked by a managed exchange rate regime,\nit may be more appropriate to think of the resource gap for\nthe two countries jointly.16 While this is interesting and I\nthink deserving of further research attention, in truth, the\nmeasurement problems are all the more severe in\nattempting to calculate a global output gap as opposed to\nsimpler domestic resource gaps.\n\nConclusion\nIn this address, I have outlined an interpretation of current\nevents in U.S. monetary policy that I called the orthodox\nview. This view stresses the currently stark difference\nbetween FOMC objectives, which are arguably nearly\nattained, and FOMC policy tools, which remain on\nemergency settings. A simple and prudent approach to\ncurrent policy would be to begin normalizing the policy\nsettings in an effort to extend the length of the expansion\nand to avoid taking unnecessary risks associated with\nexceptionally low rates and a large Fed balance sheet. This\nwould be done with the understanding that policy would\nremain extremely accommodative for several years, even\nas normalization proceeds, and that this accommodation\nwould help to mitigate remaining risks to the economy\nduring the transition.\nThese remarks have described what I see as three\nimportant challenges to this orthodox view. All challenges\nhave a certain clear appeal, but also important drawbacks.\nAll challenges contain an element of the argument that\n\"this time is different.\"\nThe rst challenge concerned possible overemphasis on\nlabor market improvement in the orthodox view. One\nversion would be that the empirical Phillips curve\nrelationship is broken, and therefore the Fed can continue a\nvery accommodative policy without worry of pressing\nin ation concerns. I called this view, somewhat\n\n\fprovocatively, \"strict in ation targeting.\" A key issue with\nthis challenge to orthodoxy is that it is di cult to use this\nargument to justify the exceptionally low policy rate\nobserved in the U.S. today. Actually trying strict in ation\ntargeting in the current environment would imply an\nexceptionally sensitive policy reaction function that might\ndestabilize rather than stabilize the economy.\nThe second challenge concerned the observed low real\ninterest rates on government debt and related instruments\nin the U.S. and globally versus the orthodox view that real\ninterest rates of this type move very little and only very\nslowly. Time-varying and low real rates can be used, via a\nTaylor-type rule, to rationalize the current policy rate setting\nof zero. An important question for this challenge to\northodoxy is whether the resulting characterization of\ncurrent policy as neutral instead of accommodative is\nconsistent with Committee statements and nancial\nmarket interpretations of current monetary policy. In\naddition, simple alternative measurements of an\nappropriate real interest rate suggest considerable\nuncertainty around this concept.\nThe nal challenge deals with global concerns versus the\northodoxy that de-emphasizes international\nconsiderations. While it may seem that with increasing\nglobalization, policy in one country has to take increasing\naccount of developments in other countries, some of the\nliterature on international monetary policy coordination in\nNew Keynesian models suggests otherwise. In particular,\nat least as a baseline concept, the global equilibrium will\nbe close to optimal if each country reacts only to domestic\nvariables and the world is characterized by exible\nexchange rates. This provides some food for thought on\nwhat globalization does and does not imply for monetary\npolicy strategy.\nIn sum, while the challenges to orthodoxy presented here\nare certainly tangible and interesting, I do not think they\nprovide su ciently robust arguments to guide U.S.\nmonetary policy over the near and medium term. The U.S.\neconomy will likely enjoy better outcomes if the monetary\npolicy orthodoxy I have described is preserved as the\nguiding principle.\n\nEndnotes\n1\n\nThe views expressed here are my own and do not\n\nnecessarily re ect the views of others on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee.

            "content": "Welcoming Remarks by James Bullard, President and CEO\nSymposium: 529s and Child Savings Accounts\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and Washington University in St. Louis\nSt. Louis, Mo.\nOct. 8, 2015\nThank you, and welcome to today’s event on 529s and Child Savings Accounts: New Strategies\nto Promote Savings and Development for America’s Children.\nToday’s event has been jointly organized by the St. Louis Fed’s Center for Household Financial\nStability, led by Ray Boshara, and our Community Development Department, led by Yvonne\nSparks. I thank Ray and Yvonne and their teams for doing all the hard work of putting this\nevent together. I also thank Michael Sherraden and his excellent team at the Center for Social\nDevelopment at Washington University in St. Louis, our partner for this and many other events\norganized by the center.\nThe St. Louis Fed is excited about the potential of child accounts—whether structured through\nfinancial institutions or through 529 college savings plans—to help children and their families\nsave for a brighter future. The evidence on the effectiveness of child savings accounts thus far\nis encouraging and has inspired exciting programs and policies in the St. Louis region and\nnationwide. We are fortunate to have many of those initiatives featured here today. Let me\noffer a special thank you to all of our speakers, many of whom traveled from all over the U.S. to\nshare their experience and expertise with us.\nResearch led by Bill Emmons from the Center for Household Financial Stability suggests that\ntoday’s younger Americans are not likely to accumulate as much wealth as previous\ngenerations of younger Americans at a similar age. For example, an American born in 1970 is\non a path to accumulate 40 percent less wealth over his or her lifetime than an American born\nin 1940. By enabling savings for college early in life, children and youth are more likely to\naccumulate wealth—which is essential for their own financial security, as well as for the\neconomic health of our nation.\nOther research, led by many of the scholars in this room, shows that child accounts contribute\nto child development, parental expectations for children’s educational achievement, maternal\nmental health, college access and completion, more savings later in life, and financial capability.\n\n\fThese results suggest that more should be done to ensure that these accounts are available to\nmore children and younger Americans.\nAs everyone here knows well, the relative cost of education is increasing, and today about\nseven in 10 students have to rely on loans to finance their education. Savings not only make it\nmore likely children will attend and complete college, savings also reduce the amount of\nborrowing necessary to get the degree that is so essential to success in today’s economy. In\nfact, recent research by Guillaume Vandenbroucke of the St. Louis Fed shows that the lifetime\nfinancial benefits of an education—sometimes called the skill premium—have never been so\nhigh.\nIn short, it is important to save, save early and save often. Households can accomplish all three\nby making sure every child has his or her own savings account. That is a big part of the appeal\nof many of the policies and programs we will be discussing today: Through an automatic, initial\ndeposit, child accounts enable every child—regardless of income, race, ethnicity or family\nbackground—to get on a path toward college savings, making lifelong savings more likely as\nwell. The St. Louis Fed is proud to be part of this exciting public policy discussion.\nThank you and, again, welcome to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.\n\n2\n\n\f",

This is the 40th\nyear for this conference. I want to thank Paulina Restrepo-Echavarria and Guillaume\nVandenbroucke for putting this program together. I am looking forward to the stimulating\ndiscussion these papers are sure to inspire over the next day and a half.\nAt the St. Louis Fed, we have long tried to provide perspectives on whether the economic\npolicies adopted in the past still serve us well today and whether recent developments at the\nfrontier of research can be fruitfully applied to improve policy. This agenda has become\nespecially important in the past few years, as the Fed and other central banks around the world\nhave struggled to devise appropriate policy responses to the current macroeconomic situation.\nIn polite economist society, there has long been a distinction between what is known as\n“frontier” research and what is sometimes called “policy” research. In my view, this has been\nand continues to be a false dichotomy. There is no such distinction: “Policy” and “frontier”\nresearch are two sides of the same coin. We need to understand both how fundamental\nmechanisms in the economy operate as well as how current data and policy measures can be\ninterpreted in terms of fundamental theory.\nIn short, advanced economic theory has to be made more relevant for actual policy, and actual\npolicy has to understand and embrace the sometimes difficult ideas advanced in the theoretical\nliterature. The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis has long been a leader in supporting research\nat the intersection of economic theory and economic policy.\nWe are fortunate this year to have an outstanding group of speakers, whose research is sure to\nexpand our understanding of key contemporary issues in macroeconomics.\nThis year’s agenda includes papers on a host of macroeconomic topics, including:\n•\n\na paper on the extent to which recent developments in neoclassical models can improve\nour understanding of aggregate economies;\n\n\f•\n\na paper that incorporates intangible investments into a multi-sector general equilibrium\nmodel to estimate processes for latent sectorial total factor productivity;\n\n•\n\na paper on the role of wholesale banking and bank runs in modeling financial crises;\n\n•\n\na paper seeking to understand the behavior of the Chinese savings rate, which has more\nthan doubled since 1980; and\n\n•\n\na paper using regional business cycle data to study the determinants of prices, wages\nand employment during the Great Recession.\n\nWe will hear about monetary policy, including:\n•\n\na paper studying the macroeconomic effects of a shortage of safe assets and the\nemergence of a deflationary equilibrium; and\n\n•\n\na paper exploring monetary policy when fractional reserves are set at 100 percent.\n\nWe will also learn about the quantitative implications of wealth taxation through a paper that\nstudies an incomplete markets model where individual rates of return are heterogeneous.\nAnd, finally, we will see a dynamic model of health insurance used to evaluate both the shortand long-run effects of policies that prevent firms from conditioning wages on the health\nconditions of their workers.\nI know that these papers and the ideas they contain will contribute importantly to the\nmacroeconomic discussion in the coming years as the papers are eventually published and the\nresults become more widely known in the profession. The St. Louis Fed is proud to provide this\nforum for discussion and analysis of the leading issues of the day.\nLet me again welcome all of you to the St. Louis Fed’s 2015 Fall Conference. Thanks very much\nfor coming.\n\n2\n\n\f",

One of the most popular and enduring\nviews in all of monetary economics since the 1970s, and\nindeed since the 1940s, has been that a nominal interest\nrate peg is poor monetary policy, and that attempts to\npursue such a policy would lead to ruin. Yet, post-crisis U.S.\nmonetary policy could be interpreted as exactly that—an\ninterest rate peg—and an extreme one at that, since the\npolicy rate has remained near zero for nearly seven years.\n\n\"Rationally, let it be said in a\nwhisper, experience is certainly\nworth more than theory.\"\nAmerigo Vespucci\n\n\fIn this talk, I will summarize some recent academic work\non the idea of a stable interest rate peg and what its\nimplications may be for current monetary policy choices. I\nwill argue that a stable interest rate peg is a realistic\ntheoretical possibility; that it has some mild empirical\nsupport based on a cursory look at the data; and that,\nshould we nd ourselves in a persistent state of low\nnominal interest rates and low in ation, some of our\nfundamental assumptions about how U.S. monetary policy\nworks may have to be altered.\nMy Current Policy Recommendations\nLet me begin by describing brie y my current monetary\npolicy recommendations. Those of you who have followed\nmy commentary during 2015 know that I have been an\nadvocate of ending the Federal Open Market Committee's\n(FOMC's) near-zero nominal interest rate policy. My case\nhas been straightforward. Essentially, I have argued that\nwhile the Committee's goals have been met, the\nCommittee's policy settings remain as extreme as they\nhave been at any time since the recession ended in 2009.\nWith respect to these goals, the current unemployment rate\nof 5 percent is statistically indistinguishable from the\nCommittee's view of the equilibrium long-run rate of\nunemployment. In addition, the current year-over-year\nin ation rate, while low, re ects an outsized oil price shock\nthat occurred during 2014. A measure that tries to control\nfor this effect, the Dallas Fed's trimmed mean in ation rate,\nmeasured year-over-year, is currently running at 1.7\npercent, just 30 basis points below the FOMC's in ation\ntarget of 2 percent. By these measures, the Committee's\ngoals have been met.\nOn the other hand, the Committee's policy settings remain\nfar from normal. The policy rate remains near zero, and the\nbalance sheet is very large relative to its pre-crisis levels. In\nthe past, the Committee has acted to normalize policy well\nbefore goals have been completely met.\nA simple and prudent approach to current policy is to move\nthe policy settings closer to normal levels now that the\ngoals of policy have been attained. There is no reason to\ncontinue to experiment with extreme policy settings.\nImplicit in my argument is a desire to return to the 19842007 U.S. macroeconomic equilibrium, which involved\nrelatively good monetary policy, relatively long economic\nexpansions, and a higher nominal interest rate than we\nhave today. Part of the nature of that equilibrium was a\nmonetary policy that was relatively well understood by both\nnancial market participants and monetary policymakers.\nWe gained much experience with the equilibrium over this\ntime period, and we think we know how it works, in part\nbecause it has been studied extensively from both a\ntheoretical and empirical perspective.\n\n\fRethinking Monetary Policy\nNevertheless, as the topic of this conference is \"Rethinking\nMonetary Policy,\" I plan to devote the bulk of my remarks\nnot to the return to the standard macroeconomic\nequilibrium that I recommend, but to the possibility that\nsuch a return is not achieved, despite the Committee's best\nefforts to engineer such an outcome for the U.S. economy.\nWe have, after all, been at the zero lower bound in the U.S.\nfor seven years. In addition, the FOMC has repeatedly\nstressed that any policy rate increase in coming quarters\nand years will likely be more gradual than either the 1994\ncycle or the 2004-2006 cycle. In short, the FOMC is already\ncommitted to a very low nominal interest rate environment\nover the forecast horizon of two to three years. Perhaps\nshort-term nominal rates will simply be low during this\nperiod, or perhaps the economy will encounter a negative\nshock that will propel policy back toward the zero lower\nbound.\nOur experience is not unique. In Japan, the policy rate has\nnot been higher than 50 basis points for two decades, and\nin the eurozone, the policy rate looks set to remain near\nzero at least through September 2016.\nThe thrust of this talk is to suppose, for the sake of\nargument, that the zero interest rate policy (ZIRP) or nearZIRP remains a persistent feature of the U.S. economy.\nHow should we think about monetary stabilization policy in\nsuch an environment? What sorts of considerations should\nbe paramount? Should we expect slow growth? Will we\ncontinue to have low in ation, or will in ation rise? Would\nwe be at more risk of nancial asset price volatility? What\ntypes of concrete policy decisions could be made to cope\nwith such an environment? Would it require a rethinking of\nU.S. monetary policy?\nI will provide tentative answers to all of these questions.\nBut rst, I want to argue that it may indeed be possible to\nconverge to an equilibrium at the zero lower bound, and\nthat this situation has some surprising consequences.\nChief among these consequences is that the policy itself\nmay put downward pressure on in ation in the medium\nand long term, rather than upward pressure as\nconventionally thought. This is a simple consequence of\nthe Fisher equation having to hold in concert with\nmonetary neutrality. I will now turn to developing this point.\nPermazero\nMost analyses of U.S. monetary policy since the crisis of\n2007-2009 have suggested that ZIRP in the U.S. is a\ntemporary affair, one that was part of an important set of\npolicy actions designed to mitigate a particularly large\nshock to the U.S. economy. But how temporary is it?\n\n\fWe have been at the zero lower bound for nearly seven\nyears. This is well beyond an ordinary business cycle time.\nNormally, we would think of a shock hitting the economy,\nwith the effects of that shock largely wearing off well\nwithin a seven-year time span. What are the consequences\nof spending such a long time with the policy rate at one\nvalue? Arguably, it is an interest rate peg.\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, the typical reply to this question\nwas that an interest rate peg was poor policy. Trying to\nkeep the nominal policy rate unnaturally low for too long a\nperiod would ultimately be in ationary, and indeed, this\nwas widely viewed as a large part of the problem leading to\nglobal in ation during this era.2 Indeed, during the past six\nyears I have warned along with many others that the\nCommittee's ZIRP has put the U.S. economy at\nconsiderable risk of future in ation. In fact, my monetarist\nbackground urges me to continue to make this warning\nright now!\nIn any case, after seven years, one might want to consider\nother models. One important possibility is that the 1970s\nwere an era when U.S. monetary policy was not very\ncredible with respect to ghting in ation, whereas the\n2000s were an era when U.S. monetary policy had already\nearned a lot of credibility for keeping in ation low and\nstable. One way to interpret this is to say that market\nexpectations of future in ation today move to stay in line\nwith the FOMC's desired policy rate instead of becoming\n\"unanchored\" as they did in the 1970s. In particular, this\nwould mean that a low nominal interest rate peg, far from\nbeing a harbinger of runaway in ation, would instead\ndictate medium- and longer-run low in ation outcomes.\nThis theme is sometimes labelled \"neo-Fisherian,\" because\nit emphasizes that the Fisher equation holds in virtually all\nmodern macroeconomic models. The Fisher equation\nstates that the nominal interest rate can be decomposed\ninto a real interest rate component and an expected\nin ation component. If we view the real interest rate as\ndetermined by supply and demand conditions in the private\nsector, then a permanent nominal interest rate peg would\nalso pin down the long-run rate of in ation. The Fisher\nequation implies, among other things, that the monetary\nauthority cannot choose the long-run value of the nominal\npolicy interest rate separately from the long-run value of\nin ation.\nThis Fisher effect is well known and is not likely to be\ndisputed in macroeconomic circles. However, how long\nbefore this Fisher effect sets in? Over what time period can\nthe monetary authority maintain an interest rate peg before\nthe peg itself begins to pull in ation expectations in a\ndirection consistent with the peg? Is seven years a\nsu cient length of time? How about 20 years, as in Japan?\nCochrane (2015)\n\n\fA new paper by Cochrane (2015) provides an interesting\nanalysis of this issue in the context of the most canonical\nof modern macroeconomic models, the linearized threeequation New Keynesian model.3 I will not provide any\ndetails of the model here, but for those who are unfamiliar\nwith it, I will brie y describe its essential ingredients. The\nkey friction in the model is that prices are sticky, meaning\nthat they do not adjust immediately in response to supply\nand demand conditions. Households and rms solve\noptimization problems taking the friction as given. The\npolicymaker controls a one-period nominal interest rate,\nand through this channel can have temporary effects on\nreal output and in ation. The Fisher equation holds at all\ntimes. The model can be described by three simple\nequations that depend on expectations of future real\noutput, future in ation and future monetary policy. The\nspirit of Cochrane's analysis is to suggest that neoFisherian effects are part of even the most ordinary of\nmacroeconomic models used to inform current monetary\npolicy.\nCochrane (2015) uses a solution technique for the model\ndue to Werning (2012). We can think of the economy as\ncontinuing from the distant past to the distant future. The\npolicymaker chooses the short-term nominal interest rate\nsequence, and, given this sequence, the model traces out\nwhat would happen to the real output gap (x) and in ation\n(π).\nI use Cochrane's model to trace out the effects on the\neconomy of the following thought experiment. Suppose the\neconomy begins with the nominal interest rate equal to 2\npercent, a real interest rate equal to 0 percent (for\nconvenience), and an in ation rate equal to 2 percent. The\nFisher equation holds, as it must, so that in the long run the\npolicy rate will equal the in ation rate in this example. The\npolicymaker then lowers the policy rate by 200 basis points\nto zero, and leaves it there for a considerable time.\nFigure 1 illustrates the effect of such a policy experiment in\nCochrane's (2015) model. The green triangles show the\npolicy rate, which begins at 200 basis points, but is lowered\nto zero at date 0. If the policy move is anticipated, as many\nactual policy moves are, then the effects on in ation are\ndescribed by the red squares, and the effects on the real\noutput gap are given by the black circles. If the policy\nchange is completely unanticipated, then the effects on\nin ation are given by the magenta squares, and the effects\non the real output gap are given by the blue circles. In the\ncase of a \"surprise\" policy move, nothing happens until the\ndate of the move, whereupon the in ation and real output\ngap variables jump to the path they would have been on,\nhad the policy change been known in advance. For our\npurposes here, it does not matter that much if we focus on\nan anticipated or an unanticipated policy change.\n\n\fInstead, I want to focus on the right hand side of this\npicture, after the policy move has occurred. The\npolicymaker has lowered the policy rate to zero, and in\nresponse, the real output gap has increased.4 This is one\nway to gauge the real effects of monetary policy according\nto the model: A pure change in the policy rate, with no other\nshocks occurring, would temporarily increase output. This\nis what the model is designed to do, and if we added more\nshocks to the model, the policymaker could use this power\nappropriately to smooth real output over time. Smoother\noutput would be preferred to more volatile output by the\nhouseholds in the model, and thus the model provides a\ntheory of monetary stabilization policy.\nBut now let us look at in ation in response to the policy\nchange. It falls in response to the policy change, very little\nat rst, but more substantially as the zero interest rate\npolicy continues. After about 2.5 years (10 quarters), at the\nfar right of the chart, the transitory effects of the policy\nchange have nearly completely died out. The real output\ngap is zero, the policy rate remains at zero, and the in ation\nrate has fallen to zero. This can be interpreted as a neoFisherian result: The policy rate is lowered, and after some\ntransitory dynamics, the in ation rate falls to be consistent\nwith the new interest rate peg.\n\nFigure 1. The policy rate falls 200 basis points. Adapted\nfrom Cochrane (2015).\nIt is clear from Figure 1 that, should the policymaker simply\nelect to keep the nominal interest rate at zero for a much\nlonger time, nothing further would happen in this economy.\nThe black, red and green lines would simply remain at zero.\nCochrane's (2015) analysis, as I have translated it into\nFigure 1, yields a very different interpretation of current\nevents compared to conventional wisdom. Conventional\ndescriptions of current monetary policy, including my own\ndescription earlier in this very speech, suggest that the\nCommittee's ZIRP is putting upward pressure on in ation,\nperhaps dangerously so. Figure 1 suggests otherwise.\nWhat's going on? The model does have a Phillips curve in\nthat today's in ation rate does depend in part on today's\nreal output gap. When the policy rate is lowered, the output\n\n\fgap is higher than it otherwise would have been, and this\ndoes put upward pressure on in ation in the model.5\nHowever, the model also has a Fisher relation, which\nmeans that as the real output gap returns to normal (that\nis, monetary neutrality asserts itself), the in ation rate will\nhave to fall to be consistent with the new level of the\nnominal interest rate. Another aspect is that the\npolicymaker is viewed as choosing the interest rate\nsequence, and in ation follows as dictated by the Fisher\nequation. The policymaker cannot set the nominal interest\nrate and the in ation target in an inconsistent way.\nA few of you may be aware of a closely related analysis by\nBenhabib, Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2001) that I have\nchampioned in discussing dimensions of monetary policy\nsince 2007-2009.6 In that analysis the Fisher relation also\nplays a prominent role, but the analysis is nonlinear and\nglobal. Benhabib et al. (2001) nd two steady states, one\nof which is associated with a low nominal interest rate and\nin ation below target. Arguments in this context then\ncenter around which of the two steady states is the stable\none in a reasonable expectation dynamic (\"learning\"). Often\nthe argument is that the traditional steady state is the\nstable one and therefore the one worthy of the most\nattention from policymakers.7 The Cochrane (2015)\nanalysis is of a linear system, and consequently ideas\nabout \"getting stuck at the wrong steady state\" are not\nnearly as clear. Rational expectations prevail at all times.8\nTo illustrate that policymakers can reverse their actions in\nthe Cochrane (2015) model, Figure 2 illustrates an\nalternative policy experiment. This experiment is almost\nthe same as the one described in Figure 1, except that the\npolicymaker chooses the nominal policy rate sequence to\nremain at zero for seven years before gradually raising the\npolicy rate back to 2 percent.\n\nFigure 2. A gradual policy rate increase. Adapted from\nCochrane (2015).\nThe left hand side of Figure 2 simply repeats what is in\nFigure 1. The middle portion of Figure 2 shows how the\ncase where the policy rate remains near zero simply keeps\nthe in ation rate low and the output gap steady as the\neffects of the rst policy move wear off. The gradual policy\n\n\frate increase is shown in the right hand portion of Figure 2\nvia the green triangles. This policy move is portrayed as\nbeing anticipated here, so in ation and the output gap\nbegin to react before the actual date of liftoff. The rising\nrate environment puts downward pressure on the output\ngap, reversing the effects of the previous policy rate move.\nAs before, in ation moves in tandem with the policy rate as\nthe Fisher equation asserts itself.\nIs this what will actually happen in the U.S. economy?\nDe nitely not, since we are looking here at pure policy\neffects with no other shocks added to the model. At best,\nFigures 1 and 2 can illustrate the directions that monetary\npolicy can be expected to push in this particular model, but\na more realistic analysis would include additional shocks,\nand monetary policy would have to react appropriately to\nthose changes in macroeconomic conditions. Still, the key\npoint is that this canonical model has a clear interpretation\nin neo-Fisherian terms, and that this interpretation is hardly\nsurprising, since the Fisher equation is built into the model.\nI have spent a lot of my time with these particular gures\nbecause I think they are interesting and can communicate\nto a wide audience in the monetary policymaking\ncommunity. But I do want to stress that the New Keynesian\nmodel is just one model in a sea of possibilities. In\naddition, it is a model that was designed to describe the\nrelatively good monetary policy in the U.S. from 1984-2007,\nwithout features that turned out to be quite important\nduring the 2007-2009 crisis and its aftermath. While I do\nnot have time to emphasize other more novel work here, let\nme just say that there is important recent work in monetary\ntheory and policy that has tried to explain very low real\nrates of return on safe assets along with the implications\nfor monetary policy. Andolfatto and Williamson (2015), for\ninstance, think of all consolidated government debt as\nhaving value in conducting transactions. Their model has a\nliquidity premium on government debt under some\ncircumstances, and offers novel interpretations of current\npolicy dilemmas. Caballero and Farhi (2015) similarly study\nsafe asset shortages and suggest important ways that our\nunderstanding of the effectiveness of various policies at\nthe zero lower bound would be affected. These are just\nsome examples of interesting work going on outside the\nrelatively narrow New Keynesian framework to try to come\nto terms with the reality of the post-crisis macroeconomy.\nEmpirical Evidence\nFigures 1 and 2 suggest that low nominal interest rates and\nlow in ation may go hand-in-hand, at least over relatively\nlong horizons in which the policy rate is kept at a constant\nlevel. Over shorter horizons with more policy moves and\nmore shocks, the correlation may not be very high. Policy\nrates have generally been very low, near zero, continuously\nin the G-7 economies since the 2007-2009 period.\nConsequently, we may be able to look at the data since\n\n\f2009 to see to what extent neo-Fisherian effects are\nexerting themselves in the G-7.9\nTo get at this issue in just one picture, Figure 3 shows the\ncentered ve-quarter moving average of the G-7 headline\nin ation rate and the average, GDP-weighted, G-7 nominal\npolicy rate since 2002.\n\nFigure 3. G-7 countries' aggregated in ation and policy\nrates. Source: OECD's Main Economic Indicators and\nauthor's calculations. Last observation: September 2015.\nIn Figure 3, the in ation rate is the solid line on the right\nhand scale, and the GDP-weighted nominal policy rate is\nthe dotted line on the left hand scale. The horizontal green\nline is an in ation rate of 2 percent, and the horizontal\nblack line is an in ation rate of negative 1 percent. The\nvertical line in the middle of Figure 3 marks the LehmanAIG event. On the left part of Figure 3, interest rates and\nin ation arguably behaved according to traditional\ninterpretations of New Keynesian theory. On the right half\nof Figure 3, the nominal policy rate falls to near zero and\nremains there. In ation initially falls across the G-7, but\nthen impressively returns close to target. In fact, in ation\nwas above target as of the beginning of 2012, about 2.5\nyears after the end of the recession in the U.S. Since then,\nhowever, policy rates have remained near zero and in ation\nhas drifted down, to the point where G-7 in ation is around\nzero today.\nConventional wisdom would have suggested that the zero\npolicy rates in the G-7 were putting upward pressure on\nin ation during the nearly four years since January 2012,\nbut instead, in ation fell. This could be viewed as\nconsistent with neo-Fisherian effects asserting\nthemselves. Of course, we have to be cautious about\ncarrying such an explanation too far. There have been\nmany other shocks during the past four years, notably a\nvery large oil price shock beginning in the summer of 2014.\nConsequences\nLet us suppose for the sake of argument that the G-7\neconomies will spend still more time at or near the zero\n\n\flower bound. This would occur because either liftoff does\nnot materialize in most or all countries or because\nadditional negative shocks drive those countries that do\nraise their policy rates back to the zero lower bound.\nPrudent policymaking suggests that we should at least\nentertain this as a realistic possibility for the path of G-7\nmonetary policy in the coming years. What are the\nconsequences of remaining in such a state for a long\nperiod of time?10\nI can think of six consequences, based on the discussion in\nthe earlier part of this speech:\nFirst, consider the near-zero policy rate path illustrated on\nthe right hand side of Figure 1. In this situation, promising\nto keep the nominal interest rate sequence at the zero\nlower bound simply reinforces the equilibrium and does not\nprovide accommodation as in the traditional New\nKeynesian equilibrium. Nothing happens in response to\nsuch promises. Policymakers would have to come to grips\nwith such a situation.\nSecond, in such a situation, in ation remains persistently\nbelow the stated in ation target. The near-zero policy rate\nis not putting upward pressure on in ation, but is instead\nthrough the Fisher equation dictating a rate of in ation\nlower than the original target. It could be that policymakers\ndo not intend to return to the original equilibrium—that is,\nthey may intend to remain with the near-zero policy rate. In\nthat case, policymakers may wish to lower the in ation\ntarget to remain more consistent with the actual in ation\noutcomes.\nThird, longer-run economic growth would still be driven by\nhuman capital accumulation and technological progress,\nas always, but without the accompanying stabilization\npolicy as conventionally practiced from 1984-2007. In\nprinciple, the economy would still be expected to grow at a\npace dictated by fundamentals.11\nFourth, the celebrated Friedman rule would arguably be\nachieved, so that household and business cash needs are\nsatiated. In many monetary models this is a desirable state\nof affairs.\nFifth, the risk of asset price uctuations may be high. In the\nNew Keynesian model, the near-zero interest rate policy\nwith little or no response to incoming shocks is associated\nwith equilibrium indeterminacy. This means there are many\npossible equilibria, all of which are consistent with rational\nexpectations and market clearing. In a nutshell, a lot of\nthings can happen. Many of the possible equilibria are\nexceptionally volatile. One could interpret this theoretical\nsituation as consistent with the idea that excessive asset\nprice volatility is a risk.\nSixth, and nally, the limits on operating monetary policy\nthrough ordinary short-term nominal interest rate\n\n\fadjustment in this situation would surely continue to re a\nsearch for alternative ways to conduct monetary\nstabilization policy. The favored approach during the past\nve years within the G-7 economies has been quantitative\neasing, and there would surely be pressure to use this or\nrelated tools.12\nConclusion\nDuring 2015, I have been an advocate of beginning to\nnormalize the policy rate in the U.S. My arguments have\nfocused on the idea that the U.S. economy is quite close to\nnormal today based on an unemployment rate of 5 percent,\nwhich is essentially at the Committee's estimate of the\nlong-run rate, and in ation net of the 2014 oil price shock\nonly slightly below the Committee's target. The\nCommittee's policy settings, in contrast, remain as extreme\nas they have ever been since the 2007-2009 crisis. The\npolicy rate remains near zero, and the Fed's balance sheet\nis more than $3.5 trillion larger than it was before the\ncrisis. Prudence alone suggests that, since the goals of\npolicy have been met, we should be edging the policy rate\nand the balance sheet back toward more normal settings.\nImplicit in my argument has been a yearning to return to\nthe monetary equilibrium of 1984-2007, which is one\naround which a great deal of theory and empirical work has\nbeen done. We would be returning to a world in which\nmonetary policy is better understood, the effects of\npolicies are more closely calibrated, and private sector\nexpectations can move and adapt to ordinary adjustments\nof the policy rate.\nMy current policy views have not changed. But in the spirit\nof the conference, I have tried to contribute to the topic of\n\"Rethinking Monetary Policy\" by focusing on a situation\nwhere the nominal policy rate and the in ation rate remain\nlow, either because liftoff does not materialize or because\nfuture negative shocks to the economy force a return to the\nzero interest rate policy. I have illustrated by reference to\nrelatively new research how such a situation could become\npermanent. In addition, I have suggested several\nconsequences of remaining at such an equilibrium over the\nlong term. It is my hope that my characterizations here will\nspur further thinking and research on these important\ntopics.\nEndnotes\n1\n\nThe views expressed here are my own and do not\n\nnecessarily re ect the views of others on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee.

            "content": "Welcoming Remarks by James Bullard, President and CEO\nThe 2016 Homer Jones Memorial Lecture\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nApril 6, 2016\nWelcome to the Homer Jones Memorial Lecture.\nThe opening of the major league baseball season is an opportunity for fans to view with wide\nwonder the possibilities of future glory. Yet, the splendor of opening day notwithstanding, we\nall know in our hearts that for some teams, a pessimistic outlook will likely provide a better\nmatch to actual results. The hard reality of error-prone fielders, poor hitting and down-themiddle pitching can add up to a lot of losses before the All-Star break, leading fans of some\nteams to sigh and say, “Wait until next year.”\nIn many ways, “Wait until next year” has been a motto for the U.S. economy since the financial\ncrisis of 2007-09. Professional forecasters, monetary and fiscal policymakers, as well as Wall\nStreet analysts and traders, have been predicting each year since then a return to halcyon days\nin the U.S., only to be disappointed by the time the All-Star break rolls around. Although labor\nmarkets have shown dramatic improvement, U.S. real economic growth has remained\nstubbornly low. Many economists have lowered their assessment of the longer-term real GDP\ngrowth rate in the U.S. to 2 percent or less, as opposed to the 3 percent or more that might\nonce have been expected for the world’s largest economy.\nWhat is it that has caused this relative losing streak? Is it something that can be fixed with a\nnew power hitter, perhaps, or a left-handed relief pitcher who can get timely outs in the late\ninnings of a game? Or is it, like the Chicago Cubs, a situation that requires a total revamp of the\nentire approach to the game?\nToday’s speaker will likely offer some thoughts on this matter.\nThis is the 27th Homer Jones Memorial Lecture. This lecture series, which began in 1986 shortly\nafter Homer’s death, honors the contributions and legacy of a former Research director at the\nSt. Louis Fed. The series, much like the vaunted St. Louis-based Energizer Bunny, has persisted,\nin large part because of the past support of many organizations and people—several of whom\nare in this audience or who represent some of the institutions that were vital in the lecture\nseries’ long run. These include the St. Louis Gateway Chapter of the National Association for\nBusiness Economics, Saint Louis University, Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville, the\n\n\fUniversity of Missouri at St. Louis and Washington University in St. Louis.\nHomer Jones is often described as “Milton Friedman’s teacher.” Jones taught Friedman when\nFriedman was an undergraduate at Rutgers University in the early 1930s. Jones had gone to\nRutgers after studying at the University of Chicago, where he was a student of legendary\nChicago professor Frank Knight. Friedman wasn’t the only person at Rutgers during Homer’s\ntime there to go on to become a well-known economist—the Rutgers economics faculty also\nincluded future Fed Chairman Arthur Burns. 1\nAccording to Friedman, Jones was one of the primary influences in Friedman’s choice to study\neconomics, as opposed to mathematics or statistics. In Friedman’s 1976 reminiscence, he says\nJones opened his eyes “to the broader reaches of economics and to the beauties and intricacies\nof economic theory.” 2 They remained lifelong friends, eventually teaming up to oppose the high\ninflation monetary policy of the Burns era.\nIn 1958, Homer Jones joined the St. Louis Fed. He is remembered for many contributions to the\nBank, but his role in the Bank’s development as a leader in monetary research and statistics\nstands out. Jones was a pioneer, perhaps the pioneer, within the Fed in developing the concept\nof independent research departments at the Reserve banks. This development, which\nsubsequently spread across the Federal Reserve System, has been invaluable to the Fed over\nthe years. The Fed’s ability to absorb and be open to multiple viewpoints helps prevent\ngroupthink and leads to superior monetary policy and ultimately to better macroeconomic\nperformance.\nToday, the St. Louis Fed is a leader in the public dissemination of economic data. Many of my\ncurrent and previous colleagues, building upon the legacy of Homer Jones, have designed and\nintroduced Bank products like FRED, mobile FRED, ALFRED, GeoFRED, CASSIDI, FRASER and\nIDEAS. Underlying all of these products is the core belief that underpinned Homer’s initial\ninnovative efforts: to keep the public better informed about its central bank and the U.S.\neconomy, and to provide accurate, timely data for economic researchers. Like Homer, we are\nalways striving to innovate—so stay tuned for some future St. Louis Fed acronym!\nThis year’s speaker is Lawrence H. Summers.\nSome of you may have heard of him!\nDr. Summers is the Charles W. Eliot University Professor and President Emeritus at Harvard\nUniversity. He served as the 71st Secretary of the United States Treasury for President Clinton\nand the Director of the National Economic Council for President Obama. Currently, Dr.\n1\n\nSee Friedman, Milton. “Homer Jones: A Personal Reminiscence.” Journal of Monetary Economics, November\n1976, 2(4), pp. 433-6.\n2\nFriedman (1976).\n\n\fSummers directs Harvard University’s Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government.\nDr. Summers was the first social scientist to receive the National Science Foundation’s Alan\nWaterman Award for scientific achievement. In 1993, he was awarded the John Bates Clark\nMedal, which is given to the most outstanding economist under 40 in the United States. He was\nelected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2002. He has published more than 150 papers in\nscholarly journals and maintains an active presence as a public intellectual.\nPlease join me in welcoming Dr. Larry Summers.\n\n\f",

The\ntraditional approach assumes all central banks follow\n“good” policy, de ned as obeying the Taylor principle. In the\nalternative view, some countries do not follow the Taylor\nprinciple and, therefore, have “bad” policy. The rst\napproach leads, in theory, to a unique worldwide\nequilibrium; the second approach leads to multiple\nequilibria with potentially more volatility in global nancial\nmarkets. The choice of which way to look at this question\nthese days, in a post-crisis world, may come down to a\njudgment of whether U.S. and foreign policymakers are still\nfollowing “good” policy rules as they were, in theory, before\nthe nancial crisis.

In my speech tonight, I plan to\ndiscuss this changed characterization in somewhat more\ndetail.\nThe St. Louis Fed had been using an older narrative since\nthe nancial crisis ended. That narrative has now likely\noutlived its usefulness, and so it is being replaced by a new\nnarrative. The hallmark of the new narrative is to think of\nmedium- and longer-term macroeconomic outcomes in\nterms of regimes. In this new narrative, the concept of a\nsingle, long-run steady state to which the economy is\nconverging is abandoned, and is replaced by a set of\npossible regimes that the economy may visit. Regimes are\ngenerally viewed as persistent, and optimal monetary\npolicy is viewed as regime dependent. Switches between\nregimes are viewed as not forecastable.\nThe upshot is that the new approach delivers a very simple\nforecast of U.S. macroeconomic outcomes over the next\ntwo and a half years. Over this horizon, the forecast is for\nreal output growth of 2 percent, an unemployment rate of\n4.7 percent, and trimmed-mean personal consumption\nexpenditures (PCE) in ation2 of 2 percent. In light of this\nnew approach and the associated forecast, the appropriate\nregime-dependent policy rate path is 63 basis points over\nthe forecast horizon.3\n\n\fI will explain how and why the St. Louis Fed has come to\nthis new approach, as well as the key fundamentals of our\nnew view. Later, I will describe how the essentially at\ncharacterization of the recommended policy rate path\ncould be upset by switches in fundamental factors in the\nfuture.\nBefore I delve further into this new narrative, I would like to\ngive you some background on the slow and steady\nevolution of my thinking since last December.\nAs you may recall, I was an advocate of a policy rate\nincrease in December 2015. However, with the nancial\nmarket turmoil that prevailed early in 2016, it appeared that\nmarkets perhaps took our 25-basis-point move as much\nlarger than we intended—essentially as a 25-basis-point\nmove plus another 100 basis points for 2016, as suggested\nby the Summary of Economic Projections. When some of\nthe data in the U.S. came in a little weaker in early 2016, I\nstarted to think that perhaps the liftoff had a larger effect\nthan we thought. This spring, data came in a little stronger,\nopening us to the possibility of a June or July move.\nHowever, as I re ected on the general trend in the data—in\nparticular, the slowdown in real output growth over the last\nyear—it became clear to me that we could no longer count\non the usual cyclical dynamics. It no longer made sense to\nsubmit a forecast of output growing above trend,\nunemployment continuing to decline, in ation rising above\ntarget, and the policy rate increasing at a fairly steep pace.\nWe needed to rethink our approach to forecasting.\n\nWhy now?\nNow is a good time to consider a regime-based conception\nof medium- and longer-term macroeconomic outcomes for\nthe U.S. Key macroeconomic variables including real\noutput growth, the unemployment rate, and in ation appear\nto be at or near values that are likely to persist over the\nforecast horizon. Any further cyclical adjustment is likely to\nbe relatively minor. Therefore, I think of the current values\nfor those key variables as being close to the mean\noutcome of the “current regime.”\nOf course, the situation can and will change in the future,\nbut exactly how and when is di cult to predict. Therefore,\nthe best that we can do today is to forecast that the current\nregime will persist and set policy appropriately for this\nregime. If there is a switch to a new regime in the future,\nthen that will likely affect all variables—including the policy\nrate—but such a switch is not forecastable.\nConsistent with the regime-based concept, the new\napproach does not contain projected long-run values for\nmacroeconomic variables or for the policy rate. That is, the\nforecast simply stops at two and a half years.\nI do not think of the current regime as pessimistic. Output\ngrows at the trend pace of 2 percent, but the\n\n\funemployment rate remains quite low, and in ation\nremains at 2 percent. In addition, as I will describe below,\noutput growth could improve if productivity growth\nimproves.\n\nThe previous narrative\nThe St. Louis Fed’s previous narrative emphasized eventual\nconvergence to a single, long-run steady state. In that\nnarrative, in the medium term, the output growth rate was\nconsistently forecast to be above trend and the\nunemployment rate was forecast to decline. In ation (net\nof commodity-price effects) was forecast to return to and\nthen exceed 2 percent over the medium term. The policy\nrate was forecast to eventually rise in order to be\nconsistent with the single, long-run steady state.\nSome aspects of this previous narrative worked well. From\nthe third quarter of 2013 through the second quarter of\n2015, a period of two years, the average quarterly real GDP\ngrowth rate was 2.7 percent, well above our estimate of a\ntrend rate of 2 percent. The unemployment rate declined\nfrom 7.3 percent in July 2013 to 5.3 percent as of July\n2015. In ation, however, barely moved. The trimmed-mean\nPCE in ation rate was 1.56 percent in July 2013 and had\nonly increased to 1.64 percent as of July 2015.\nIn the last year, the usefulness of this narrative may have\ncome to an end. The average quarterly real GDP growth\nrate from the third quarter of 2015 through the present\nquarter (using a tracking estimate for the second quarter\nof 20164) is about 1.7 percent, somewhat below our\nestimate of trend. The unemployment rate is currently at\n4.7 percent. It may not fall much further, considering that\nduring the last expansion, the average unemployment rate\nfrom January 2006 to December 2007 was about 4.6\npercent. Trimmed-mean in ation, at 1.84 percent, is now\ncloser to 2 percent but has not been rising rapidly.\nOn balance, real output growth, the unemployment rate,\nand in ation may be at or near mean values that could be\nsustained over the forecast horizon provided there are no\nmajor shocks to the economy. We seek to describe this\nsituation in the new narrative we are adopting.\nFigures 1, 2, and 3 summarize the data on output growth,\nunemployment, and in ation along with the new St. Louis\nFed projections that assume the U.S. economy will remain\nin the current regime. (all gures are below)\n\nMultiple productivity regimes\nWith our new narrative, we are backing off the idea that we\nhave dogmatic certainty about where the U.S. economy is\nheaded in the medium and longer run. We are trying to\nreplace that certainty with a manageable expression of the\nuncertainty surrounding medium- and longer-run\noutcomes. By doing so, we hope to provide a better\n\n\fdescription of the nature of the data dependence of\nmonetary policy going forward.\nFundamental factors determine the nature of the regimes\nin play. One important fundamental is productivity growth.\nThe productivity growth rate has been low on average at\nleast since 2011. We think of this as a low productivity\ngrowth regime. We know from past observation of the U.S.\neconomy that productivity could switch to a higher-growth\nregime. If such a switch occurred, it might have important\neffects on many variables, but especially on output growth,\nwhich would be higher.\nBecause we view the low productivity growth regime as\nvery persistent, for the purpose of forecasting we simply\nassume we will remain in the low productivity growth\nregime (and hence the low output growth regime) through\nthe forecast horizon. The idea that productivity may switch\nto a high-growth regime is not incorporated in the forecast\ndirectly, but it is an upside risk to the forecast. The switch\nto the high-growth regime is viewed as possible, but not\nforecastable.\nFigure 4 shows the recent data on productivity in the U.S.\nHowever, simply having high and low productivity growth\nregimes is insu cient to describe the current\nmacroeconomic situation. There are at least two other\nfundamental factors that have to remain in their current\nstate in order to maintain the status quo. We now turn to\ndescribing these.\n\nMultiple real rate regimes\nOne important fundamental is the real rate of return on\nshort-term government debt. This is very low today by\nrecent historical standards, perhaps less than -1 percent. In\nour framework, we view this as a low real rate regime. The\nalternative regime, which has been observed historically, is\nfor a considerably higher value of this rate. Again, we view\nthe current low real rate regime as very persistent, and so\nfor the purpose of forecasting, we simply assume we will\nremain in the low real rate regime through the forecast\nhorizon. A switch to the higher real rate regime is possible,\nand if it occurred would likely affect many variables in the\nsystem, including the appropriate policy rate. The\npossibility of such a switch does not enter directly in the\nforecast; instead, it is a risk to the forecast.\nWhile the real return to short-term government debt is low\ntoday, the real return to capital does not appear to have\ndeclined meaningfully.5 For this reason we prefer to\ninterpret the low real rate of return on short-term\ngovernment debt not as re ecting low real returns\nthroughout the economy (as in a simple New Keynesian\nmodel), but instead as re ecting an abnormally large\nliquidity premium on government debt.6 It is this liquidity\npremium which is the fundamental factor. We sometimes\n\n\frefer to this conception of the low value of the real return\non short-term government debt as r† (“r-dagger”) to\ndistinguish it from the more commonly discussed r* (“rstar”).7\nFigure 5 shows the recent data on ex-post real returns on\nshort-term (i.e., one year) U.S. government debt. This\ncalculation can be viewed as a way to smooth out readings\non real returns over the last several years.\n\nThe state of the business cycle\nAnother important fundamental is the possibility of\nrecession, perhaps driven in part by a collapse in asset\nprices (as occurred for housing prices during 2006-2009)\nor other factors. We are currently in a no-recession state,\nbut it is possible that we could switch to a recession state.\nIf such a switch occurred, all variables would be affected,\nbut most notably, the unemployment rate would rise\nsubstantially. Again, the possibility of such a switch does\nnot enter directly into the forecast because we have no\nreason to forecast a recession given the data available\ntoday. The possibility of recession is instead a risk to the\nforecast.8\nFigure 6 shows that the current recession probability is\nabout 3 percent from a published empirical model.9\n\nThe policy rate path\nI have described a very basic set of fundamental factors as\nfollowing regime-switching stochastic processes. The\ncurrent con guration is: (a) low growth, (b) low real rate,\nand (c) no recession. Conditional on this con guration, our\nforecast is for real output growth of 2 percent, an\nunemployment rate of 4.7 percent, and trimmed-mean\nin ation of 2 percent over the two and a half year forecast\nhorizon.\nThe associated recommended policy rate path supporting\nthis outcome is regime dependent. I have already argued\nthat the unemployment and in ation gaps are essentially\nzero. The value of 63 basis points for the policy rate could\ntherefore be viewed in terms of a Taylor-type policy rule in\nwhich the gaps terms are zero. The Taylor-type rule would\nthen collapse to a Fisher equation. Let’s consider a oneyear Fisher equation with expected in ation at 2 percent.\nThe value of the real rate in the low real-return regime on\nshort-term government debt, r†, would have to be the value\nthat would solve this equation. This value is -137 basis\npoints. This is very close to, and hence consistent with, the\nvalue of r† described in Figure 5 (-142 basis points).\nFigure 7 shows the projected regime-dependent policy rate\npath through the end of 2018.\n\nRisks to the forecast\n\n\fThere are risks to this forecast in the sense that any of\nthese fundamental factors could switch to alternative\nvalues, thus knocking the system out of the current regime.\nPolicy would then have to react.\nThere are other risks to this projection that do not neatly t\ninto the description I have outlined.\nOne key risk not expressed in the regime-switching part of\nthe description is on in ation. I have described a situation\nin which Phillips curve effects on in ation are negligible.\nLow unemployment and generally strong labor markets,\ndespite being in place throughout the forecast horizon, do\nnot put upward pressure on in ation in the forecast I have\ndescribed. It could be that meaningful Phillips curve\neffects return and drive in ation higher even though\nnothing else about the situation as I describe it has\nchanged.\nA second key risk is that this projection says little about\nincoming data on in ation expectations, which according\nto market-based measures seem to be too low to be\nconsistent with the forecast I am describing.\nA third key risk is that the approach presented here says\nlittle about asset price bubbles, a factor that often enters\nthe actual policy discussion.\n\nA schematic diagram\nFigure 8 provides a schematic diagram of the new\nnarrative. We can start on the left side of the diagram with\nthe question, “What is a reasonable forecast for real output\ngrowth, the unemployment rate, and in ation over the next\ntwo and a half years?” First, we have no reason based on\ncurrent data to forecast a recession, so we adopt a “norecession” baseline scenario. Next, we assume that the\nvery large liquidity premium on short-term government\ndebt will remain in place over the forecast horizon, the low\nr† regime. Moving further to the right, we assume that the\nlow-productivity regime will remain in place over the\nforecast horizon. These considerations lead to the baseline\nforecast at the right on the diagram. As I have explained,\nwe recognize that regimes could switch, and this is the\narea labelled “upside risk” in the diagram. Policy is regime\ndependent—it is set to be consistent with the current\nregime.\n\nConclusion\nThe forecast values for output growth, in ation, and the\nunemployment rate in the new St. Louis Fed forecast are\nonly somewhat different from those given under the\nprevious narrative. The main difference in the new\napproach is in the characterization of recommended future\nmonetary policy via the projected policy rate. In the\nprevious narrative, we had a medium- and long-run\noutcome for the economy expressed in terms of a single,\nlong-run steady state. In that formulation, all variables\n\n\ftrended toward values that were consistent with the\nassumed long-run outcome. This includes the policy rate,\nwhich trended toward a value 350 basis points higher than\nit is today. If the Federal Open Market Committee moved at\na pace of 25 basis points per year, it would take 14 years to\nreach such a value.\nIn the new narrative, uncertainty about possible mediumand longer-run outcomes is more explicitly taken into\naccount. The economy does not necessarily converge to a\nsingle steady state, but instead may visit many possible\nregimes. Regimes can be persistent, as we think the\ncurrent one may be. The timing of a switch to an\nalternative regime is viewed as not forecastable, and so we\nsimply forecast that the current regime will persist. Policy\nis regime dependent, leading to a recommended policy rate\npath which is essentially at over the forecast horizon. Of\ncourse, the at policy rate characterization is conditional\non no switches occurring—if a switch does occur, then the\npolicy rate would have to change appropriately. This is a\nform of data dependence.\nI have described some of the risks to this forecast, and\ntaking these risks into account I think that, on balance, the\npolicy rate path may be somewhat higher than the one we\nare forecasting over the next two and a half years. In this\nsense I think there is some upside risk to our forecast.\nNevertheless, by describing the expected policy path as\nessentially at with some upside risk—and with no\npresumption about a long-run outcome—I hope I can\nprovide a better description of my view of the current policy\nsituation in this narrative as opposed to the previous\nformulation.\nEndnotes\n1\n\nThis speech is based on a paper that was released June\n\n17, 2016.

            "content": "Welcoming Remarks by James Bullard, President and CEO\nFourth Annual Community Banking in the 21st Century Research and Policy Conference\nThe Federal Reserve System and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS)\nSt. Louis, Mo.\nSept. 28, 2016\nGood morning, and welcome to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The St. Louis Fed is again\nproud to serve as the host site for the Community Banking in the 21st Century research and\npolicy conference. This year marks the fourth consecutive year of the conference and the\nfourth time the Federal Reserve has partnered with the Conference of State Bank Supervisors\non these proceedings.\nWhen the Federal Reserve and the CSBS first began this endeavor, our primary goal was to\nidentify and bring forward the latest research on community banking from a cross section of\nacademic institutions and regulatory agencies. I think we have been successful in meeting that\ngoal. By the conclusion of this year’s conference, we will have presented nearly 50 papers, with\nmore than twice as many papers submitted as accepted. These papers have addressed a range\nof issues of importance to community banks, to regulators and to policymakers. This\nconference has given us a forum to discuss the findings and debate the policy\nrecommendations.\nOne theme consistent throughout these conferences is something I hear during my discussions\nwith bankers across the Federal Reserve’s Eighth District: A strong banking system supports\nstrong communities and ultimately leads to a strong economy. Or, said more simply:\nStrong banks. Strong communities. Strong economy.\nThe 10 papers in this year’s conference—through their analysis of the community bank business\nmodel, their exploration of the relationship between community bank size and performance,\nand their assessment of the regulatory issues facing community banks—all ultimately support\nthis core idea.\nFor example, this year we’ll hear about the changing composition of minority depository\ninstitutions within communities they serve; another paper offers us a model for thinking about\nhow commercial and agricultural lending by community banks impacts state-level employment\n\n\fand gross state product; and another paper provides evidence that community bank use of\n“soft information” is an acceptable substitute for “hard information” (such as credit scores) for\nloan types where the bank has developed an expertise.\nIn addition to the excellent academic research, the effort on the part of the state banking\ncommissioners to administer a national survey of community banks is proving its value. For\nexample, last year’s survey was cited by the U.S. Government Accountability Office in a report it\nreleased last December on the impact of Dodd-Frank regulations on community banks and\nother financial institutions. The survey was also cited by the White House Council of Economic\nAdvisers in a brief on community bank performance released last month. Further, the survey\nand survey data have been requested by several academic institutions, and I was pleased to see\nthat the data from the 2015 survey was even used in a paper that will be presented during the\nsecond research session of this year’s conference.\nAlthough you’ll have to wait until tomorrow to see the results from the 2016 survey, what you’ll\nlearn is that the findings in the survey and the anecdotal information gathered by the state\nbanking commissioners to supplement and amplify the data will come back to that same core\nprinciple I mentioned earlier:\nStrong banks. Strong communities. Strong economy.\nThere are two other additions to this conference that I’d like to mention before turning the\nconference over to the researchers, the moderator and the community bank discussant in our\nfirst research session.\nThe first is the Community Bank Case Study competition that our partners, the Conference of\nState Bank Supervisors, piloted last year and conducted nationally this year. Encouraging\nstudents at the undergraduate level to develop an understanding and interest in our banking\nsystem, and in community banks specifically, is absolutely essential to the future viability of our\nbanking system. They are our future researchers, policymakers and bankers—the investments\nwe make in them today will pay great dividends.\nAnd I must say, from what I can tell from the winning case study paper prepared by students\nfrom Southeastern Louisiana University and from the incredible personal stories of the students\non the team, the students just might steal the show at this year’s conference. The work of these\nstudents and of all of the students in the competition shows how a single community bank has\nimpacted its community and its region.\n2\n\n\fFinally, I’d like to mention the video montage that you saw when we kicked off the conference\na few moments ago. The montage is comprised of videos from a series titled “Community\nBanking: In Your Community and Beyond Your Community.”\nSince early September, the conference committee has released two of these videos per week in\nthe lead-up to the conference. In the videos, community bankers and state banking\ncommissioners discuss how a single bank can not only motivate a local success, but how that\nsuccess can have impacts well outside the bank’s local community and into the broader\neconomy. In fact, I think Joe Kesler of First Montana Bank in Libby, Montana, who is featured in\none of this year’s videos, put it best when he said:\n“Every day you walk into the bank, you do not know what little loan that you’re making, how it\nmight transform not just that person’s life, but the community and potentially even the nation.”\nI encourage our audience here to develop relationships, too. As Julie mentioned, we\ndeliberately build an audience comprised of researchers, regulators and bankers. I’ve found in\nmy years of attending and sponsoring conferences that some of the best discussions take place\nduring networking breaks, and I understand that some great relationships have already been\nbuilt through these proceedings the past three years.\nI look forward to another great conference this year. I thank you all for joining us either here in\nperson or via our interactive webcast and look forward to seeing how the discussions here can\nhelp foster a stronger banking and regulatory system, leading to stronger communities and\nultimately leading to a stronger economy.\n\n3\n\n\f",

He also discussed the implications of the low\nnatural rate for the Fed’s policy rate and concluded that the\nnatural rate of interest, and hence the appropriate policy\nrate, is low and unlikely to change very much over the\nforecast horizon.\n\nJames Bullard\nPresident and Chief\nExecutive O cer\nBio\nCurriculum Vitae\nStaff Contacts\nIDEAS/RePEc Pro le\nPhotos\nVideos\nSubscribe:\nEmail alerts\nRSS\n\"Rationally, let it be said in a\nwhisper, experience is certainly\nworth more than theory.\"\nAmerigo Vespucci\n\nGENERAL\nHome\nAbout Us\nBank Supervision\nCareers\nCommunity Development\nEconomic Education\n\n\fEvents\nInside the Economy Museum\nNewsroom\nOn the Economy Blog\nOpen Vault Blog\nOUR DISTRICT\nLittle Rock Branch\nLouisville Branch\nMemphis Branch\nAgricultural Finance Monitor\nHousing Market Conditions\nSELECTED PUBLICATIONS\nBridges\nEconomic Synopses\nHousing Market Perspectives\nIn the Balance\nPage One Economics\nThe Quarterly Debt Monitor\nReview\nRegional Economist\nST.

He highlighted the importance of\nadjusting for price differences across MSAs when making\nsuch comparisons. In all, 381 MSAs in the U.S. were\nstudied. Bullard noted that the St. Louis MSA ranked in the\ntop 6 percent of these metro areas. This analysis may lead\nto other research on why some cities are more successful\nthan others, he said. Bullard spoke at the Bi-State\nDevelopment’s annual meeting, in downtown St. Louis.\n*Please note the updated chart on slide 33 and the addition of\nslide 35, “Bottom line on top 10 MSAs,” on Oct. 24, 2017.\n\nBelow is a transcript of Bullard's remarks, in addition to Q&A\nwith the audience. This transcript has been lightly edited for\nclarity. A video of the event is also available.\nJames Bullard: Well, good afternoon, and what a great\naudience here. I'm really looking forward to the remarks\nhere and to challenge this audience and also to a Q&A. I\nwill take Q&A at the end if I can see any of you. These are\nbright lights up here, so I'm not really used to that. So we're\ngoing to need slides up here in order to do this. Here we\nare. Can we go back one? Good. Here we are. I wanted to\nstart with this because, you know, I'm not going to talk\nabout monetary policy here. [Laughter.] The audience\nbreathed a sigh of relief.\nI'm going to talk about something I think you'd be very\ninterested in, which is living standards across U.S.\nmetropolitan statistical areas, and this represents, as I'm\ngoing to outline here, some research and some ideas I've\nbeen thinking about and that I've talked with John about\nover the last year or so. So this is kind of testing out the\nresearch results. I'm anxious to hear what you guys think\nabout it.\n\nJames Bullard\nPresident and Chief\nExecutive O cer\nBio\nCurriculum Vitae\nStaff Contacts\nIDEAS/RePEc Pro le\nPhotos\nVideos\nSubscribe:\nEmail alerts\nRSS\n\"Rationally, let it be said in a\nwhisper, experience is certainly\nworth more than theory.\"\nAmerigo Vespucci\n\n\fSo this is going to draw on some recent research at the St.\nLouis Fed, but it will also be supplemented by additional\nrecent research from outside the Bank. Some of you know\nthat the St. Louis Fed has one of the top economic\nresearch departments in the Federal Reserve and in fact in\nthe world, so we're trying to leverage that to attack this\nparticular issue. For those that want to see recent\ncomments on monetary policy, you can look at my talk at\nTruman State University last week, and also during the Q&A\nI'd be happy to entertain questions about monetary policy if\nyou want to go in that direction.\nThe paper I'm going to talk about is by my colleagues,\nCletus Coughlin, Chuck Gascon and Kevin Kliesen. It is\navailable on our webpage. You can click on it. It's called\n\"Living Standards in St. Louis and the Eighth Federal\nReserve District: Let's Get Real.\" The things I'm going to talk\nabout here in these slides are a little bit more preliminary\nthan the published paper. And so I'm happy to take\ncomments if you have any or you know other people that\nhave comments.\nI want to motivate this by—with the really large literature on\ninternational standards of living that is already out there.\nAnd in that literature we try to address—we economists try\nto address the question of which national economies are\nperforming well and which national economies are\nperforming less well for their citizens. And there's an\nestablished methodology for how to do that, and I'm going\nto copy that methodology.\nAnd, again—you're just talking about whether the citizens\nare well-off in terms of material well-being. You're not\ntrying to get at anything else. It's just sort of pure\neconomics, material well-being. Some countries do very\nwell and are considered rich countries, like the United\nStates. Others do less well, and they're considered\nrelatively poor on the world scale. So we would like to be\nable to make similar statements across metropolitan\nstatistical areas in the U.S.\nSo if you look at this international literature, you'll get a\npicture like this. The vertical axis is some kind of measure\nof real per capita income across countries, and each bar on\nthis represents one country. And the U.S. is called out\nthere. It's on toward the left in this picture, which means it's\na relatively high per capita income. GDP is the same as\nincome. And China and India are relatively low on this.\nAnd so we make statements that say, you know, U.S. is a\nrelatively wealthy country or relatively rich country in terms\nof per capita income. And China and India have lower\nstandards of living because they have lower per capita\nincome. So we want to make exactly these kinds of\nstatements across U.S. metropolitan statistical areas.\nNow, I just want to stress to people that, just because\nyou're the highest, or one of the highest standards of living\n\n\fin the world doesn't mean that we're the fastest-growing.\nIt's well-known in particular China and India are fastergrowing countries, but they have lower standards of living.\nAnd I think it's—you know, it's something where the\nstatistics bear out actual experience. If you go to India, if\nyou go to China, you'll see a very different country than\nwhat you see here, if you travel across the whole country.\nSo let me just talk about MSAs in the U.S. And I think some\nof you probably know this, but we've got the whole set of\nMSAs. An MSA is an area containing a large population\ncenter in adjacent counties with a high degree of\nintegration with that center, as measured by commuting\npatterns. So there's some science behind this about how\nyou do this and how you de ne this. And it provides a\nnatural unit for what we want to talk about here, instead of\narti cial political boundaries, which are, you know, sort of\ndotted lines around certain areas.\nWe want to talk about the economic unit, and I think the\nMSA is designed to do that. And so we're going to do that.\nAnd, certainly, Bi-State Development is all about getting the\nwhole region to work together. About 90 percent of U.S.\nGDP is produced in metropolitan statistical areas. We're\ngoing to look at the whole set here: 381 MSAs in the U.S.,\nabout 86 percent of the U.S. population lived in these\nplaces.\nThe smallest was Carson City, Nev., at 54,000 people.\n50,000 is the cutoff here, so they won't de ne an MSA\nsmaller than that. Largest is New York City, population 20\nmillion. The median population, about 238,000; average\npopulation, 721,000. So this means these big cities are\nreally big compared to the Carson City, Nevadas of the\nworld. So you have a lot of skewness in the size\ndistribution of cities.\nSo what we're going to do, because it's so skewed, is that\nwe're also going to consider just a set of the very largest\nMSAs in the sample, having a population of at least 1\nmillion. For that group, about 56 percent of the population\nlives in that group. There are 53 of these large MSAs. St.\nLouis is one of them. Tucson, Ariz., is the smallest, about 1\nmillion. New York's the largest. Median population for this\nlarge set, 2.3 million; average population, 3.4 million. Those\nnumbers are not too far from the St. Louis area. And so\nthere's skewness even among the large MSAs, but it's not\nas extreme as for the whole set of MSAs. So we're going to\nreport results for both sets.\nAnd here's a picture that I love that our staff did to give you\nan idea about what we're talking about here. Those blue,\ndarker blue, are the 53 large MSAs in the country. And,\nagain, you're talking about half of GDP is in those blue,\ndarker blue blocks. If you add in the lighter blue blocks, you\nget the entire set of MSAs. You've got 90 percent of GDP\nbeing produced in those areas. So this is what we're talking\nabout. And the question as I look at this map, where is the\n\n\f—which of these are performing the best and which are\nperforming less well, based on per capita income?\nNow, a key to this research is the idea of price levels by\nMSA. And those of you that know me and have heard me\ntalk about this know where I'm going on this. Prices vary\ngreatly across the U.S. And, certainly, we all have an\nintuitive sense that some places are wildly expensive and\nother places are very inexpensive.\nAnd the good thing is that, recently, there's been more\nsystematic accounting of this and better data has been\ndeveloped on regional price level differences. And we're\ngoing to use this new data—that's what makes this really\ninteresting to macroeconomic people like me—hey, this is\nsome new data that we can use. But we're going to use this\nnew data to calculate the real income per capita across\nthese MSAs.\nSo these new data are called Regional Price Parities, RPPs.\nThey measure the differences in price levels by MSA,\nacross MSAs, in a given year. So it's annual data. This is\ndone by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. These data\nstarted to be published in 2014. So in the world of\nresearch, that's just like yesterday. They just became\navailable, and so we're starting to use them. They are\navailable back to 2008, but here in this talk I'm mainly just\ngoing to focus on one particular year, the most recent year\nfor which we have complete data, which is 2015.\nThese RPPs are expressed as a percentage of the national\nprice level. So you'll see numbers like 90 or 110. That\nmeans 90 percent of the national price level or 110 percent\nof the national price level. And this covers all consumption\ngoods and services and includes rents, and that's a key\naspect of what I'm talking about here.\nSo a key issue here is, well, why do these prices differ\nacross different parts of the country? If you think of\nsomething like gas stations, I can always go to the next\ngas station and it should be competitive with the last gas\nstation that I was at, and therefore the prices should be just\nabout the same across the cities. But the reason prices\ndiffer is housing costs, and the housing differentials are\nhuge.\nI've got an example here from Zillow data. St. Louis median\nhouse is about 105 bucks per square foot, median home in\nSan Francisco about $479 per square foot. That's a ratio of\nabout ve to one. And I think we know this intuitively, that\nthese housing costs are so substantially different that it\nreally affects your standard of living if you live in different\nplaces around the country.\nSo here's a picture—I've got two pictures like this—this is a\n3D picture from metrocosm.com, and the basic message\nof this picture, yellow and orange means $200 to $500 per\nsquare foot for housing costs. The darker colors are less\n\n\fthan $50 up to $100 or $150 per square foot. And the basic\nidea that you get from this picture is the East Coast—\nBoston, New York, D.C., South Florida—and especially the\nCalifornia coast and Hawaii—are extremely expensive on\nthis measure, the middle part of the country much less\nexpensive. Aspen, Colo., comes up to be the very highest\nhere. I think this is by Zip code, not by MSA. Aspen isn't\nactually that big of a place.\nThis is another picture that shows the same kind of thing,\nthe share of households that can afford payments on the\nmedian-priced single-family home. And dark green means\nthree-quarters of the households could afford to buy the\nmedian house in that particular area. Red means that less\nthan a third of the households could afford to buy even the\nmedian house in that particular area.\nSo you can see in this picture that the West Coast is all red.\nSo that means it's very unaffordable even for most\nhouseholds to buy the median house in that area. I'm not\ntalking about buying the very best house in the area, just\nthe median house in the area, whereas the same can be\nsaid for the East Coast—Boston and New York, Florida—\nand then in the middle west part of the country, we get\nmuch more affordability, and you get things like two-thirds\nor three-quarters of the households can afford to buy the\nmedian house in that area.\nSo this is just another way to say what we already know,\nthat housing costs are very different across the country.\nThis affects your lifestyle. It affects your standard of living\nacross the country. And it shows up in these RPPs, these\nRegional Price Parity numbers, for different parts of the\ncountry.\nSo the least expensive MSA is Beckley, W.Va. It has an RPP\nof about 80 percent, so about 80 percent of the national\nprice level. So it's cheaper to live there. The most expensive\nis Honolulu, 125 percent. And St. Louis is a little over 90\npercent of the national average.\nOK. So we're ready to do our calculation. What is real\nincome per capita across these MSAs? We're going to take\nreal income per capita for each MSA and adjust it based on\nthese regional price levels. And that's going to give us the\nstandard of living as the average level of real income per\nperson for a particular location analogous to the crosscountry literature graph that I showed you at the beginning.\nNow, I don't have median data here. I only have the\naverage. And so this isn't going to take into account\nincome inequality. You might be saying, OK, the MSA\ngenerates a certain amount of income. That's income per\nperson. We're not really saying who's getting the income.\nThat's income inequality. But I'm going to come back with a\nsection later that's going to talk about income inequality,\nincluding for St. Louis. And we'll take a look at that at the\nend.\n\n\fSo the measure of real income is going to be per capita\npersonal income adjusted for in ation, so this is real\npurchasing power. Another possibility would be to look at\nhousehold income, and if you read the paper, they do look\nat household income. I think that's probably a less good\nway to look at it, but if you want to get into that, we can talk\nabout it. And then if we divide by this RPP for that\nparticular MSA, we're going to get this real income per\ncapita, adjusted for regional price differentials. I'm going to\nfocus on 2015 only here.\nSo here's the result for the St. Louis MSA. We had an RPP\nadjusted real personal income per capita that was about\n12 percent higher than the national average. Among the 53\nlargest MSAs, we ranked No. 7 in the nation. Among the\ncomplete set of 381 MSAs, St. Louis ranks about 20, which\nis in the top 6 percent or so. So another way to say this is\nSt. Louis' standard of living is higher than about 94 percent\nof the MSAs in the nation.\nAnother way to say this is, if I randomly reallocated all of\nyou to other MSAs, you're probably going to be worse—and\nyou're the average guy—you're probably going to be worse\noff going to one of those other MSAs than staying here in\nSt. Louis. So this is a good set of numbers for St. Louis\nthat I think highlights how well this region really does and\nbrings into stark relief the high standard of living that exists\nin this part of the country.\nSo, what I'm going to do in the rest of the talk is show\ntables that expand on this result right here and talk about it\nin a variety of ways. So here's the picture analogous to the\ncross-country picture that we looked at at the beginning.\nSo this is our measure of real per capita income. One\nwould mean that you are the same as the national average\nin that particular MSA. Higher than that means you're\nhigher than the national average.\nAnd you can see that this is arranged—MSAs are arranged\nfrom highest to lowest, going from left to right in this\npicture. Each bar represents an MSA. We put St. Louis on\nhere, and we put the three largest MSAs in the country—\nNew York, Chicago and LA—that are all trailing us in\nstandard of living.\nYou can see there's—this is an S-shaped curve, which I\nthink is interesting. Some places do extremely well. The\nvery highest bar there on the far left I believe is Midland,\nTexas, so something about oil boom going on there. And\nthen things gradually trail off, and then some places are\nsubstantially lower in standard of living than the nation as\na whole. But, basically, St. Louis does extremely well on\nthis.\nNow this is the whole set of 381 MSAs. We might also\nwant to look at the very largest MSAs, and here they are. So\nthese are the 53 largest ones. Again, we called out St.\nLouis and then the three largest ones, which are New York,\n\n\fChicago and Los Angeles, which are trailing us. And I'm\ngoing to show you some pictures here in just a minute of\nthe top 10 here, which we are in the top 10.\nNow one thing about this picture and interpreting this, the\nones on the far left there are clearly doing something right,\nbecause they're much higher or substantially higher than\nthe national average. And then when you get to St. Louis,\nwe're at the high end, but the cities behind us are not too\nfar behind us, so you've got a lot of more or less equal\ncities that are—the slope is very—not very steep there. And\nwe're going to look at that also.\nSo, now what I'm going to do is just focus the rest of the\ntime on the top 10 large MSAs—and we're No. 7 in that\ngroup—and just look at who they are. So this is a table that\nshows you how this came out. St. Louis is No. 7. We're\nabout at—1.13 for us means about 13 percent above the\nnational standard of living.\nOur competitors are here in this top 10 list. We've got—the\nBay Area does extremely well here. The tech boom has\nbeen going on for at least 20 years there, and it really\nshows in these numbers. They're No. 1 and 2, really the\nsame place—San Jose, Calif., and San Francisco. Boston\ndoing very well, Seattle also a tech hub. Seattle has\nAmazon and Microsoft. Then you get to Washington, D.C.,\nand the other—the bottom ve in this list out of the top 10.\nAnd they're very close to being equal. So there's not a huge\ndifference between them, but we are in the top 10.\nNow, some of these in this group have a high cost of living\nand some of them have a low cost of living. So one thing\nwe could add to the list is, say, OK, among these that have\na high standard of living, which are the low-cost areas and\nwhich are the high-cost areas? And we're going to do that\nhere. And, as you might have surmised just looking through\nthis list, it's only us and Nashville, Tenn., that have this\nlower cost of living. All the others in this list either have\ncost of living at the national average or considerably higher\nthan the national average in the case of San Jose, Calif.,\nand San Francisco or even Boston or even Seattle or\nWashington, D.C.\nNow, I mean, these might just—you might just think, \"Well,\ngee, Jim, these are just numbers on a table.\" But, you know,\nyou think about what this means. You're talking about 90\npercent here. You're talking about 110 percent in Boston.\nThat's a 20 percent cost differential. You think about 121 in\nSan Francisco or close to that in Washington, D.C. That's a\n30 percent cost differential. So if you're a company and\nyou're producing product here and then shipping it around\nthe country versus producing product in Washington, D.C.,\nor San Francisco and trying to ship it around the country,\nthose other guys have a 30 percent disadvantage in cost\ncompared to St. Louis or Nashville. So those are huge\ndifferences.\n\n\fCould you imagine trying to run your business and your\nopponent has a 30 percent cost advantage on you? You're\ngoing to get killed. So I think this is one of the biggest\nthings about St. Louis and Nashville on this list—Nashville's\ngoing to turn out to be basically identical to St. Louis in\nthese numbers—is that we have tremendous cost\nadvantage over our rivals among the cities that have the\nhighest standard of living in the nation.\nNow, just to keep perspective on what we're talking about\nhere, the international income distribution is a lot more\nunequal than the U.S. income distribution. If you take the\nratio of the 90th percentile to the 10th percentile across\nMSAs, you're going to get a number of 1.37. So what does\nthat mean? That means that the average guy in the kind of\nthe rich city is making about 35 percent, 37 percent more\nthan the average guy in the poor city that's in the 10th\npercentile. So that's a difference of 35-40 percent across\nthat spectrum.\nIf you do the same thing to the international data, you get a\nstunning number of 28. So that means that the guy in the\n90th percentile of the rich countries is making 28 times\nwhat the guy in probably a Sub-Saharan African country is\nmaking. So the international income differentials are so\nstaggering they make your jaw drop. And that remains true\neven if you focus on a more homogeneous set of\ncountries. For instance, just European countries, you do the\n90-10 ratio, you get 3.8. And if you do the OECD countries,\nyou get 2.1.\nSo among—within the international context, that 1.37 is not\na huge number. But when we think about competing across\nMSAs within the USA, 35 percent or 40 percent is a big\nnumber. So you've got to keep everything sort of in\nperspective when you're looking at this here.\nSo, now we're going to go to the income inequality idea\nwithin MSAs. Obviously, we're just averaging across all the\npeople in the St. Louis MSA. Some are doing well. Some\naren't doing very well. We'd like to be able to account for\nthat and get the idea of how much income inequality is\nthere within these different MSAs. The data that I'm looking\nat does not account for the distribution of income. So I'm\ngoing to have to go to a different paper, and it's going to be\nthe paper that's cited here by three authors that I don't\nknow very well. But we're going to use their research. They\nhave studied the issue of income inequality across MSAs.\nIt turns out that St. Louis is kind of average in terms of\nincome inequality and some of our rivals on the top 10 list\nhave very high income inequality, and we're going to look at\nthat here. So here's the picture. This isn't per capita income\nanymore. This is a measure of income inequality, and the\nMSAs are along the horizontal as we had before, and the\nmeasure of inequality is on the vertical axis.\n\n\fAnd the measure of inequality is the ratio of the average\nincome of the guy in the top 1 percent versus the average\nincome of the guy in the bottom 99 percent. And if you look\nat that ratio for New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, which are\nlisted there, those numbers are all higher. St. Louis is down\nthe list. I wouldn't say it's exactly low, but it's close to the\nmiddle of the distribution here as you go off to the right in\nthis picture. You've got the one with the highest—the MSA\nwith the highest inequality is Bridgeport, Conn. I don't know\ntoo much about that MSA, but the kind of rumor would be a\nlot of hedge fund type people like to live in Bridgeport, and\nit probably has also a poorer segment of its MSA, and\nthat's creating a lot of inequality in that particular place.\nBut I think the main message of this is that the larger cities\ntend to be places where income inequality is quite a bit\nhigher than it is for the rest of the MSAs. And this is all 380\nof them in here.\nSo now we can put that extra column on our top 10 list\nhere, so this is the same table that we had before with our\nmeasure of per capita income. We're No. 7 on the list.\nWe've got our measure of cost of living and the RPP. We're\nlow cost. And then we've got our measure of inequality in\nthis last column. And I just want to focus on this for a\nminute, because some of these cities have pretty high\ninequality.\nAnd what cities are they? They're the Bay Area cities that\nhave inequality numbers around 30, Boston very high,\nHouston also quite high. But the other cities on this list are\nprobably comparable to St. Louis, kind of in the middle.\nNashville in particular is close to us, Minneapolis close to\nus. Seattle a little bit higher, but generally speaking close to\nus. Washington, D.C., actually comes up with relatively low\ninequality. I think the federal government there provides a\nkind of a lot of income across a very large swathe of the\nworkforce there, and so it's kind of a different city from\nother places.\nSo the message I would like to take—and this talk's about\nover here, so you can wake up again. [Laughter.] The\nmessage I'd like you to take is that, among the top 10\nplaces for standard of living in the U.S., there's only two\nthat are low cost. That's us and Nashville. And then—and\nNashville is really almost identical to us across the board\nhere. And then, among the ones that do better than us on\nstandard of living, some of them are high cost—they're\nhigher-cost than us, but some of them also have quite a bit\nhigher inequality than what we have here.\nSo I'm going to stop there. I think we're about done—oh, I've\ngot one more thing. We often talk about economic growth,\nand I think a lot of the discussion that I've had with all of\nyou we think of growth as being the measure of how well\nwe're doing, whereas I'm talking about the level, the\nstandard of living level that we're at. If we don't grow, then\n\n\fothers will catch up to us and pass us in per capita income.\nBut economic growth is not the same as standard of living.\nNow in the cross-country literature it's well-understood that\nsome of the poorer countries are also the fast-growing\ncountries. And that's certainly happening with China and\nIndia. If you look at their growth rates, 6 percent to 7\npercent per year, year in and year out—U.S. is growing at 2\npercent a year, year in and year out—after a while they're\ngoing to catch up in per capita income if they continue to\ngrow faster than us. However, the standard of living as of\ntoday is still low, you know, by a factor of 5 to 10, than it is\nin the U.S. So they have a relatively low standard of living,\neven though they're growing really fast.\nYou might say the same thing about MSAs, but I don't really\nhave enough data here to get at this issue. And so we're\ngoing to have to defer that to a future day. Of course, it\nwould be great to be growing fast, but I think the point here\nis that the level of per capita income is high in St. Louis.\nOK. So let's conclude. If you want to think about these\nissues, you have to adjust for price differences across\nMSAs and housing prices in particular. Otherwise, you\nwon't have meaningful comparison about the standard of\nliving across MSAs. So I used some recent data that's\nbecome available on this issue. We use that to calculate\nper capita income across MSAs. And I'm hopeful that we\ncan use this kind of data to keep perspective of where we\nare and what we have to do to get better and where our\ncompetition is in the U.S. going forward.\nSo I'm going to stop there and let you guys ask some\nquestions. So thanks very much. You've been very attentive\nand very good. [Applause.] I think we have microphones\nover on this side and another one over on this side, so\nyou're going to have to troop up to the microphone if you\nwant to get a question. I prefer softball questions.\n[Laughter.]\nMale: Sorry about that, no softball. Dr. Bullard, I don't think\nthe data correlates with how most people in the region\nwould feel about our success.\nJames Bullard: Yes. I'm trying to shock you into what's\nreally going on here. This is what's really going on. These\nare the numbers. This is the data. Now from here you can\ngo say all kinds of other things. [Laughter.]\nMale: What do you think the reason is for that lack of\ncorrelation between what you're presenting and how\nprobably most of us feel? Humbleness?\nJames Bullard: There is a Midwestern humbleness, I would\nsay that. But some of the other places—it's not just St.\nLouis. It's that the cultural story has become very popular\nin the last 20 years, and I think that's mostly because of the\ntech boom. And the tech boom is a great story, and these\ntech companies are coming to dominate the U.S. economy,\n\n\fand that makes places like Seattle and the Bay Area look\nvery, very good. And they look good in this data as well.\nBut then you forget about, well, what about Minneapolis—\nforget about St. Louis. But what about Minneapolis? What\nabout Nashville? What about Houston? Are those also\nplaces with a high standard of living? And they are,\naccording to these data. So, I think—the idea that everyone\nhas got to scramble up to San Francisco to get into the\ntech boom I always think is a little bit funny. I mean, you\ncould do that from anywhere. You don't have to be out\nthere paying 30 percent more than what you're paying here.\nPlease?\nMale: OK. Since we're here in a transit agency, I thought I'd\nask a transit-related question. How did your data\ncompensate for the difference in utility and private car\nownership versus the availability of mass transit? In other\nwords, dense areas would obviously have higher property\ncosts, but also much higher costs of owning cars.\nThe ipside of that and something that came out in the\nFerguson Commission is the affordability of mass transit.\nIf you are living in a high-cost area and you have good\nmass transit and you compare that, how do you compare\nthat to living in perhaps a low-cost area which has car\nownership as a prerequisite to working?\nJames Bullard: Well, I think that's a great question, and the\nanswer is this data does not address that question.\n[Laughter.]\nSo, what I wanted to get at is this international comparison\nliterature. So when we're saying Switzerland has a high\nstandard of living, U.S. has a high standard of living, U.K.\nhas a high standard of living, we're not telling stories about\nthe transportation network in those countries. We're not\ntelling—there are a whole host of things that are going to\nbe a lot better in those three countries than they're going to\nbe in Latin America or Sub-Saharan Africa. There's going to\nbe dramatic differences in all kinds of dimensions between\nthose kinds of countries on the international scale.\nAnd you want to think of the MSA in the same way.\nDifferent MSAs are going to have different transportation\nnetwork needs. I think the coastal cities in particular seem\nto—at least from afar seem to be extremely congested\nbecause they're limited in what they can do with their\ngeography, and this creates a lot of complications about\ngetting around. I mean, New York City, who thought of the\nidea of putting 20 million people on that island? I mean,\nthat was like the stupidest thing we ever did. [Laughter.]\nSo I think what the advantage of the Midwest is—\nMinneapolis, Indianapolis, Dallas, Houston—you've got\nareas where you can spread out. And if you can build a\nrealistic transportation network, you can keep this cost of\nhousing more competitive than what you see in these\n\n\fcoastal communities. And that just provides tremendous\ncost advantage in the Midwest compared to the coast.\nSo I think that's what's going on in spades and it seems to\nbe getting even—you know, the prices are increasing more\nand more. If you look internationally at these cities, the\nhousing prices are increasing more and more. In the sort of\nglam cities or coast cities, people seem to want to pay a lot\nfor their housing. So I think the Midwest has a great\nadvantage on it.\nNow, being in the Midwest all by itself, even with a cost\nadvantage, doesn't mean it would be a great MSA. You also\nhave to have the jobs in the city that are good enough or\nthat are going to provide a high standard of living. So not\nall the cities on this list are in the Midwest. And so it's kind\nof that you're competing against a rival that has other—that\nmight have other advantages. But cost is not one of them.\nAnd I think we're doing very well against the list here.\nPlease?\nMale: Comparison to international comparisons was\ninteresting. For the international one, people can't move\nbetween countries. But for cities, people can move. So\nyou're saying the living standards are 20, 50 percent\ndifferent, and people aren't apparently moving given\nmigration statistics. Is it because of cost or is it because of\namenities you don't measure?\nIf it's amenities, it might be interesting to compare the\ndifferences in things like public transportation like the\nprevious speaker said or the things that might suggest\nmore investment in bi-state regional development. If these\nare amenities they control, they explain why we don't see\nmigration moving in the direction you suggest.\nJames Bullard: Yep.\nMale: Maybe there are other things that can be done.\nJames Bullard: Brilliant, brilliant question. So if the\nstandard of living is better somewhere else, then you would\nthink people would say, \"Hey, I'm going to move to the\nsomewhere else,\" if you're the average guy. We're talking\nabout the average guy here, too. We're not talking about the\nrich people. They can y wherever they want. But the\naverage person might say, \"Gee, my life would be a lot\nbetter if I go over from the poor country to the rich country,\nand therefore I'm going to move to the rich country.\"\nAnd that does happen internationally in spades, I would\nsay. But if you talk to people from poor countries, they\ncomplain about brain drain. They complain about their\nmost talented people wanting to be in Europe or the U.S.\nAnd so that happens. It doesn't happen on a grand scale\nbecause of immigration restrictions across countries. And,\ntherefore, what you see across countries is a lot of\ninequality across countries internationally.\n\n\fNow when I show you the MSA distribution, it's way atter.\nSo I think that process has gone on over the last 50 years\nor 100 years in the U.S., and people have moved to places\nwhere they thought the economic opportunity was bigger\nand where they can do better. And in order to get that\nprocess to work appropriately, people have to have the\nright perception about where the economic opportunity\nreally is. To a young person, this would say that places like\nSan Francisco and Boston are good. But it would also say\nplaces like Minneapolis and Nashville are also good and St.\nLouis also good.\nSo the fact that labor does not move internationally means\nthat that distribution is not getting equalized the same way\nthat it has in the U.S. It has become—it's much more equal\nin the U.S. across places, but not completely where you still\nhave a 35 percent or 40 percent differential between the\n90th percentile MSA and the 10th percentile MSA.\nOK, I think I've exhausted you. Well, it's a pleasure to be\nhere. What a great audience.

A strong desire for\nsafe assets would imply a relatively large negative value\nfor ξ, whereas an ordinary desire for safe assets would\nimply a value closer to zero.\n\n1I\n\nuse the term r† instead of r* because r* has become associated with the New Keynesian model, whereas I make broader\nstructural model assumptions here.\n4\n\n\fWhy this decomposition of r†?\n•\n\nAssumptions:\no log preferences T-period OLG with no discounting\n\n•\n\n•\n\no fixed capital and no other frictions\n\nIn this type of model, if there was no special desire for safe\nassets, r† would equal the real output growth rate (also the\nconsumption growth rate), λ + ψ, along the balanced\ngrowth path.\nThis is one concept of a natural rate of interest.\n\n5\n\n\fLonger-run outcomes as regimes\n•\n•\n•\n\nThis conception of the natural real rate of interest suggests\nr† will have a constant mean associated with a single\npossible balanced growth path.\nThe point of this presentation is that this single mean may\nbe better modeled as shifting over time.\nShifting means can be modeled as regime-switching\nprocesses.\no For example, relatively long eras of high productivity\n\ngrowth may be followed by relatively long eras of low\nproductivity growth, and the natural rate of interest would be\ndifferent in the two regimes.\n\n6\n\n\fData\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nI use U.S. data from 1984 to the present.\nI construct an ex-post measure of r† by subtracting the\nDallas Fed trimmed-mean PCE inflation rate from the 1year Treasury rate.1\nThese raw data show a clear downward trend.\nMacroeconomic theory does not like this downward\ntrend—it wants a constant mean.\nCentral bank policy may influence this rate over short\nperiods of time, but not over the entire sample period.\n\n1Forward-looking\n\nmeasures, based on the FRB of Cleveland data, are similar but more volatile.\n7\n\n\fReal rate of return on short-term\ngovernment debt, r†\n\nSources: Federal Reserve Board, FRB of Dallas and author’s calculations. Last observation: September 2017.\n8\n\n\fThe declining trend is on government\npaper only, not on capital\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nThe chart shows a declining trend on an ex-post real return\nto holding government paper.\nThe declining trend does not appear to extend to ex-post\nreal returns on claims to capital as measured from the U.S.\nGDP accounts.\nThat return has been fairly constant since the 1980s, as\nshown in the next chart.\nThis provides a rationale for the inclusion of the ξ factor\nabove, which measures the desirability of holding safe\nassets relative to capital.1\n\nFor an alternative perspective on this issue, see J.C. Williams, “Three Questions on R-star,” FRB of San Francisco\nEconomic Letter No. 2017-05, Feb. 21, 2017.\n1\n\n9\n\n\fReal returns on capital and safe assets\n\nSources: P. Gomme, B. Ravikumar and P. Rupert. “Secular Stagnation and Returns on Capital,” FRB of St. Louis Economic\nSynopses No. 19, 2015; Federal Reserve Board, FRB of Dallas and author’s calculations. Last observation: 2017-Q3.\n10\n\n\fMain question\n•\n•\n\n•\n•\n\nWhich of the three factors is most important in accounting\nfor this downward trend? Is it productivity growth, labor\nforce growth or the desirability of safe assets?\nI will treat each of these three factors as following a twostate Markov-switching intercept process:\nxt = x(st) + εt , where εt is an i.i.d. error term\nst can take two values, high and low.\nThe two possible mean values are called “regimes.”\nThe idea is that these types of factors generally have\nconstant means, but that there can be infrequent shifts in\nmean. I want to characterize these shifts statistically.\n11\n\n\fLabor Productivity Growth\n\n12\n\n\fU.S. labor productivity growth has\nbeen low\n•\n•\n•\n\nA statistical model that estimates the probability that the\nU.S. economy is in a low-productivity-growth regime puts\nnearly all the probability on the low-growth regime.1\nThe most recent estimates from Kahn and Rich (2006) put\nthe growth rate in the low (high) state at 1.24 percent (2.94\npercent).2\nThe U.S. economy was in the high-productivity-growth\nregime from early 1997 to late 2004.\n\nSee J.A. Kahn and R.W. Rich, 2006, “Tracking Productivity in Real Time,” Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Current\nIssues in Economics and Finance, 12(8).\n2 In previous talks, I have used even lower productivity growth assumptions.\n1\n\n13\n\n\fThe high- and low-productivitygrowth regimes\n\nSources: Kahn and Rich (2006) and FRB of New York.

Last observation: October 2017.\n17\n\n\fInvestor Desire for Safe Assets\n\n18\n\n\fInvestor desire for safe assets\n•\n•\n•\n\nI now remove the regime-switching trends for both labor\nproductivity and labor force growth from the raw data on\nex-post safe real returns.\nThis leaves us with a time series of adjusted safe real\nreturns, and this series still has a downward trend.\nI then fit a two-state regime-switching process to these\nadjusted data, and I interpret the two states as a strong\ndesire for safe assets versus a more normal desire for safe\nassets.\n\n19\n\n\fThe normal- and\nhigh-desire-for-safe-assets regimes\n\nSource: Author’s calculations. Last observation: September 2017.\n20\n\n\fHigh-desire-for-safe-assets regime\n•\n•\n•\n\nThe estimated values for ξ are -3.01 percent in the highdesire-for-safe-assets regime and 0.64 percent in the\nnormal-desire-for-safe-assets regime.\nThe U.S. is currently in the regime with a high desire for\nsafe assets.\nThe difference between the two regimes is largest for this\nfactor; it is in some sense the “most important” of the\nthree.\n\n21\n\n\fCurrent regime: High desire for safe assets\n\nSource: Author’s calculations.

The max (min) natural rate is the value corresponding to all three factors taking\nthe value in the high (low) state.\n24\n\n\fUsing the regime-switching approach\n•\n•\n\n•\n•\n\nLabor productivity appears to be in the low-growth\nregime, so set λ = 1.24 percent.\nThe labor force appears to be in the low-growth regime as\nwell, so set ψ = 0.46 percent. Plausibly, labor force\ngrowth could be interpreted as switching to the highgrowth regime, ψ = 1.33 percent.\nThere also appears to be a high desire for safe assets, so set\nξ = -3.01 percent.\nAccording to this analysis, r† = λ + ψ + ξ is either -131\nbasis points or -44 basis points, depending on how one\nviews labor force growth.\n25\n\n\fRecent Related Estimates\nfrom the Literature\n\n26\n\n\fRelated literature and regime\nswitching\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nThere is a fairly large and growing literature trying to\nunderstand the downward trend in the natural rate of interest.\nThe literature tends to be quite a bit more sophisticated than\nthe analysis presented here.\nThe only point here is to think in terms of regime switching.\nTwo of the three factors analyzed, labor productivity growth\nand the desire for safe assets, are in the low state and do not\nappear to be shifting to the high state.\nThis suggests the natural rate of interest, and hence the Fed’s\npolicy rate, can remain low over the forecast horizon.\n\n27\n\n\fRelated literature on the natural rate\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nLaubach and Williams (2003) impose a structural model and\nestimate a low r* without a safe asset demand factor.1\nCurdia (2015) performs a similar analysis with somewhat\naltered assumptions and gets a very low r*.2\nDel Negro et al. (2017) impose a structural model, include an\nevolving demand for safe assets and get a low value for r*.3\nI have imposed less structure along with an alternative\nstochastic conception, regime switching. This suggests a\ndifferent view of mean-reversion properties.\n\n1 T.\n\nLaubach and J.C.

By committing to an in�ation target, in�ation has generally been kept\nlower and less variable, and in�ation expectations have also been less variable,” Bullard\nsaid. “This has been a major achievement of U.S. monetary policy, and one to which Allan\nMeltzer made an outsized contribution.”\nRead the related article in Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Review »\nFull text of remarks:\nAllan Meltzer and the Search for a Nominal Anchor1\nJames Bullard\nPresident and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nMeltzer’s Contributions to Monetary Economics and Public Policy\nPhiladelphia, Pa.\n\nIntroduction\nAllan Meltzer was an outstanding monetary economist with a long and distinguished\ncareer.2 He has been an absolute �xture on the central banking and monetary economics\nscene during my entire career, so much so that I have a hard time picturing that scene\n\n\fwithout him. He was also a great friend of the St. Louis Fed.\nMeltzer published seven papers in the St. Louis Fed’s Review. The �rst was published in\n1969 and was titled “Controlling Money.”3 The last was published in 2005 and was a\nprecursor to Volume 2 of his monumental A History of the Federal Reserve.4 I will use this\nlast Review publication as a starting point for my comments.\nThe paper, titled “Origins of the Great In�ation,” discusses the run-up to the extraordinary\nin�ation of the 1970s and early 1980s in the U.S. from a policymaker perspective. Meltzer\npresents in the style later carried on in the History. He quotes the views of individual\nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members, along with those of the staff, that\ndescribe what they thought they were doing in adopting particular monetary policy actions\nat particular times. He presents this material almost deadpan, with little judgment, to try to\ndiscern what the protagonists were thinking as the Great In�ation developed.\nAnd indeed, they were thinking and saying a wide variety of things. As the narrative\nprogresses, however, it becomes quite apparent that there was little in the way of a clear\nframework for monetary policy during these years. Meltzer states that the Committee had\nno common baseline even for fundamental questions, such as the causes of in�ation. Ideas\nfor the provision of a nominal anchor centered on keeping �scal de�cits low, closely\nregulating the growth of the money supply, or keeping interest rates suf�ciently high. None\nof these were widely accepted, and all had detractors. Some FOMC members eschewed\nmacroeconomic theory altogether. He notes that then-Board Governor Sherman Maisel\noften exhorted the Committee to spend more time on the development of a coherent model\nthat could be used to better guide decision-making, but with little effect. As a result of the\ntheoretical incoherence, actual decision-making was perhaps more open to in�uence by\nother factors, such as domestic politics, which Meltzer discusses in some detail.\nFrom this situation some �ve decades ago as described by Meltzer, we come to the present.\nIs the situation today very different? The debates in the monetary theory literature and the\n�scal theory of the price level literature roll onward. Certainly, much progress has been\nmade, but complicated arguments abound and clear resolution seems distant. Yet today,\ndespite the remaining theoretical incoherence, in�ation control has been in place in the\nU.S. for about two decades—and this despite the global �nancial crisis. If there is a problem\nwith in�ation today, it is because in�ation has been lower than promised, not higher. How is\nit that a nominal anchor for the U.S. has been found without clear resolution to the puzzles\nposed in the academic literature?\n\nIn�ation Targeting\nThe answer to this question is surely “in�ation targeting.” In�ation targeting does not\n\n\fprovide a comprehensive account of in�ation dynamics or of the methods used to attain a\ngiven in�ation goal over the medium term. As implemented in the U.S., it is really only a\ncredible statement of a goal and a promise to try to achieve the goal in the medium term via\nall means at the disposal of the FOMC. That is not enough to satisfy any modern notion of\nwhat constitutes a macroeconomic theory. Nevertheless, it has succeeded in providing the\nU.S. with the nominal anchor that so eluded us during the 1970s and early 1980s.\nIn�ation targeting came upon the global central banking scene in the 1990s. Early adopters\nincluded the Reserve Bank of New Zealand and the Bank of England, but many other central\nbanks around the world have followed since that time. The European Central Bank was\nconceived and established with a formal in�ation target. The Bank of Japan and the Federal\nReserve did not join the club formally until fairly recently, with the U.S. adopting an\nin�ation target in January 2012.\nNevertheless, in my opinion the U.S. has followed a de facto in�ation targeting policy from\n1995 onwards. As of that time, U.S. in�ation had declined to about 2 percent and has not\ndeviated substantially from that target over the last 22 years, at least not on the scale\nobserved during the 1970s and early 1980s. U.S. policymakers were well aware of the\ntrends in the international policy debate toward in�ation targeting during this era, and\nmany members of the Committee were sympathetic to the arguments supporting in�ation\ntargeting.\nGenerally speaking, the evidence from around the globe is that in�ation targeting has been\nsuccessful in those countries that have implemented it. In�ation rates are generally lower\ntoday than in the pre-in�ation targeting era, and in�ation rates are often maintained\nrelatively close to the announced in�ation target. The variance of in�ation has generally\nbeen lower than in the pre-in�ation targeting era. In addition, the variance of in�ation\nexpectations has also declined, generally speaking, because �nancial market participants\nhave tended to view many central bank in�ation targets as relatively credible commitments.\nThese developments are all in line with what one might expect based on theories that\ncompare a noisy and purely discretionary monetary policy like the one Meltzer described\nfor the U.S. during the run-up to the Great In�ation, as opposed to a policy based more on a\ncommitment by the central bank as to what it intends to achieve.\nWhat would Allan Meltzer say if he were here? My reading of his views is that he would\nstress that the act of naming a credible in�ation target recognizes some fundamental truths\n—truths that were not recognized in the run-up to the Great In�ation. In particular, it\nassigns the responsibility for the in�ation rate to the central bank. It strongly suggests that\nin�ation is a monetary phenomenon. But it stops short of requiring an implementer of the\npolicy to commit to any particular macroeconomic theory beyond these precepts.\n\n\fI would add my own view at this point, without trying to implicate Allan Meltzer, as I am not\nsure that he would stress it as much as I do. My point is this: The act of naming an explicit\nin�ation target recognizes the importance of macroeconomic expectations and future\npolicy expectations as being paramount in the monetary policy arena. It is the expectations\nof future policy that can be unruly and lead to changes in economic behavior that can, in\nturn, change the nature of the macroeconomic equilibrium. If expectations are the problem,\nthen a natural way to help tie them down is to credibly commit to an in�ation target. This\napproach has worked admirably during the last two decades.\nOne could tie private sector expectations down still further by credibly committing to a\nmonetary policy rule, such as a Taylor-type rule.5 The Taylor-type rule has the in�ation\ntarget as a critical component, but also speci�es how the central bank should respond to\nvarious shocks to the economy. Would there be additional gains, on top of those already\nachieved through the naming of a credible in�ation target itself, by a central bank\ncommitment to such a rule? Allan Meltzer thought so, and testi�ed to that effect before\nCongress in 2015.6 Others have been opposed, including my long-time colleague and now\noutgoing Fed Chair Janet Yellen.7\n\nTwo Indications of Monetary Policy Quality\nHow can we decide if there are additional gains that would accrue to the U.S. economy via\nmonetary policymakers more explicitly adopting a Taylor-type policy rule? Much has been\nwritten on this issue. Some of the issues addressed in the literature include the idea that the\nTaylor-type policy rule is a more model-dependent object and that its policy prescriptions\nwill be valid only in certain model environments. A very real issue, therefore, is the\nsubstantial model uncertainty that characterizes today’s policy landscape. But instead of\nrehashing these arguments, I wish to go in a different direction in the remainder of my\nremarks.8\nI want to turn now to make an assessment of whether in�ation targeting, as implemented\nimplicitly in the U.S. since 1995 (and explicitly since 2012), has led U.S. policymakers to\nadopt something we can view as close to optimal monetary policy. If recent monetary policy\ncan be viewed as close to optimal, then attempts to further pin down expectations of future\npolicy actions may be less desirable. If recent monetary policy is viewed as less close to\noptimal, then further monetary policy commitment may confer important bene�ts to the\neconomy.\nI will proceed by considering two examples. In these examples, the evidence on whether\nrecent monetary policy is close to optimal or not is somewhat mixed, so the results here are\nbroadly inconclusive. Nevertheless, I think it is instructive to work through these examples.\n\n\fTo make an assessment of this type requires a model. Since there are many models to\nchoose from, we could simply stop here and say we do not know. But in the spirit of trying to\nunderstand a little more about the effects of in�ation targeting, I will use a very simple\nversion of a New Keynesian model. Since most of you know the ideas behind this model\nvery well, I have relegated the details to an appendix.\n\nThe Case of the Disappearing Phillips Curve\nThe �rst example is the case of the disappearing Phillips curve. Here we will begin with the\nempirical evidence, which is neatly summarized in Figure 1, adapted from the latest annual\nreport of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS).9 The �gure shows the coef�cient on a\nmeasure of resource slack (unemployment) in a regression of price in�ation on resource\nutilization, using the authors’ preferred speci�cation. The coef�cient is estimated\nrepeatedly in rolling 15-year samples, and the point estimates, along with 90 percent\ncon�dence bands, are plotted in the �gure. The sample runs from the 1980s to the present.\nThe data are for a panel of G-7 economies, and the point estimate is a weighted average\nacross economies.\nThe main idea of the �gure is that the slope of the Phillips curve was once negative in the\n1980s but has been drifting toward zero in the in�ation targeting era since 1995. The\ncoef�cient has not been different from zero in recent years—hence the disappearing\nPhillips curve that has been widely discussed in �nancial markets and in monetary policy\ncircles.\nThe empirical phenomenon documented in Figure 1 can be related to the idea that\nmonetary authorities have moved closer to implementing optimal monetary policy during\nthe in�ation targeting era.10 The details of this argument can be found in the appendix, but\nI will describe the approach here. I begin with a standard, two-equation, linearized New\nKeynesian model. I then assume that the monetary policymaker wishes to stabilize a\nquadratic function of in�ation gaps and output gaps over an in�nite horizon. I give the\npolicymaker a Taylor-type linear feedback policy rule to work with. I allow the policymaker\nto choose just one parameter in this feedback rule in order to minimize the loss function.\nThat single parameter is the coef�cient on the in�ation gap. We could think of this as\nrepresenting the weight placed on in�ation stabilization versus output stabilization in the\nTaylor-type rule.\nIn this simple exercise, the solution to the policymaker problem is to set the value of the\ncoef�cient on the in�ation gap to a very large value—technically, in�nity. In this situation,\noptimal monetary policy would call for very low tolerance of deviations of in�ation from\ntarget. The central bank reacts very aggressively to keep in�ation under control.\n\n\fIn this simple model, we can also write out explicitly the value of the regression coef�cient\nin a regression of the in�ation gap on the output gap, which is the theoretical counterpart of\nthe slope of the Phillips curve in the BIS regression of Figure 1. The Taylor-type rule\ncoef�cient on the in�ation gap appears in this formula. As this value tends to in�nity the\npolicymaker is following something closer and closer to optimal policy—and at the same\ntime the slope of the Phillips curve is tending toward zero.\nThis result is one way to state the idea that central banks have become better and better at\nin�ation targeting, and that this success has driven the Phillips curve slope to zero. The\nempirical evidence in Figure 1 can therefore be interpreted as a signature of optimal\nmonetary policy in observable data. Figure 1 is saying, in effect, that policymakers have\nalready jumped on the Taylor rule bandwagon during the last two decades.\n\nPrice Level Targeting\nThe second example is price level targeting. I have so far argued that in�ation targeting has\nconferred considerable bene�ts on the economy. And yet, within the standard New\nKeynesian model, optimal monetary policy is often characterized as price level targeting or\nits close cousin, nominal income targeting. In recent years, FOMC members (including me)\nhave discussed both price level and nominal income targeting as a possible future of U.S.\nmonetary policy. A move in this direction would require considerable debate and re�ection,\nbut might also confer substantial bene�ts to the U.S. economy if it could be implemented\neffectively.\nIf we simply take as given that price level targeting is optimal policy within the New\nKeynesian construct, a signature in the U.S. data of optimal monetary policy would be\nwhether the price level in the U.S. follows a prescribed price level path. If it does, then the\nFOMC has been de facto price level targeting even if the Committee has not of�cially said\nthat it has been doing so. The hallmark of price level targeting is that periods of belowtarget in�ation are averaged out with other periods of above-target in�ation in such a way\nthat the economy remains on a price level path consistent with a given in�ation rate.\nIn the price level targeting world, the starting date matters. I have already argued that 1995\nis the point at which the Volcker-era in�ation stabilization came to full fruition, and that\nfrom that point onward, the FOMC attempted to maintain a 2 percent in�ation target. But\ndid the Committee do even more, implicitly attempting to keep the U.S. economy on a 2\npercent price level path?\nIn the fall of 2012, I argued that the FOMC had kept the U.S. on a 2 percent price level path\nsince 1995, and that this was an outstanding achievement given the global �nancial crisis\nduring the intervening years.11 Again, at least as of 2012, the actual implementation of U.S.\n\n\fmonetary policy could be viewed as optimal. By itself, this would suggest that there would\nbe little to be gained from additional monetary policy commitments by the central bank.\nHowever, as Figure 2 illustrates, in the last �ve years, the U.S. has fallen off the 2 percent\nprice level path established in 1995. The deviation from the path is now fairly substantial,\nabout 4.6 percent on the low side. Recent FOMC forecasts do not seem to anticipate enough\nin�ation to return the economy to the 2 percent path. Therefore, we will have to conclude\nthat monetary policy has not been optimal from this perspective.\n\nSummary and Conclusion\nI have ruminated on Allan Meltzer’s excellent career by casting it in terms of a search for a\nnominal anchor for the U.S. I took as a starting point Meltzer’s last article for the St. Louis\nFed’s Review, “Origins of the Great In�ation.” That article, a precursor to the much larger\nwork, A History of the Federal Reserve, Volume 2, suggests that during the period of the\nrun-up to the Great In�ation, there was no coherent monetary policy framework. This lack\nof coherence may have left monetary policy susceptible to in�uences other than those from\nmonetary science, such as politics.\nToday, some �ve decades later, there remains a great deal of theoretical and empirical\nuncertainty about the effects of monetary policy on the economy. And yet, despite this\nuncertainty, the U.S. and many other countries have been able to achieve low and stable\nin�ation and, if anything, have faced a problem of in�ation being lower than promised,\ninstead of higher than promised as in the 1970s and early 1980s. How was the nominal\nanchor found, and what was it?\nMy answer is that it has been in�ation targeting, either practiced implicitly or explicitly.\nThis may not have been the answer many economists were expecting during the earlier\nportions of the postwar era—ideas then revolved around constant money growth, low �scal\nde�cits or the level of short-term nominal interest rates. In�ation targeting has worked well\nbecause it deals more directly with the coordination of macroeconomic expectations than\nother approaches. By committing to an in�ation target, in�ation has generally been kept\nlower and less variable, and in�ation expectations have also been less variable. This has\nbeen a major achievement of U.S. monetary policy, and one to which Allan Meltzer made an\noutsized contribution.\nIf the naming of a credible in�ation target coordinates expectations and helps inform the\nmacroeconomic equilibrium, then perhaps further coordination can be achieved by being\neven more explicit about the future actions of monetary policymakers. One method of doing\nthis would be for the central bank to commit to using a Taylor-type monetary policy rule.\nWhether this would confer added bene�ts or not would depend on whether one thinks there\nare in fact additional gains to be had for the economy by more tightly buttoning down future\n\n\fexpectations of monetary policy.\nSuch questions cannot really be answered without the assistance of a macroeconomic\nmodel. But if we go ahead with a popular and simple version of the New Keynesian model,\nwe can consider two examples of what optimal policy would look like and how it compares\nto actual monetary policy outcomes during the in�ation targeting era. The “disappearing\nPhillips curve” example suggests that actual U.S. monetary policy has tended to be closer\nand closer to optimal in the last two decades, and that this has, in fact, killed off the Phillips\ncurve correlation previously apparent in the data. The “price level targeting” example\nsuggests U.S. monetary policy was close to optimal between 1995 and 2012, but has since\nfallen away somewhat.\nWhether we can do better than these two examples suggest, or whether the available gains\nhave largely accrued already via the commitment to in�ation targeting implicitly made in\nthe U.S. in the 1990s, remains an important question for future research. I am sure that\nresearch will continue to be in�uenced by the enormous contributions of Allan Meltzer.\n\nEndnotes\n1\n\nAny opinions expressed here are my own and do not necessarily re�ect those of the\nFederal Open Market Committee.\n\n2\n\nTaylor (2017).\n\n3\n\nMeltzer (1969).\n\n4\n\nMeltzer (2003, 2005, 2009a, 2009b).\n\n5\n\nTaylor (1993).\n\n6\n\nMeltzer (2015).\n\n7\n\nYellen (2015).\n\n8\n\nFor more on my views concerning the Taylor rule, see Bullard (2017).\n\n9\n\nBank for International Settlements (2017).

He noted one possible approach –\nprice level targeting – would likely require lots of careful preparation and debate before any\nchanges could be made. Under this framework, “deviations from target are overcome by\nallowing for higher or lower inflation in the future in such a way that the inflation target is\nmaintained on average.

Households would\nrather be in the higher growth regime in this sense. But the\nproductivity growth regime is taken as an exogenous process\nchosen by nature here.\nMonetary policy cannot switch the economy to the high-growth\nregime, but it can conduct an optimal policy given the regime.\nMonetary policy can be useful, but not so useful as to create high\nreal growth.\n\nE ND\n\n\fI NTRO\n\nL OW INTEREST RATES & SAVING\n\nF RICTION\n\nE NVIRONMENT\n\nG RAPHS\n\nP OLICY\n\nP ERCEPTIONS\n\nM ORE CAVEATS\n\nI focus on an equilibrium where the real interest rate equals the\noutput growth rate every period in the stochastic economy.\nThere may be other equilibria.\nResults would still hold if there were two or more lifetime\nproductivity profiles, allowing for intracohort income inequality.\n\nE ND\n\n\fI NTRO\n\nL OW INTEREST RATES & SAVING\n\nF RICTION\n\nE NVIRONMENT\n\nG RAPHS\n\nPerceptions\n\nP OLICY\n\nP ERCEPTIONS\n\nE ND\n\n\fI NTRO\n\nL OW INTEREST RATES & SAVING\n\nF RICTION\n\nE NVIRONMENT\n\nG RAPHS\n\nP OLICY\n\nP ERCEPTIONS\n\nI NACCURATE PERCEPTIONS OF REGIMES\n\nIn this presentation, the policymaker and the private sector\nagents have rational expectations, meaning they understand the\nnature of the regime-switching process driving the economy.\nWhat if they had a misspecified model in which they expected\nthe economy to return to a fixed mean?\nIt remains for future reseach to understand how these results\nmay be altered in this scenario.\nNevertheless, this may be occurring in actual U.S. monetary\npolicy.\nThe following charts illustrate this possibility using recent U.S.\ndata.\n\nE ND\n\n\fI NTRO\n\nL OW INTEREST RATES & SAVING\n\nF RICTION\n\nE NVIRONMENT\n\nG RAPHS\n\nP OLICY\n\nP ERCEPTIONS\n\nP OLICYMAKER PERCEPTIONS\n\nF IGURE : Source: Federal Reserve Board and author’s calculations.

He presented a regime-switching view of the issues around the natural\nreal rate of interest, which he called r-dagger (r†) to emphasize that these estimates use an\nalternative methodology. Bullard considered three factors that can influence the natural rate\nand noted that the U.S. is currently in a regime (or state) of low productivity growth, appears to\nbe in a low-growth state for the U.S. labor force, and is in a regime of a high desire for safe\nassets (the most important of the three factors). He concluded that the natural safe real rate of\ninterest, and hence the appropriate policy rate, is relatively low and unlikely to change very\nmuch over the forecast horizon of two years.\nRelated article in Business Economics, (2018).\n\nFOLLOW US\n\nSIGN UP FOR EMAIL ALERTS\nReceive updates in your inbox as soon as new content is published on our website\nSIGN UP\nQUICK LINKS\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/from-the-president/speeches-and-presentations/2018/natural-real-rate-of-interest\n\n1/2\n\n\f12/21/22, 5:38 PM\n\nR-Star: The Natural Real Rate of Interest | James Bullard | St. Louis Fed\n\nAbout Us\nLegal Information\nContact Us\nPrivacy Policy\nCareers\nDoing Business with the Fed\nEvents\nFederal Reserve Services\nVisiting the St. Louis Fed\nFederal Banking Regulations\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/from-the-president/speeches-and-presentations/2018/natural-real-rate-of-interest\n\n2/2\n\n\f",

He noted that societies have disliked non-uniform currency systems\nbecause the currencies trade at different values. “Cryptocurrencies may unwittingly be\npushing in the wrong direction in trying to solve an important social problem, which is how\nbest to facilitate market-based exchange,” Bullard said.\nSimilar remarks were delivered at Alternative Money University, Cato Institute, Washington,\nD.C., July 15, 2018, (presentation pdf) and at The Canon Institute for Global Studies,\nConference on Macroeconomic Theory and Policy 2018, Tokyo, Japan, June 4, 2018,\n(presentation pdf).\n\n\f",

Until recently, Forbes was an external member of the\nMonetary Policy Committee for the Bank of England; she served during the historic Brexit\nvote. She is now an economics professor at MIT. Previously, Forbes served in senior policy\nroles at the U.S. Treasury and on the White House Council of Economic Advisers.

Let me explain how. The ties that bind Milton\nFriedman and the St. Louis Fed go back to Rutgers University in the early 1930s. At that\ntime, Friedman studied as an undergrad with an economics professor named Homer Jones.\n\n\fJones encouraged Friedman to go into economics via graduate school at Columbia\nUniversity, and they remained friends and colleagues thereafter. Eventually, Friedman\nwould go on to fame and notoriety, as well as a Nobel Prize, at the University of Chicago.\nHomer Jones would take a different route. He would go west to St. Louis. Homer’s fame and\nnotoriety was cemented at the St. Louis Fed.\nDuring his time as research director, Homer Jones presided over the rise of rigorous\nmacroeconomic research at the Bank. He was a leader in insisting on careful theoretical\nand empirical work to back up major monetary policy decisions, a tradition that remains\nwith the Bank today. He liked macroeconomic data and worked to make data available to\nevery person who wanted access to it. That tradition also continues today via the Bank’s\nFRED and family set of databases, which now boast a user base of about 25 million\nworldwide.\nWe commemorate the legacy of Homer Jones through this lecture series. It is one of the\nBank’s signature events.\nThe �rst lecture was given in 1987, shortly after Homer Jones’ death. The lecture has\npersisted, in large part, because of the past support of many organizations and people.\nThese have included Saint Louis University, Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville, the\nUniversity of Missouri at St. Louis and Washington University in St. Louis. For the past\nseveral years, the lecture series has been a joint collaboration between the St. Louis\nGateway Chapter of the National Association for Business Economics and the Federal\nReserve Bank of St. Louis.\nOwing to its prominence, the lecture series has attracted many outstanding economists and\npolicymakers. Past speakers have included Allan Meltzer, Anna Schwartz, Ben Bernanke,\nRobert E. Lucas Jr., Larry Summers and John Taylor.\nThis year’s speaker is Kristin J. Forbes.\nKristin Forbes is the Jerome and Dorothy Lemelson Professor of Management and Global\nEconomics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan School of Management. Her\ndistinguished career includes senior policy roles at the U.S. Treasury and the White House\nCouncil of Economic Advisers, as well as a long list of publications in top academic journals.\nFrom 2014 to 2017, she was an external member of the Monetary Policy Committee for the\nBank of England, a time that included the controversial decision by the U.K. to leave the\nEuropean Union, the so-called Brexit vote that has upended British and European politics\nover the last two years. Forbes has been honored as one of the top 25 economists under the\nage of 45 who are “shaping how we think about the global economy.” The World Economic\nForum has also named her a “Young Global Leader.” The Homer Jones Memorial Lecture is\none of her �rst public speeches after leaving the Bank of England.\n\n\fForbes will discuss aspects of globalization under the intriguing title, “How Have Shanghai,\nSaudi and Supply Chains Affected U.S. In�ation Dynamics?”\nPlease join me in welcoming Dr. Kristin Forbes.\n1 Any opinions expressed here are my own and do not necessarily re�ect those of the\n\nFederal Open Market Committee.\n\n\f",

During his interview with Bloomberg, he also shared\nhis views on the impact of U.S. monetary policy on emerging markets, the effects of rising\noil prices on the U.S. economy, global in�ation dynamics, and the Fed’s forward guidance\nand dot plot.\nHis �ve reasons for caution in raising the policy rate include 1) the �attening yield curve\nand the risk of yield curve inversion, 2) low in�ation expectations, 3) the neutral policy rate,\n4) room to grow business investment and 5) labor market equilibrium. (For more on this\ntopic, see Bullard’s presentation “U.S. Monetary Policy: A Case for Caution,” delivered on\nMay 11, 2018.)\n“I think we’re close to neutral today or even at neutral today … and we don’t have much of an\nin�ation problem, nor does any in�ation seem to be on the horizon according to marketbased expectations,” he said. “My advice would be stand pat where we are, certainly watch\nthe data carefully, watch for surprises and adjust accordingly from here. But I don’t think we\nhave to scramble to get to some higher level of rates in order to contain in�ation.”\nBullard was interviewed by Bloomberg’s Kathleen Hays.

Bullard, “Living Standards across U.S. Metropolitan Statistical Areas.” Remarks delivered at the Bi-State\nDevelopment 2017 Annual Meeting, St. Louis, Mo., Oct. 6, 2017.\n3\n\n\fFor more details\n•\n\nI will be referring to St. Louis Fed research that was\nconducted by my Bank colleagues:\no C.C. Coughlin, C. Gascon and K.L. Kliesen, “Living\n\n•\n\nStandards in St. Louis and the Eighth Federal Reserve\nDistrict: Let’s Get Real,” Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nReview, Fourth Quarter 2017, pp. 377-94.\n\nFor more regional research at the St. Louis Fed, see\nhttps://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/regionalresearch/.\n\n4\n\n\fMotivation: Literature on\nInternational Standards of Living\n\n5\n\n\fThe cross-country literature\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nI take as a motivation the very large literature comparing\ninternational standards of living.\nThat literature tries to address the question of which\nnational economies are performing relatively well and\nwhich are performing less well for their citizens.\nThe literature tries to understand what makes some\ncountries relatively well-off in terms of material wellbeing and what makes other countries relatively poor.\nI would like to do the same for U.S. MSAs.\nThe next slide shows a chart of some recent findings from\nthe international literature.\n6\n\n\fReal per capita GDP in 2014 internationally\n\nSource: Penn World Table, version 9.0. PPPs refer to the purchasing power parity exchange rates.\n7\n\n\fStandard of living: from international\nrankings to MSA rankings\n•\n\nOne of the standards in the international literature is to use\nreal per capita income as the key metric.\no This is defined as total real income produced in the economy\n\n•\n•\n•\n\ndivided by the population.\no This is the clearest measure of “standard of living.”\n\nWe say, based on the previous chart, that the U.S. standard\nof living is relatively high and that the standard of living in\nmany other countries is lower.\nThe goal of this talk is to make the same types of\nstatements for MSAs in the U.S.\nNote that the countries with a high standard of living are\nnot necessarily the fastest-growing countries.\n8\n\n\fMSAs in the U.S.\n\n9\n\n\fMSA as the basic unit of analysis\n•\n•\n•\n\nAn MSA is an area containing a large population center and\nadjacent counties with a high degree of integration with that\ncenter, as measured by commuting patterns.\nMSAs provide the natural unit of analysis for this talk.\nA large fraction (about 90 percent) of U.S. gross domestic\nproduct (GDP) is produced in MSAs.\n\n10\n\n\fPopulation among all MSAs\n•\n•\n•\n\nI will consider 381 MSAs.*\nIn 2015, about 86 percent of the U.S. population lived in\nMSAs.\nSome basic statistics:\no The smallest was Carson City, Nev., with a population of 54K.\no The largest was New York, with a population of 20M.\no The median population was 238K.\n\no The average population was 721K.\n\no The fact that the average is significantly larger than the median\n\nmeans that the large MSAs are very large and skew the size\ndistribution.\n\n* Because\n\nof data availability, I will not include Enid, Okla., which was classified as an MSA in 2015.\n11\n\n\fPopulation among large MSAs\n•\n•\n•\n\nI will also consider the subset of large MSAs, defined as\nhaving a population of at least 1M.\nIn 2015, about 56 percent of the U.S. population lived in\nthe 53 large MSAs.\nSome basic statistics for large MSAs:\no The smallest was Tucson, Ariz., with a population of 1M.\no The largest was New York, with a population of 20M.\no The median population was 2.3M.\n\no The average population was 3.4M.\n\no The average is still greater than the median, but the skewness\n\nis not as pronounced as for the entire set of MSAs.\n\n12\n\n\fMSAs in the U.S.\n\nSource: Census Bureau. Last observation: 2015.\n13\n\n\fPrice Levels by MSA\n\n14\n\n\fRegional price levels\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nPrices can vary greatly across the U.S.\nWe all have an intuitive sense that some places are\nexpensive locations to live and other places are\ninexpensive.\nIn recent years, more systematic data have been developed\nthat account for these differences in prices across the\ncountry.\nMain idea: I will use these newer regional price level data\nto calculate real income per capita across MSAs.\n\n15\n\n\fRegional price parities\n•\n\nThe data are called Regional Price Parities (RPPs) and they\nmeasure the differences in price levels across MSAs for a\ngiven year.\no The Bureau of Economic Analysis started publishing RPPs\n\n•\n•\n\nin 2014.\no Data are available beginning in 2008.\n\nRPPs are expressed as a percentage of the national price\nlevel.\nI will use all items RPPs, which cover all consumption\ngoods and services, including housing.\n\n16\n\n\fWhy regional price differentials?\n•\n•\n•\n\nWhy does the cost of living differ across cities?\nOne key reason is housing costs.\nHousing cost differentials can be substantial and are one\nprimary driver of cost-of-living differences:\no As an example, Zillow data show that in 2015 the median\n\n•\n\nhome value in St. Louis was $105 per square foot, whereas\nthe median home value in San Francisco was $479 per\nsquare foot.*\no That is a ratio of nearly 5 to 1!\n\nThe next two slides show that certain parts of the country\ntend to have high housing costs per square foot.\n\n* Median home values are for the metro areas and are computed as averages of monthly data.\n17\n\n\fMedian home values\nAverage price per square foot\n<$50\n$50-$100\n$100-$150\n$150-$200\n$200-$300\n$300-$500\n>$500\n\nSource: metrocosm.com based on Zillow data.

Galka, “This 3D Map Shows America’s Most Expensive Housing\nMarkets,” blog post, Sept. 2, 2016.\n18\n\n\fShare of households that can afford payments\non the median-priced single-family home\n\nSource: Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University.\n19\n\n\fRegional price parities by MSA\n•\n•\n\nIn 2015, 59 MSAs were more expensive than the nation at\nlarge; that is, they had an RPP larger than 100 percent.\nSome basic statistics for RPPs by MSA:\no The least expensive was Beckley, W.Va., with an RPP of\no\no\no\no\n\n79.7 percent.\nThe most expensive was Honolulu, with an RPP of 124.5\npercent.\nThe median RPP was 93 percent.\nThe average RPP (population weighted) was 101.7 percent.\nSt. Louis’ RPP was 90.6 percent.\n\n20\n\n\fReal Income Per Capita across MSAs\n\n21\n\n\fThe calculation\n•\n•\n•\n\nThe main idea here is to take real income per capita for\neach MSA and adjust it based on the regional level of\nprices for that MSA.\nThis type of calculation gives the standard of living as the\naverage level of real income per person for a particular\nlocation, analogous to the cross-country literature.\nI do not have the median for these data, only the average.\no The average can be influenced by the income inequality\n\nwithin the MSA.\no Later in the talk, I will consider another study that looks at\nincome inequality by MSA.\n\n22\n\n\fReal income per capita across MSAs\n•\n\nThe measure of real income I use is per capita personal\nincome in 2009 chained dollars.\no Another possibility is to look at median household income.\n\n•\n•\n\nFor details, see the Coughlin, et al., paper cited earlier.\n\nDividing by the RPP for a particular MSA then gives a\nmeasure of real income per capita adjusted for regional\nprice level differentials.\nI will focus on 2015, the most recent year for which data\nwere available when this analysis was done.\n\n23\n\n\fResults for the St. Louis MSA\n•\n•\n•\n\nIn 2015, the St. Louis MSA had an RPP-adjusted real\npersonal income that was more than 12 percent higher than\nthe national average.\nAmong the 53 largest MSAs, St. Louis ranks 7th.\nAmong the complete set of 381 MSAs, St. Louis ranks\n20th, which is within the top 6 percent.\no Said differently, 94 percent of all MSAs across the nation\n\n•\n\nhave a lower standard of living than St. Louis.\n\nAmong the complete set of MSAs, the larger MSAs tend to\nrank higher overall.*\n\n* This is broadly consistent with E.

Bullard, “Living Standards across U.S. Metropolitan Statistical Areas.” Remarks delivered at the Bi-State\nDevelopment 2017 Annual Meeting, St. Louis, Mo., Oct. 6, 2017.\n3\n\n\fFor more details\n•\n\nI will be referring to St. Louis Fed research that was\nconducted by my Bank colleagues:\no C.C. Coughlin, C. Gascon and K.L. Kliesen, “Living\n\n•\n\nStandards in St. Louis and the Eighth Federal Reserve\nDistrict: Let’s Get Real,” Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nReview, Fourth Quarter 2017, pp. 377-94.\n\nFor more regional research at the St. Louis Fed, see\nhttps://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/regionalresearch/.\n\n4\n\n\fMotivation: Literature on\nInternational Standards of Living\n\n5\n\n\fThe cross-country literature\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nI take as a motivation the very large literature comparing\ninternational standards of living.\nThat literature tries to address the question of which\nnational economies are performing relatively well and\nwhich are performing less well for their citizens.\nThe literature tries to understand what makes some\ncountries relatively well-off in terms of material wellbeing and what makes other countries relatively poor.\nI would like to do the same for U.S. MSAs.\nThe next slide shows a chart of some recent findings from\nthe international literature.\n6\n\n\fReal per capita GDP in 2014 internationally\n\nSource: Penn World Table, version 9.0. PPPs refer to the purchasing power parity exchange rates.\n7\n\n\fStandard of living: from international\nrankings to MSA rankings\n•\n\nOne of the standards in the international literature is to use\nreal per capita income as the key metric.\no This is defined as total real income produced in the economy\n\n•\n•\n•\n\ndivided by the population.\no This is the clearest measure of “standard of living.”\n\nWe say, based on the previous chart, that the U.S. standard\nof living is relatively high and that the standard of living in\nmany other countries is lower.\nThe goal of this talk is to make the same types of\nstatements for MSAs in the U.S.\nNote that the countries with a high standard of living are\nnot necessarily the fastest-growing countries.\n8\n\n\fMSAs in the U.S.\n\n9\n\n\fMSA as the basic unit of analysis\n•\n•\n•\n\nAn MSA is an area containing a large population center and\nadjacent counties with a high degree of integration with that\ncenter, as measured by commuting patterns.\nMSAs provide the natural unit of analysis for this talk.\nA large fraction (about 90 percent) of U.S. gross domestic\nproduct (GDP) is produced in MSAs.\n\n10\n\n\fPopulation among all MSAs\n•\n•\n•\n\nI will consider 381 MSAs.*\nIn 2015, about 86 percent of the U.S. population lived in\nMSAs.\nSome basic statistics:\no The smallest was Carson City, Nev., with a population of 54K.\no The largest was New York, with a population of 20M.\no The median population was 238K.\n\no The average population was 721K.\n\no The fact that the average is significantly larger than the median\n\nmeans that the large MSAs are very large and skew the size\ndistribution.\n\n* Because\n\nof data availability, I will not include Enid, Okla., which was classified as an MSA in 2015.\n11\n\n\fPopulation among large MSAs\n•\n•\n•\n\nI will also consider the subset of large MSAs, defined as\nhaving a population of at least 1M.\nIn 2015, about 56 percent of the U.S. population lived in\nthe 53 large MSAs.\nSome basic statistics for large MSAs:\no The smallest was Tucson, Ariz., with a population of 1M.\no The largest was New York, with a population of 20M.\no The median population was 2.3M.\n\no The average population was 3.4M.\n\no The average is still greater than the median, but the skewness\n\nis not as pronounced as for the entire set of MSAs.\n\n12\n\n\fMSAs in the U.S.\n\nSource: Census Bureau. Last observation: 2015.\n13\n\n\fPrice Levels by MSA\n\n14\n\n\fRegional price levels\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nPrices can vary greatly across the U.S.\nWe all have an intuitive sense that some places are\nexpensive locations to live and other places are\ninexpensive.\nIn recent years, more systematic data have been developed\nthat account for these differences in prices across the\ncountry.\nMain idea: I will use these newer regional price level data\nto calculate real income per capita across MSAs.\n\n15\n\n\fRegional price parities\n•\n\nThe data are called Regional Price Parities (RPPs) and they\nmeasure the differences in price levels across MSAs for a\ngiven year.\no The Bureau of Economic Analysis started publishing RPPs\n\n•\n•\n\nin 2014.\no Data are available beginning in 2008.\n\nRPPs are expressed as a percentage of the national price\nlevel.\nI will use all items RPPs, which cover all consumption\ngoods and services, including housing.\n\n16\n\n\fWhy regional price differentials?\n•\n•\n•\n\nWhy does the cost of living differ across cities?\nOne key reason is housing costs.\nHousing cost differentials can be substantial and are one\nprimary driver of cost-of-living differences:\no As an example, Zillow data show that in 2015 the median\n\n•\n\nhome value in St. Louis was $105 per square foot, whereas\nthe median home value in San Francisco was $479 per\nsquare foot.*\no That is a ratio of nearly 5 to 1!\n\nThe next two slides show that certain parts of the country\ntend to have high housing costs per square foot.\n\n* Median home values are for the metro areas and are computed as averages of monthly data.\n17\n\n\fMedian home values\nAverage price per square foot\n<$50\n$50-$100\n$100-$150\n$150-$200\n$200-$300\n$300-$500\n>$500\n\nSource: metrocosm.com based on Zillow data.

First, market-based inflation expectations in the U.S. remain\nsomewhat low. Second, the current level of the policy rate appears to be neutral, meaning it is\nputting neither upward nor downward pressure on inflation. Third, the U.S. nominal yield\ncurve could invert later this year or in 2019, which would be a bearish signal for U.S.\nmacroeconomic prospects, he said.\n\nFOLLOW US\n\nSIGN UP FOR EMAIL ALERTS\nReceive updates in your inbox as soon as new content is published on our website\nSIGN UP\nQUICK LINKS\nAbout Us\nLegal Information\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/from-the-president/speeches-and-presentations/2018/a-cautionary-note\n\n1/2\n\n\f12/21/22, 5:38 PM\n\nA Cautionary Note on U.S. Monetary Policy Normalization | James Bullard | St. Louis Fed\n\nContact Us\nPrivacy Policy\nCareers\nDoing Business with the Fed\nEvents\nFederal Reserve Services\nVisiting the St. Louis Fed\nFederal Banking Regulations\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/from-the-president/speeches-and-presentations/2018/a-cautionary-note\n\n2/2\n\n\f",

Azariadis, J. Bullard and B.D. Smith, “Private and Public Circulating Liabilities,” Journal of Economic Theory, July\n2001, 99(1-2), 59-116; J. Bullard and B.D. Smith, “The value of inside and outside money,” Journal of Monetary\nEconomics, March 2003, 50(2), 389-417.\n4\n\n\fKey themes in this talk\n•\n•\n\nThe literature suggests that public and private currencies\ncan co-exist as part of an equilibrium.\nCryptocurrencies are creating drift toward a non-uniform\ncurrency in the U.S., a state of affairs that has existed\nhistorically but was disliked and eventually replaced.\n\n5\n\n\fMore key themes in this talk\n•\n•\n\nThe international monetary system features non-uniform\ncurrency arrangements, but the volatile exchange rates that\ncharacterize the system have long been criticized.\nConclusion:\no Cryptocurrencies may unwittingly be pushing in the\nwrong direction in trying to solve an important social\nproblem, which is how best to facilitate market-based\nexchange.\n\n6\n\n\fGlobal Currency Competition\n\n7\n\n\fCurrency\n•\n•\n\nFor my purposes, currency is an intrinsically worthless\nobject that has value in equilibrium only because others are\nexpected to accept it in exchange.\nIn the theories I work with, there is always an equilibrium\nwhere no one chooses to hold the currency, and its value\nfalls to zero.\n\n8\n\n\fCurrency competition\n•\n•\n•\n\nCurrency competition is nothing new, nor is electronic\ndelivery of value.\nMany currencies are government-issued and backed by the\nmonetary policy of the issuing government.\nThere are also micro-currencies of many types.\no Famously, cigarettes became a currency among POWs during\n\nWWII.\n\n9\n\n\fCurrency competition in action\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nThe first chart plots the number of Venezuelan bolivars\nrequired to purchase one U.S. dollar during 2018.\nU.S. monetary policy is relatively stable, while Venezuelan\npolicy has been unstable, leading the bolivar to devalue\nagainst the dollar.\nBolivar holders were harmed relative to dollar holders\nduring this period due to unstable Venezuelan policy.\nCould cryptocurrencies protect us against the vagaries of\nVenezuelan-style monetary policy?\n\n10\n\n\fVenezuelan bolivar devaluation\n\nSources: Federal Reserve Board and author’s calculations. Last observation: Week of May 4, 2018.\n11\n\n\fPrivately Issued Currency Enters the\nCurrency Competition\n\n12\n\n\fPrivately issued currency\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nPrivately issued currency can fit into this context of many\ncompeting currencies.\nOne of the interesting results from the literature is the\nexistence of a steady state in which both publicly and\nprivately issued currencies circulate as exchange media.\nThe key point is that, at least in an equilibrium like this, one\ntype of money need not crowd out the other. Both are\nrequired to allow all voluntary trade to occur.\nWhat is happening? It is simple: The private currency\nfacilitates exchange that would not otherwise occur.\n\n13\n\n\fAre more transactions better?\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nIn an abstract model, more transactions are a good thing.\nVoluntary exchange should be encouraged and not\ninhibited.\nIn the real world, some of these now-enabled transactions\nmay be illegal or quasi-legal.\nSome examples include illegal drug trades or simple\navoidance of other types of rules, such as Chinese capital\ncontrols.\nThis issue has been widely debated, so I will not comment\non it further here.\n\n14\n\n\fLots of Privately Issued Currency\n\n15\n\n\fFew limits on issuance\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nAnother prediction from the theory is that many private\ncurrencies would be issued.\nIn the literature, every person who wants to issue a private\ncurrency could do so and would do so as part of the\nequilibrium.\nIf we turn to the real world today, something like this\nappears to be happening.\nAccording to Investing.com’s current list, more than 1,800\ncryptocurrencies have been launched.\n\n16\n\n\fNon-uniform currency then\n•\n•\n•\n\nHistorically, the profusion of privately issued currency\ncreated an unsatisfactory system.\nIn the 1830s, 90 percent of the U.S. money supply was\nprivately issued banknotes.*\nContemporaries did not like this system. Currencies traded\nat different rates at different times and places. There were\ndiscount books in each town to keep track of how much\neach currency should be discounted. There was a call for a\n“uniform currency,” which was implemented during the\nCivil War.\n\n* See P. Temin, The Jacksonian Economy, Norton, 1969.\n17\n\n\fNon-uniform currency now\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nIs something like this happening today?\nIt certainly appears to be.\nThere are lots of privately issued cryptocurrencies, trading\nat various rates minute by minute.\nThe only reason this is not a bigger issue today is that the\ntotal volume of cryptocurrency trade is not that large in\nrelation to the entire economy.\n\n18\n\n\fThe drift toward non-uniformity\n•\n•\n•\n\n•\n\nThe current situation could be described as a drift toward a\nnon-uniform currency in the U.S.\nOne suspects that consumers and businesses will not like a\nnon-uniform currency in which many types of currency\ntrade simultaneously at a variety of prices in a local market.\nCurrencies have to be reliable and hold their value. This is\nprobably why government backing has been important\nhistorically, combined with a stable monetary policy that\npromotes stability of the currency.\nThe Venezuelan example fails the second part of this test.\n\n19\n\n\fThe Vagaries of Monetary Policy Remain\n\n20\n\n\fThe vagaries of monetary policy\n•\n\nThe problem of how to stabilize currency value is not\nmitigated by commodity-backed money or cryptocurrency.\no Under a gold standard, the government had to name the\n\n•\n\nexchange rate between notes and gold, and governments\nsometimes altered this rate.\no With cryptocurrencies, there is a monetary policy encoded in\nthe system, perhaps a fixed volume of “coins.” But the\nsystem can also bifurcate, creating two fixed volumes of\ncoins—a process that can happen multiple times.\n\nThe core question remains: How credible are promises for\nlimits on future issuance?\n\n21\n\n\fThe credibility of future policy\n•\n•\n•\n\nOne of the main lessons of monetary theory is that the\ncredibility of future issuance policy is a key aspect to the\nvalue of a currency.\nAn important illustration of this is Thomas J. Sargent’s\nfamous paper, “The Ends of Four Big Inflations.”*\nSargent reviewed hyperinflations in four countries\nfollowing WWI and found that they all ended with credible\ncommitments to future policy.\n\n* T.J. Sargent, “The Ends of Four Big Inflations,” in Inflation: Causes and Effects, R.E. Hall, ed., University of Chicago\nPress, 1982.\n22\n\n\fThe end of hyperinflation in Austria\n\nSource: Figure 2.1 from Sargent (1982).\n23\n\n\fThe Chaos of Exchange Rates\n\n24\n\n\fThe single-currency solution\n•\n•\n\nSocieties have disliked non-uniform currency systems\nbecause the currencies trade at different values—that is,\ndifferent exchange rates.\nThis can be avoided by having a uniform currency.\no Panama is a country that does this by being dollarized.\no The country accepts the U.S. monetary policy and the\n\n•\n\nexchange rates associated with the dollar.\n\nIf this happened with a cryptocurrency, that country would\nbe accepting the monetary policy embedded in the code,\nalong with exchange rates associated with that particular\ncryptocurrency.\n25\n\n\fLocal versus global uniformity\n•\n•\n•\n\nLocally, countries have wanted a uniform currency.\nGlobally, we do not have a uniform currency. Instead we\nhave a system of competing currencies with exchange rates.\nI am arguing that the current cryptocurrency wave may be\ndriving the U.S. uniform currency system toward\nsomething more like the international non-uniform currency\nsystem.\n\n26\n\n\fThe controversial international\nmonetary order\n•\n\n•\n•\n\nGenerally speaking, the international monetary order\nremains controversial, as the currencies seem to fluctuate\nexcessively, attracting speculative trading and altering real\ncapital flows.\nGovernments can and do devalue suddenly, forcing\ninvestors to price in devaluation risk premia.\nThis could be viewed as a distraction from the real business\nat hand, which is to use the price system to judge and\nassign value to goods and services globally.\n\n27\n\n\fExcessive exchange rate volatility\n•\n•\n•\n\n•\n\nThe chart on the next slide illustrates what many consider\nto be excessive FX volatility.\nIn the chart, the change in the yen-dollar exchange rate is\nmuch more volatile than fundamentals, such as real GDP\ngrowth in the U.S. and Japan, which are also plotted.\nThe chart is impressive because both the U.S. and Japan\nhave had relatively stable monetary policies during this\nperiod, but the exchange rate has fluctuated widely\nnevertheless.\nBottom line: The global non-uniform currency system\nfeatures volatile exchange rates. A local non-uniform\ncurrency system may have similar volatility.\n28\n\n\fThe volatility of foreign exchange\n\nSources: International Monetary Fund, Bureau of Economic Analysis, Cabinet Office of Japan and author’s calculations.\nLast observations: April 2018 and 2018-Q1.\n29\n\n\fFamous arguments on FX volatility\n•\n\nHere is my take on some of the many views of FX\nvolatility:\no Hayekian: The chart shows that governments cannot be\n\ntrusted to maintain the value of their currencies.\no Friedmanian: The chart shows markets at work.\no Wallacian: The chart shows that the relative price between\ntwo intrinsically worthless objects is indeterminate.\no Mundellian: The chart shows a deadweight loss from nonuniform currency arrangements.\n\n30\n\n\fConclusion\n\n31\n\n\fConclusions\n•\n•\n•\n\nThe U.S. is drifting toward non-uniform currency trading\narrangements, a system the society has disliked historically.\nGlobally, we have an example of a non-uniform system of\ncurrencies, but these currencies trade at exchange rates that\nare often viewed as excessively volatile.\nConclusion:\no Cryptocurrencies may unwittingly be pushing in the\nwrong direction in trying to solve an important social\nproblem, which is how best to facilitate market-based\nexchange.\n\n32\n\n\fConnect With Us\nJames Bullard\n\nstlouisfed.org/from-the-president\nSTLOUISFED.ORG\n\nFederal Reserve\nEconomic Data\n(FRED)\n\nThousands of data\nseries, millions of users\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nBlogs and\nPublications\n\nNews and views\nabout the economy\nand the Fed\n\nEconomic\nEducation\nResources\n\nFor every stage\nof life\n\nCommunity\nDevelopment\n\nPromoting financial\nstability of families,\nneighborhoods\n\nECONOMY MUSEUM\n\n33\n\n\f",

Azariadis, J. Bullard and B.D. Smith, “Private and Public Circulating Liabilities,” Journal of Economic Theory, July\n2001, 99(1-2), 59-116; J. Bullard and B.D. Smith, “The value of inside and outside money,” Journal of Monetary\nEconomics, March 2003, 50(2), 389-417.\n4\n\n\fKey themes\n•\n\nThe key themes in this talk are as follows:\no Public and private currencies can coexist as part of an equilibrium.\n\no Cryptocurrencies are creating a drift toward a non-uniform currency\n\nin the U.S., a state of affairs that has existed historically but was\ndisliked and eventually replaced by a uniform currency.\no The international monetary system features non-uniform currency\narrangements, but the volatile exchange rates that characterize the\nsystem have long been criticized.\no Cryptocurrencies may unwittingly be pushing in the wrong\ndirection in trying to solve an important social problem, which is\nhow best to facilitate market-based exchange.\n\n5\n\n\fGlobal Currency Competition\n\n6\n\n\fCurrency\n•\n•\n\nFor my purposes, currency is an intrinsically worthless\nobject that has value in equilibrium only because others are\nexpected to accept it in exchange.\nIn the theories I work with, there is always an equilibrium\nwhere no one chooses to hold the currency, and its value\nfalls to zero.\n\n7\n\n\fCurrency competition\n•\n•\n•\n\nCurrency competition is nothing new, nor is electronic\ndelivery of value.\nMany currencies are government-issued and backed by the\nmonetary policy of the issuing government.\nThere are also micro-currencies of many types.\no Famously, cigarettes became a currency among POWs during\n\nWWII.\n\n8\n\n\fCurrency competition in action\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nThe first chart plots the number of Venezuelan bolivars\nrequired to purchase one U.S. dollar during 2018.\nU.S. monetary policy is relatively stable, while Venezuelan\npolicy has been unstable, leading the bolivar to devalue\nagainst the dollar.\nBolivar holders were harmed relative to dollar holders\nduring this period due to unstable Venezuelan policy.\nCould cryptocurrencies protect us against the vagaries of\nVenezuelan-style monetary policy?\n\n9\n\n\fVenezuelan bolivar devaluation\n\nSources: Federal Reserve Board and author’s calculations. Last observation: Week of July 6, 2018.\n10\n\n\fPrivately Issued Currency Enters the\nCurrency Competition\n\n11\n\n\fPrivately issued currency\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nPrivately issued currency can fit into this context of many\ncompeting currencies.\nOne of the interesting results from the literature is the\nexistence of a steady state in which both publicly and\nprivately issued currencies circulate as exchange media.\nThe key point is that, at least in an equilibrium like this, one\ntype of money need not crowd out the other. Both are\nrequired to allow all voluntary trade to occur.\nWhat is happening? It is simple: The private currency\nfacilitates exchange that would not otherwise occur.\n\n12\n\n\fAre more transactions better?\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nIn an abstract model, more transactions are a good thing.\nVoluntary exchange should be encouraged and not\ninhibited.\nIn the real world, some of these now-enabled transactions\nmay be illegal or quasi-legal.\nSome examples include illegal drug trades or simple\navoidance of other types of rules, such as Chinese capital\ncontrols.\nThis issue has been widely debated.\n\n13\n\n\fLots of Privately Issued Currency\n\n14\n\n\fFew limits on issuance\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nAnother prediction from the theory is that many private\ncurrencies would be issued.\nIn the literature, every person who wants to issue a private\ncurrency could do so and would do so as part of the\nequilibrium.\nIf we turn to the real world today, something like this\nappears to be happening.\nAccording to Investing.com’s current list, about 1,900\ncryptocurrencies have been launched.\n\n15\n\n\fNon-uniform currency then\n•\n•\n•\n\nHistorically, the profusion of privately issued currency in\nthe U.S. created an unsatisfactory system.\nIn the 1830s, 90 percent of the U.S. money supply was\nprivately issued banknotes.*\nContemporaries did not like this system. Currencies traded\nat different rates at different times and places. There were\ndiscount books in each town to keep track of how much\neach currency should be discounted. There was a call for a\n“uniform currency,” which was implemented during the\nCivil War.\n\n* See P. Temin, The Jacksonian Economy, Norton, 1969.\n16\n\n\fNon-uniform currency now\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nIs something like this happening today?\nIt certainly appears to be.\nThere are lots of privately issued cryptocurrencies, trading\nat various rates minute by minute.\nThe only reason this is not a bigger issue today is that the\ntotal volume of cryptocurrency trade is not that large in\nrelation to the entire economy.\n\n17\n\n\fThe drift toward non-uniformity\n•\n•\n•\n\n•\n\nThe current situation could be described as a drift toward a\nnon-uniform currency in the U.S.\nOne suspects that consumers and businesses will not like a\nnon-uniform currency in which many types of currency\ntrade simultaneously at a variety of prices in a local market.\nCurrencies have to be reliable and hold their value. This is\nprobably why government backing has been important\nhistorically, combined with a stable monetary policy that\npromotes stability of the currency.\nThe Venezuelan example fails the second part of this test:\nNo one is sure what future Venezuelan monetary policy\nwill be.\n18\n\n\fThe Vagaries of Monetary Policy Remain\n\n19\n\n\fThe vagaries of monetary policy\n•\n\nThe problem of how to stabilize currency value is not\nmitigated by commodity-backed money or cryptocurrency.\no Under a gold standard, the government had to name the\n\n•\n\nexchange rate between notes and gold, and governments\nsometimes altered this rate.\no With cryptocurrencies, there is a monetary policy encoded in\nthe system, perhaps a fixed volume of “coins.” But the\nsystem can also bifurcate, creating two fixed volumes of\ncoins—a process that can happen multiple times.\n\nThe core question remains: How credible are promises for\nlimits on future issuance?\n\n20\n\n\fThe credibility of future policy\n•\n•\n•\n\nOne of the main lessons of monetary theory is that the\ncredibility of future issuance policy is a key aspect to the\nvalue of a currency.\nAn important illustration of this is Thomas J. Sargent’s\nfamous paper, “The Ends of Four Big Inflations.”*\nSargent reviewed hyperinflations in four countries\nfollowing WWI and found that they all ended with credible\ncommitments to future policy.\n\n* T.J. Sargent, “The Ends of Four Big Inflations,” in Inflation: Causes and Effects, R.E. Hall, ed., University of Chicago\nPress, 1982.\n21\n\n\fThe end of hyperinflation in Austria\n\nSource: Figure 2.1 from Sargent (1982).\n22\n\n\fThe Chaos of Exchange Rates\n\n23\n\n\fThe single-currency solution\n•\n•\n\nSocieties have disliked non-uniform currency systems\nbecause the currencies trade at different values—that is,\ndifferent exchange rates.\nThis can be avoided by having a uniform currency.\no Panama is a country that does this by being dollarized.\no The country accepts the U.S. monetary policy and the\n\n•\n\nexchange rates associated with the dollar.\n\nIf this happened with a cryptocurrency, that country would\nbe accepting the monetary policy embedded in the code,\nalong with exchange rates associated with that particular\ncryptocurrency.\n24\n\n\fLocal versus global uniformity\n•\n•\n•\n\nLocally, countries have wanted a uniform currency.\nGlobally, we do not have a uniform currency. Instead we\nhave a system of competing currencies with exchange rates.\nI am arguing that the current cryptocurrency wave may be\ndriving the U.S. uniform currency system toward\nsomething more like the international non-uniform currency\nsystem.\n\n25\n\n\fThe controversial international\nmonetary order\n•\n\n•\n•\n\nGenerally speaking, the international monetary order\nremains controversial, as the currencies seem to fluctuate\nexcessively, attracting speculative trading and altering real\ncapital flows.\nGovernments can and do devalue suddenly, forcing\ninvestors to price in devaluation risk premia.\nThis could be viewed as a distraction from the real business\nat hand, which is to use the price system to judge and\nassign value to goods and services globally.\n\n26\n\n\fExcessive exchange rate volatility\n•\n•\n•\n\n•\n\nThe chart on the next slide illustrates what many consider\nto be excessive FX volatility.\nIn the chart, the change in the yen-dollar exchange rate is\nmuch more volatile than fundamentals, such as real GDP\ngrowth in the U.S. and in Japan, which is also plotted.\nThe chart is impressive because both the U.S. and Japan\nhave had relatively stable monetary policies during this\nperiod, but the exchange rate has fluctuated widely\nnevertheless.\nBottom line: The global non-uniform currency system\nfeatures volatile exchange rates. A local non-uniform\ncurrency system may have similar volatility.\n27\n\n\fThe volatility of foreign exchange\n\nSources: International Monetary Fund, Bureau of Economic Analysis and author’s calculations. Last observations: June\n2018 and 2018-Q1.\n28\n\n\fFamous arguments on FX volatility\n•\n\nHere is my take on some of the many views of FX\nvolatility:\no Hayekian: The chart shows that governments cannot be\n\ntrusted to maintain the value of their currencies.\no Friedmanian: The chart shows markets at work.\no Wallacian: The chart shows that the relative price between\ntwo intrinsically worthless objects is indeterminate.\no Mundellian: The chart shows a deadweight loss from nonuniform currency arrangements.\n\n29\n\n\fConclusion\n\n30\n\n\fConclusions\n•\n•\n•\n\nThe U.S. is drifting toward non-uniform currency trading\narrangements, a system the society has disliked historically.\nGlobally, we have an example of a non-uniform system of\ncurrencies, but these currencies trade at exchange rates that\nare often viewed as excessively volatile.\nConclusion:\no Cryptocurrencies may unwittingly be pushing in the\nwrong direction in trying to solve an important social\nproblem, which is how best to facilitate market-based\nexchange.\n\n31\n\n\fConnect With Us\nJames Bullard\n\nstlouisfed.org/from-the-president\nSTLOUISFED.ORG\n\nFederal Reserve\nEconomic Data\n(FRED)\n\nThousands of data\nseries, millions of users\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nBlogs and\nPublications\n\nNews and views\nabout the economy\nand the Fed\n\nEconomic\nEducation\nResources\n\nFor every stage\nof life\n\nCommunity\nDevelopment\n\nPromoting financial\nstability of families,\nneighborhoods\n\nECONOMY MUSEUM\n\n32\n\n\f",

He noted that yield curve inversion is\nbest avoided in the near term by caution in raising the fed funds rate. “Given tame U.S.\nin�ation expectations, it is unnecessary to push monetary policy normalization to such an\nextent that the yield curve inverts,” he said.\nPresentation:\n\n\fAudience Q&A:\n\nST.

(FDIC)\nSt. Louis, Mo. Oct. 3, 2018\nI am pleased to welcome everyone to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis for the sixth\nannual community banking research and policy conference.\nI am also pleased to welcome the FDIC as an of�cial conference sponsor, starting this year.\nThe Federal Reserve and the FDIC work closely with the state banking regulatory\nauthorities to supervise our nation’s state-chartered banks—the vast majority of which are\ncommunity banks. Due to this shared supervisory role, the Fed, CSBS and FDIC have mutual\n\n\finterests in understanding the opportunities and challenges facing community banks and\nin promoting quality academic research that helps inform policy decisions that affect the\nindustry.\nToday, we are looking at a somewhat different set of opportunities and challenges than\nwhen this conference was �rst launched in 2013. Regulatory burden and the potential\nimpacts of the Dodd-Frank Act dominated the discussion during the �rst few years of the\nconference. Although concerns over regulatory burden are still on the minds of community\nbankers, attention is shifting to the opportunities and challenges posed by technology.\nOn some level, these concerns aren’t new: Banks have always had to keep current on the\nlatest technological innovations impacting their industry. But the pace of change and\ngrowing cyber threat environment have accelerated the impact as the number of new\n�nancial technology �rms seems to be increasing rapidly.\nAs new �nancial technology offerings entered the marketplace, we heard regular assertions\nthat �ntechs would “disrupt” the �nancial services industry—or perhaps even replace it.\nBold statements were frequent: Fintech �rms are going to “upend relationship lending,”\nthey will “provide unprecedented credit access to the underserved,” �ntech will “make\nbranch banking obsolete.”\nTo date, those assertions have not been ful�lled. Indeed, we have seen signi�cant\ncooperation between �ntech �rms and �nancial institutions because of their mutual\ninterests, and importantly, because �ntech �rms have largely relied on banks to clear and\nsettle their transactions. We are aware of many successful and responsible partnerships.\nFor the most part, these partnerships work well, allowing banks to offer products and\nservices that may have been out of reach previously, or engage new customers and new\nmarkets that had previously been closed to them. I understand we will close this year’s\nconference with a panel that speci�cally explores the future of community banking through\nthe lens of those who have engaged in these types of partnerships.\nThese partnerships, of course, are not without risk. Increasingly, we are hearing stories of\n�ntech companies interested in their own �nancial services charters—special purpose\ncharters, industrial loan company charters or traditional bank charters. While traditional\nbank charters provide a level playing �eld in terms of the regulatory and supervisory\nprocess, the options and opportunities with other forms of charters are yet unknown.\nFor those banks partnering with �ntech �rms or using their services, there is also some\ndegree of uncertainty. I mentioned cyber risk earlier. We are very cognizant of the potential\nfor growing interconnectivity in our �nancial system. I anticipate that operational risk will\nsomeday equal or exceed credit risk for many community banks.\n\n\fWe also recognize the uncertainty of the impact of the use of arti�cial intelligence on the\nunderwriting of credit and its impact on �nancial markets during economic cycles.\nProviders of these services must be vigilant about providing fair and equal access to credit.\nThere must be mechanisms to ensure credit availability even during stressed economic\ncycles. One of the lessons learned from the �nancial crisis was that the volume of small\nbusiness loans fell substantially in larger banking organizations. This was often not due to\nliquidity or capital issues. Indeed, it is possible that automated underwriting mechanisms\nwere an important contributing factor.\nThe changing landscape of �nancial services is an important reason for this conference.\nThe impacts of automation on the �nancial services industry have been substantial in\nrecent years, and the pace of change will likely only increase. Across the country, cities are\nmaking investments in technology incubators to improve the ef�ciency of common\nbusiness processes. In the St. Louis Fed’s District, we have examples of these technology\nand innovation hubs including the Cortex and T-REX innovation communities in St. Louis\nand the Little Rock technology park in Little Rock, Ark., which are enabling innovation in\nseveral industry sectors. Perhaps their innovations will be the topic of a future conference.\nIn closing, I want to thank you all, our in-person and webcast audience for your\nparticipation in this year’s event. It is your ideas, your questioning, your debating and your\nengagement that make this conference what it is and enable it to have the impact it has had.\nI look forward to another successful conference.\nAnd now I would like to introduce our keynote speaker to begin today’s conference.\nLoretta Mester is the president and chief executive of�cer of the Federal Reserve Bank of\nCleveland, a position she has held since June 2014.\nPrior to her current position, she served as executive vice president and director of\nresearch at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.\nLoretta is originally from Baltimore, Md. She graduated from Barnard College of Columbia\nUniversity with a Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics and economics. She earned M.A.\nand Ph.D. degrees in economics from Princeton University, where she was a National\nScience Foundation Fellow.\nAlthough this is her �rst time attending the conference, she had a paper that she coauthored presented here during the 2016 conference. That paper, titled “Is Bigger\nNecessarily Better in Community Banking?,” examined economies of scale among publicly\ntraded community banks. Her research on banking gives her a unique perspective on the\nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and brings great perspective to this year’s\nconference.\n\n\fPlease join me in welcoming Loretta to this year’s conference.\n1\n\nAny opinions expressed here are my own and do not necessarily re�ect those of the\nFederal Open Market Committee.\n\n\f",

A participant on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee, Bullard focused his presentation on modernizing monetary policy rules.\nAbout 150 business and community leaders, as well as economists, attended the event, held\non the campus of the University of Memphis.\nDuring his talk, Bullard discussed modernizing a popular monetary policy rule, a version of\nthe Taylor rule, whose construction was based on U.S. data from the 1980s and 1990s. Since\nthen, he noted, three important macroeconomic developments have altered key elements of\npolicy rule construction. These developments are lower short-term real interest rates, the\ndisappearing Phillips curve and better measures of in�ation expectations. “Incorporating\nthese developments yields a modernized policy rule that suggests the current level of the\npolicy rate is about right over the forecast horizon,” Bullard said.\nVideo of Presentation and Audience Q&A:\n\n\fBullard was on a two-day tour of Memphis, Tenn., where the St. Louis Fed has a Branch.\nBesides meeting with civic leaders, Bullard toured a charter school that once housed the\nMemphis Branch and attended a special dinner commemorating the Branch’s centennial.\nAmong other activities, he met with current and former members of the Branch’s board of\ndirectors on Friday, Oct. 19.\nBullard frequently visits communities in the four zones that make up the St. Louis Fed’s\nDistrict. The other three zones are based in Little Rock, Ark., Louisville, Ky., and St. Louis.\n\nBefore his presentation Thursday, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard mingled with some of the\napproximately 150 people in attendance at the Economic Club of Memphis event.\n\n\fDownload High Resolution Photo\n\nIn his presentation about monetary policy rules, Bullard focused on modernizing the long-popular Taylor rule.\nDownload High Resolution Photo\n\nAnother stop for Bullard was the Memphis Grizzlies Preparatory Charter School.

Regarding normalization, he said, “The campaign has been largely\nsuccessful: Nominal short-term interest rates have been raised from near-zero levels, and\nthe size of the Fed’s balance sheet has been reduced as the economic expansion has\ncontinued.”\nWhile normalization has come to an end, the conduct of monetary policy has not, Bullard\npointed out. “The FOMC may elect to adjust monetary policy going forward, but any such\nadjustments would be in response to incoming macroeconomic data and not part of an\nongoing normalization strategy,” he said.\nBullard went on to discuss the macroeconomic challenges facing the FOMC during 2019,\nincluding weak feedback from labor markets to in�ation. He also noted that in�ation\nexpectations remain somewhat low and parts of the Treasury yield curve are inverted.\n“These market-based signals indicate that the FOMC needs to tread carefully going forward\nin order to sustain the economic expansion,” he added.\nBullard was on a two-day tour of Tupelo and Greenwood, Miss., and the surrounding\ncommunities. Besides meeting with business and civic leaders, Bullard also toured the\nToyota Motor Manufacturing Mississippi Inc. plant in Blue Springs and visited Staplcotn, the\noldest and one of the largest cotton marketing cooperatives in the U.S. On Thursday night,\nBullard also spoke before community and business leaders on the St. Louis Fed’s efforts to\npromote community development.\nBullard frequently visits communities in the four zones that make up the St. Louis Fed’s\nDistrict.

I’m\nKaren Mracek, your host for this podcast. With me today is St. Louis Fed President Jim\nBullard, and we will be discussing nominal GDP targeting. President Bullard, thank you for\nbeing here.\nJames Bullard: Thanks for having me.\nMracek: Before we jump into speci�cs of nominal GDP targeting, can you tell us a bit about\nhow the Fed maintains price stability now, and why we are talking today about a different\napproach?\n\n\fBullard: My view of this is that, beginning in the 1990s, there was a coming together of the\nacademic literature and practitioners in central banking around the concept of in�ation\ntargeting, which, roughly speaking, meant that central banks named an in�ation target and\nconducted monetary policy in such a way as to hit that in�ation target over the medium\nterm. And this is commonplace today, but at the time was a big shift compared to the ’70s\nand ’80s where there weren’t any in�ation targets, and it wasn’t at all clear, relatively\nspeaking, what the various central banks were doing.\nI have to say, in the big picture, that in�ation targeting has been crazy successful. In�ation\nhas been much lower and much closer to these in�ation targets across the countries that\nadopted them. In�ation’s been much less variable than it was in the ’70s and ’80s. The\nin�ation expectations in these various countries have become much less volatile and much\nmore clustered around the in�ation targets. So, in�ation targeting has been a great success\nstory, and the question now would be, can you improve on that?\nMracek: Can you explain, then, what nominal GDP targeting is, and how is it different from\nin�ation targeting?\nBullard: In in�ation targeting, we would name the in�ation target, but if we missed the\nin�ation target, either on the high side or the low side, you wouldn’t be too worried about it.\nYou’d say, “Well, OK, we’ll try to hit it again next year or over the medium term, and we\nwon’t worry about the fact that we’ve missed it this year or maybe several years in a row.”\nWith price-level targeting or its close cousin nominal income targeting, you would worry\nabout past misses, and you would try to make up for past misses in such a way that you\nwould stay on a path for the price level or a path for nominal GDP, depending on which route\nyou went. But they’re closely related.\nSo the main difference is that private-sector investors would understand that you were\ngoing to make up for past losses, and they would understand that if you missed to the low\nside in the past, this would mean that future policy would likely miss to the high side for a\nlittle while. And, vice versa, if you missed on the high side for a while, then you would\nprobably miss on the low side in the future for a little while.\nAnd, in so doing, at least in theory, this would further cement in�ation expectations—even\nmore than they’ve already been controlled by the in�ation targeting regime that’s been in\nplace the last 25 years. You would further pin down in�ation expectations, and therefore,\nget even better monetary policy than what we’ve had over that period of time.\nMracek: To clarify, when you talk about nominal GDP targeting, are you referring to\ntargeting the level of GDP or the growth rate?\nBullard: At least in the simplest examples, it would be the level of nominal GDP. You’d have\n\n\fa projected path for that level, and you would be right on that path all the time, every year. I\nmean, practically speaking, that’s not what would happen, but ideally that’s what would\nhappen.\nMracek: How would nominal GDP targeting work in theory?\nBullard: I do have this paper called “Optimal Monetary Policy Masses,” which is only one\nout of a sea of papers on this issue. In that paper, there are big private credit markets as\nthere are in the real world. But in the model, those credit markets don’t quite work the way\nthey should because all the trading takes place in nominal terms and it is non-state\ncontingent.\nAnd because of that, the monetary policy can follow this nominal GDP targeting rule, and\nthat �xes the problem that would otherwise exist in credit markets, and therefore gets a\nmore smoothly operating credit market than you would otherwise have.\nSo, this would be an improvement to the equilibrium of the economy and everyone in the\neconomy would be much happier than if you didn’t do this. And so that provides one\nrationale for nominal GDP targeting in a theoretical setting.\nThat’s just one possible way you could talk about this issue inside of a model, but I think it’s\nan interesting one.\nMracek: Can you give us an example of when the monetary policy response under nominal\nGDP targeting might be different from in�ation targeting?\nBullard: Yeah, even right now, when the Fed looks back on the in�ation outcomes since\n2012, we’ve generally missed to the low side of our in�ation target. And, as I was saying\nearlier, under in�ation targeting, that’s just treated as a bygone, and you don’t worry about\nthat, which means that the way the Fed is treating it right now is that, yes, we’ve missed in\nthe past, but we’re just going to promise to hit the target in the future, and then that will be\nthat.\nBut under nominal GDP targeting, you wouldn’t be satis�ed with that. You would say, “I want\nto make up for the fact that I missed to the low side over several years,” and therefore it’d be\nOK if you allowed in�ation to be higher for several years in order to have it average out over\na longer period of time to hit your 2% in�ation target.\nIn some ways, at a very simple level, there’s just more commitment to the idea that you’re\nactually going to hit the 2% target instead of saying that, “Well, we’ll try to hit it, but if we\nmiss it, then there’s no guarantee.”\nThis nominal income targeting idea would be a way to make sure that you hit the target over\n\n\flonger periods of time.\nMracek: What would be the advantages of using nominal GDP targeting?\nBullard: The biggest advantage is this idea that you would really cement in�ation\nexpectations around the target. This would give investors and �nancial market participants,\nhouseholds, businesses, the con�dence that the central bank really was going to deliver on\nwhat it said. It was going to deliver this 2% in�ation rate. They could use that in their\nplanning, and they could be reasonably con�dent that that was going to be the actual\noutcome in the economy over longer periods of time. This would help with getting the best\nallocation of real resources that we can get. So, that would be the principal advantage.\nI think the question about both nominal GDP targeting and price-level targeting is whether\nthe additional gains that you would get are going to be that big compared to what you\nalready are getting from in�ation targeting. I started this off by saying in�ation targeting\nhas been crazy successful, and I think that’s the right view of the last 25 years in the\ncountries that have adopted in�ation targeting. I said it’s been a way better experience than\nthe ’70s and ’80s where you had in�ation expectations bouncing all over the place and a lot\nmore volatility. You got both nominal volatility, but also more recessions and more frequent\nrecessions.\nMost of that has smoothed out, the �nancial crisis notwithstanding. We’ve managed to have\nmore moderation in real variables and nominal variables in the in�ation targeting era, even\nthough we had the big �nancial crisis. But that’s only one part of the last 25 years.\nMracek: And are there any disadvantages to nominal GDP targeting?\nBullard: Some people say it hasn’t been tried, and it would be hard to communicate. And I\nthink one way to convey that idea is that it really relies on private-sector expectations\nunderstanding the policy, and because they understand the policy, they expect in�ation to\nbe right around 2%. And because of that, you get good things to happen in the economy.\nIt’s the kind of thing where you might say, “OK, we switched to nominal GDP targeting.”\nNobody notices in the entire economy. No one pays any attention whatsoever, and you don’t\nget any of these effects at all. I think that would be the kind of thing that is very practical and\ncould possibly happen, because private-sector people might say, “Well, I don’t understand\nit,” or, “I don’t see what the difference is between this and in�ation targeting. It’s all too\nsubtle.”\nThe theories are relying on these things being really tight and really affecting these\nexpectations a lot. But the reality might be a lot more distant than that.\nMracek: One common criticism is that stag�ation is consistent with nominal GDP targeting.\n\n\fWhat is your thought on that?\nBullard: Stag�ation is a term from the ’70s when both unemployment and in�ation were\nhigh—at one point both in double-digit ranges in the early 1980s—and this came to be called\nstag�ation. It was considered a bad outcome.\nThere is an aspect of this with price-level targeting and nominal GDP targeting because\ngood times are the times when in�ation would run below target, and bad times are the\ntimes when in�ation would run above target. And that’s different than what we’re used to.\nBut when you think about it, bad times are times when you want the somewhat higher\nin�ation because that’s supposed to drive the real interest rate lower, and that is what is\nsupposed to get you out of the recession and help you during recessionary times. So it does\nhave a certain logic to it, even though we had this sour experience from the ’70s.\nI don’t think anybody’s talking about that kind of in�ation or that kind of volatility that we\nhad at that time. That’s not something you’d want. You’d want sort of mildly higher in�ation\nin bad times, and mildly softer in�ation during good times. So I think it’s more contained\nthan anything that happened during the ’70s, which was quite volatile.\nMracek: I think you touched on this, but have any central banks used nominal GDP\ntargeting?\nBullard: No, not to my knowledge. And one of the criticisms is that we barely got everybody\nconverted over to in�ation targeting, and now you’d be switching again. The U.S., in\nparticular, only named its in�ation target in 2012. Japan’s another country that didn’t come\naround to in�ation targeting until relatively recently.\nAnd so it’s not clear that you want to, then, make another change. Although I would say, if\nyou’re going to make a change, you should make it during good times, not try to improvise\nwhen it’s a very volatile area or high recession risk or something like that. If you wanted to\nmake the change during calm, successful times for the economy, that’s probably the time to\ndo it.\nI do think that one of the advantages of in�ation targeting was that smaller countries took it\non �rst and experimented with it, showed how it could be done, and then you had,\neventually, the founding of the ECB [European Central Bank] coming on in the late ’90s, and\nthen the Fed following through later. And so you kind of tested it out in other places before\nyou had the world’s leading economies adopting it.\nIf the U.S. moved �rst and went with price-level targeting or nominal GDP targeting, that\nwould be a different kettle of �sh, and that would be something that has to be thought about\ncarefully, I think. You’d be setting a trend in a global environment, and other countries\n\n\fwould likely follow.\nMracek: That make sense. Would the average consumer notice a difference if a central bank\nswitched from in�ation targeting to nominal GDP targeting?\nBullard: I don’t really think so. I think the person on the street would regard everything as\nbeing about the same. But again, this is really more about cementing expectations in\n�nancial markets and the way bond markets, in particular, would operate under this kind of\na regime as opposed to the one we’re using now. And so I don’t think a typical person would\nsee much difference.\nMracek: Theoretically, if the Fed were to adopt nominal GDP targeting, would it capture\nboth sides of the dual mandate—that is, stable prices and maximum sustainable\nemployment?\nBullard: It would, because—at least in theory, if this was the true optimal policy—this would\nmean you’d get the best allocation of resources, which would include labor resources so that\nlabor would be supplied exactly at the rate that households would desire. And this would be\nthe best employment outcomes that you could get for the economy. So it’s all supposed to\nwork at least on paper. Whether that actually works in the real world is certainly an area\nthat people like to debate.\nMracek: Got it. Is there anything else you want our listeners to know about this topic or how\nthe Fed thinks about maintaining price stability?\nBullard: Well, I think it’s under review in 2019, and it’s something the Fed will consider, I\nthink, as part of its review. I think it’s good to be thinking about possible innovation in\nmonetary policy frameworks as time goes on. Surely, the framework we’re using today will\nnot be the same one we’re using 50 years from now. And, in order to be able to evolve at the\nright moments, we have to have regular reviews and think about these issues. And I think\nthat’s the purpose of this framework review in 2019.\nMracek: Great.

Bullard, 2018, “R-Star Wars: The Phantom Menace,” Business Economics, 53(2), pp. 60-65.\n3\n\n\fKey themes\n• The main themes are:\no r* is, in practice, a low-frequency trend measure of a short-term real\n\ninterest rate, and this talk will take a regime-switching view of this issue.\n\no Observed low real interest rates are associated with government debt, not\n\nnecessarily with capital.\n\no There appears to be a large demand for safe assets globally, and this may\n\nbe the largest factor driving real interest rates to low levels in the past\nthree decades.\n\no There is only modest evidence that key trends influencing the natural rate\n\nof interest are changing today.\n\n4\n\n\fRaw Data and the Trend\n\n5\n\n\fShort-term real interest rates\n• This talk views the natural real rate of interest as the trend component\n•\n•\n•\n\nof short-term real interest rates.\nThe Fed can influence the real rate of interest but not the trend in the\nreal rate of interest, which is viewed as driven by fundamental factors.\nI will call the slow-moving trend value “r-dagger” (or r†).\nThere are many ways to detrend the data.\n\n6\n\n\fRaw data\n• The raw data for this talk are one-year ex-post real interest rates on\n•\n\nU.S. Treasury bills from 1984 to the present.1\nMany possible methods to detrend the data:\no Use a constant as in Taylor (1993).2\n\no Use a model, such as Holston et al. (2017) or Del Negro et al. (2017).3\no Use a linear trend.\n\no Use an atheoretical filter, like the Hodrick-Prescott filter.\n\n1 Forward-looking\n\nmeasures, based on the FRB of Cleveland data, are similar but more volatile.\nTaylor, 1993, “Discretion versus policy rules in practice,” Carnegie-Rochester Conference Series on Public Policy,\n39, pp. 195-214.\n3 K.

Last observations: 2019-Q1 and 2018-Q4.\n9\n\n\fA regime-switching view\n• In this talk, I will give a regime-switching view of these issues.\n• Fundamental factors—mostly the same as those that others have\n•\n•\n\nlooked at—are viewed as switching between high-mean and low-mean\nstates.\nTo center the analysis, I will consider all issues in the context of a\nTaylor-type policy rule.\nI will give the policy implications of my view at the end of the talk.\n\n10\n\n\fThe Natural Rate of Interest in a\nTaylor-Type Policy Rule\n\n11\n\n\fWhy worry about r†?\n• In a Taylor-type rule, the trend natural real interest rate, rt† ,\n\n•\n•\n\ndetermines the intercept:\nit = rt† + πte + ϕπ πtGAP + ϕy ytGAP,\nwhere πte = π* = 2 percent, the FOMC’s inflation target.\nWhen the gaps are zero, a Taylor-type rule simply recommends setting\nthe policy rate equal to the value of rt† plus the inflation target.\nBut what is the value of rt†?\n\n12\n\n\fDecomposing the natural real rate\n• One way to think of the underlying or trend natural real rate of interest\n•\n•\n•\n\nis to divide it into three factors:\nrt† = λt + ψt + ξt, where\nλt: the labor productivity growth rate\nψt: the labor force growth rate\nξt: an investor desire for safe assets. A strong desire for safe assets\nwould imply a relatively large negative value for ξt, whereas an\nordinary desire for safe assets would imply a value closer to zero.\n\n13\n\n\fA model with this decomposition\n• One model that produces a decomposition of this sort is outlined in\n•\n•\n•\n\n1 J.\n\n“Optimal Monetary Policy for the Masses.”1\nThe model is a 241-period life-cycle DSGE with certain “symmetry\nassumptions.”\nA balanced growth path of the model would have a decomposition\ncomparable to the one outlined in the previous slide.\nThis provides one concept of the Wicksellian natural real rate of\ninterest.\n\nBullard and R. DiCecio, 2019, “Optimal Monetary Policy for the Masses,” FRB of St. Louis Working Paper No. 2019-009C.\n14\n\n\fLonger-run outcomes as regimes\n• This conception of the natural real rate of interest suggests r† will have\n•\n•\n\na constant mean associated with a single possible balanced growth\npath.\nThe point of this presentation is that this mean may be better modeled\nas shifting over time.\nShifting means can be modeled as regime-switching processes.\no For example, relatively long eras of high productivity growth may be\n\nfollowed by relatively long eras of low productivity growth, and the\nnatural rate of interest would be different in the two regimes.\n\n15\n\n\fThe declining trend is on government paper\nonly, not on capital\n• The raw data show a declining trend on an ex-post real return to\n•\n•\n•\n\nholding government paper.\nThe declining trend does not appear to extend to ex-post real returns on\nclaims to capital as measured from the U.S. GDP accounts.\nThat return has been fairly constant since the 1980s, as shown in the\nnext chart.\nThis provides a rationale for the inclusion of the ξ factor above, which\nmeasures the desirability of holding safe assets relative to capital.1\n\nFor an alternative perspective on this issue, see J.C. Williams, “Three Questions on R-star,” FRB of San Francisco\nEconomic Letter No. 2017-05, Feb. 21, 2017.\n\n1\n\n16\n\n\fReal returns on capital and safe assets\n\nSources: P. Gomme, B. Ravikumar and P. Rupert. “Secular Stagnation and Returns on Capital,” FRB of St. Louis Economic\nSynopses No. 19, 2015; Federal Reserve Board; FRB of Dallas; and author’s calculations. Last observation: 2019-Q1.\n17\n\n\fMain question\n• Which of the three factors is most important in accounting for the\n•\n\n•\n•\n\ndownward trend? Is it productivity growth, labor force growth or the\ndesirability of safe assets?\nI will treat each of these three factors as following a two-state Markovswitching intercept process:\nxt = x(st) + εt , where εt is an i.i.d. error term\nst can take two values, high and low.\nThe two possible mean values are called regimes.\nThe idea is that these types of factors generally have constant means,\nbut that there can be infrequent shifts in mean. I want to characterize\nthese shifts statistically.\n\n18\n\n\fLabor Productivity Growth\n\n19\n\n\fU.S. labor productivity growth has been low\n• A statistical model that estimates the probability that the U.S. economy\n•\n•\n\nis in a low-productivity-growth regime puts nearly all the probability\non the low-growth regime.1\nThe most recent estimates, based on the Kahn and Rich (2006, 2007)\nmethodology, put the growth rate in the low (high) state at 1.33 percent\n(2.96 percent).2\nThe U.S. economy was in the high-productivity-growth regime from\nearly 1997 to late 2004.\n\nSee J.A. Kahn and R.W. Rich, 2006, “Tracking Productivity in Real Time,” FRB of New York, Current Issues in\nEconomics and Finance, 12(8); and J.A. Kahn and R.W. Rich, 2007, “Tracking the New Economy: Using Growth Theory\nto Detect Changes in Trend Productivity,” Journal of Monetary Economics, 54(6), pp. 1670-1701.\n2 In previous talks, I have used even lower productivity growth assumptions.\n1\n\n20\n\n\fLabor productivity growth\n\nSources: Kahn and Rich (2006, 2007) and FRB of New York. Last observation: 2019-Q1.\n21\n\n\fLabor Force Growth\n\n22\n\n\fLabor force growth has been low\n• The U.S. labor force had been growing at a 1.33 percent annual rate\n•\n•\n•\n\nuntil the financial crisis.\nThe growth rate has been 0.53 percent since the financial crisis.\nIt appears that the U.S. is in a low-growth state, but statistically the\ntwo regimes are not precisely estimated.\nIn discussing the policy implications below, I will consider the\npossibility that the U.S. is in either state.\n\n23\n\n\fLabor force growth\n\nSources: Bureau of Labor Statistics and author’s calculations. Last observation: April 2019.\n24\n\n\fInvestors’ Desire for Safe Assets\n\n25\n\n\fStrong desire versus a more normal desire\nfor safe assets\n• I now remove the regime-switching trends for both labor productivity\n•\n•\n\nand labor force growth from the raw data on ex-post safe real returns.\nThis leaves us with a time series of adjusted safe real returns, and this\nseries still has a downward trend.\nI then fit a two-state regime-switching process to these residual values,\nand I interpret the two states as a strong desire for safe assets versus a\nmore normal desire for safe assets.\n\n26\n\n\fHigh-desire-for-safe-assets regime\n• The estimated values for ξ are -2.94 percent in the high-desire-for-safe•\n•\n\nassets regime and 0.62 percent in the normal-desire-for-safe-assets\nregime.\nThe U.S. is currently in the regime with a high desire for safe assets.\nThe difference between the two regimes is largest for this factor; in\nsome sense, it is the “most important” of the three.\n\n27\n\n\fDesire-for-safe-assets regimes\n\nSource: Author’s calculations.

Last observation: March 2019.\n31\n\n\fState values for each factor\n\nFactor\nLabor productivity growth, λ\nLabor force growth, ψ\nInvestor desire for safe assets (inverse), ξ\nMax/min natural rate, r†\n\n296\n133\n62\n\nHigh-low\nstate\ndifference\n133\n163\n53\n80\n-294\n356\n\n491\n\n-108\n\nHigh\nstate\n\nLow\nstate\n\n599\n\nAll values are expressed as basis points. The max (min) natural rate is the value corresponding to all\nthree factors taking the value in the high (low) state.\n\n32\n\n\fUsing the regime-switching approach\n• Labor productivity appears to be in the low-growth regime: λ = 1.33\n•\n•\n•\n\npercent.\nThe labor force appears to be in the low-growth regime as well: ψ =\n0.53 percent. Plausibly, labor force growth could be interpreted as still\nconsistent with the high-growth regime, ψ = 1.33 percent.\nThere also appears to be a high desire for safe assets: ξ = -2.94 percent.\nAccording to this analysis, r† = λ + ψ + ξ is either -108 basis points or\n-28 basis points, depending on how one views labor force growth.\n\n33\n\n\fRecent Related Estimates\nfrom the Literature\n\n34\n\n\fRelated literature and regime switching\n• There is a fairly large and growing literature trying to understand the\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\ndownward trend in the natural real rate of interest.\nThe literature tends to be quite a bit more sophisticated than the\nanalysis presented here.\nThe only point here is to think in terms of regime switching.\nTwo of the three factors analyzed—labor productivity growth and the\ndesire for safe assets—are in the low state and do not appear to be\nshifting to the high state.\nThis suggests the natural safe real rate of interest, and hence the Fed’s\npolicy rate, can remain low over the forecast horizon.\n\n35\n\n\fRelated literature on the natural rate\n• Laubach and Williams (2003) impose a structural model and estimate a\nrelatively low r*.1\n\no Holston et al. (2017) extend the analysis to other countries.\n\n• Curdia (2015) performs a similar analysis with somewhat altered\n•\n•\n\nassumptions and gets a very low r*.2\nDel Negro et al. (2017) impose a structural model, include an evolving\ndemand for safe assets and get a low value for r*.\nI have imposed less structure along with an alternative stochastic\nconception, regime switching. This suggests a different view of meanreversion properties.\n\n1 T.\n\nLaubach and J.C.

Taylor (1993): ϕπ = 1.5, ϕy = 0.5\n2. Taylor (1999): ϕπ = 1.5, ϕy = 1\no Inflation target:\n\nπ e = π* = 200\n\no The inflation gap:\n\nπ GAP ∈ [-51, -4]\n\no Natural real rate:\no The output gap:\n\nr† ∈ [-108, -28]\n\ny GAP ∈ [44, 207]\n\n42\n\n\fPolicy rate recommendations\n• Based on these data and rules, then\n1. Taylor (1993) implies i ∈ [38, 270].\n2. Taylor (1999) implies i ∈ [60, 373].\n\n• The Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) target range for the\n•\n\nfederal funds rate today is 225 to 250 basis points, and the federal\nfunds rate is trading at about 240 basis points.\nThis value is within the range of the Taylor (1993, 1999)\nrecommendations.\n\n43\n\n\fObservations for Policymakers\n\n44\n\n\fAlternative Taylor-type rules\n• Modernized Taylor-type policy rules tend to put less weight on the\n•\n•\n\noutput gap term.1\nIf we use a coefficient ϕy = 0.1, keeping other values the same, then the\nTaylor rule recommends lower policy rates: i ∈ [20, 187].\nIn this case, the actual U.S. policy rate setting would appear to be\nsomewhat high.\n\nSee J. Bullard, “Modernizing Monetary Policy Rules,” remarks delivered at the Economic Club of Memphis, Memphis,\nTenn., Oct. 18, 2018; and J. Bullard, “More on Modern Monetary Policy Rules,” remarks delivered at the Indiana\nEconomic Outlook Forum, Carmel, Ind., Dec. 7, 2018.\n1\n\n45\n\n\fLess demand for safe assets\n• The desire for safe assets has a large effect on the policy rate\n•\n\nrecommendation.\nIf the desire for safe assets returns to a low level, then r† ∈ [248, 328]\nand\n1. Taylor (1993) implies i ∈ [394, 626].\n2. Taylor (1999) implies i ∈ [416, 729].\n\n• This portion of the analysis suggests that better understanding of the\n\nworldwide demand for safe assets is critical to future monetary policy.\n\n46\n\n\fMean-reversion properties\n• The regime-switching approach suggests that the current setting of the\n•\n•\n\npolicy rate in the U.S. may be somewhat restrictive.\nIt also suggests that r† is unlikely to shift over a forecast horizon of two\nyears (the typical time frame for monetary policy decisions).\nThis means that forward guidance should be characterized by a\nrelatively flat policy rate path, as opposed to an upward-sloping one\nthat would be appropriate if r† has strong mean reversion.\no The FOMC median Summary of Economic Projections has adopted a\n\nrelatively flat policy rate path in recent communications.\n\n47\n\n\fConclusions\n\n48\n\n\fConclusions\n• This analysis has provided some background on how one might begin\n•\n•\n\nto think about recent trends in the natural safe real rate of interest in a\nregime-switching context.\nAccording to the analysis presented here, the natural safe real rate of\ninterest, and hence the appropriate policy rate, is relatively low and\nunlikely to change very much over the forecast horizon.\nA more rigorous and thorough analysis that reaches a similar\nconclusion is Del Negro et al.

He noted that the Federal\nOpen Market Committee’s monetary policy normalization program has been successful in that\nU.S. real economic performance has been very good during the normalization.\nThe normalization of U.S. monetary policy has come to a close at an appropriate point, Bullard\nnoted. “Going forward, the FOMC may adjust monetary policy, but any changes would be in\nresponse to incoming macroeconomic data and not part of an ongoing normalization strategy,”\nhe said.\nThe FOMC faces many macroeconomic challenges, Bullard explained, including unresolved\ntrade disputes and below-target inflation. “These challenges suggest that the FOMC needs to\ntread carefully in order to help sustain the economic expansion,” he said.\nHe noted that the FOMC may want to consider ways to re-center inflation and inflation\nexpectations at the 2% target. “A downward policy rate adjustment even with relatively good\nreal economic performance may help maintain the credibility of the FOMC’s inflation target\ngoing forward,” Bullard said. “A policy rate move of this sort may become a more attractive\noption if inflation data continue to disappoint.”\n\nFOLLOW US\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/from-the-president/speeches-and-presentations/2019/a-successful-normalization-of-monetary-policy\n\n1/2\n\n\f12/21/22, 5:39 PM\n\nA Successful Normalization of Monetary Policy in the U.S. | James Bullard | St. Louis Fed\n\nSIGN UP FOR EMAIL ALERTS\nReceive updates in your inbox as soon as new content is published on our website\nSIGN UP\nQUICK LINKS\nAbout Us\nLegal Information\nContact Us\nPrivacy Policy\nCareers\nDoing Business with the Fed\nEvents\nFederal Reserve Services\nVisiting the St. Louis Fed\nFederal Banking Regulations\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/from-the-president/speeches-and-presentations/2019/a-successful-normalization-of-monetary-policy\n\n2/2\n\n\f",

Why is the\nFed doing this review, and what does it entail? “I\nwould say that it’s best practice among central\nbanks to review their policymaking framework\non a regular basis,” says St. Louis Fed President\nJames Bullard. He also discusses what\npolicymakers will do with the information\ngathered during the review.\n\nTranscript\nKaren Mracek: Welcome to the Timely Topics podcast series from the Federal Reserve\nBank of St. Louis. I’m Karen Mracek, your host for this podcast. With me today is St. Louis\nFed President James Bullard. President Bullard, thank you for being here.\nJames Bullard: Happy to be here.\nMracek: Today we will be talking about the monetary policy framework review that the\nFederal Reserve is currently undertaking. At a high level, what does this review entail?\nBullard: Well, I would say that it’s best practice among central banks to review their\npolicymaking framework on a regular basis, let’s say �ve years or seven years. This was\n\n\fpioneered by the Bank of Canada. And I think this gives an opportunity to think about\nchanges that might be made outside of the normal policy cycle because you don’t want this\nto get wrapped up with current-day decision-making on monetary policy. This is more longrun thinking about monetary policy strategy.\nMracek: OK. So, to be clear, is the dual mandate or the 2% in�ation target under review?\nBullard: The dual mandate would be part of the legislation in the Federal Reserve Act. So,\nthat’s not under review. The in�ation target is something the [Federal Open Market]\nCommittee adopted in 2012, and Chair [Jerome] Powell has said that we’re not going to\nreview that as part of the discussion.\nMracek: Can you tell us a little bit about why the Fed is doing this review now?\nBullard: Macroeconomic outcomes are quite good for the United States. Unemployment is\nnear a 50-year low. In�ation is low and stable. I’ve argued that it’s a little bit too low, but it’s\nbasically low and stable. The economy’s not in recession. So, it’s actually a good time to do\nstrategic thinking for the future. You’re trying to think over �ve or 10 years into the future\nhere. And so, I think it’s a good opportunity for that.\nMracek: OK. So, let’s discuss some of the speci�cs of the review, starting with the monetary\npolicy strategies. Can you tell us a little bit about the Fed’s current strategy for meeting its\ndual mandate of price stability and maximum employment?\nBullard: I think most people would describe the current strategy as in�ation targeting,\nwhich has swept the world of central banking since the 1990s. We named an of�cial\nin�ation target in January 2012. We conduct policy to try to maintain that rate of in�ation\nover time, but we also adjust appropriately to meet the employment side of our mandate.\nAnd ideally, we’d be able to hit both of them at the same time.\nThe only problem with this framework is that it may lead to in�ation being too low on\naverage over time because, as we found out in the last 10 years, the policy rate can hit the\neffective lower bound. And when it does that, then you have to resort to other types of\npolicies like quantitative easing and so on. And because of that, people are thinking about:\nWell, are there ways to better manage the monetary policy framework going forward?\nMracek: What are some ways that the economy has evolved since the �nancial crisis and\nGreat Recession that you might have to take into consideration when looking at the\nmonetary policy framework?\nBullard: I think the biggest issue has been this zero lower bound. We started calling it\neffective lower bound because some countries have negative interest rates now. But the zero\nlower bound means that you kind of get stuck in monetary policy. You can’t move the policy\n\n\frate anymore. And then you have to resort to other types of policies as I was just noting.\nAnd the question is whether you might get stuck at an in�ation rate that’s lower than your\nin�ation target. Certainly, the case in Japan where their policy rate hasn’t been above 50\nbasis points in 20 years and their in�ation rate has been low or negative over that horizon.\nSo, how can we stay out of that kind of trap, I think, is a key issue for this review.\nMracek: What are some possible alternative strategies that the Fed is discussing during this\nreview?\nBullard: The key alternative would be to target the price level instead of targeting the\nin�ation rate, which sounds like a minor change. But what it would say is that you pay\nattention to the fact that you might miss your in�ation target, let’s say, to the low side for a\nwhile. And then you might make up for that by missing your in�ation target to the high side\nfor a while so that, on average, you still hit the in�ation target. That’s often called price-level\ntargeting as opposed to in�ation targeting, which has a subtle difference. In in�ation\ntargeting, if you were below target, you would just try to go back to the target. You wouldn’t\ntry to go above the target.\nSo, the good thing about price-level targeting type strategies is that you hit the in�ation rate\nbetter on average during the long run. And this better cements in�ation expectations, and\nso you get better policy out of that. I would also say that price-level targeting is closely\nrelated to nominal GDP targeting, which is another version of the same idea basically.\nMracek: Turning to the review of monetary policy tools, are the tools that the Fed currently\nuses adequate for setting the stance of monetary policy?\nBullard: Well, that’s part of this discussion. Normal times would call for adjustments to the\npolicy rate up or down in various situations depending on how the economy’s evolving. And\nthat’s how you would conduct monetary policy. Certainly all during the [former Fed\nChairman Alan] Greenspan era, for instance, that’s exactly what we did. A lot of theory and\nempirics grew up around analyzing just that particular channel.\nBut when you hit the zero lower bound or the effective lower bound, then a whole new set of\ntools comes on board. Probably the most famous one is quantitative easing or bond-buying\nprograms by central banks. The Fed did a lot of that during the period when we were at the\neffective lower bound.\nBut there are other policies. Forward guidance is another one. And I think a good question\nfor this review is how effective forward guidance is when you’re not at the zero lower bound.\nWhen you’re away from the zero lower bound, should you be giving guidance on where you\nthink the policy rate is going to go in the future?\n\n\fAnd then there are other types of policies that probably aren’t getting as much analysis. But\none is negative interest rate policies. Those are being used in Europe and in Japan. They\nhaven’t been as popular in the U.S., but that’s something else that certainly could be looked\nat. There are probably a host of others that we could talk about, but those are probably the\nmain ones.\nMracek: And the review also looks at ways in which the Fed communicates monetary policy.\nSo, to start with, what do you think is going well?\nBullard: The U.S. has begun to meet an international standard by having press conferences\nafter every meeting. I think markets always want to know what the Federal Reserve is\nthinking, what the Committee is thinking. Even if nothing is happening, they want to know,\n“OK, nothing is happening.” So, we’ve begun to do that this year, and I think it does provide\nbetter communication on the whole. So, I think it’s working well.\nMracek: And are there further improvements in communication that you’d like to see?\nBullard: The Committee has a Summary of Economic Projections, [with] the so-called dot\nplot, which is put out once a quarter. I don’t think our communication there is as good as\nforeign central banks have. The Bank of England [and] the ECB [European Central Bank] put\nout more comprehensive descriptions of their forecasts—usually their staff forecasts—and\nthen the policymakers themselves can comment on the staff forecast, which I think is\nmaybe one way that we could change the system that we use. So, I think there are some\nimprovements that could be made.\nMracek: And this monetary policy framework review includes Fed Listens events\nthroughout the Federal Reserve System. What is the purpose of holding these events? And\ncan you describe for us the setup for the upcoming meeting here in St. Louis in September\nand what you hope to learn from that meeting?\nBullard: Well, we wanted the framework review to get input from a wide variety of sources,\nand we’re certainly doing that. We’ll basically talk to anybody who is interested in this, but,\nin particular, constituents in the various parts of the country. And we’re doing that in the\nEighth District.\nAnd what we’re going to do for our Fed Listens event is bring all our councils together on a\nsingle day into St. Louis and get the whole shebang at one time. That’s a special event. But it\njust re�ects part of what we do all the time here at the St. Louis Fed, which is try to stay in\nclose touch with economic actors on the ground and see what’s happening in their lives and\ntheir businesses on a day-to-day basis in order to allow that to be an input into monetary\npolicy.\nMracek: And what will policymakers at the Fed do with the information gathered during\n\n\fthis whole review?\nBullard: Well, I think the code word here is evolution, not revolution. I don’t think we want\nto give the impression that we’re going to overturn the current Fed operating framework or\nstrategic framework overnight. I don’t think that’s realistic or desirable. But I do think that\nmany of these ideas will feed into future monetary policy as we go forward and creep in in\nvarious ways. Some of them might be more visible than others, but I would not expect a\nmanifesto to come out that radically reorients Fed policy.\nThere is one focal point, which is the January statement of long-run monetary policy\nstrategy and goals. We could make changes to that statement, but it is a relatively terse\nstatement. It has only a few paragraphs. And the most we could do is make some changes to\na few parts of those paragraphs. So, I don’t think the person on the street would take that as\ntoo signi�cant. But that’s the nature of evolution, not revolution. I think we could tweak that\na little bit, and that might be a visible outcome of this process.\nAnother outcome could just be that we’re happy with our in�ation-targeting process and we\nthink it’s a good strategy going forward. Some of the Bank of Canada reviews that they’ve\ndone over the years have come exactly more or less to that conclusion, where they reviewed\neverything but then they reaf�rmed the previous strategy. And I think that’s a perfectly �ne\noutcome as well.\nThis is not necessarily meant to suggest that there are big changes afoot. But it is meant to\nbe thoroughgoing, get lots of input, think about these issues deeply on a calendar basis,\nsomething like �ve years or seven years. Because otherwise you might go 50 years and you\nnever changed your framework, and it gets badly out of date and it really doesn’t work very\nwell. But because you’ve never thought about the strategy, you’ve never changed it. And if\nyou are going to change it, you would have to change it in small ways in order to make\nprogress.\nMracek: So, you mentioned the Bank of Canada and their review. Do you think that the Fed\nwill start reviewing its monetary policy framework on a regular frequency?\nBullard: Well, that would be the hope. We’re not done with this one yet, so we’ll see how\nsuccessful this is. But we’re certainly learning as we go along. I would be hopeful that we\nwould get �ve or seven years down the line and then we would say, “OK, let’s go through this\nagain and see if anything’s changed or if we want to change our approach.”\nMracek: And is there anything else you want our listeners to know about the Fed’s\nmonetary policy framework review?\nBullard: Well, I just think this is such a good kind of corporate practice. So, I do think it’s a\ngood thing that we’re doing. When you think about the crisis 10 years ago, we had to do a lot\n\n\fof improvisation, on-the-run changes in monetary policy, new tools being introduced. That\ncauses a lot of volatility. People aren’t really sure how this is going to work. Policymakers\nthemselves aren’t really sure how it’s going to work. So, I think it’s very useful to try to do as\nmuch as you can in good times so that when bad times come again, you’ve at least got some\nbasis to go ahead and make decisions.\nMracek: All right.

I’m Jim Bullard, president of the St. Louis Fed, and I’m\nvery pleased to welcome you all to the Bank and today’s Fed Listens meeting. Joining us are\nFederal Reserve Governor Miki Bowman, members of the St. Louis Fed’s advisory councils,\nmembers of the media, Bank staff and others via livestream. Welcome everyone.\nToday we’ve brought together our six advisory councils to hear their views about the\neconomy, employment, in�ation, interest rates and Federal Reserve communications.\n\n\fThese are members of our Community Development Advisory Council, Agribusiness\nIndustry Council, Health Care Industry Council, Real Estate Industry Council,\nTransportation Industry Council and Community Depository Institutions Advisory Council.\nTogether, they are both an industry-diverse and a geographically diverse set of advisors who\nhail from and represent communities throughout the St. Louis Fed’s seven-state District.\nListening is built into the St. Louis Fed’s DNA. In addition to meeting with each of these\nadvisory councils at least twice a year, we regularly meet with business, community and\nlabor leaders, as well as the general public, in order to get a direct sense of how they are\nexperiencing the economy. Listening to their viewpoints helps keep us informed about the\nkey economic issues they’re facing, which in turn ensures that the concerns and\nperspectives of those throughout the Eighth Federal Reserve District are heard during\nmonetary policy deliberations. This dialogue allows us to put context to data and research\nwhile gathering direct and un�ltered information on a variety of topics. Models and data are\ncritical, but they don’t tell the whole story. Hearing from people like you helps us �ll in the\ngaps.\nBut our work doesn’t stop there. My staff and I regularly tour our District, visiting\ncommunities both large and small to hear directly from Main Street and from people such\nas yourselves. We do this because there’s no substitute for visiting these communities and\nhearing �rsthand. Experiencing what’s happening on the ground helps us build strong\nconnections and get feedback on business, economic and banking conditions. Being the\nvoice of Main Street is one of the key roles of the regional Federal Reserve bank, and it’s\nbaked into how the Federal Reserve System was designed 105 years ago.\nMiki and I, as well as the rest of our colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee, want\nand need to hear from you today to understand how our monetary policy decisions affect\npeople and communities in the Fed’s Eighth District. In many ways, today’s meeting is\nbusiness as usual for our council members: We will be listening to you. What’s not business\nas usual, however, is that today’s meeting is part of the �rst-ever public comprehensive\nreview by the FOMC of our monetary policy strategy, tools and communications. Our\nmeeting today—along with other Fed Listens events around the Federal Reserve System this\nyear—is at the core of that review.\nAs part of its Fed Listens initiative, the Federal Reserve is asking a wide range of\nstakeholders throughout 2019 to provide feedback on our approach to policymaking. We’re\nasking for perspectives on our performance in using monetary policy to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices—the goals Congress has assigned to us. In addition, we’re\nasking about how well we are communicating our policies and actions.\nThe comprehensive review gives us an opportunity to think about possible changes to our\n\n\fmonetary policy framework outside of the current-day decision-making on monetary\npolicy. Given that macroeconomic outcomes have been quite good for the U.S. in recent\nyears, now is a good time to do strategic thinking for the future—say, over the next �ve or 10\nyears. Doing this review and considering new ideas in good times are important so that\nwhen bad times return, policymakers have some basis to go ahead and make decisions. The\nresults of this review will help ensure that we are well positioned to meet our goals for many\nyears to come.\nThe Board of Governors and other Federal Reserve banks have hosted several Fed Listens\nevents so far this year, including a System research conference at the Federal Reserve Bank\nof Chicago with academic experts and panelists from outside the Fed. Today’s meeting is\nthe ninth event across the Federal Reserve System that is designed to hear from people and\ncommunities that are positioned to see the direct effects of monetary policy. As we listen to\nhow monetary policy impacts your businesses and industries, consumers, small\nbusinesses, banks and people in low- and moderate-income communities, we’ll be thinking\nabout how to use this information to help shape our strategies going forward. Information\nheard during these events will ultimately be considered when the FOMC performs its own\nassessment of its tools and strategies, including an assessment of the approaches we’ve\nused and the approaches that have been proposed but not tried. We expect to make our\nconclusions public in the �rst half of 2020.\nBefore I turn it over to Miki, let me explain how today’s meeting will work. After lunch, the\nadvisory councils will break out into separate working sessions in assigned conference\nrooms, where you will share with each other your insights and answers to the questions I\nsent you in advance. During the breakout session, you’ll also put together a report\nsummarizing your council’s discussion. Miki and I will not be part of your working sessions,\nbut we will rejoin all of the advisory councils at 2:30 p.m. in the auditorium, where one\nrepresentative from each council will report out on the council’s discussion and take a few\nfollow-up questions from Miki and me. After today, we will compile the feedback into a\nwritten report that will be shared with you and posted to our public website. We will also\nsend it to the Board of Governors for inclusion in a larger report. We are livestreaming these\nopening remarks today, and we will be livestreaming the report-out session after the\ncouncils’ working sessions.\nMiki’s and my role here today is to listen, and we look forward to hearing from you. We need\nthe best tools and strategies possible for dealing with the challenges we face, and our\ncommunications about monetary policy must be clear and credible. We welcome your best\nthinking on these issues. Thank you.\nAnd now I would like to introduce my colleague and friend: Federal Reserve Governor\nMichelle “Miki” Bowman.\n\n\fMiki Bowman took of�ce as a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem on Nov. 26, 2018, to �ll an unexpired term ending Jan. 31, 2020.\nPrior to her appointment to the Board, Miki served as the state bank commissioner of\nKansas from January 2017 to November 2018. She also served as vice president of Farmers\n& Drovers Bank in Kansas from 2010 to 2017.\nIn addition to her experience in the banking industry, Miki worked in Washington, D.C., for\nSenator Bob Dole of Kansas from 1995 to 1996 and served as a counsel to the U.S. House\nCommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the Committee on Government\nReform and Oversight between 1997 and 2002. In 2002, she became director of\ncongressional and intergovernmental affairs at the Federal Emergency Management\nAgency. From 2003 to 2004, she served as deputy assistant secretary and policy advisor to\nHomeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge.\nFollowing her time in Washington, D.C., Miki led a government and public affairs\nconsultancy based in London before returning to Kansas in 2010.\nShe received a BS in advertising and journalism from the University of Kansas and a JD\nfrom the Washburn University School of Law. She is a member of the New York Bar.\n1 Any opinions expressed here are my own and do not necessarily re�ect those of the\n\nFederal Open Market Committee.\n\n\f",

I am pleased you have\njoined us for “Banking and the Economy: A Forum for Minorities in Banking.” This forum,\nnow in its fourth year, is growing into what we hoped it would become—a valuable resource\nfor minority leaders in the banking industry. Our vision is that this forum will assist\nminority leaders in the banking industry in enhancing their industry knowledge,\n\n\fconnecting with other professionals in the industry and at the Federal Reserve, and\npreparing to better serve the future �nancial needs of our communities.\nDiversity and inclusion are top priorities across the Federal Reserve System. In many ways,\nthe need to recognize and embrace a variety of viewpoints and experiences is central to the\nFederal Reserve’s unique structure as a decentralized institution. The 12 Federal Reserve\nbanks serve districts that differ in geography, demographics and economics. The needs of\ncommunities here in the St. Louis Fed’s District, while similar in many respects to\ncommunities in other Fed districts, are also distinct.\nThis regionalized structure enables the Federal Reserve to gather data and other\ninformation about the economy, as well as the needs of local communities throughout the\nnation. Inputs from various sources are necessary to inform a national monetary policy\naimed at maintaining the health of the economy and the stability of the nation’s �nancial\nsystem for everyone.\nAs neighborhoods and communities across the country become more diverse, it is\nimportant for policymakers and regulators to hear different viewpoints and perspectives.\nBut recognizing a multiplicity of views throughout the different districts is just one way\ndiversity is embraced at the Fed.\nThe Federal Reserve is also committed to a diverse and inclusive workforce. We believe that\nthe best ideas, decision-making and service to the public are borne from diverse\nperspectives. Diversity and inclusion aren’t just good for morale; they’re a good business\nstrategy. We can attract and recruit the best possible talent by casting a wide net and\nexpanding recruiting efforts. A diverse workforce enhances our ability to be innovative and\nbetter serve the communities in which we operate.\nAt the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, we are committed to building a workplace where\ndifferences provide a foundation for better decisions and services. We have various\ninitiatives here at the St. Louis Fed to ensure that the decisions and recommendations we\nproduce re�ect a variety of perspectives.\nIn 2018, the St. Louis Fed’s staff re�ected a diverse employee population when compared\nwith relevant job groups in the St. Louis MSA.2 Broadly speaking, the St. Louis Fed\nworkforce is more than a quarter (26%) minority. Of the new hires by the St. Louis Fed last\nyear, 35% were minorities.\nDiversity among our employees allows for unique perspectives when generating ideas and\nsolving problems. We encourage an environment where innovation and excellence thrive.\nFor a public-serving institution, having diverse leaders and employees is critical to earning\nand keeping the public’s trust.\n\n\fSimilarly, workforce diversity is also incredibly important throughout the �nancial\nindustry. It is essential to ensuring a safe, sound and accessible banking system that\nprotects consumers and promotes competition.\nOverall, representation of minorities throughout all levels of management positions in the\n�nancial services industry has increased since 2007, from about 17% to 21% in 2015,\naccording to a 2017 report by the Government Accountability Of�ce.3 However, the level of\nrepresentation by minorities varied by race and ethnicity group, as well as by seniority.\nSpeci�cally, representation of African Americans at various management levels decreased\nslightly during this period, while representation of other minorities increased, as noted in\nthe report.\nProspects for minorities are favorable. The management pipeline at �nancial industry\norganizations—through which diverse candidates can move into senior-level management\npositions—has grown. Representation of minorities in �rst- and mid-level management\npositions was 22.4% in 2015, up from 18.7% in 2007. This compares to the 12.3%\nrepresentation of minorities in senior-level management positions in 2015, according to\nthe GAO.\nEvents like this forum contribute to a robust pipeline of new banking leaders who are\ninformed, engaged and ready to serve their communities. Helping minority leaders develop\nthe skills and connections to advance in the �nancial services industry is important to\nindividual advancement, but also for increasing representation of minorities at all levels of\nan organization. Visibility, networking and information are vital for professional\ndevelopment, and there are many examples of information sharing, engagement and\nnetworking continuing long after the forum concludes.\nMinority ownership in the �nancial services industry is also crucial to the promise of\ndelivering broad-based economic gains and �nancial solutions.\nAs the minority representation in the �nancial services industry ticks up, the number of\nMinority Depository Institutions (MDIs) has declined since the �nancial crisis, which is\nconsistent with industry trends. From 2008 to 2018, the number of MDIs declined 31%, a\nsigni�cant decline but a more gradual decline than community banks as a whole, which\ndeclined by 33% over the same period, the FDIC reported.4\nAgain, there are racial and ethnic disparities, as noted in the FDIC report. From 2001 to\n2018, the number of depository institutions owned by Asian Americans, Hispanics and\nNative Americans increased, while the number of MDIs owned by African Americans\ndeclined by more than half. African American MDIs represented just 15% of all MDIs at the\nend of last year.\n\n\fAnd compared with the more than 5,400 insured �nancial institutions, the number of MDIs\nis still small, the FDIC noted. There were only 149 MDIs in the U.S. last year, down from 215\nbefore the �nancial crisis.\nOn the plus side, �nancial performance at MDIs has improved signi�cantly over the past\n�ve years in terms of revenue generation and loan performance, according to the FDIC.\nThese institutions make a greater share of mortgage originations—as well as small business\nloans—to borrowers in low- and moderate-income census tracts.\nThey are more likely to have branches in minority neighborhoods and are more likely than\nnon-MDIs to focus on lending within communities of diverse ethnic backgrounds. This puts\nminority depository institutions in place to be valuable partners and to create an economic\nmultiplier effect for communities of color.\nOne way the Federal Reserve is working to assist these banks is through Partnership for\nProgress,5 a program launched in 2008 to help preserve and promote minority-owned\ninstitutions and enhance their ability to thrive in a competitive banking environment.\nThe program seeks to help minority institutions confront the unique challenges of their\ncommunities and cultivate safe and sound practices throughout their life cycle. Through\nprogramming that includes one-on-one guidance and workshops, as well as an online\nresource and information center, Partnership for Progress helps minority-owned and de\nnovo banks grow to a size that allows them to continue providing capital and �nancial\nservices to a growing population. This adds strength and vitality to the local communities\nthey serve and helps provide stability to the U.S. economy.\nThe program also helps the Fed better understand the challenges these institutions face in\nraising capital, growing their institutions and attracting as well as retaining talent. Key\nconcepts from the program were incorporated into the Federal Reserve System’s examiner\ntraining to provide a deeper understanding of the issues unique to minority-owned\ninstitutions.\nWhether you are a shareholder, director, of�cer or staff, we can all agree on the importance\nof minority leadership throughout the �nancial system. The Federal Reserve convenes\nconferences like this to facilitate a conversation about the needs of the communities we\nserve and also to help us better understand the communities we serve.\nI hope you will take away from this forum a deeper understanding of the �nancial industry,\nthe role of the Fed and the needs of the communities you work in. I thank you all for your\nparticipation in the upcoming sessions and look forward to a successful conference.\n1 Any opinions expressed here are my own and do not necessarily re�ect those of the\n\n\fFederal Open Market Committee.\n2 Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Of�ce of Minority and Women Inclusion 2018 Annual\n\nReport to Congress, https://www.stlouisfed.org/~/media/�les/pdfs/about-us/omwi\n/omwi_report_2018_�nal.pdf?la=en.\n3 Financial Services Industry: Trends in Management Representation of Minorities and\n\nWomen and Diversity Practices, 2007–2015 (PDF), U.S. Government Accountability Of�ce\nreport, November 2017.\n4 Minority Depository Institutions: Structure, Performance, and Social Impact, Federal\n\nDeposit Insurance Corp., May 2019.\n5 Partnership for Progress, https://fedpartnership.gov/.\n\n\f",

The conference is sponsored by the Federal\nReserve System, the Conference of State Bank Supervisors and the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corp.\nDuring his remarks, Bullard discussed ways in which the conference has expanded over the\nyears. He also shared his thoughts on the research that has been presented at the\nconference, the importance of combining researchers’ perspectives with practitioners’\nperspectives, and the value of the annual CSBS National Survey of Community Banks.\nFull text of remarks:\n\nPrepared Welcoming Remarks1\nJames Bullard\nPresident and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nSeventh Annual Community Banking in the 21st Century Research and Policy\nConference\nFederal Reserve System, Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS) and Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC)\nSt. Louis, Mo.\nOct. 1, 2019\nI welcome you to this research and policy conference that we somewhat boldly entitled\n\n\fCommunity Banking in the 21st Century when it began in 2013. The conference then, as\nnow, was sponsored by the Federal Reserve System and the Conference of State Bank\nSupervisors. Last year, we welcomed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to this effort. We\nare pleased with this expanded partnership.\nThe content of that �rst conference was relatively simple: We worked to combine the latest\nin community bank research with the comments of bankers that were voiced during various\n“town hall” meetings held by state banking commissioners around the country.\nThe conference has expanded signi�cantly since. I’d like to highlight some of those changes.\nFirst, we have seen strong sponsorship from senior of�cials of regulatory agencies and the\nCSBS. This support is re�ected by the keynote addresses in this year’s agenda. The morning\nkeynote address is by Federal Reserve Governor Michelle “Miki” Bowman, the Fed’s �rst\ngovernor with responsibility for community banking matters. Her experience as a state\nbanking regulator and as a community banker gives her unique insights into the\ncommunity bank business model. In addition, we are again joined by FDIC Chairman Jelena\nMcWilliams, who has been a strong voice for the community banks since her appointment. I\nlook forward to her talk this afternoon. Another one of my Fed colleagues, Philadelphia Fed\nPresident Patrick Harker, will speak tomorrow morning.\nI also want to acknowledge CSBS President John Ryan and the state banking commissioners\nwho continue to serve as a vital backbone to our unique state-federal supervisory model\nand, of course, to this conference.\nThe conference has expanded in other ways as well.\nSeveral years ago, we introduced a panel discussion to provide a business perspective to\ncomplement the academic research. This year, we will present a panel discussion focused\non the future of community bank funding, a signi�cant issue to banks in the Eighth Federal\nReserve District and across the U.S.\nOf special interest to many bankers is the student case study competition, an innovative\nidea of the CSBS that was introduced four years ago. This year, we will hear the presentation\nof a case study of community banks presented by the winning undergraduate student team\nfrom Juniata College in Huntingdon, Pa.\nFinally, several years ago, we introduced the voices of community bankers through a video\nseries. This year, we have a montage of video interviews with community bankers from\nacross the U.S. We’ll also hear directly from a community banker from Massachusetts who\ndemonstrates that community banks can not only compete against some of the largest\nbanks in the nation but also win.\n\n\fAs you can see, voices of community bankers will continue to be heard throughout nearly\nevery aspect of this conference, including in connection with the research being presented\nthis year.\nOf course, this conference is fundamentally a research conference. So let me offer a few\nthoughts on the research.\nOver the years, more than 60 academic papers have been presented at this conference.\nThese papers have been published in leading economic, �nance and accounting journals.\nThey have been widely cited by other researchers. In other words, they have become the\nreference point for academic research for community banking that the conference\nsponsors envisioned when this endeavor �rst began.\nThis year, 12 papers were selected for presentation from what I’ve been told was an\nimpressive number of high-quality submissions. They are organized in four sessions. One\nsession looks at how regulation in�uences small-business lending. Another examines how\nfunds are transferred among geographic markets in response to local economic shocks.\nAnother examines relationships between regulation and risk. The last one connects\ntechnology to the growth and pro�tability of banks.\nAgain this year, a community banker will participate on every research panel alongside an\nacademic moderator. While it may sound simple, combining a researcher’s perspective with\na practitioner’s perspective is not the norm in the research world. I’ve spent much of my\ncareer in the research world and can tell you: This approach is unusual!\nIn fact, we’ve received inquiries from other institutions asking us about the structure of this\nconference and the inclusion of the voices of practitioners in our research proceedings. I do\nhope we see this approach used more frequently. We have learned a lot from our\ncommunity bankers through this conference, and many of our researchers have told us the\nperspectives they’ve gleaned have helped them improve their research.\nFinally, I’d like to offer a few thoughts on this year’s National Survey of Community Banks,\nwhich was conducted by state banking commissioners and the CSBS. The survey offers a\nsnapshot of the opportunities and challenges faced by community banks. Speci�cally, the\nsurvey has resulted in the creation of a unique data set around compliance costs.\nResearchers here in St. Louis and from other institutions around the country have been\nable to use these data to help us better understand the compliance cost of regulation. The\nsurvey has also offered evidence on how the burden of compliance costs disproportionately\naffects the smallest community banks.\nBank commissioners are cognizant of the time it takes for bankers to complete this survey.\nBut we have seen the value. The survey results not only have added to our knowledge of\n\n\fissues affecting community banks but also have been cited by, among others, the\nCongressional Research Service, the U.S. Government Accountability Of�ce and the White\nHouse Council of Economic Advisers. Clearly, this conference is making its presence felt\nthroughout the research and policy spectrum.\nIn closing, the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis is delighted to host this conference.\nCommunity banking is important to the Midwest economy. We have learned from\ncommunity banks as, hopefully, they have learned from us.\nI wish everyone here today in St. Louis and those joining us through the webcast a great\nconference.\nAnd now I’d like to introduce our opening keynote speaker: Michelle Bowman.\n“Miki” Bowman joined the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System on Nov. 26,\n2018. She is the �rst person to �ll the seat for Federal Reserve governor that had been\nreserved for someone with experience in community banking or community bank\nsupervision. As I mentioned earlier, Governor Bowman has both of those quali�cations.\nPrior to her appointment to the Board, she served as the state bank commissioner of\nKansas. She also served as vice president of Farmers & Drovers Bank in Council Grove, Kan.\nGovernor Bowman received a Bachelor of Science degree in advertising and journalism\nfrom the University of Kansas. She received a Juris Doctor degree from the Washburn\nUniversity School of Law in Topeka, Kan. She is a member of the New York Bar.\nPlease join me in welcoming Governor Bowman.\n1 Any opinions expressed here are my own and do not necessarily re�ect those of the\n\nFederal Open Market Committee.\n\n\f",

He noted that global trade policy uncertainty is\nlikely to remain high over the medium term, but firms are now adjusting business strategies to\nremain profitable in the face of this uncertainty. Regarding the intensification of geopolitical\nrisk, he said this may mean higher oil prices, but the ultimate impact of that on the U.S.\neconomy may be approximately neutral given lower oil intensity and higher production in the\nU.S. than historical levels.\n\nHaving trouble with the video?

Another question is whether interest-sensitive sectors in the U.S. will\nrespond to the 2019 change in U.S. monetary policy, Bullard pointed out.

Cochrane is a senior fellow of the Hoover Institution at\nStanford University. He is known in part for his economic and public policy news and views\nblog, “The Grumpy Economist,” and also for his �scal and monetary policy research. During\nhis lecture, he discussed “Strategic review and beyond: Rethinking monetary policy and\nindependence.”\nFull text of remarks:\nPrepared Welcoming Remarks1\nJames Bullard\nPresident and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nThe 2020 Homer Jones Memorial Lecture\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nMarch 4, 2020\nWelcome to the 30th Homer Jones Memorial Lecture.\nThe Homer Jones Memorial Lecture—one of the Bank’s signature events—honors the lasting\nlegacy of a former research director.\nThe �rst lecture was given in 1987, shortly after Homer Jones’ death. The lecture has\npersisted, in large part, because of the past support of many organizations and people. These\nhave included Saint Louis University, Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville, the\nUniversity of Missouri-St. Louis and Washington University in St. Louis. For the past several\nyears, the lecture series has been a joint collaboration between the St. Louis Gateway\nChapter of the National Association for Business Economics and the Federal Reserve Bank of\n\n\fSt. Louis.\nIn the early 1930s, Homer Jones taught at Rutgers University. Arthur Burns, a future\nchairman of the Fed in the 1970s, was also at Rutgers at the time. If you have attended this\nlecture before, you undoubtedly remember that Milton Friedman was a student of Homer’s\nat Rutgers University. Homer encouraged Friedman to pursue a graduate degree in\neconomics. Milton would do so and eventually ended up at the University of Chicago. Homer\neventually landed at the St. Louis Fed.\nDuring his time as research director, Homer Jones presided over the rise of monetary and\nmacroeconomic research at the Bank. His two-pronged approach—rigorous research using\neconomic and monetary data and the dissemination of those data—played no small part in\nthe Keynesian-Monetarist debates in the 1960s and 1970s.\nAfter Jones retired, a distinguished group of monetary economists—including Nobel\nLaureate Milton Friedman—published a series of articles praising him and the imprint he left\non economics, monetary policy and the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. This compendium\nwas published in a 1976 issue of the Journal of Monetary Economics.\nThe St. Louis Fed’s tradition of rigorous economic research and data dissemination\ncontinues today. For example, last year there were a little more than 13 million visits to the\nBank’s FRED and family set of databases.\nAn enduring quality of time is that it has an element of forgetfulness. This can be a blessing\nor a curse. In his time and place, Homer Jones �gured prominently in the KeynesianMonetarist debates. Over time, though, debates are settled—the Monetarists won, by the\nway!—and new strains of research are developed that spawn other debates. The regrettable\nresult is that �gures from the past and their timeless contributions tend to fade.\nThe annual renewal of this lecture is our attempt to commemorate the legacy of Homer\nJones—while, at the same time, honoring those who speak with authority on the challenges of\ntoday’s economic problems.\nThis year’s speaker is Dr. John H. Cochrane. He speaks with authority and knowledge about\nmany of today’s economic issues.\nCochrane is the Rose-Marie and Jack Anderson Senior Fellow of the Hoover Institution at\nStanford University. Before going to Hoover, Cochrane was the AQR Capital Management\nDistinguished Service Professor of Finance at the University of Chicago Booth School of\nBusiness.\nHis monetary economics publications include articles on monetary policy and the �scal\ntheory of the price level. His �nance publications include the book Asset Pricing and articles\n\n\fon dynamics in stock and bond markets, the volatility of exchange rates, the term structure\nof interest rates, the returns to venture capital, liquidity premiums in stock prices, the\nrelation between stock prices and business cycles, and option pricing when investors can’t\nperfectly hedge. He has also written articles on macroeconomics, health insurance, timeseries econometrics, �nancial regulation and other topics. He writes occasional op-eds,\nmostly in the Wall Street Journal, and blogs as “The Grumpy Economist.” His most recent\ninnovation is the “Grumpy Economist” podcast.\nHaving known John for many years, I can assure you that while at times he may be grumpy,\nhe will by no means leave you sleepy!\nDr. Cochrane will present: “Strategic review and beyond: Rethinking monetary policy and\nindependence.”\nPlease join me in welcoming Dr. Cochrane.\n1Any opinions expressed here are my own and do not necessarily re�ect those of the Federal\n\nOpen Market Committee.\n\n\f",

Making tests for the disease widely\navailable to people would be the surest route, he said.\n\"We can't test them at the scale we would like to, but widespread testing of everybody in the\neconomy would put an end to this crisis,\" Bullard said.\nIf the U.S. is producing about half the normal output of $5 trillion per quarter [about $2.5\ntrillion], a rough guess is that the quarantine is costing $25 billion a day in lost household\nincome, Bullard said. That's only sustainable for a little while, he said.\n\"After a while you have to think about how you want to manage risk,\" Bullard said. \"We\nmanage all kinds of risks—health risks and other risks—to the economy, and we're going to\nhave to do that as well for COVID-19.\"\n\n\fBullard also spoke about the Federal Reserve's policies and programs to address the\neconomic effects from the pandemic, including addressing liquidity problems in many\nsegments of �nancial markets. \"I think the spirit of the times is to maintain market\nfunctioning through this crisis,\" he said.\nDuring the moderated Q&A, Bullard shared his views on the outlook for unemployment and\nthe economy as well as other topics. Asked if the economy would come back in a \"V\" shape—\nwith the sharp decline followed by a quick and strong recovery—he said there was no reason\nthe economy couldn't come back that way.\n\"It can happen if this is managed appropriately, if you make sure everyone is comfortable\nand able to pay their bills through the second quarter, if you can get the virus under control,\"\nBullard said, but added that there is a lot of uncertainty around the virus.\nHaving trouble with the video?

He also talked about the need to manage the health risk to avoid another shutdown\nof the same magnitude once the economy has reopened.\nHaving trouble with the video? Watch it here.\n\n\f",

He\nspoke at a webinar, \"The World Economy Transformed: Re�ections on Policy Responses and\nthe Future Post Pandemic Monetary Architecture.\" The Chamber of Digital Commerce,\nReinventing Bretton Woods Committee, and Accenture hosted the event.\nBullard said that he thinks the main economic impact will occur in the second quarter of\n2020, which he has suggested calling a \"pandemic adjustment period.\" He said that \"the\nnumbers coming out of the second quarter will be not comparable to anything we've seen in\nU.S. macroeconomic history.\" Comparing the time with other periods in the past is\nmisleading \"in thinking about how the economy might be able to behave going forward,\" he\nsaid.\nBullard also suggested that this is a time when economists have to come up with solutions\n\n\fthat will end this crisis and put the U.S. and global economy back on �rm footing.\nTo that end, he talked about the importance of ramping up testing for the virus. He proposed\nusing some of the dollars being spent on the crisis to pay the costs of production of tests for\nany entity that wants to produce them. The tests would be sold on an open competitive\nmarket. This would create a pop-up industry and lead to a glut of tests, Bullard noted.\n\"The reason I like this is because it doesn't count on a miracle happening,\" he said. \"It counts\non existing technology, but it's all about trying to scale up that technology and create a gold\nrush in the production of tests—not just in the U.S. but globally—and that would end the\ncrisis.\"\nBullard also discussed the Federal Reserve's response and the �scal response to the\npandemic.

He noted that the task at hand is to put the economy\non pause and ask people to stay home in order to invest in national health.\nHe reiterated his view that the main disruption in the U.S. economy will be in the second\nquarter. \"I do think we have a better chance of a swift recovery given this shock than others\nthat we have seen in the past if we manage the situation carefully and we continue to keep\nour wits about us as we move through, day by day, the pandemic threat,\" he said.\nBullard said that one goal during the shutdown period is to provide support to the �nancial\nsector to avoid having a �nancial crisis in addition to a pandemic crisis. \"I think that the Fed\n\n\fhas intervened effectively in �nancial markets in order to maintain market functioning,\" he\nsaid. \"I think we can do more, but I think weâ€™ve done probably the most obvious steps so\nfar.\"\nAnother goal during this period is to support the real economy, which the FOMC did right\naway by lowering the policy rate to zero, Bullard noted. He added that the �scal response has\nalso been aggressive in trying to compensate those who are being asked to pause in their\nbusinesses and their work, which is helping mitigate the risk of the crisis morphing into a\nvery serious and long-lasting depression.\nBullard noted that the general-pause situation is OK right now, but it cannot be maintained\nfor long. \"I think the shutdown policy was appropriate to handle the initial surprise of the\npandemic, but keeping the shutdown in place in the same way that we have it now as a\nblanket policy will cause too many problems longer term,\" he said, adding that he expects to\nsee a more risk-based and granular policy going forward.\nIn terms of ending the crisis, Bullard suggested putting resources toward technology that is\navailable, mainly testing. From an economic point of view, \"what we really have is an\ninformation problem\" in that people don't know where the virus is, he explained.\nHaving trouble with the video? Watch it here.\n\n\f",

He noted that the Fed’s relatively quick\nresponse to this shock was to use 13(3) lending programs (authorized under that section of\nthe Federal Reserve Act) and provide liquidity to �nancial markets.\n“As far as the initial wave, I think the response has been much faster than it was in the\nprevious crisis, and that has served us very well in terms of market liquidity, preventing this\nfrom morphing into a �nancial crisis, at least so far,” he said.\nBullard also spoke about the shutdown policy, cautioning against continuing it for too long.\n\n\f“We cannot hit the pause button for very long in major economies around the world, and\ncertainly not in the U.S.,” he said, adding that there may be a 90- or 120-day shelf life on the\npolicy. After that, the shutdown policy can’t continue because too much will start to happen,\nhe said. “You’ll get business failures on a grand scale, and you’ll be taking risk that you’d go\ninto depression.”\nThe shutdown policy was rational at the beginning, when the pandemic caught everybody by\nsurprise and it was necessary to get the disease under control, he said. But it is a blankettype policy, he explained. “I think we have to get away from the shutdown policy and toward\nsomething that is more about risk mitigation,” Bullard said.\nIn terms of his economic outlook, he said that he expects a large decline in GDP in the\nsecond quarter for the U.S., followed by very positive growth in the third quarter.\nDuring the webinar, Bullard also discussed pandemic relief for disrupted workers and\nbusinesses, negative interest rates, the Fed’s balance sheet, the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio,\nin�ation risk, the Federal Reserve’s policy framework review, the future of central banking,\nand more.\nHaving trouble with the video?

LOUIS FED\n\n00:00:00\n/ 01:02:20\nPresident30Jim Bullard,\nCD Howe\nInstitute Webinar30\nMay 27, 2020\n\nSt. Louis Fed President James Bullard shared his views on the partial-shutdown policy that\nhas been in place for the U.S. economy as an investment in national health. He also\ndiscussed two ways to solve the crisis from the COVID-19 pandemic. He spoke during a C.D.\nHowe Institute webinar.\nBullard said that the shutdown policy was appropriate initially, but that continuing it too long\nwould risk a �nancial crisis and would risk depression.\nHe then talked about two solutions to the crisis, which he said are happening to some degree\nalready—ubiquitous testing and a risk-based stay-at-home approach. He added that both\neconomic and health outcomes would be better using those two solutions than under the\nshutdown policy.\nBullard said the testing would solve an information problem, allowing people to know where\nthe virus was at all times. A highly productive economy that would also have very low\nfatalities from COVID-19 would result, he added.\nA risk-based stay-at-home approach would rely on data on who is being affected by the\ndisease, Bullard explained. He suggested using other mortality risks, such as from accidental\ninjuries, to size the mortality risk from COVID-19. Based on current projections, he said, the\nrisk posed by COVID-19 would be slightly less than the risk posed by accidental injury for\n2020.\nHe also said calibrating the risk could be done by age, which would suggest that younger\npeople would probably go to work, while older people would probably stay home, he\nexplained.\n\n\f“And because of that, you’d get more output, and you’d get very limited fatalities, as long as\nthe elderly population stayed away from infection,” Bullard said.\n\n\f",

He spoke during a Shadow Open\nMarket Committee (SOMC) virtual conference with Chapman University. The SOMC is an\nindependent organization that discusses economic policy.\nThe shutdown policy in response to the COVID-19 pandemic was appropriate initially when\nlittle was known about the disease, but cannot be maintained over a longer period of time,\nBullard said. If massive business failures occur, we’ll face depression risk, �nancial crisis\nrisk, or both, he said, adding that we want to stay out of those situations.\nAs we learn more about the disease, the economy will “adopt a more granular risk-based\napproach to disease management,” he said.\nBullard discussed two approaches: “ubiquitous” testing, which includes testing not just\nthose who are sick; and “risk-based” stay at home, where those who have different levels of\nrisk from the disease will protect themselves differently. A lot of those adjustments already\nare occurring, Bullard said, and will continue through the third quarter, at which point most\nof the easiest and simplest adaptations will have been made by �rms and households.\n“The end of the third quarter will be an important checkpoint for where we are in the crisis,”\nhe said.\nAs the days and weeks go by, more is learned about the nature of the mortality risk and how\nit can be mitigated, as well as how goods and services can be provided safely, Bullard said.\nRisk mitigation can be undertaken at the individual level and at the �rm level, he said.\n“The result will likely be higher output, as well as less fatalities than the economy initially\nexperienced during the March-April 2020 time frame,” he said.\nBullard also answered questions about prospects for the U.S. economic recovery, the policy\n\n\fresponses during this crisis compared with those during the 2007-09 �nancial crisis, the\nrisks of a higher federal debt-to-GDP ratio, and more.\n\n\f",

He also\ndiscussed the labor market and in�ation during a webinar that was part of the Milken\nInstitute Summer Series.\nDespite the second quarter being the worst quarter of all time from an economic growth\nperspective, quarterly output looks like it will be 90% of what would be produced in a normal\nquarter, Bullard said. He attributed this to people working from home and the ability of\nessential businesses to adapt.\n\"I think the bulk of the economy will be able to get back to the production levels that they\n\n\fwere at,\" he said. However, he added that it's a different world with a new mortality risk in\nthe economy that isn't going away in the near term. \"We're going to have to adapt and learn\nto cope with it as best we can and mitigate the risk to the most vulnerable individuals as best\nwe can,\" he said.\nBullard noted that one of the goals of the current situation is to stay out of a �nancial crisis,\nand another is to stay out of a depression.\n\"If you get into the depression scenario, the health outcomes and the economic outcomes\nwill be worse. I think that's really why we should all be motivated to think about how we can\nstay out of that situation,\" he said.\nAddressing a question about making monetary policy that's aimed at racial justice, Bullard\nsaid that ideally unemployment would be as low as possible nationwide with no statistical\ndifferences in unemployment rates across racial and ethnic groups. He noted that Black and\nHispanic unemployment rates have consistently been higher than white unemployment\nrates in the postwar era, but that the gaps were narrowing coming into this crisis.\nSome of the economics literature on this topic suggests that one of the best things that can be\ndone for racial equality and racial justice is to keep economic expansion going for a long\ntime, Bullard said.\n\"That's very much tied to our mandate from Congress, and we certainly try to carry that out\nas best we can,\" he said.\nHe also talked about in�ation, which has generally been below the Fed's 2% in�ation target\nin recent years.\n\"We've got a lot of very aggressive monetary policy and �scal policy in place to respond to\nthis crisis,\" Bullard said. \"I'm hopeful that we can get a pretty robust recovery in the second\nhalf here and that in�ation will actually come up to our 2% target.\"\nHaving trouble with the video?

He also spoke about the importance of an inclusive economy and promoting\nracial economic equity.\n“A more inclusive economy is a stronger economy, and the work of the St. Louis Fed must\nhelp to root out institutional racism and other inequities that systematically create economic\nbarriers,” Bullard said.\nHe cited research from the St. Louis Fed’s Center for Household Financial Stability, which\nhas consistently found that Black families in the U.S. have about 10 cents for every dollar in\n\n\fwealth held by white families—a gap that has been virtually unchanged for at least three\ndecades. The Center’s research suggests that structural and historical factors continue to\nsuppress the ability of Black Americans to accumulate wealth, Bullard noted.\n“Accordingly, to promote racial economic equity, we as a nation must also consider\nstructural or institutional responses,” he said. “While the St. Louis Fed has undertaken\nsigni�cant research and initiatives on this front, our work must continue in earnest. It’s\nwelcome news that many organizations are doing the same.”\nTurning to the pandemic, Bullard noted that the primary economic impact will be in the\nsecond quarter of 2020, when the U.S. economy was intentionally slowed down to invest in\npublic health.\nHe said that the set of health, �scal and monetary policies that has been put in place has\nbeen a good response and a good mitigator of the initial shock from the pandemic, but can’t\nbe maintained inde�nitely.\n“There is really no pause button for the U.S. economy, and attempts to go on too long with\nthis set of policies would risk �nancial crisis or depression or both,” Bullard said, adding that\nhealth and economic outcomes would be worse in that scenario.\n“The risks are signi�cant, but my base case is that all of that will be avoided and that we will\nget a robust recovery in the second half of the year,” he said.\nGoing forward, Bullard said that new risk mitigators will be put in place to control the\ndisease while also allowing production of goods and services and restoration of household\nincome. This would be a better policy overall because it would lead to fewer fatalities and\nmore household income, he noted.\nHe discussed two approaches for mitigating the health risk: ubiquitous testing, which would\nsolve the information problem by allowing people to know where the disease is; and riskbased stay at home, whereby people make their own decisions based on their risk from\nCOVID-19.\nHaving trouble with the video?

This new\nstrategy would allow policymakers to make up for past misses on inflation, he said.\nBullard discussed other elements of the review, including the Federal Open Market\nCommittee’s emphasizing that the Fed’s employment goal is broad and inclusive of everybody\nin the economy; revised language that says the FOMC would worry only about shortfalls,\ninstead of “deviations,” of employment from full employment; and better description of the\nrole of financial stability in FOMC deliberations.\nDuring the panel discussion, he addressed questions related to overshooting the inflation\ntarget, additional actions the Fed could take should more be needed, and the U.S. Treasury\nyield curve.\nThe video for the event can be found here.\n\nFOLLOW US\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/from-the-president/speeches-and-presentations/2020/bullard-discusses-feds-monetary-policy-framework\n\n1/2\n\n\f12/21/22, 5:41 PM\n\nBullard Discusses Fed’s Monetary Policy Framework during Virtual Panel | James Bullard | St. Louis Fed\n\nSIGN UP FOR EMAIL ALERTS\nReceive updates in your inbox as soon as new content is published on our website\nSIGN UP\nQUICK LINKS\nAbout Us\nLegal Information\nContact Us\nPrivacy Policy\nCareers\nDoing Business with the Fed\nEvents\nFederal Reserve Services\nVisiting the St. Louis Fed\nFederal Banking Regulations\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/from-the-president/speeches-and-presentations/2020/bullard-discusses-feds-monetary-policy-framework\n\n2/2\n\n\f",

He spoke during a\nmoderated panel discussion at the National Association for Business Economics (NABE) Economic\nPolicy Conference.\nBullard noted that the monetary policy and fiscal policy responses during the COVID-19 crisis have\nbeen quite good. He also noted that the economic recovery has been quite a bit stronger than most\npeople had projected as of last March and April.\nHe said that he is expecting a strong year on many dimensions for the U.S. economy. For 2021, he\nhas penciled in 6.5% real GDP growth, inflation moving up to 2.5% and unemployment moving\ndown to 4.5%. He cautioned that the pandemic is still going on, adding that he’d like to see actual\ndata come in that verifies his forecast.\nOn the issue of federal debt, Bullard noted that he has been thinking about new ways to assess debtto-GDP ratios across nations and how much debt is too much. He said the advice from\nmacroeconomists has to take the country into account, rather than having a blanket statement that\nsome debt-to-GDP ratio is appropriate for all nations at all times.\nRegarding the U.S. dollar, he reiterated his view that the dollar is going to be the world’s reserve\ncurrency for a long time. He also discussed currency competition, privately issued currencies and\nexchange rate chaos.

The Paul Simon Public\nPolicy Institute at Southern Illinois University hosted the virtual conversation.\nBullard discussed the history behind the Fed’s regional structure as well as some of the different\nresponsibilities of Federal Reserve banks and the Board of Governors. He also talked about ways\nthe St. Louis Fed keeps in touch with businesses and communities throughout the Eighth Federal\nReserve District.\nIn discussing the Fed’s actions during the pandemic, he said that the “13(3)” backstop lending\nprograms eliminated the incipient financial crisis that could have occurred on top of the pandemic.\nSection 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act allows for such emergency lending by the Fed with the\nconsent of the U.S. Treasury Secretary. Bullard also said that the fiscal policy response has been\nexceptionally effective for this shock.\nRegarding current monetary policy, Bullard said the Federal Open Market Committee has a great\npolicy in place for right now. He said he anticipates the pandemic will come to a close through the\nvaccine strategy, but it hasn’t happened yet. “And so, I think keep the policies in place until you get\nfarther along here, and then as the dust settles, we can open up a conversation about what to do\nnext,” he said.\nHe said he expects to see a very strong U.S. economy and a strong labor market once the pandemic\nends, and expects inflation to be 2.5% at the end of this year.\nBullard also highlighted several St. Louis Fed resources during the event, including the new\nInstitute for Economic Equity, his research on monetary policy and inequality, the FRED economic\ndatabase and the On the Economy blog.\nHaving trouble with the video?

He participated in a panel discussion with Dallas Fed President Robert S. Kaplan.\nBullard noted that the Federal Open Market Committee’s median projection for economic growth in\n2021 was upgraded to 7% and the median projection for core PCE inflation moved up to 3% in the\nlatest Summary of Economic Projections (SEP). These compare to median projections of about 4%\non economic growth and 1.8% on core PCE inflation in the December SEP. “I just think we’re in a\nmuch stronger position with respect to reopening than we would have anticipated, and the inflation\nhas come along with it,” he said.\nThe essence of the Fed’s new monetary policy framework is that the FOMC would allow inflation to\nrun above target for some time, Bullard noted. Then the FOMC would approach 2% inflation from\nthe high side and get something pretty close to 2% inflation when averaged across past years, he\nsaid.\nBullard cautioned that this is a period of high volatility and that there is upside risk to inflation.\n“We have to be ready on both sides, I think, to be able to react to that, to be state contingent, to be\nnimble, just as nimble coming out of the pandemic as I think we had to be going into the\npandemic,” he said.\nOn the labor market, Bullard said that the anecdotal evidence is overwhelming that it is very tight.\nHe also noted that the extent of labor market improvement has been dramatic, with the\nunemployment rate now down to 5.8%. He added that he expects lots of further improvement in the\nmonths and quarters ahead.\nRegarding tapering the Fed’s bond purchases, Bullard noted that the debate is now open and that\nmany parameters will have to be set, including the degree of state contingency.\nHe also addressed questions about fiscal policy, financial stability risks and the U.S. Treasury\nmarket during the panel discussion.\nHaving trouble with the video?

Held virtually this year, the conference is sponsored by the\nFederal Reserve System, the Conference of State Bank Supervisors and the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation.\nBullard discussed the importance of bringing various perspectives together to inform the\nthinking on the future of community banking. He also introduced the �rst keynote speaker\nof the conference: Federal Reserve Gov. Michelle “Miki” Bowman.\nFull text of remarks:\n\nPrepared Welcoming Remarks1\nJames Bullard\nPresident and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\n2021 Community Banking in the 21st Century Research and Policy Conference (Virtual)\nFederal Reserve System, Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS) and Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)\nSept. 28, 2021\nOn behalf of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, I’d like to welcome you to this year’s\nvirtual community bank research conference. I’d also like to acknowledge the important\npartnership we enjoy with the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation, the Board of Governors and other Reserve banks to bring you this\n\n\fconference every year.\nIn “normal” times, we would be gathering in St. Louis to hear from an impressive array of\nresearchers, bankers and regulators from around the world—and after the formal\npresentations were over, we’d meet informally in our Gateway Conference Center to engage\nin lively discussions and debate ideas.\nOver the years, those discussions have led to new relationships. They’ve also generated new\nresearch ideas. For example, I recently learned that one of the papers in this year’s\nconference came about directly because of a conversation between a community banker\nand a researcher a few years ago at this conference.\nWhile those conversations will be a bit more challenging in the virtual environment, we’ve\nall gotten much better at working, communicating and interacting with each other virtually\nover the past 18 months. I encourage you to take full advantage of the opportunities to\nconnect with one another during this virtual event in order to keep information and ideas\n�owing between all of our presenters and attendees. That’s the real value of this and all\nresearch conferences: the exchanging of ideas.\nThis year’s conference focuses on a number of important ideas, including:\n• The impact of two extraordinary pandemic-era programs: the Paycheck Protection\nProgram and the Federal Reserve’s Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility\n• The impact of minority banks in their communities and the role community\ndevelopment �nancial institutions (CDFIs) play in allocating credit to low- and\nmoderate-income communities\n• The consequences and incentives around supervisory oversight\nWe’ll also hear from an expert panel of community bankers who will offer their views on the\nfuture of commercial real estate lending.\nAs we just heard, thanks to the efforts of the state banking commissioners who conduct the\nCSBS National Survey of Community Banks, community banks were able to understand and\nreact quickly to the challenges of the pandemic. They are now looking ahead to a future that\nwill consist of new competitors and new technologies that could have a signi�cant impact\non how banks will offer products and services in the future.\nUnderstanding that future is a challenge for all of us—researchers, regulators, policymakers\nand community bankers. That’s why I believe that this conference is so important—it’s the\none place that we very deliberately bring all of those perspectives together.\nAmong the perspectives that inform our thinking on the future of community banking are\n\n\fthose of our �rst keynote speaker: Federal Reserve Gov. Miki Bowman.\nGov. Bowman, with her focus on community and regional banking organizations, has\nbrought new ideas and new energy to the Board of Governors regarding banking and\nbanking supervision issues. She’s challenged staff to promote innovation and lessen\nregulatory burden while also strengthening our overall banking and �nancial system.\nAs a former community banker and state regulator, she brings important insights to her\nwork at the Fed and to forums such as this conference. I appreciate the commitment she\nhas made to incorporate a wide range of perspectives into her thinking as she implements\nnew initiatives and ideas. I also appreciate the commitment she has made to this\nconference—and her commitment to participate in these proceedings every year since she\nbecame a Fed governor (and even prior to becoming governor).\nWelcome, Gov. Bowman.\n1 Any opinions expressed here are my own and do not necessarily re�ect those of the\n\n\f",

His\nremarks were during a panel discussion at the International Research Conference hosted by the\nCentral Bank of the Philippines and the Reinventing Bretton Woods Committee.\nWhile nobody really knows at this point how big an effect the delta variant has had on GDP growth\nin the third quarter, most forecasters expect that growth to get pushed into the next few quarters or\nall of 2022, Bullard said. “In a way, it’s a bullish factor for 2022 because it’s just postponing growth,\nnot eliminating growth, for the U.S.,” he said.\nRegarding inflation, Bullard noted that the risk with the Fed’s flexible average inflation targeting\nframework is that this year’s inflation shock will be too big and that monetary policy won’t react fast\nenough, resulting in more inflation than the FOMC intended.\n“The risk management approach to monetary policy that I’ve been advocating suggests that we\nshould take this inflation risk seriously,” he said. “We certainly are expecting inflation to moderate.\nBut I want to be prepared for the case where it doesn’t moderate as much as hoped, and that we’re\nable to keep inflation under control in that scenario without disrupting the economy or sending the\nU.S. economy or the global economy into recession.”\nIn discussing current monetary policy, Bullard noted that the FOMC gave a strong signal at its most\nrecent meeting that tapering of the Fed’s asset purchases would begin soon. The tapering process is\nthe first step toward pulling back some of the aggressively easy monetary policy that was put in\nplace to mitigate the impact of the pandemic, he said.\nHaving trouble with the video?

The Aspen Institute and the St.\nLouis Fed partnered to publish the book, which includes 63 essays from leading experts.\nFull text of remarks:\n\nOpening Remarks1\nJames Bullard\nPresident and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nBook Launch: The Future of Building Wealth\nThe Aspen Institute and Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nSept. 30, 2021\nIt’s a pleasure to be here. I want to thank Dan Porter�eld for his introduction and for\norganizing today’s exciting book launch event.\nThe St. Louis Fed is proud to partner with the Aspen Institute for this book on building\nwealth inclusively. When Ray approached us with the idea for this book, we thought, “What\na great way to keep Ray busy!”\nBut seriously, like Ray, the St. Louis Fed believes that the con�uence of so many large events\nmakes this book especially timely—the pandemic, the recession that followed, and our\nnation’s critical efforts around racial reckoning. And all of these are occurring amidst levels\nof economic inequality our nation hasn’t seen in a century. These are precisely the kinds of\n\n\fevents that present opportunities to update our country’s social contract. We didn’t want to\nmiss our chance to put some bold and innovative ideas on the table.\nWhile it’s not the Fed’s role to direct �scal policy, it is our role as thought leaders—in\nmacroeconomic policy, economic research, economic education and community\ndevelopment—to offer fact-based ideas that could improve our nation’s economy, especially\nfor those struggling Americans who could more fully reap its rewards.\nThought leadership has always been central to the St. Louis Fed’s mission, and we were\neager to provide leadership in an area where we were already heavily invested: savings and\nwealth building among those with fewer resources.\nThrough our recently sunset Center for Household Financial Stability, founded in the wake\nof the Great Recession, we documented large and enduring wealth gaps along racial,\neducational, generational and gender lines. These gaps, as the opening essays in the book\ndemonstrate, remain large and enduring:\n• The top 10% of American families owns 70% of total �nancial wealth, while the bottom\nhalf owns only 2%.\n• Those in the top half of the wealth distribution are more likely to be older, white or\nhighly educated; these groups own more family wealth than their share of the\npopulation.\n• The bottom half is disproportionately younger, Black or Hispanic and less educated;\nthese groups own less family wealth than their share of the population.\nIn many ways, we see this book as a capstone of the Center’s efforts to promote wealth\nbuilding inclusively, but we also see it as a cornerstone of the Center’s successor, the\nInstitute for Economic Equity, which views wealth equity as critical to achieving overall\neconomic equity in our country.\nObviously, we have a long way to go to reach wealth equity. For example, the typical, or\nmedian, white family has a net worth of about $184,000, while the typical Black family has\njust $23,000.\nThink about what these different levels mean for a family’s economic resilience in the face\nof a job loss, car breakdown or natural disaster—or for a family’s ability to look ahead: to\ninvest in education, a small business, a �rst home or a secure retirement. We all know that\nwealth begets wealth, so the challenge is: How do you accumulate some wealth in the �rst\nplace? Answering that question is one of the reasons we’re eager to publish this book.\nThe book aims to document profound wealth gaps but also point toward some promising\nsolutions. Knowing that we don’t have all the answers, Ray and Aspen reached out to over\n\n\f100 diverse and leading experts, resulting in over 60 original essays. These essays not only\noffered the latest thinking on ways to shore up fragile family balance sheets, but also how to\ndevise entirely new ways of generating an ownership stake in the U.S. economy.\nImportantly, working toward wealth equity at the household level contributes to a stronger\noverall economy. This point was strongly reinforced in a conversation I had with three of my\nFed colleagues—Presidents Bostic of the Atlanta Fed, Harker of the Philadelphia Fed and\nKashkari of the Minneapolis Fed—a summary of which is included in this book. In that\ndiscussion, my colleagues also described how the Fed could help address racial and other\nwealth gaps using the tools at its disposal.\nThank you for joining us today. We hope you’ll pick up your free copy—the price is right—of\nthe book and especially engage in the conversations we’re sure it will start.\nI’m now pleased to turn the program over to the book’s co-editors, my colleague Ray\nBoshara along with Ida Rademacher of the Aspen Institute.\n1 Any opinions expressed here are my own and do not necessarily re�ect those of the\n\nFederal Open Market Committee.\n\n\f",

That hasn’t been felt to be the case in the U.S. for years, he added.\nDuring the panel, Bullard noted that output and national income are higher today than before the\npandemic because the U.S. economy has adjusted and has so much resilience. He also said the U.S.\nmay be switching to a higher productivity growth rate and therefore a higher medium-term growth\nrate for the economy.\nHe also touched on fiscal policy during the pandemic, trade policy and immigration policy.\nHaving trouble with the video?

He expects real GDP growth to be higher than 4% for all of 2022.\nIn discussing the very tight labor market in the U.S., Bullard cited the unemployment-to-vacancies\nratio, the unemployment rate and a labor market conditions index.\nRegarding inflation, Bullard noted that core PCE inflation measured from a year ago is 3.6%, the\nhighest it has been in 30 years.

            "content": "Unofficial Transcript:\nVirtual Discussion with St. Louis Fed President James Bullard\nSeymour, Ind. (via WebEx)\nNov. 18, 2021\nNikki Lanier: Good morning, all. My name is Nikki Lanier, and I have the pleasure of serving as the senior\nvice president and regional executive of the Louisville Branch office of the Federal Reserve Bank of St.\nLouis. And I’m just so excited to welcome you to this convening this morning. This feels like a long time\ncoming. We’ve had various fits and starts, trying to make sure that we have an opportunity for our\nwonderfully auspicious president to visit with the leaders in Seymour. And COVID notwithstanding, we\nwere able to find an opportunity to do just that. So I’m very appreciative of all of you hanging in there\nwith us and kind of pivoting to this format this morning.\nToday’s session is being recorded and will likely be posted on the St. Louis Fed website. I would\njust ask that, during the Q&A, if you have a question, if you wouldn’t mind, please briefly introducing\nyourself when asking the question and then of course unmute yourself after the moderated discussion\nto do so.\nSo the timeline will be as follows for today’s discussion. The first portion will be a moderated\ninterview. It’s going to be about 20 minutes, followed by 30 minutes of open dialogue. Our President Jim\nBullard is super interested in your perspectives and your musings as it relates to your own\nunderstanding of and experience with the economy right now, so he’d love to hear that. During the\nopen dialogue session, the attendees will be able to mute and unmute your microphones to ask\nquestions after the commentary.\nI do want to make a few acknowledgements. The first is our wonderful board chair, Emerson\nGoodwin. And then my illustrious boss, First Vice President of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nKathy Paese. We have various members of the Bank’s External Engagement and Corporate\nCommunications team and the Supervision team that’s represented, our Research team, Guest Services\nteam—lots of teams from the Federal Reserve kind of make this magic happen behind the scenes. Of\ncourse, our Louisville Branch office employees as well. So thank you to all of you for your amazing\nsupport in getting us to this point.\nSo it’s my pleasure now to introduce Marvin Veatch. It’s been fantastic to work with Marvin. He\nhas been such a stalwart supporter of our work at the Branch office and certainly at the Bank level. He,\nas you all know, many of you on the call, he’s the president and CEO of the Jackson County Bank. He’s\nthe ninth CEO in the bank’s 121-year history. And he’s bringing more than 29 years of banking and\nfinancial accounting experience to this role with the 19 years that he’s been with the bank. Marvin\n1\n\n\fpreviously served as senior VP, CFO and COO with the bank, so he’s got a great storied history, very\ndeep understanding of the institution that he now has leadership over. As importantly, Martin has\nserved on the St. Louis Fed’s Community Depository Institutions Advisory Council, and did so from 2018\nto 2020. Marvin is a graduate of Anderson University and currently serves as treasurer of the Jackson\nCounty Industrial Development Corp. Marvin, I’m happy to turn the program over to you, sir.\nMarvin Veatch: Great, thank you, Nikki. And good morning, everyone. I too would like to add my\nwelcome and thank you for attending this morning’s virtual meeting with St. Louis Fed President Jim\nBullard. It’s certainly an honor for Jackson County to host President Bullard this morning. We would’ve\nall liked to have had this meeting be onsite and an in-person event. However, as Nikki has mentioned,\ngiven the resurgence of COVID during the planning stages, we needed to pivot, like we’re all accustomed\nto doing, and make this a virtual gathering.\nI first had the privilege of meeting President Bullard while serving on the Community Depository\nInstitutions Advisory Council, as Nikki mentioned, from 2018 to 2020. I can tell you that I certainly\nbenefited far more from those council meetings than I contributed, but my main takeaway from those\ncouncil meetings was President Bullard’s keen interest in taking the pulse of the economy and issues\nfacing the council members’ represented geographic area. As has been mentioned, the format of this\nmorning’s discussion will be a moderated discussion between myself and President Bullard, leaving\nample time for questions and open discussion because he truly does want to hear directly from each\nand every one of you.\nJim Bullard is the president and CEO at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. In that role, he is a\nparticipant on the Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee, which meets regularly to set the\ndirection of U.S. monetary policy. He also oversees the Federal Reserve’s Eighth District, including\nactivities in the St. Louis headquarters and its branches in Little Rock, Arkansas; Louisville, Kentucky; and\nMemphis, Tennessee.\nA noted economist and policymaker, Bullard makes Fed transparency and dialogue a priority on\nthe international and national stage as well as on Main Street. He serves on the board of directors of\nConcordance Academy of Leadership, and he is a past board chair of the United Way U.S.A. Bullard is coeditor of the Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control, a member of the editorial advisory board of the\nNational Institute Economic Review, and a member of the Central Bank Research Association’s senior\ncouncil. He’s an honorary professor of economics at Washington University in St. Louis, where he also\nsits on the advisory council of the economics department and the advisory board of the Center for\nDynamic Economics. A native of Lake Forest, Minnesota, President Bullard is also a Hoosier, receiving his\ndoctorate in economics from Indiana University in Bloomington. Welcome, Jim.\nJim Bullard: Yeah, it’s great to be here. Thanks for the introduction.\nVeatch: All right. If you’re all right, let’s just jump right in. As a bit of a backdrop for our discussion this\nmorning, I think it’s important that keeping our economy healthy is one of the most important jobs of\nthe Federal Reserve. Since 1977, the Federal Reserve System has been given a dual mandate by\nCongress, pursuing economic goals of maximizing employment and price stability. It does this by using a\nvariety of policy tools to manage financial conditions that encourage progress towards its dual mandate.\nIn other words, conducting monetary policy.\n2\n\n\fFed Chairman Jerome Powell said he expects inflation to persist well into next year. My question is, is\nthe current high inflation function in excess of fiscal monetary stimulus added over the past two years?\nOr if not, what do you attribute to those inflationary pressures? And secondarily, do you share the view\nthat the current inflation is temporary or transitory? And if so, what current conditions must change to\nbring that down?\nBullard: Yeah. It’s great to be here today, and it’s great to see everybody. And I’ll just put my emphasis\non the idea that it would be nicer if we could be in person. I always like moving around the District and\nmeeting people firsthand. I think soon we’ll be able to get back to that, but we’re not quite there yet, so\nwe had to do this via virtual interaction. But I think we can have a great meeting today, and I’m looking\nforward to everyone’s input because I really do like to hear how the anecdotes from around your area\nare matching up with all the data that we see and analyze all the time, which I would just emphasize is a\nlittle bit dated. The data is always a couple months behind or even a couple quarters behind, so the\nvalue for me is to really hear about what’s going on right now and how you’re seeing the next couple of\nmonths or couple of quarters in the economy.\nOn inflation, I think just a few numbers. The Committee likes to emphasize what we call the core\nPCE inflation rate, which is the personal consumption expenditures inflation less food and energy. So\nyou’re going to throw out the energy component in particular. And you can measure this from one year\nago. So that particular number—and there are other ways to measure inflation, but that one’s the\nfavorite of the Committee. That number is 3.6% right now, and it’s expected to tick up further, maybe\nover 4% by the end of this year.\nNow if you look back historically, so this is a smoothed measure, and one that throws out some\nstuff, which may not be that wise because those are prices people actually have to pay. But you’re\nalready doing a lot of smoothing and a lot of trimming when you look at this number, 3.6%. But that’s\nthe highest this has been in 30 years, so since the early 1990s. And I would consider that era, from let’s\nsay 1979-1980 to 1995, to be part of the Volcker era where we were trying to bring inflation down and\nkeep inflation under control. We didn’t really succeed in that until 1995. So you have to go all the way\nback to that era to see inflation at the levels that they’re at today. And I think this is a major challenge,\nboth within the Fed, for the people that analyze inflation within the Fed, for financial markets. I just\ndon’t think people are used to the idea that we’re going to have this much inflation and we’re probably\ngoing to have to take action to combat this inflation and keep it under control.\nAnother thing I would emphasize here is that it’s the central bank’s responsibility to keep\ninflation low and stable, and to hit the inflation target of 2%. And when it’s not happening, it’s because\nof the central bank. It isn’t because of anything else. And some of the discussion today is veering off in\nother directions and putting blame for inflation on all kinds of other factors, but no. It’s up to the central\nbank to keep inflation near the inflation target, and to take actions that make sure that you achieve your\ninflation objective. So we made a lot of progress I think, starting in 2012 when we actually named an\ninflation target, and it was 2%. That’s an international standard. Similar to the European Central Bank\nand other central banks around the world. And for a long time, we missed it to the low side. I was\nactually on the dovish side of the Committee during that era saying we should do more to try to hit our\ninflation target and maintain credibility. But now, just in the last nine months or so, we’ve gone to the\nhigh side and we’re at risk now of allowing inflation to drift even higher during 2022. I’m not saying\nthat’s my baseline case, but that could happen. We’re vulnerable to further shocks or further surprises\n3\n\n\fon inflation. And if that happens, I think we’ll have to take more action in order to keep inflation under\ncontrol.\nSo this is why I’ve been advocating that we tack in a hawkish direction in the meetings ahead.\nWe’ve got a very easy monetary policy. We’re buying lots of bonds and mortgage-backed securities. And\nwe’ve got the policy rate near zero. So this is really an all-out response to the pandemic. I think that was\nappropriate in March and April of 2020, but since then, the economy has boomed since really the third\nquarter of 2020 and all the way up to the present time. It has totally surprised to the upside, to the point\nwhere real GDP or national income is actually above the pre-pandemic level. So in that sense, the\neconomy’s completely recovered from the pandemic, and the pandemic isn’t even over yet, as this\nmeeting has illustrated and we can’t meet in person yet. So I think that’s a tribute to the ingenuity of\nAmerican businesses that they’ve been able to take on this new challenge, think about how to provide\ntheir goods and services even though they’re in a different environment than they would have\nanticipated, more automation, different types of products. Some businesses have been hit too hard and\nthey haven’t been able to survive, but many have been able to do very well during this period.\nSo I just wanted to give those as some baseline comments on where I think we are with\ninflation, but I’ll quit rambling on so that you can ask more questions.\nVeatch: No, you’re fine. That kind of leads me into my next question here. We talked about kind of the\nelevated level of inflation, but we’ve all heard the supply chain issues that many are facing and most are\nconsidering that to be very, very frustrating. What direct impact do you believe that the supply chain\nissues are having on the economy and the inflation increase that you just spoke about?\nBullard: Yeah. Those are getting a lot of attention and they’re very tangible and very real. One thing\nabout the pandemic is that it has upset global supply chains, and the pandemic is affecting different\nparts of the world at different rates. And so one day one part of the world might be more affected, and\nanother day another part of the world might be more affected. And that’s showing up in disruptions in\nsupply chains that were not anticipated. And of course, if you have restrictions to supply, you’re going to\nsee higher prices.\nI would caution people though that that can’t be the entire story here. If you take your supply\nand demand diagram from econ 101 and you shift the supply curve to the left, yes, the price level will go\nup and the quantity will go down, but that isn’t totally what’s happened here because, as I just said, real\nGDP is actually higher than it was before the pandemic. So I think the demand curve has also shifted to\nthe right, so at least half the inflation is due to demand factors, even though some of it’s due to supply\nfactors.\nSo this is sounding a lot like the 1970s where you did have supply shocks. You had a lot of\npeople arguing that it wasn’t up to the central bank to control inflation, but it is up to the central bank\nto control inflation.\nVeatch: Speaking of the supply chain issues, do you have any idea on what needs to be done direct by\nthat, or when those supply chains will be reopened in any measure?\nBullard: Most businesses seem to think that this is going to persist through 2022 and even into 2023.\nThe pandemic itself is going to have this long tail I think, despite the arrival of vaccines. I guess what\n4\n\n\fwe’ve learned is that those don’t penetrate across the entire population and certainly not across the\nentire world population. Different countries have different strategies about how to handle the\npandemic, and have maybe been slower to vaccinate and the disease itself can morph and has to some\nextent. So I think for those reasons, you probably shouldn’t expect a sudden resolution of supply chain\nissues. But I also think that companies do adapt, and over these kinds of time scales. They can’t adapt\nover 90 days maybe, but over a year or 18 months, then they can start to think about, well, I’m going to\nfind some way around this log jam and find some other way to get the inputs that I need to produce my\nproduct. So I think a lot of that is happening. And I think also business school 101 is coming back into\nplay here, which I always thought was diversify your supply chain so you don’t get into these problems\nand don’t lock into a particular supply arrangement, because you can really get burned if it gets\ndisrupted.\nVeatch: Finding workers continues to be an issue, not only here in Jackson County, but across the state\nand the entire U.S. Jackson County’s unemployment rate at the end of September was 2.9%. That\ncompares to Indiana’s rate of 3.5% and the U.S. rate of 4.6%. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics,\nin the two months ending October 2021, the U.S. labor participation rate ranged between a low of\n61.4% and a high of 61.7%. Can you provide any thoughts or insight as to why you believe this\nparticipation rate remains depressed?\nBullard: Yeah. So I’ll tell you my story about it, but I’d like to hear input from all of you as well. I think\nthis is one of the hottest labor markets we’ve seen in the post-World War II era. And I would cite three\nmeasures on this. One is the unemployment rate itself, 4.6% right now. But the key thing about that is\nit’s been declining at about two-tenths per month since vaccines came on the scene last December. And\nif it continues to decline at two-tenths per month, we’ll be below 4% unemployment in the U.S. in the\nfirst quarter of 2022. So for those of you that track these kinds of numbers, anything below 4% is a\nfantastic labor market in the U.S., and even 4.6% would have been considered well below full\nemployment at one point by the Open Market Committee. So it’s low and it’s coming lower, so that’s\none argument.\nAnother argument is that the number of job openings compared to the number of unemployed\nworkers is—if you take the unemployment-to-vacancies ratio, that’s at an all-time low, even lower than\nit was in 2018-2019 before the pandemic, lower than it was in 2006-2007 before the financial crisis, and\nlower than it was even in the late 1990s, which was one of the very best job markets that we’ve ever\nseen. So I think there’s just no question that the number of people seeking work is much, much less than\nthe number of job openings that businesses are posting. And so it’s very clear that there’s a scramble for\nlabor, and I’d like to hear more about this here. Even to the point where you see some businesses\nunable to reopen from the pandemic because they just can’t find any workers, or they have to open for\njust limited hours, maybe four hours is all they can do to stay open. So you really have a scramble here.\nYou’re seeing this in wages. You’re seeing this in banners on businesses as you’re driving down the\nhighway, “We’re hiring. Signing bonus. You can start tomorrow. You can start today. You can start\nbefore lunch.” So it’s just a very hot labor market on that dimension.\nAnd then the other thing I would cite here is that we’ve wanted to have a broad and inclusive\nmeasure of labor market performance so that we’re not overly focused on just one number. And you\ncan do that. There are lots of labor market indicators, anywhere from 15 to 25, depending on how you\nwant to count it. And so what you can do is put all those indicators together in an index, call that the\nlabor market conditions index. And the Kansas City Fed has done this; they have a labor market\n5\n\n\fconditions index. And that’s a way of getting at this issue of broad and diverse measures of labor market\nperformance. So that index is back at the pre-pandemic level, and has been shooting up rapidly in recent\nmonths. So I think there again, all indications are that this is a very strong labor market.\nNow on the labor force participation, I think there’s been overemphasis on this issue. It’s very\nclear that as the pandemic came on, it changed behavior in certain ways, in two key ways. One is the\namount of retirements that occurred. Now, we think that might be as high as three million early\nretirements. You can measure it in different ways. You might get somewhat different numbers, but it’s\nseveral million. And I think it makes perfect sense that when the pandemic came along, people that\nwere near retirement decided to go ahead and retire because their nest eggs looked pretty good,\nequities are near or at an all-time high, house prices have gone up dramatically, so if they owned a\nhouse, then they were in good shape on that dimension. And the COVID is more risky for elderly people;\n80% of the deaths have occurred in people over 65. So all those factors would push a person that’s on\nthe margin toward the retirement decision. So I think that was made. And I wouldn’t begrudge any of\nthem. I hope they have a good retirement. But I wouldn’t expect them to come back into the labor force\nin this situation. The pandemic isn’t even over.\nAnd the other factor that has driven labor force participation down is child care. There again\nyou’ve got a situation where households looked at the pandemic. They looked at schools not being in\nperson, and if they’re on the margin they decided that, “Hey, maybe this is a good time for one of the\nadults in the house to stay home.” And child care couldn’t be more personal interaction and a lot of high\nphysical contact, which isn’t good in this era. So there again, you’ve got probably more than a million\ndropping out of the labor force because of that. Those factors will dissipate as we go forward over the\nnext five to ten years and you’ll get back to something more normal, but I wouldn’t expect them to\ndissipate in the near term here while we’ve got our inflation pressure in the economy. So I wouldn’t wait\nfor that. And I wouldn’t begrudge any of these people for making these decisions. These sound like\nsensible decisions given the fact that you’re in the middle of a pandemic.\nSo I think labor force participation is going to be depressed for a while. But I think nevertheless,\nit’s a very hot labor market with increases in labor compensation.\nVeatch: You talked about housing and that’s a great segue into kind of our next topic here. Housing\ncontinues to be an issue facing not only our region, state and country. In Indiana, on a 12-month rolling\naverage, the housing inventory is down 42% while average prices have increased 13%. In Jackson\nCounty, there are currently 59 homes on the market. And over the last year, there’s an approximate 1.3\nmonth inventory supply. So as you know, that’s a very, very low inventory supply number there.\nSo with that, do you believe that there’s any kind of a housing bubble that’s being created with\nthe increasing and escalating prices?\nBullard: Yeah. I’ve been concerned about this. I do think that the Fed got into a lot of trouble in the mid2000s by neglecting a housing bubble, and not moving rapidly enough to try to contain it. I think housing\nprices getting out of control turned out to be much more important than, let’s say, an individual stock or\neven the dot-com bubble because it’s a leveraged purchase by most households, and the decline in\nhouse prices during the earlier crisis from 2007 to 2009 caused tremendous pain and rippled throughout\nthe economy and throughout the global economy. So I do worry about the idea that we might be\nfeeding into an incipient housing bubble, especially with our purchase of mortgage-backed securities,\n6\n\n\fwhich is still going on right now. This was something that we did put in place in March and April of 2020.\nAt least my thinking at the time was that we were going into this pandemic. You didn’t know what was\ngoing to happen. It could have been a Great Depression scenario, and probably the housing market\nwould be hard hit. But instead what happened was that the housing market boomed during the\npandemic as people reassessed where they could live and where they wanted to live. And combine that\nwith input supply problems, which we’ve already talked about for being able to build houses or add to\nthe stock.\nSo I am concerned about this. I think that’s a good reason to end asset purchases even\nsomewhat sooner than what the Committee has already decided to do. We have a tapering program\nthat’s supposed to end in June. I’d want to think carefully about speeding that up. I don’t think there’s\nany reason to be doing these asset purchases at this point. It’s not really helping us and it might be\nfeeding into a bubble situation, which we may regret later.\nVeatch: Going back to some of the workforce related issues, we’re also finding kind of lack of workers\nwith experience in the trades to even build the houses that are needed. Our local Seymour High School\nhas what’s called Al Manufacturing Program, which focuses on training high schools in the\nmanufacturing sector, and this was an opportunity that I had to share with Nikki and she toured this\nwith me a couple years ago. But since that time, the high school’s also restarted building a trades\nprogram and is also developing an agriculture related curriculum knowing that college may not be for all\nkids.\nSo what are you finding or seeing along these lines? Do you see any kind of a transition in that\nwhole education aspect?\nBullard: I mean, I applaud that kind of program, and I’ve toured some myself around the District in other\nmunicipalities and counties. I think it’s a great idea. I do think it’s right that you have to think at a\nsomewhat earlier age about what’s going to be likely for where different people want to go with their\nwork life, and picking up skills, and being able to do important work, I would say, but maybe not things\nthat require the college degree is appealing to a certain segment, and I think that’s great. And they can\ndo pretty well in those kinds of fields. So I think it’s a great idea. Sometimes I’d point to the German\nmodel. Germany is a country that made labor market reforms. For a long time they had an\nunemployment around 10%, and they had youth unemployment extremely high. Much higher than 10%.\nAnd then they went to this labor market reform, and part of it was a lot of apprenticeship programs at\nwhat we would call the high school level, and that was very successful. It cut the youth unemployment\nrate in half and reduced the overall unemployment rate probably in half. And so I have always thought\nthat Germany had the right model here about how to ease that transition for people, let’s say between\n15 and 20 years old, that when they’re thinking about their future give them some options and some\ntraining so they can do some things other than, if they want, other than necessarily going and getting\nthe college degree.\nVeatch: Great. Approximately two weeks ago, President Biden nominated Saule Omarova, a Cornell\nUniversity law professor, to serve as the next comptroller of the currency. An outspoken critic of the\nbanking system, she’s forwarded an idea of restructuring the Federal Reserve and downsizing the\ninfluence of and roles of banks. She’s argued that by shifting deposit accounts from banks to the Fed, it\nwould make the financial system less complex, more stable and more efficient in serving the long-term\nneeds of the American people. Many have weighed in to say this position is bad for the country’s\n7\n\n\ffinancial position. I’m interested in your thoughts and insights on this idea that’s been put forward, and\nwhether or not you believe it has any merit.\nBullard: Yeah. Well, I wouldn’t comment on any pending nominees, and I don’t know the details around\nthis proposal, but I can talk in general terms about some of the ways I see financial intermediation\nevolving in the country.\nI would say a couple things. One to keep in mind is that a lot of the intermediation actually does\nnot go through banks. So Congress generally is overly enamored, I would say, with the banking sector,\nand they don’t pay enough attention to the non-bank financial sector. You’ve got 80% of what’s going\non is this non-bank financial, and you’ve got a whole host of people in Silicon Valley and elsewhere\naround the country that are thinking of ways to provide financial services without calling themselves\nbanks. This is regulatory arbitrage 101, and that’s mainly what’s going on in this country. So to come in\nand do something—lay on more regulations around the banks or something, that probably isn’t going to\nbe what’s going to stabilize the financial sector, and it’s not going to be what prevents the next financial\ncrisis. The next financial crisis is almost certainly going to come from the unregulated part of financial\nintermediation services.\nI would say another thing in this kind of idea of Fed accounts is Japan had a postal kind of\nbanking system. So you could—for years I think in the post-war era, and maybe up until today, you could\nhave an account in the Japanese postal system. As far as I know, I’ve never seen anything that that really\nmade very much difference one way or the other. People could do it if they wanted to, but they could\ndeposit elsewhere if they wanted to. I mean, I just don’t see it as a silver bullet for anything. And I think\none thing I’d like to see is an argument that that kind of system made some big difference in how the\neconomy operated. I don’t think that it did.\nAlso you’ve got credit unions, which are a favorite subject of bankers. So if the concern is that\npeople are putting their deposits in profit-making entities, and these entities are turning around and\nallocating capital according to marketing signals, well, you’ve also got a not-for-profit sector, the credit\nunion sector, which has almost as many institutions and lots of assets. So I would say that households\nhave an option if that’s the concern. I’ve often wondered why we don’t put those two parts of the\ndeposit taking institution sector on a level playing field, but that isn’t something Congress has wanted to\ndo.\nI was going to say about central bank digital currency. So this is getting wrapped up in the\ncentral bank digital currency debate, and that is a debate about whether a virtual coin should be issued\nby the Fed. And that’s a little bit different from just the idea of having deposit accounts at the Fed. I\ndon’t think that the ideas around central bank digital currency are addressing the phenomenon of\nprivately issued currency effectively. I’m sure people are interested in this, so let me just talk about it for\na little bit.\nThe privately issued currency, which is what a cryptocurrency is, that was for a long time not\nlegal in the U.S., but in the last part of the last century it became okay to do that. So now you’ve got\nvirtual currency circulating around. I think you might wonder if they’re perfect substitutes for dollars,\nthen why are the virtual currencies being used? But most of that is also regulatory arbitrage of various\nkinds. They’re trying to use the cryptocurrency for transactions that would be hard to make if you just\ndid them through banks and through the normal payment system. I don’t think cryptocurrencies have\n8\n\n\fany advantages as far as speed or anything like that. You can trade dollars around the world instantly. So\nit has to do with regulatory arbitrage and getting outside of the regulations inside the banking system\nand inside the payment system.\nSo the idea of a central bank digital currency would be that it’s going to compete with the\ncryptocurrency, but it’s not because it’s not going to be regulatory arbitrage if we issue it, because we’re\ngoing to put all the rules around it that would be around the normal payment system. So I think people\nare a little confused on this issue, and I think cryptocurrency has to face up to the types of transactions\nthat are being made on this system. I think there’s probably more regulation coming on cryptocurrency\nas we go forward. Cryptocurrency has another problem which is free entry. So free entry means\nanybody can issue one of these, and that is certainly happening. You’re seeing thousands actually have\nbeen issued, and more every day, and it’s inexplicable how they trade against one another. So a lot\ngoing on in this space, but I just wanted to get to some of those issues.\nVeatch: I appreciate your insight on that. And I think speaking for most, if not all bankers across the\ncountry, we certainly would welcome the idea of a level playing field with our credit union friends there.\nSo appreciate that.\nRecently this past Monday, President Biden signed into law a one trillion dollar infrastructure\nbill. Any insight on what you believe the current and/or future impact this bill might have on some of the\nthings we’ve already talked about, inflation, employment, supply chain issues and the like?\nBullard: Yeah. This was a hard infrastructure bill, and I am one that thinks Congress should be probably\nevery year—they don’t behave like this, but every year you should have an infrastructure bill that’s kind\nof the same way you’d have an ag bill or something. And then you should wrestle with the public\ninfrastructure in the economy, and you should be thinking about—all the time I think—where do we\nneed to update? Where do we need to build out for the future? And those decisions, as we all know, are\nfraught. It’s hard to make those decisions. Some parts of the country benefit and other parts of the\ncountry get less benefit. But nevertheless, it’s up to the Congress, in my view, to take care of the\nphysical capital stock. If you let it depreciate too much, that hurts the whole economy. If you build it up,\nit can be good, but you also have this problem of wasteful spending. You can build highways and bridges\nthat don’t need it, and that comes out of the political process and the jockeying around this kind of bill. I\ndon’t know how much of that is going on here, but one thing that would be helpful is to track very\ncarefully how this actually gets spent and look at what actually happens with the dollars as they go out\nthe door.\nBut we did get bipartisan support for this in the Senate and some in the House, and I think that\nreflects the idea that a lot of things probably do need to be done nationally on infrastructure. Whether\nthis would influence the longer-run growth rate of the economy, I would say, well, yes, compared to\ndoing nothing. If you’re going to let your public infrastructure crumble, that’s going to hurt the\neconomy. But it should be viewed more as this is the normal makeup for the depreciation of physical\ncapital stock, and you should be doing a little bit of this all the time so that you don’t get too far behind\nand your infrastructure totally crumbles. I think bridges that need repair is one of the examples that’s\noften given, and this bill only does actually a little bit of the total amount of bridge repair that we\nprobably should be doing. So I’d advocate that you had a bill like this sort of every year, and you had a\nlist of projects, and you’re thinking, “Okay, well, we’ll do some of these this year, and we’ll do some of\nthese next year, and some of these the year after that.” But the politics of it really gets very difficult.\n9\n\n\fVeatch: We’ve covered a lot of ground this morning, and I’ve got really one last question before I turn it\nback over to Nikki and we open it up for questions and discussion from our guests. As you may recall, as\nI reported at our CDIAC meetings, I believe our county and our region has a lot of great things going for\nit. From an economic development perspective, according to Jim Plump, our executive director of\nJackson County Industrial Development Corporation, our 2021 promised investment, and this was\nthrough September, is about 105.5 million dollars. That’s the fifth highest total in history and just the\nsecond time since 2014 that more than 100 million was invested. We’re also confident at this point that\nanother 92 million will hit the books for 2022. And as you know, we’ve not even yet closed the books for\n2021. Additionally, recent U.S. Census Bureau data reported that Jackson County ranks as the fastest\ngrowing Indiana rural county and the seventh fastest overall in Indiana. Jackson County also ranks\nseventh out of 92 counties with a growth rate of 9.6% over the past decade. Further, the city of Seymour\nregistered a 23.2% population increase. And we also have some other great assets in our community.\nOur local hospital and health care system is a tremendous asset and has received numerous regional,\nstate and even national awards for their quality of care.\nWhile I think it would be certainly unfair for us to compare ourselves to other metro areas like a\nSt. Louis, a Louisville or a Memphis, given this limited overview of our county and there are\napproximately 44,000 population with nearly half of those living in Seymour, can you give a sense of\nhow you would say that we kind of stack up to those other communities you’ve visited in the Eighth\nDistrict?\nBullard: Yeah. I think those statistics speak to the quality of life I think in the Midwest. You know, I\nalways say the Midwest is America’s best kept secret. I actually think it’s one of the wealthiest regions in\nthe country if you are willing to account for cost of living. And I’ve tried to emphasize in some of my\ntalks, cost of living. And I think because the costs are so high in some of the glam cities, it really makes it\nkind of a miserable lifestyle to be living in a place where even with a pretty good job or two jobs, the\nhousehold really has a struggle to live a good lifestyle. So I think that the pandemic may be a turning\npoint where people do a better job of recognizing that they could live in various parts of the country,\nthey could have a higher quality of life. You don’t have to pile into the big city in order to have a good\nlifestyle. So we’ll see the extent to which that happens, but I would think that that’s going to be\npotentially a major trend over the next ten years. And you’re certainly seeing a lot of that where firms\nare thinking about whether they could hire workers at somewhat higher wages, but not as high as they\nwould have to pay in the big city. And certainly tech companies and others are talking about that and\nmoving in that direction. So I think this is really a major technological trend that will influence the\neconomy for some time to come.\nThe unemployment rate for the District, which we measure by taking the MSAs in the District\nand looking at their unemployment rates and weighting that, it’s 4%. So in this part of the country,\nyou’re talking about unemployment heading into the 3% range very soon. Probably with the next jobs\nreport. And if you look at where unemployment is still high, it’s California, New York and some of the\neast coast, and maybe a few other places. But I think that the pandemic has influenced especially very\nlarge cities differently because of the public transportation issue and the difficulties of commuting and\npeople kind of reassessing whether they really want to or need to be commuting as much as they are. In\na smaller place you don’t really have that issue. It goes away and you get sort of better housing per\ndollar. So I think this is really a place where we’re going to be reassessing as we go forward and come\nout of the pandemic here.\n10\n\n\fVeatch: All right. Great. Well Jim, thank you so much for taking time out of your schedule this morning.\nIt’s been certainly a pleasure. And I’m hopeful that when we get this pandemic in our rearview mirror\nthat you will join us in person here in Seymour in Jackson County. At this point, I’ll turn the meeting back\nover to Nikki. Nikki?\nLanier: Marvin, thank you. Thank you so much. That was masterfully moderated. I very much appreciate\nthat. Jim, thank you for your remarks and your perspectives. I’d love to open up the floor. I think we are\nan intimate enough of a group to maybe manage this organically over the next 15 minutes or so. So if\nyou have a question, a comment or a reaction, if you would not mind unmuting and of course introduce\nyourself briefly, and then if you could share your thought or your question with Jim. Please do so now\nwhoever would like to go first.\nQuestion from the audience: We’re in some of the major supply chains in the automotive industry, and\none of the challenges that we’re having is convincing our end customers that these increases are real\nand how long they’re going to last. And I thank you very much for the graphs you have on the St. Louis\nFed website. I’ve been using them a lot in these types of presentations.\nI was looking if you could give us some insight into what are some of the best ways to look at the\nfuture predictors so we can help them understand that. And if you were in my position, are there some\nspecific graphs or data you would use to help convince them of this problem? They all recognize it, but\nthey don’t really want to recognize it when it comes to increasing costs for us as a producer.\nBullard: Well, yeah. I guess you’ll have to be forceful with them. But I’m not probably a great negotiator,\nso I’m not sure that I can offer too much insight on this. I do think though that anecdotally we’re\ncertainly getting the idea that certain types of supply chain problems are going to persist for a long time.\nI would just give a big macro picture out of this, which is that I think that Asia early in the pandemic\nseemed to be addressing the pandemic better than North America and better than Europe. And of\ncourse a lot of these supply chain issues are tied toward factories and manufacturers in Asia.\nHowever, I think that as the pandemic went on, it became clearer that actually North America\nand Europe probably had the better strategy. More oriented toward vaccines, more oriented toward\nquick vaccination. And then you had the delta variant come along, which made kind of the COVID zero\nstrategy not be that effective anymore. And so in a sense, the Asian economies were sitting ducks when\ndelta came along; they weren’t highly vaccinated and you had this very virulent type of COVID that was\nspreading very rapidly. So I think that’s one reason why I think that these supply chain problems are not\nclearing up as readily as you would think. Now, the world’s a big place. You’ve got billions and billions of\npeople. You shouldn’t expect everyone to get vaccinated, and it’s certainly not going to happen that\nway. So how this is going to play out, I don’t know. But I think that’s one sort of high-level argument that\nyou can make, that this is going to persist for quite a while.\nAlso, these supply chains are too specialized, I would say. That’s kind of the lesson. I mentioned\nthis earlier. The drive toward cost cutting over the last 25 years, just fierce, I would say, and you just go\nto the very lowest cost producer, and you’ve got the one factory somewhere that’s producing\nsomething, and you’re going to put all of your marbles in that basket, and this shows that that isn’t a\ngood strategy. It’s not resilient enough when something unexpected happens. And you should have\nmore diversity in your supply chain. Like I say, some of that’s happening, but it’s not that easy to just\nbuild a plant. “Oh, all of a sudden I’m going to build two new plants in different parts of the world so\n11\n\n\fthat I’m more diversified.” That’s not that easy to do. But it will happen, but it’s going to take quite a\nwhile. So I know that’s not a great answer for your situation, but those are some of my thoughts.\nQuestion from the audience: If I understand correctly, you talked about unemployment is moving\ndown, 4% in the next report. When you break that down race and gender, what does that look like?\nBullard: The gender will look similar, but the race, as we all know, I think will be, have a gap. Black\nunemployment tends to be higher. I would very much like to see that gap come down to zero. What I\nwould suggest on that is that that should be an assignment given to the labor secretary where the Labor\nDepartment is responsible for getting these gaps down to zero. I think it could be done with some\nmanagement attention, frankly, on it. And it seems to me like that would be a great focus. We could get\na lot better outcomes for Black America, but also good outcomes for the whole economy if we could get\nthese unemployment rates to sort of match up across racial and ethnic groups.\nQuestion from the audience: I’m blessed to have nine grandchildren and always concerned about the\nlevel of our national debt. Can you discuss the influence of the national debt, both recorded and off\nbalance sheet on the behind the curtains discussions about monetary policy?\nBullard: Yeah. I think it’s clear that the pandemic led to a lot of deficit spending. On that, I would say\nthat the kind of spending done in March, April 2020—if there was ever a time when you were going to\ntake on a lot of debt to try to get through a crisis, it seems like that was the time to do it. By itself, that\nprobably put 10 percentage points on the debt-to-GDP ratio. I will say Congress has been mildly more\ndisciplined, I guess, than I was expecting in later legislation. They’ve insisted on trying to pay for some of\nthe things that they want to spend money on. I think that’s good. There are always gimmicks and tricks\naround that, which I think is not good and I wish we could get that out of our political process. But can\nthe country carry a 100% or 110% debt-to-GDP ratio? I think that we can at low interest rates, and\ncertainly we’ve had low interest rates for quite a while.\nI think the way to maintain low interest rates is to maintain discipline on inflation and make sure\nthat you’re keeping inflation low and stable so that you don’t get the high nominal interest rates that\nare associated with the high inflation. So when we had problems in the 1970s, that’s what happened is\nthat you had high inflation and high nominal interest rates, and it made the debt service component of\nthe federal debt skyrocket and create a lot of problems. So hopefully we don’t get into that situation.\nBut to avoid that situation, the Fed has to remain vigilant on inflation, and keep inflation low and stable.\nLanier: Probably have time for one more question.\nQuestion from the audience: You worked with Janet Yellen for a number of years as Fed Chair and\ncolleague, and now she’s Treasury Secretary. Do you find significant differences in her positions as Fed\nChair and where she is now as Secretary of the Treasury? And that may be too political for you to\nanswer, but I’ll leave that for you to decide.\nBullard: I always really enjoyed working with Janet. We don’t always agree on everything, but I’ve\nalways found her to be a very good economist. She has a lot of middle-of-the-road, I would say, ideas\nabout how to handle certain issues. I think it’s put a lot of pressure on her I think to ask her to step in\nafter being Fed Chair as Treasury Secretary, but she was willing to do it, so I think we should salute her\nfor her service to the country. I think she’s influential inside the Biden administration. She’s a person\n12\n\n\fthat has the ear, I’d say, on both sides of the Democratic party, and that makes her a pivotal person for\nhow the nation will approach key issues. So I’ve always enjoyed working with her.\nQuestion from the audience: Thank you. That sounds very politically correct, and I accept that at face\nvalue. Maybe a follow up. Your position on the idea of the IRS having access to the extent that’s being\nproposed to everyday consumer and business checking account information.\nBullard: Yeah. I’ve been concerned about this issue, and it’s a little unclear exactly what the proposal is.\nI have talked to members of the Congress from the Eighth District. They do seem to be concerned about\nit. I don’t think you’d want to be tracking every transaction of every account. And it seems like an\nadministrative burden and probably unnecessary for what’s going to be accomplished. I’m not even sure\nyou could handle that much data with our current system. So I think we probably need something. The\nspirit of it I think is to get better enforcement for the IRS, but there must be better ways to do it than to\ntry to keep track of all these transactions over millions and millions of people.\nLanier: Well thank you so much, Jim. And we are right at 9:30. That’s absolutely incredible. We finished\nright on time. I just want to express my appreciation again on behalf of the Branch and our Bank, St.\nLouis Federal Reserve, for your very gracious, attentive, focused engagement today. Starting out your\nmorning with us is quite a treat, and we very much appreciate that. Thank you, Jim. Thank you, Marvin.\nThank you everyone on the Federal Reserve team who made today possible. And we definitely look\nforward to an opportunity to get Jim physically in Seymour. I have been, and thoroughly enjoyed my\ntime there, and I’m sure he will too. You all have a great rest of your morning, and we will talk soon\nagain I’m sure.\n\n13\n\n\f",

The\nfederal debt is therefore not backed by future taxes.\nImportant private credit market: The young borrow from the\nmiddle-aged, who are saving for when they are old.\nEnough realistic features to provide an interesting calibrated\nbenchmark.\nSubstantial inequality in income and financial wealth—enough\nto generate Gini coefficients close to those observed in U.S. data.\n\n4\n\n\fI NTRODUCTION\n\nE NVIRONMENT\n\nM APPING TO D ATA\n\nC ONCLUSIONS\n\nM AIN FINDING\n\nMain result: The optimal federal debt-to-GDP ratio in the\nbenchmark calibrated equilibrium of this economy is 100%, a\nsubstantial share of the current U.S. federal debt-to-GDP ratio.\nIntuition: Our model provides a demand for government debt as\na type of “interest-bearing money,” and the amount needed to\nsupport the first-best allocation of resources turns out to be large.\nThe results in this paper are best thought of as applying to large\nstable economies with high fiscal and monetary policy credibility.\nWhether these results would apply to countries within the EMU\nis an open question.\n\n5\n\n\fI NTRODUCTION\n\nE NVIRONMENT\n\nM APPING TO D ATA\n\nC ONCLUSIONS\n\nR EMARKS\nComplete characterization of optimal monetary/fiscal policy.\nThe fiscal authority issues one-period nominal debt at the expected\nrate of nominal output growth.\nThe monetary authority sets the price level to ensure that the real\nrate of return on this debt and other assets is equal to the stochastic\nrate of real output growth.\n\nThe optimal fiscal-monetary mix works equally well whether\ninterest rates are high or low.\nMonetary policy provides a form of insurance to investors by\nmaking the real return on government debt appropriately\nstate-contingent in an economy with non-state-contingent\nnominal contracting.\n\n6\n\n\fI NTRODUCTION\n\nE NVIRONMENT\n\nM APPING TO D ATA\n\nC ONCLUSIONS\n\nM ORE REMARKS\n\nIn the equilibrium we describe, federal government debt coexists\nwith capital and with privately issued debt, which can be\ninterpreted as mortgage-backed securities.\nWe focus on one-period debt, but the model can price\nmany-period debt.\nWe abstract from international considerations, but this is an\nimportant area for future research.\n\n7\n\n\fI NTRODUCTION\n\nE NVIRONMENT\n\nM APPING TO D ATA\n\nC ONCLUSIONS\n\nB OTTOM LINE EXAMPLE\nThe U.S. federal debt-to-GDP ratio is 122.5% (Q3 2021).\nStandard macroeconomics would consider this entirely as\nBarro-Ricardian debt that must be backed by future taxation.\nAlso, levels in excess of 60% (according to the Maastricht Treaty)\nare excessive and suggest a future crisis.\nThis paper calibrates a first tranche of 100%, which is\n“interest-bearing money” and not backed by future taxation.\nThis would leave 22.5% as Barro-Ricardian debt (not modeled)\nthat must be backed by future taxes—a level that would\nnormally be considered easily sustainable.\nThe paper provides wide scope for interpreting how large the\ntwo tranches may be—the case with a first tranche of 100%\npresented here provides one illustration that the first tranche\nmay be quite large.\n\n8\n\n\fI

AGENTS\nAt each date t, a new continuum of households enters the\neconomy, makes economic decisions over T + 1 = 241 dates,\nthen exits the economy.\nThis corresponds to an agent entering the economy as a\ndecision-maker at age 20 and exiting as a decision-maker at age\n80, inclusive of end points, and making economic decisions at a\nquarterly frequency.\nResults are perfectly general for the choice of T, with higher\nvalues corresponding to decision-making at more frequent\nintervals.\nThis class of models has a “paper-and-pencil” equilibrium\nsolution, and so it provides a simple benchmark model for\nheterogeneous-agent macroeconomies with aggregate shocks.\n\n10\n\n\fI NTRODUCTION\n\nE NVIRONMENT\n\nM APPING TO D ATA\n\nC ONCLUSIONS\n\nR ISK FACED BY HOUSEHOLDS\n\nThere is both aggregate risk and idiosyncratic risk.\nAll idiosyncratic risk is borne as the agent enters the economy.\nMacroeconomic policymakers provide a form of insurance\nagainst the aggregate risk.\nA welfare theorem describes the sense in which the equilibrium\nstudied here represents a first-best allocation of resources.\n\n11\n\n\fI NTRODUCTION\n\nE NVIRONMENT\n\nM APPING TO D ATA\n\nC ONCLUSIONS\n\nA SSETS AND NOMINAL CONTRACTING\nThere are three nominally denominated assets: privately issued\ndebt, publicly issued debt and capital.\nWe think of these as representing U.S. data counterparts: (1)\nmortgage-backed securities, (2) federally issued debt and (3)\nphysical capital, respectively.\nIn the U.S. data, MBS net out, but federally issued debt and\nphysical capital are in positive net supply and we target a value\nof assets-to-GDP equal to 1.00 + 3.32 = 4.32.\nThe credit market friction is non-state contingent nominal\ncontracting (NSCNC): All debt contracts are stated in nominal\nterms, with a stated nominal interest rate, and repayment is not\nstate-contingent.\nThe role of monetary policy is to adjust the price level each\nperiod in order to convert these nominal, non-state contingent\ncontracts into real, state-contingent contracts in order to achieve\nthe first-best allocation of resources.\n12\n\n\fI NTRODUCTION\n\nE NVIRONMENT\n\nM APPING TO D ATA\n\nC ONCLUSIONS\n\nH OUSEHOLD TYPES\n\nThere are two household types: “life cycle” and\n“hand-to-mouth.”\nThe life-cycle households are assigned a hump-shaped\nproductivity profile at the beginning of their life cycle.\nAccordingly, they need to use credit markets (hold assets) to\nsmooth life-cycle consumption.\nThe hand-to-mouth households are assigned a perfectly flat\nproductivity

He spoke at the Asian Investment\nConference in an interview that was recorded March 22.\nBullard noted that the U.S. inflation data in October through February were hotter\nthan expected, and inflation rates are the highest in 40 years. The Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC) has adjusted a lot in the last six months, and more at\nlast week’s meeting, with the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections now\nsuggesting that the policy rate would rise substantially this year, he said.\nHe discussed his dissent at last week’s meeting, saying that he thought the FOMC\nshould start moving sooner and faster in terms of removing monetary policy\naccommodation. In particular, Bullard favored raising the policy rate by 50 basis\npoints (instead of the FOMC’s 25-basis-point increase) and getting going on Fed\nbalance sheet runoff. (See “President Bullard Explains His Recent FOMC Dissent”\nfor more details.)\n“We’re certainly moving in the right direction, but you have to move at a pace that\nmakes sense for the situation, and right now we’re putting upward pressure on\ninflation” while headline PCE inflation is running 400 basis points over target,\nBullard said. “So, I think we have to move faster to keep inflation under control,” he\nsaid, noting that he has in mind something like the 1994 reset of monetary policy,\nwhere the policy rate was increased 300 basis points in one year with good results\nfor the economy and inflation.\nBullard also discussed his main concern about the Russia-Ukraine war from an\neconomic point of view (whether Europe can stay out of recession in response to the\nshock), the robust labor markets in the U.S., and the importance in central banking\nof thinking about new ways to approach monetary policy and deal with unique\nsituations.\nHaving trouble with the video?

During an event hosted by the Energy Infrastructure\nCouncil in West Palm Beach, Fla., he also shared his views on recent monetary policy and further\nanticipated moves.\nOn the real economy, Bullard said that he is expecting above trend growth in the U.S. over the\nnext 18 months, although he acknowledged that there are risks to growth, such as what will\nhappen with the European and Chinese economies. He also noted that U.S. labor markets are\nstrong.\nCiting recent remarks by Fed Chair Jerome Powell, Bullard said that in�ation is the Federal Open\nMarket Committee’s No. 1 concern and that the FOMC is going to bring in�ation back down to\n2%, which means raising interest rates.\nBullard noted that the FOMC has raised the policy rate twice this year (by 25 basis points in\nMarch and by 50 basis points in May) and that further anticipated increases are already priced\ninto �nancial markets.\n“I think we have a good plan for now, and I think the base case is good,” he said, adding that Chair\nPowell has said it looks like the FOMC is on course for 50-basis-point increases at coming\nmeetings.\nBullard also discussed the FOMC’s plan for reducing the size of the Fed’s balance sheet, saying\nthat, all else equal, it should put upward pressure on the longer end of the yield curve. He said\nsome of that has already occurred, with the 10-year Treasury yield and 30-year mortgage rate up\nsubstantially, and he expects to see more upward pressure on longer-term yields going forward.\nWatch the discussion.\n\n\f",

The associated ex-post real interest rate was relatively high.\nThe subsequent experience was that core PCE inflation was below 5.2%\nfor the next 10 years.\nThe real economy also stabilized with no recession until 1990-91.\nThe contrast between the 1974 and 1983 experiences convinced many\nthat it was important to “get ahead” of inflation.\n8\n\n\fRisks to Inflation Expectations\n\n9\n\n\fInflation expectations\n• The current U.S. macroeconomic situation is straining the Fed’s\n•\n•\n\ncredibility with respect to its inflation target.\nIn economic theory, expected inflation and actual inflation should be\nclosely related.\nThe current divergence between actual inflation readings and TIPS-based\nexpected inflation will have to be resolved, possibly resulting in still\nhigher inflation expectations.\n\n10\n\n\fActual and expected inflation\n\nSources: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and Bureau of Economic Analysis. Last observations: March 2022 and April\n2022.\n11\n\n\fGetting Ahead of Inflation\n\n12\n\n\fCredibility and forward guidance\n• Modern central banks have considerably more credibility than they did\n•\n•\n•\n\nin the 1970s, much of it stemming from an explicit commitment to\ninflation targeting, and they also make more use of forward guidance.\nAs a result, indications of future policy rate increases are incorporated\ninto current financial market pricing before policy actions are taken.\nThis has been a key factor in current market pricing, as the 2-year\nTreasury yield and the 30-year mortgage rate have increased\nsubstantially.\nThe Fed still has to raise the policy rate sufficiently ex post to ratify the\nforward guidance previously given.\n13\n\n\fThe pre-pandemic benchmark\n• Before the pandemic, at the end of 2019, the U.S. economy was\n•\n•\n•\n•\n†\n‡\n\ngrowing at 2.6%, the headline PCE inflation rate was 1.5%, and the\nunemployment rate was 3.6%.†\nThe policy rate associated with these outcomes was 1.55%.‡\nPolicy was not expected to change much going forward as of the fourth\nquarter of 2019. Accordingly, the 2-year Treasury yield was 1.61%.‡\nLonger-term rates were moderate, with the 10-year Treasury yield at\n1.86% and the 30-year fixed rate mortgage at 3.96%.‡\nThis may provide a practical benchmark for where the constellation of\nrates may settle once inflation comes under control in the U.S.\n\nReal GDP growth and inflation are Q4-over-Q4 values. Unemployment is the December 2019 value.\nInterest rates are monthly averages of daily data for December 2019.\n14\n\n\fMarket pricing based on Fed credibility\n\nSources: Optimal Blue and Department of the Treasury. Last observation: May 24, 2022.\n15\n\n\fMarket rates above pre-pandemic benchmark\n• The fact that market interest rates have moved above their pre-pandemic\n•\n•\n\nbenchmarks while the policy rate has not can be read as an illustration of\nthe effect of credible forward guidance.\nThe Fed still has to follow through to ratify the forward guidance\npreviously given, but the effects on the economy and on inflation are\nalready taking hold.\nAs I have stressed, U.S. inflation is far above target, which means that\nmarket rates will have to move well above their pre-pandemic\nbenchmarks this year before converging back to lower levels in\nsubsequent years. But how far?\n16\n\n\fMinimal Taylor-type rule calculation\n• In a recent talk, I suggested a minimal Taylor-type rule calculation,\n•\n•\n•\n\nwhich recommended a policy rate of 3.63%.†\nThe calculation involved various judgments concerning the elements\nof a minimal Taylor-type rule.\nThe calculation gives an idea of where the FOMC may need to move\nthe policy rate to address the inflation problem now taking hold in the\nU.S.\nThe 2-year Treasury yield, which embodies forward guidance by the\nFed, has been trading around 2.6%, still somewhat short of the\nminimal level to bring inflation under control.\n\n†\n\nSee J. Bullard, “Is the Fed ‘Behind the Curve’?

Last observations: May 2022 and April 2022.\n4\n\n\fD ISINFLATION AHEAD\n\nRhetoric from the Fed and the ECB suggests disinflationary\nmonetary policy ahead.\nThe Fed is raising its policy rate sharply and allowing its balance\nsheet to decline, while the ECB looks set to pursue related\nactions.\nWith inflation near 1970s levels, will the Fed and the ECB be able\nto disinflate relatively easily and quickly, or will a substantial\nrecession occur as was the case of the Fed under Volcker?\nMany financial market observers and participants are arguing\nthat a substantial recession is likely.\n\n5\n\n\fI NCREDIBLE DISINFLATIONS\n\nThis talk reviews selected literature post-Volcker on credible\nversus incredible disinflations.\nThe Volcker disinflation was incredible: Initially, few believed\nthat the Fed was serious about reducing inflation after an entire\ndecade of allowing inflation to build.\nFor instance, see Lindsey, Orphanides and Rasche (StL Fed\nReview, 2005), Nelson (working paper, 2022), Goodfriend and\nKing (JME, 2005, “The Incredible Volcker Disinflation”), and\nSargent (Goodfriend conference volume, 2022, “Rational\nExpectations and Volcker’s Disinflation”).\n\n6\n\n\fC REDIBLE DISINFLATIONS\nThe post-Volcker literature turned to analyze credible\ndisinflations, inspired by Sargent (1982, “The Ends of Four Big\nInflations,” and 1981, “Stopping Moderate Inflations: The\nMethods of Poincaré and Thatcher”).\nAvailable in Sargent (2013), Rational Expectations and Inflation, 3rd\ned., Princeton University Press.\n\nThis literature explored the idea that credible disinflations do not\nhave large output costs.\nRather, because of rational expectations, they can be costless.\nThe apparent real-world “cost” only comes from having to “earn\ncredibility.”\n“If you have to cut off the tail of a dog, don’t do it one inch at a\ntime.”\n\n7\n\n\fL ESSON FOR THE COMING DISINFLATION\n\nThe current situation for the euro area and the U.S. seems to fall\nmore closely under the rubric of a “credible disinflation,” rather\nthan the “incredible disinflation” experienced by Volcker.\nSince modern central banks have more credibility than their\ncounterparts 50 years ago, it appears that both the Fed and the\nECB may be able to disinflate and achieve a relatively soft\nlanding.\n\n8\n\n\fPure Phillips Curve Disinflation\n\n9\n\n\fD ISINFLATION AND\n\nUNEMPLOYMENT\n\nLet’s suppose we begin with a pure Phillips curve analysis (not\nsomething I advocate).\nCurrent estimates for the U.S. point to an essentially flat Phillips\ncurve.\nFor instance, Stock and Watson (JMCB, 2020) report a slope of\n0.03 for both core and headline PCE inflation post-2000.\n\nStrictly speaking, using this mechanism alone would require\nunemployment to go to very high levels to get inflation to return\nto 2% in the U.S.\nWhile numbers could vary, this is the genesis of the idea that\nthere will have to be a large recession to get inflation under\ncontrol in the U.S.\nBut this is a mechanical calculation that says nothing about\ninflation expectations.\n\n10\n\n\fT HE ROLE OF EXPECTATIONS\nThe New Keynesian Phillips curve (NKPC) has two arguments,\nan output gap term as well as an inflation expectations term.\nThe NKPC has a coefficient near unity on the inflation\nexpectations component, which theoretically suggests that the\nrelationship between actual inflation and expected inflation\nshould be very close.\nThe following chart seems to confirm that this relationship holds\nin broad terms.\nThese considerations suggest that inflation expectations may\nplay a large role in the coming disinflation, as opposed to the\nsize of the output gap.\n\n11\n\n\fA CTUAL AND EXPECTED\n\nINFLATION\n\n6\n5-year breakeven inflation rate\nCore PCE inflation\n\n5\n4\n\nPercent\n\n3\n2\n1\n0\n-1\n-2\n2005\n\n2010\n\n2015\n\n2020\n\nSources: St. Louis Fed and BEA.

Their\nmodel attributes the cost of disinflation to the degree of\ncredibility.\n\n19\n\n\fDisinflation Today\n\n20\n\n\fT HE MONETARY- FISCAL MIX TODAY\nThe COVID-19 pandemic induced large deficit spending\ncombined with accommodative monetary policy, including\nlarge-scale asset purchases.\nThis could be thought of as akin to an intentional, temporary,\nhigh-inflation regime, as the monetary authority did not attempt\nto offset the inflationary impulse unleashed by the fiscal\nauthority.\nIn keeping with the spirit of Sargent (1981, 1982), what is now\nrequired is a regime switch back to the previous, pre-pandemic\nregime that featured inflation near target.\nIs such a switch occurring?\n\n21\n\n\fD ISINFLATION TODAY\nThe regime shift back to the pre-pandemic fiscal-monetary mix\ndoes appear to be taking shape in the U.S.\nFiscal situation in the U.S.: Additional large-scale deficit\nspending may be less likely due to the possibility of divided\ngovernment following the 2022 midterm elections.\nMonetary situation in the U.S.: The Fed is committed to an\ninflation target; it has taken actions to increase the policy rate\nand to begin quantitative tightening (QT).\nConsequently, medium- and longer-term inflation expectations\ncurrently tend to be lower than shorter-term inflation\nexpectations.\nA similar narrative for the euro area?\n\n22\n\n\fM EDIUM - AND LONG - TERM INFLATION EXPECTATIONS\nLOWER THAN SHORT- TERM EXPECTATIONS\n4\n\nPercent\n\n3\n\n1yr-1yr fwd.\n5yr-5yr fwd.\n1yr-1yr fwd.\n5yr-5yr fwd.\n\nU.S. CPI infl. swap\nU.S. CPI infl. swap\neuro area HICP infl. swap\neuro area HICP infl. swap\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\nJan 2020\n\nJan 2021\n\nJan 2022\n\nSource: Barclays.

He went on to say that the Fed’s interest rate\nincreases will slow down the economy, but probably to more of a trend pace of growth as\nopposed to going below trend.\nHe later reiterated that front-loading policy rate increases is a good idea in this situation.\n“What you would like to do, if we can, is nip in�ation in the bud before it gets entrenched in\nthe economy, get in�ation back down toward 2% and converge to our long-run balanced\ngrowth path from the high side,” he said. He noted that headline PCE in�ation is 6.3%,\nsimilar to the 1970s median rate of 6.4%.\nBusiness in�ation expectations have gone up substantially, Bullard said. He said he thinks\npricing decisions on the business side, rather than from the labor market, is where the\ndisin�ation dynamic will get started and will continue, as businesses start to worry about\nlosing market share if they increase prices.\nWatch the discussion.\n\n\f",

Bullard’s remarks were pre-recorded.\nFull text of remarks:\n\nPrepared and Pre-recorded Introductory Remarks\nJames Bullard\nPresident and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\n2022 Federal Reserve Community Development Research Seminar Series\nToward an Inclusive Recovery: Achieving an Equitable and Inclusive Wealth Recovery\nJune 29, 2022\n\nAny opinions expressed here are my own and do not necessarily re�ect those of the Federal\nOpen Market Committee.\nGood afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. My name is Jim Bullard, and\nI’m the president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. It’s my pleasure and\nhonor to welcome you today to our research seminar on an inclusive wealth recovery. We\nare most pleased to partner with our excellent colleagues at the Boston Fed and the Board of\nGovernors in bringing you today’s seminar, the �rst of three in the 2022 series.\nI regret not being with you in real time for today’s seminar, but I am eager to hear what was\nlearned and how the St. Louis Fed can continue and deepen its commitment to economic\n\n\fequity.\nWhen we say a wealth recovery, we mean: How can households recover the savings and\nassets they may have lost during the pandemic, and how can they pay down the debts they\nmay have accumulated? While what a family earns is, of course, critical, without some\nwealth they lack economic resilience as well as the ability to make investments in their\nfuture.\nYet today’s seminar isn’t just about an inclusive wealth recovery; it’s also about wealth\nequity. That is, our goal shouldn’t simply be to restore the large and enduring wealth gaps\nthat existed prior to the pandemic, but to narrow those gaps by reducing barriers and\nadding more incentives for disadvantaged groups to build wealth. To illustrate, the St. Louis\nFed’s most recent data show that, on average, white families owned over $1 million more in\nwealth than Black and Hispanic families—a gap that’s grown since the onset of the\npandemic.\nAnd it’s not just narrowing gaps that matters but also raising the level of wealth among,\nespecially, women, less educated, younger and non-white Americans. For instance, Fed data\nshow that the median Black family owns about $23,000 in wealth compared with the\nmedian white wealth of $184,000. I ask all of you to imagine what you could do with\n$184,000 in wealth compared to $23,000—what it means for your economic resilience and\nfor your ability to buy a home, start a business, send your kids to college without debt,\nprepare for a secure retirement, or pass on some wealth to the next generation. Remember:\nWealth begets wealth. The challenge is to have some in the �rst place—a real challenge\ngiven that the bottom half of the population owns just 1% of the nation’s wealth, down from\n3% a generation ago.\nClearly, we’re far from reaching gender, educational, racial and generational economic\nequity—but it’s imperative that we try. Doing so will reap bene�ts not just for our families\nbut for the broader economy as well.\nWe have a fabulous lineup today. Our �rst panel will establish a fact base of wealth trends\nsince the onset of the pandemic, while the second will focus on evidence-based solutions.\nWe’ll close out today with remarks from my St. Louis Fed colleague Bill Rodgers, who heads\nup our Institute for Economic Equity, and the Boston Fed’s Prabal Chakrabarti, CAO\n[community affairs of�cer] and executive vice president. We’re also eager to engage all of\nyou in today’s discussion.\nThanks again for joining us.\n\n\f",

Last observation: May 2022.\n6\n\n\fWhat the Fed Has Done So Far\n\n7\n\n\fThe FOMC’s moves so far\n• Beginning in the second half of 2021, the Fed began to move in a more\n•\n•\n•\n\nhawkish direction to take better control of inflation risks.\nWith respect to the policy rate: The FOMC has increased the rate’s level\nat the last three meetings and is poised to make further increases at\ncoming meetings.\nWith respect to the balance sheet: The FOMC has ceased asset\npurchases and has begun to allow passive runoff, known in markets as\nquantitative tightening, or QT.\nForeign central banks are simultaneously increasing their policy rates\nand allowing their balance sheets to shrink.\n8\n\n\fApproaching global quantitative tightening\n\nSources: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, European Central Bank, Bank of Japan and author’s\ncalculations. Last observation: June 2022.\n9\n\n\fThe Pre-Pandemic Benchmark\n\n10\n\n\fThe pre-pandemic benchmark\n• Before the pandemic, at the end of 2019:\no The U.S. economy was growing at 2.6%, the headline PCE inflation rate\n\nwas 1.5%, and the unemployment rate was 3.6%.†\no The policy rate associated with these outcomes was 1.55%.‡\no Policy was not expected to change much going forward. Accordingly, the\n\n2-year Treasury yield was 1.61%.‡\no Longer-term rates were moderate, with the 10-year Treasury yield at 1.86%\n\nand the 30-year fixed rate mortgage at 3.96%.‡\n\n• This may provide a practical benchmark for where the constellation of\nrates may settle once inflation comes under control in the U.S.\n†\n‡\n\nReal GDP growth and inflation are Q4-over-Q4 values.

Last observation: July 1, 2022.\n12\n\n\fMarket rates are above pre-pandemic benchmarks\n• The fact that market interest rates have moved above their pre-pandemic\n•\n\nbenchmarks while the policy rate has not can be read as an illustration of\nthe effect of credible forward guidance.\nThe Fed still has to follow through to ratify the forward guidance\npreviously given, but the effects on the economy and on inflation are\nalready taking hold.\n\n13\n\n\fLabor Markets Remain Robust\n\n14\n\n\fRobust labor markets\n• U.S. labor markets remain robust, according to recent data and anecdotal\n•\n•\n•\n\nreports.\nThe Kansas City Fed’s labor market conditions index, which aggregates\nvarious measures of labor market performance into a single metric,\nremains near highs last seen in 1999-2000.\nReal-time indicators of U.S. GDP growth suggest continued expansion\nin the quarters ahead.\nRisks remain substantial and stem from uncertainty around the RussiaUkraine war and the possibility of a sharp slowdown in China.\n\n15\n\n\fLabor market conditions: as good as in 1999-2000\n\nSource: Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.

Last observation: Week ending June 25, 2022.\n17\n\n\fBanks and Financial Stability\n\n18\n\n\fU.S. banks are strong and expected to remain so\n• The Fed’s 2022 stress tests concluded that the 33 largest U.S. banks\n\n•\n\ncould absorb significant losses in a “severely adverse” economic\nscenario and remain well-capitalized, able to continue lending to\nhouseholds and businesses.†\nRegional and community banks are also strong, according to a Fed\nreview of banking conditions.‡\n\n† See\n‡ See\n\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 2022 Federal Reserve Stress Test Results, June 2022.\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Supervision and Regulation Report, May 2022.\n19\n\n\fFinancial system vulnerabilities appear moderate\n• The Fed’s Financial Stability Report highlighted four areas of\npotential vulnerability:†\n1.\n\nAsset valuations: Moderate concern.\n\n2.\n\nLeverage in nonfinancial sectors: Low concern.\n\n3.\n\nLeverage in financial institutions: Low concern.\n\n4.\n\nFunding risks: Moderate concern.\n\n† Board\n\nof Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Financial Stability Report, May 2022.\n20\n\n\fNear-term risks to financial stability\n• In early 2022, New York Fed staff surveyed a broad range of contacts,\nwho expressed particular concern about these near-term risks to\nfinancial stability:†\no Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine.\no Elevated and persistent inflation.\no The possibility that stresses in China, including in the real estate sector,\n\ncould spill over to the U.S.\no The possibility that inflationary pressures and adverse external shocks could\n\nlead to stresses in other emerging market economies (EMEs) that could\naffect the U.S.\n† See\n\nSection 5 of Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Financial Stability Report, May 2022.\n21\n\n\fConclusion\n\n22\n\n\fConclusion\n• Inflation in the U.S. is far above target and is at levels last seen in the\n•\n•\n•\n\n1970s and early 1980s.\nThe Fed has raised the policy rate, promised to raise the policy rate\nfurther in the future, and begun passive balance sheet reduction.\nFed credibility along with forward guidance on these dimensions is\nhelping the Fed move policy more quickly to the degree necessary to\nkeep inflation under control.\nThe Fed recently reported stress test results indicating that the largest\nbanking institutions in the U.S. remain on solid financial footing.\n\n23\n\n\fConnect With Us\nVisit stlouisfed.org\nBrowse publications featuring\nexpert research and analysis\nDiscover free economic education\nresources for all learners\nFind community development tools\nthat support an economy for all\nExplore the Economy Museum online\nand see how to visit in person\n\nFollow @stlouisfed\non Twitter, Instagram,\nLinkedIn and more\nKeep up with\nPresident Jim Bullard’s\nlatest remarks\n\nGet timely economic\ndata from FRED®\n24\n\n\f",

Looking at the “hot” inflation report, he said that his\nreaction is that instead of trying to achieve a Fed policy rate of 3.5% by the year’s end,\nwhich has been his baseline for several months, “I would now say that we may have to try\nto hit 3.75 to 4% by the end of 2022.”\nInflation is staying “stubbornly high,” Bullard said later.\n“But we've got the right policy to bring it back to 2% in a relatively short timeframe, and I\nwould say something like 18 months,” he said.\n\n\f",

He\nspoke before the Money Marketeers of New York University.\nCurrent in�ation in the U.S. and the euro area (EA) is near 1970s levels, Bullard said. The\ndisin�ation under former Fed Chair Paul Volcker was costly, he added, but it was not\ncredible initially—Volcker had to earn credibility.\nNobel laureate and economist Thomas Sargent initiated a literature on costless disin�ation\n(“soft landings”) that emphasized in�ation expectations as the key variable, not the Phillips\ncurve, Bullard noted. Subsequent literature illustrated how credibility might be earned in\nmodels that depart from rational expectations, he said.\n“The Fed and the ECB [European Central Bank] have considerable credibility compared\nwith their 1970s counterparts, suggesting that a soft landing is feasible in the U.S. and the\nEA if the post-pandemic regime shift is executed well,” Bullard concluded.\n\n\f",

He spoke while participating virtually at a forum hosted by Barclays and the\nCentre for Economic Policy Research in London.\n“No matter how you look at it, we have a serious in�ation problem in the U.S., and we’re missing our\n(2%) in�ation target and the credibility of our in�ation targeting regime is at risk,” Bullard said. He\nadded that this level of in�ation hasn’t been experienced since the late 1970s and early 1980s, when\nPaul Volcker was chairman of the Fed.\nBullard said he recently recalculated the minimal level of the policy rate that could be argued was\nrestrictive monetary policy, and that rate was close to 4.5%, higher than he had calculated in May. He\nalso pointed out that at its last meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee moved up its projections\nof the needed policy rate level to more in the 4% range.\nGiven the level of in�ation, the policy rate will need to be high compared with rates over the last 15\nyears, Bullard said. “In addition, I think we’ll have to stay at that higher rate for some time to make\nsure that we’ve got the in�ation problem under control,” he said.\nBullard also noted that tighter monetary policy was in place sooner through market pricing than would\nbe apparent if one just looked at the policy rate itself and did not consider other aspects, including\nquantitative tightening. “This market pricing leading the Fed is a bene�t of the modern era of forward\nguidance and transparency and has helped us enormously, I think, so far during this episode,” Bullard\nsaid.\nSo strict comparisons with Volcker are inappropriate at this point, he added.\nModern central banks including the Fed have an explicit in�ation target of 2%, which is an\ninternational standard, Bullard said. That wasn’t the case in Volcker’s time, he noted. “So I think we've\ngot a better chance of success with less disruption to the economy than Volcker would have had,”\nBullard said.\nView video from the Barclays-CEPR International Monetary Policy Forum.\n\n\f",

Held in-person and\nvirtually this year, the conference is sponsored by the Federal Reserve System, the Conference of State\nBank Supervisors (CSBS) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.\nBullard discussed some of the challenges and opportunities that community banks have faced since\nthe event’s inception. He recognized several conference features added in the past decade, while\nacknowledging the passing earlier this year of John Ryan, CSBS president and CEO and a founder of\nthe conference. Bullard also introduced a pre-recorded special video conference message delivered by\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.\n\nPrepared Introductory Remarks\nJames Bullard\nPresident and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nCommunity Banking Research Conference (Hybrid)\nFederal Reserve System, Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS) and Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corp. (FDIC)\nSept. 28, 2022\n\nAny opinions expressed here are my own and do not necessarily re�ect those of the Federal Open\nMarket Committee.\nGood morning and welcome to St. Louis for the 2022 Community Banking Research Conference. I’m\npleased to welcome you back into our building after presenting the conference virtually for the past\ntwo years. The pandemic gave us an opportunity to learn how to operate in a virtual environment and\nensure that all our participants can be fully engaged in these proceedings—whether you’re here in\nperson or joining us on Zoom.\nOn behalf of the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and\n\n\fthe Federal Reserve System, I welcome you all.\nThis year’s conference is particularly special, as it marks the 10th year of these proceedings. It began\nsomewhat humbly, but with ambition. The goal of the conference, as outlined then by Governor\nJerome Powell, now chair of the Board of Governors, was to “inform discussions among policymakers,\nto collect unique and innovative practices of successful community banks and to serve as a reference\npoint for future research conferences.”\nI think this conference has achieved that goal.\nIn my remarks at the 2014 conference, I noted a signi�cant increase in the number of paper\nsubmissions relative to the inaugural year and predicted continued expansion. While I am reluctant to\nmake predictions—as St. Louis native Yogi Berra once said, “It’s tough to make predictions, especially\nabout the future”—on this one I was right. We’ve seen a steady increase in submissions each year of\nthe conference.\nThe conference grew in other ways as well.\nThe organizers added several other important features over the past decade. To name a few:\n• Community bankers were added to each of the research panels to provide a practitioner’s\nperspective on the research presented.\n• An Emerging Scholars program was created to support Ph.D. students interested in community\nbanking-related topics.\n• CSBS developed an undergraduate case study competition to motivate interest in banking and\nbanking research among students.\n• Expert panels were assembled to address highly topical issues and offer ideas for future\nresearch—and starting last year, the FDIC started rebroadcasting these conference discussions\nthrough its popular “FDIC Podcast.”\nAdditionally, in the second year of the conference, CSBS developed a National Survey of Community\nBanks. The survey is administered by the state banking commissioners and has given us current\ninformation on the state of community banking.\nMiki Bowman, who is here with us today and is a longtime supporter of the conference, previously as\nKansas state bank commissioner and now as a member of the Board of Governors, described the\nsurvey as “a window into what community bankers are experiencing.” I agree. It serves as a backdrop\nfor the research presented and is valuable in its own right—�ndings have been cited over the years in\npolicy discussions conducted by, among others, the U.S. Government Accountability Of�ce and the\nEconomic Report of the President.\nThe challenges and opportunities faced by community bankers have also changed over the 10 years of\nthe conference. Initially, bankers were concerned about lingering impacts of the �nancial crisis and\nnew regulations responding to it under the Dodd-Frank Act. Later came the COVID crisis, which\ncommunity banks confronted as prominent providers of lifelines to small businesses through the\nPaycheck Protection Program. And now, banks face high in�ation and an uncertain economic outlook.\n\n\fBut other challenges and opportunities have persisted. The community banking industry continues to\nconsolidate. Bankers are �nding that regulatory costs, particularly those incurred by smaller banks,\nremain burdensome. Bankers face now, as they did a decade ago, technological advances and\ncompetition from nonbank providers of �nancial services.\nAt the inaugural conference in 2013, John Ryan called for “robust, honest, disciplined research and a\nwillingness to challenge our assumptions.” John was president and CEO of the Conference of State\nBank Supervisors until his untimely passing earlier this year. I believe this conference has met his\nchallenge, and I think he would be pleased with the agenda again this year.\nThroughout this year’s proceedings, we will hear from leaders in community banking, banking\nsupervision and academic research and from the conference sponsors, who will share their views on\nthe importance and signi�cance of this year’s event. Before we play a special conference message sent\nto us by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, I’d like to offer my own congratulations, to the\nconference organizers, to everyone on this year’s program and to all of you—here in St. Louis and\nvirtually—for sustaining this important conference for the past decade.\nI look forward to seeing what the next decade will bring.\n\n\f",

He made the comments during a virtual discussion at an HSBC\nGlobal Emerging Markets Forum.\nBullard said the U.S. in�ation rate was way above the Federal Open Market Committee’s 2%\ntarget, which is why the FOMC has moved aggressively to raise its policy rate. He also\npointed to forecasts made by FOMC members in September’s Summary of Economic\nProjections that suggest additional moves in the policy rate this year.\n“We’re hopeful that by acting sooner and with transparency and with clear communication\nthat we’ll be able to get in�ation down now, as opposed to the 1970s where in�ation at these\nlevels lingered for 15 years or so,” he said.\nMarkets and policymakers are coming around to the view that in�ation will take a while to\ngo back to 2%, Bullard said, adding that in�ation probably won’t fall in a straight line. These\nfactors seem to indicate higher policy rates for longer than markets might have thought\neven a year ago, he said. Since labor markets remain strong, this is a good time to try to get\nin�ation under control, he noted.\nBullard was asked whether the Fed’s 2% in�ation target should be adjusted higher. The\nnotion of changing the target when the Fed is challenged by high in�ation sounds like a\nreplay of the 1970s, he said, adding that “this is just a totally bad idea.”\n“I know people are talking about that, but we'll maintain credibility of the in�ation target,\nwe will push in�ation to 2%, and we'll do it in a reasonably compact time frame,” he said.\nBullard noted the steady reduction in the Fed’s balance sheet, which started in the second\nquarter, is hitting full stride in September. He said his preference is to wait and see on the\nbalance sheet runoff to determine how things were developing.\n\n\fBullard emphasized that other central banks around the world are reducing their balance\nsheets as well and that he’ll be keeping an eye on how this global quantitative tightening\naffects global �nancial conditions.\nIn addition, Bullard said he believes that the rise in interest rates alone isn’t enough to\ncause a recession in the U.S., and that a recession instead would be caused by a shock. “I\nthink we're at higher recession risk, but I don't think that's the base case at this point,” he\nsaid.\n\n\f",

            "content": "Unofficial Transcript:\nSt. Louis Fed President and CEO James Bullard’s Remarks at Citi Macro Forum\nOct. 14, 2022\n\nyou.\n\nModerator: Thank you again. Much look forward to your introductory remarks, and over to\n\nJames Bullard: Okay. Thanks very much. It's a pleasure to be here today and great to see a lot\nof you in person again. So, let me just start out with some kind of level-setting comments about how I'm\nseeing the economy generally, the U.S. situation. Then I'll get to the global situation. Then I'll stop, and\nwe'll go with questions from there.\nSo, I think, first of all, if you're looking at the U.S. situation, as you guys have been all day, the\ntop issue is inflation, and I think it's just the, I think, markets and policymakers have been recognizing all\nthrough 2022 that the inflation problem is very serious in the U.S. and requires very forthright\naddressing by the central bank. And we are doing that. And I think we've made very good moves during\n2022 here to try to get to a place where we can mitigate inflation risk, push inflation back down to 2%.\nAnd the sooner we can get this job done, the better off we'll be both for the U.S. economy and for the\nglobal economy.\nSo, that has argued for frontloading effects. If you look at an impulse response function and\noptimal monetary policy, and you got some big shock like this, it would tell you, raise your policy\ninstrument quickly. And then the inflation will dissipate in the future, and you'll be able to get back to\nnormal. So, that's very much been in my mind about where we are with policy and what we're trying to\ndo.\nLet me talk about the inflation numbers a little bit. The news has been unremittingly bad, I\nwould say, even since spring. A lot of you and a lot of the policy community was predicting even in the\nfall of 2021 that inflation would be back to 2% by the spring of 2022. By the time we got into the spring\nof 2022, we were saying that inflation would be back to maybe not 2% but much lower by the end of\n2022. That's not happening. So, this has all gone in the wrong direction here. And I think it really\nvindicates our strategy that we really needed the risk management. We needed to prepare for this case.\nSo, I'm glad that we have. And we're in a much better position today to get inflation under better\ncontrol in 2023. And I am hopeful now that we're in good position to do that.\nThe story that inflation was due to lumber prices and that inflation was due to this special factor\nand that special factor has been blown out of the water. It's not. It's broad-based. Ideas that it was just\ndue to a supply shock of this type or that type has been blown out of the water. This is a serious inflation\nproblem, and it requires action by the central bank. That's what we're doing.\nNow, I actually think that we've benefitted dramatically here from transparency and forward\nguidance, which didn't exist the last time we had inflation this high in the United States in the Volcker\n1\n\n\fera. Volcker was very secretive. He moved behind the scenes. He surprised markets. He had to earn\ncredibility. He didn't have any credibility at all when he started because the United States had dithered\nall the way through the 1970s. But here, it's a different era, and I think once we got the FOMC on board\nto fight back against inflation, then we had a lot of forward guidance. Markets have moved ahead of the\nFed. I think that has helped us tremendously. And it's helped us move policy in the right direction and\nstart to get some mitigating pressure onto inflation even before we actually made any major moves. So,\nit was almost like we barely had to lift our pinky finger. And a lot of things had already happened in\nfinancial markets.\nSo, I think that's a benefit of transparency, and that's a benefit of forward guidance. But forward\nguidance also means that you have to follow through on the promises that you make earlier because if\nyou don't follow through then, you lose some credibility and the forward guidance isn't as effective in\nthe future. And I would give some credit to our former chair Ben Bernanke, who got a Nobel Prize just\nrecently, because Bernanke was the one that was all about really opening up the Fed, providing\ntransparency, and that providing forward guidance would be helpful in trying to do a difficult job.\nSo, I think that is helping us here. Now, we haven't followed through all the way. We're only at 3\nto 3¼% on the policy rate; that's too low for the current environment, so we've got a ways to go. But the\nmarket pricing is definitely anticipating more moves on our part. And I'll come back to that in a minute.\nOn the other part of our mandate, which is labor markets, these are some of the best labor\nmarkets the U.S. has seen since the late 1990s. Unemployment rate at 3.5% is hard to match in U.S.\nmacroeconomic history. Unemployment insurance claims, if you throw out the hurricane here, had been\ntracking below 2017, 2018, 2019 levels for this time of year. If you look at quits, still very high. Number\nof openings per unemployed worker, still at 1.7 times. I've had a hard time seeing, and maybe you guys\ncan convince me, but I've had a hard time seeing why unemployment would go up meaningfully in an\nenvironment where you had that many job openings. Even if your company goes out of business\ntomorrow, it seems like you'd have a lot of opportunity to go get another job, and certainly at the lower\nlevels of the income distribution, this seems to be true.\nSo, instead of having unemployment tick up further, it actually ticked down in the last report.\nWe're still creating jobs fast, much faster than the trend rate that you would expect, which is some\npeople would put at 100k per month or even 75k per month depending on who you talk to. We're still\nway above 200 in the last report. So, even though job growth has slowed, you still have a very, very\nstrong jobs market here.\nSo, I think, and the last comment on this would be if you want to take the indicators of labor\nmarket performance in totality, you can look at the Kansas City Fed's Labor Market Conditions Index.\nThat index is as high as it was in the late 1990s, often considered the best labor market in the whole\npostwar era of the U.S.\nSo, the argument is that, at least for now, labor markets are very, very strong in the U.S. And so,\nthis is giving us a lot of leeway and means that it's the right time to get this inflation problem under\ncontrol. There will be moments in the future where conditions aren't as ideal as they are today to try to\ncontrol an inflation problem. But right now, on our labor market mandate, we're doing very, very well.\nAnd so, I think this is the moment to try to crush inflation in 2023. And hopefully we'll put this episode\nbehind us here.\nLet's see, let me talk about GDP a little bit. So, GDP is negative in the U.S. in the first—GDP\ngrowth was negative in the first half of the year. I find this number not credible. The U.S. economy\n2\n\n\fadded 3.2 million jobs in the first half of the year. I think that will get revised but probably not out until\nthe benchmark revision years from now, so we won't be the beneficiaries of that revision. But I would\nbe willing to say that, okay, well, it was pretty slow growth in the first half of 2022. Some of that, I think,\nis because the transmission of monetary policy is more immediate than it might've been during the '50s\nand '60s and '70s when Friedman talked about long and variable lags.\nAnd so, now you're in a situation where the first half was slow or zero. Maybe the second half\nwill be somewhat faster than that. And then maybe 2023 will be somewhat faster than that, so I actually\nthink because now you'd be returning to trend, the trend pace of growth in the U.S. economy. So, we'll\nsee if that's what happens. I know you guys have other forecasts, recession forecasts. But I would never\nput a recession as a baseline because a recession is a special event that is usually caused by a heavy\nshock. And that's not predictable, so that wouldn't fit into most forecasting frameworks.\nI would say we're at higher risk of [recession] right now as we're trying to carry out this\ndisinflationary policy. And so, we are at risk. But still, something else would have to happen in the next\nlet's say 12 months to knock us off the baseline path and into the [recession] scenario. That could\nhappen. And probably these are higher than they would otherwise be. But it's not my base case if all\ngoes well.\nAnd, again, part of this is the strong labor market. Part of it is also households seem to still have\na lot of cushion of money saved up during the pandemic. The level of wealth to disposable income is still\nvery high despite the equity sell-off this year because house prices are way up and equities on the whole\nare way up over time here, even though they're down this year. So, I think those factors will keep\nconsumption relatively good and keep us in pretty good position here.\nIf you want to talk about recession, I think it's a better story to talk about a global recession or a\nglobal slow-growth scenario, which I think is very plausible. There, you have Europe to talk about with\nthe first major land war since World War II occupying a lot of the mind share. And you have China with\nits inexplicable COVID policy shutting down big parts of the Chinese economy or certainly slowing down\nbig parts of the Chinese economy. China has been a major contributor or maybe the major contributor\nto global growth, so if they're going to be a slower-growing economy, then it makes sense to just say,\nwell, the whole world is going to grow more slowly. And that will come back to hurt the U.S. So, I think\nit's a factor. But again, my base case for the U.S. would not be a recession at this point. Maybe I'll stop\nthere and see if this has jogged anybody's memory, because I think we'll have many questions to—\nModerator: We will have—I will have used them up [overlapping] to ask the first one. … Can I\nask you, you mentioned maybe shorter transmissions lags, then, in the past. But given the pace of hiking\nthe Fed that's carried out so far this year, how do you think about the tightening effects still to come and\nkind of the landing zone for policy to arrive at in this kind of environment? How restrictive are we\nalready? And how much more restrictive do we need to get?\nJames Bullard: When Friedman talked about long and variable lags, he was talking about money\ngrowth and the economy. So, first of all, it's a little bit different object. There was a later literature that\ntalked, did monetary policy in terms of the federal funds rate; that literature did seem to get these\nhump-shaped impulse responses maybe six months after a monetary policy surprise. In the models,\nthose are surprises. So, the question is, when are you going to date that surprise? Are you going to put it\nright here at the November meeting, where we're scheduled to do 75 basis points? Or are you going to\nsay, \"No, no. The surprise was really when Jay, at the hearing last year at this time, said, \"I think we can\nthrow away the term 'transitory,'\" because I think that was more or less the start of the wheels in\nmotion.\n3\n\n\fAnd a lot happened, I would say, also during the first quarter of 2022. I gave an interview to\nBloomberg one day, and I started talking about what Greenspan would do. And this was extremely,\ncame off extremely hawkish, that day anyway. But I think it was because both policymakers and the\nprivate sector had just not kind of internalized what was going to need to happen here and how much\ninflation was moving way beyond what we had forecast.\nSo, if that's when you think the shock was and you believe the literature, then the major effects\nwould only be six months after that, which would be right in the third quarter of 2022. So, I think we\nhave to be careful about exactly what we're saying about long and variable lags. So, a lot of people say,\n\"Well, the major effects won't occur now until late 2023 or the first half of 2024. We'll all have forgotten\nall this by the time we get to that point.\nSo, I do think there's a case to be made, that the transition, that the financial markets are very\ndifferent than they were in the '70s, that transmission is much faster and occurs much more through\nfinancial markets than it would have. Firms react really, certainly on a weekly or a monthly basis, even\non a daily basis. I think they're far more agile than they would've been in that era.\nAnd so, I think the case that you're talking 12 to 18 months for people to get used to 100 basis\npoints higher on the policy rate is a tough case to make these days. And also, this literature has had a\ntough time because it's hard to carry out the same kind of analysis during the period of the zero lower\nbound. And that was a very long period, and it took up the whole decade. So, where exactly are we with\nthe empirical evidence on long and variable lags? I don't know, but I think there's a case to be made that\nthey're much shorter than they used to be and that we're getting a lot of the impacts probably now in\n2022. And it certainly shows up as GDP, looks like a zero-growth year on the whole if you take the data\nliterally. And so, there's a case to be made, and I think that it's having the impact now.\nInflation would be more persistent and especially something like Dallas Fed Trimmed Mean or\ncore PCE inflation would be slower-moving, more persistent, takes longer to come down. But I think it\nhas peaked. Or I wouldn't say \"peaked,\" but stopped increasing. And then, hopefully we'll get this\ndisinflationary process going during 2023. And that'll be a great dynamic, I think, if we can get that going\nand get this disinflationary process going very soon. The data isn't really cooperating, but hopefully it\nwill cooperate very soon.\nModerator: Thank you.\nAudience: Thank you, Jim. First, congratulations on having championing the front-loading of the\nhiking cycle argument, which I think it was the right thing to do. On the two questions, one, you\nmentioned that you don't see a recession in your baseline, but also you mentioned that you were always\ntold crash inflation. So, how do the two go together? I mean, I understand for official sector, it's hard to\nput in forecast the recession. But don't you need to see a higher end on the rate, sufficiently higher to\nput inflation down.\nAnd the second question is more about the policy half. From your own perspective, what do you\nneed to see to slow the pace of the hiking cycle and then eventually to pause?\nJames Bullard: On the unemployment, the SEP does have unemployment rising into the mid 4%\nrange. However, my interpretation of that would be that that would be a return to mean. 3.5% is surely\nnot the most common unemployment rate we've observed in the U.S. over time, and it wouldn't be\nunusual for the employment rate to go up from here. You don't have to get a Nobel Prize to say, \"Well,\nprobably unemployment won't go down from here, it'll probably go up from here.\"\n4\n\n\fBut even if we're in the mid-4% range, that would still be a strong labor market. So, I think that's\na sense in which we have a lot of room to maneuver here on the inflation side and get inflation down.\nAnd we'll all be happier if we can do this during 2023. Now, as far as how the disinflationary process\nwork, I've been mystified at the discussion around this, that it emphasizes labor markets so much\nbecause we just spent a decade saying that the Phillips curve is extremely flat. And so, therefore, you\nwouldn't get much disinflationary pressure coming from that channel, at least according to the flat\nPhillips curves. And even the ones that aren't quite as flat, there isn't very much there as far the\ncorrelation between labor market action and inflation, at least price inflation.\nSo, I think the way the disinflationary process is going to work is very different. It's going to\ncome through product markets instead and the price-setters in the economy. And my interpretation of\nthe 1980s disinflation is that firms had the fear of God in them that if they raised prices too rapidly, they\nwould lose market share. And if that happens, market share leaves permanently; and the company\neither loses business permanently or just goes out of business altogether.\nSo, when you think of the Walmart phenomenon in the '80s, especially where they really grew\nrapidly, they were the low-cost provider, they hustled, they were more productive, they were better at\nlogistics, and they put all these other guys out of business; the other guys just wanted to raise prices. So,\nI think that's what will happen this time. But we need to see that dynamic get started.\nModerator: [unintelligible]. And, please, one—\nJames Bullard: You had something else, though.\nAudience: Yes. On the path for policy from here on, will you need to go slow and then\neventually pause?\nJames Bullard: I have a good answer. At the Stanford Conference in May—called something like\n\"Why is the Fed Behind the Curve?\" which shows you the mentality of the conference—I gave a\ncalculation about if you used the Taylor Rule and you made all the most generous assumptions that you\ncould possibly make—generous to us, the central bank—what would be the minimal level of the policy\nrate you'd have to be at, given the inflation situation in the U.S.?\nAnd if you want to go check it out, it's on my webpage. The answer was 3.5%. And that's what I\nstarted saying during the spring of 2022. However, there's been bad news since then on inflation. And\nthat number has moved up to 4.5 or maybe 4.75. But this gives you some idea that that calculation says,\nwell, suppose you take the real short-term global interest rate. The most generous assumption you\ncould make is maybe minus half a percent on that, and you take the inflation gap, the most generous\nthing that you can say is, \"I'll take Dallas Fed Trimmed Mean minus 2%.\" That'd give you kind of the\nsmallest inflation gap that the central bank would have to actually act upon and be active in reducing.\nYou put a coefficient on the inflation gap of 1.25, which is smaller than most people would use,\nyou still get something in the 4% range now for what the central bank has to do. So, I think this is a way\nto think about it, about why we need to be up where we were talking about going at a minimum. And\nthen from there, you'd have to assess the data and see how the data comes in or whether it's reacting\nor whatever.\nSo, I don't think we're really in danger of doing too little based on that kind of calculation. I'm\nsorry, we're not in danger of doing too much based on that kind of calculation. We're sort of at risk of\n5\n\n\fnot getting up to this minimum level. But the committee has really got religion here. And so, we're\nmoving very quickly.\nI've been pleased that we've been able to do the 75-basis-point moves. That's just helped\ntremendously, I think. And we've really been able to do that. I know there's a lot of repricing. You've got\ntens of trillions of dollars of assets. And they all change prices because of this. But I think we've\nmanaged to do this in a transparent enough way that we've been able to get through most of 2022,\nhere, without undue international turmoil. And on that issue, I would say this: The St. Louis Fed has a\nFinancial Stress Index. It does a good job of tracking financial stress. It was very high in 2008. It was very\nhigh again, almost the same level, in March and April of 2020. Today, it's far below average. So, it just\ndoesn't look like either of those moments right now as far as financial stress. So, I'll stop.\nModerator: Thank you. Gentlemen, one question.\n[Audience question unintelligible]\nJames Bullard: Well, I hope we're not replaying Volcker, even though we're talking about\nVolcker a lot. So, I think Volcker did not have credibility when he started. So, this is the biggest factor\nthat has to be considered here. And when I say it didn't have credibility, there was no such thing as\ninflation targets. There was no such thing really even as agreement that central banks were responsible\nfor inflation.\nI've often told the story that when I went into my undergraduate institution, there was a big\nposter on the wall, really big poster, and it said, \"What causes inflation?\" in the middle. And then, there\nwere all these theories in little bubbles around the side. But central banks weren't there; it was unions,\nor it was deficits, or all these other things. So, you didn't have the intellectual agreement that you have\ntoday. And you didn't have the inflation target that you have today. And you didn't have the experience\nthat you have today of 25 years of actually having low inflation.\nSo, all those things are helping us tremendously today compared to Volcker. Volcker was in a\nsense, hacking through a jungle at that time that we don't have to hack through. So, when we're raising\nrates today, everyone says, people say a lot of things, and there's a lot of things going on, but they say,\n\"Oh yeah, they've got to do that because you've got to get inflation down.\" And it would be better if we\ngot inflation down.\nSo, I think there's more, far more acceptance of what we're doing. And I think that gives us a\nmuch better shot at a soft landing than Volcker had. One of the things that happened with Volcker, if\nyou read about the era, is that he increased the discount rate early in his term. And it was 50 basis\npoints, as I recall. And nothing happened. No one in markets paid any attention at all. Nothing\nhappened. So, it's like he didn't exist.\nSo, it was after that that he said, \"We're going to have to switch to the monetarist experiment.\"\nAnd he had the Saturday night meeting where they dropped interest rate targeting and started doing\nreserves targeting. But this shows you how much they had to do and how much they had to shake up.\nHe was looking for something that would shake up the system and allow interest rates to go much\nhigher.\nAnd so, it's just a much different situation. Here, Powell barely says anything. He says, \"I think\nwe have to retire the word 'transitory.'\" That's enough to make a lot of movement. So, I think it's\n6\n\n\fdifferent from that perspective. And I think that's giving us a much bigger chance of success than Volcker\nhad. He was the one that had to earn all this credibility. But we have it, and we can use it.\nAudience: Simple question, but maybe not so easy. The interest rate transmission channel that\nyou envisage in your mind when you think about raising rates so much, which one is it? Because if it’s\nnot so much leverage anymore and U.S. economy is quite healthy that way, are you trying to eliminate\nall the savings or cause so much fear that consumers will just keep their savings? And where's the\ntransmission channel [unintelligible]?\nJames Bullard: So, I think one way to think about the, well, it's mostly inflation expectations, so\none way to think about why we ended up with so much inflation is to think about a war scenario: World\nWar I, World War II, and the pandemic is kind of World War III. And we know by looking at historical\nexperience across many times and places that wars are associated with inflation, both for the winning\nside and the losing side. And why is that?\nWell, what happens during the war is that there's a social crisis. There's a lot of government\nborrowing without too many questions about how you're going to pay for this in the future because\nyou're in the middle of a crisis. The central bank is requested to help with the war effort and keep\ninflation or keep interest rate very low. This is a recipe for inflation. And so, what was the pandemic? It\nwas exactly that, both in the U.S. and around the world. And no, it wasn't like a world war, but kind of\nwas, against the virus.\nAnd so, you got lots of government borrowing with low interest rates accompanying that\nborrowing. And so, too much, and this led to some inflation overhang after we're all done. Now, how do\nyou get rid of that inflation? Well, you switch back to the pre-pandemic policy or the pre-war policy,\nwhich is you don’t borrow so much on the fiscal side without the future taxes there, and you get the\nmonetary policy guys to get on the ball and start moving the policy rate to the appropriate level for that\nsituation.\nI think both those things are happening in the U.S. Cook Political Report tells me there'll be\ndivided government in the U.S. very soon. That doesn't sound like very much fiscal actions coming from\nthat angle. And the central bank is absolutely convincing; I think, that we're intent on moving the policy\nrate to the right level to get inflation under control. So, what is this going to do?\nThis means that inflation expectations are staying low, and TIPS-based inflation expectations are\nlooking pretty good. I suppose they're up after the inflation report here. But basically, they're in the two\nrange as opposed to being in the five range, where they could be if our policy wasn't so credible. So,\nthat's looking pretty good. And it looks like we're making progress on expeditiously moving to a\nreasonable level of the policy rate. Hopefully, we'll get there very soon. So, I think we have every chance\nof success here. But, man, you're in the middle of the war. You don't know what's going to come around\nthe corner here.\nAudience: I think there's a question back there. Yes.\nAudience: A question around rental inflation. So, my impression is rent inflation makes\n[unintelligible] part of the core inflation that he's looking at. And it's driven by historically lower\nvacancies, and at hikes, probably exacerbated by [unintelligible] on it, slowing down. The housing\nconstruction, I guess they're saying that's what happened. So, in the short term, rents will probably keep\ngoing up. Is there something you [unintelligible]. Or are you willing to go through with the rent inflation?\n7\n\n\fJames Bullard: Yeah. Rent inflation is very serious in the U.S. It has been very hot. There are a\ncouple of things happening. One is that the increase in the policy rate has driven up mortgage interest\nrates very quickly. And house prices in the U.S. did not decline during the pandemic, but instead\nboomed during the pandemic. So, what has happened is the affordability for a median house by a\nmedian family has declined dramatically. And I think a lot of this is sticker shock. Somebody that was in\nthe market to build a house or buy a house now realizes that they can only afford a limited amount of\nsquare footage compared to what they could previously get.\nSo, that's all doable. They could adjust their expectations about that. But it's hard to do that in a\nshort time period. Those people are dropping out of the market and are going to rentals. And that's\nputting extra pressure on the rental market compared to what it otherwise would've been. Overall,\nthere hasn't been that much housing supply either. And so, a lot of people think that total housing\nsupply in the U.S. is too low. It takes a long time to fix that.\nSo, I do think that the rental inflation is going to be persistent as one of the components that\nsuggests that inflation is not being driven just by special factors. It's widespread and going to be\npersistent. And that's why we're going to have to be higher for longer in order to help get inflation\ndown.\nModerator: Just to follow up on that quickly, isn't that also suggesting that you will see the\neffects of your current policy on rental inflation, just much later?\nJames Bullard: Yes. But we're aware of this. So, a lot of people are saying, \"Well, you're going to\nbe too slow because it's going to be a whole year before this goes away,\" even though new rentals are\nactually tailing off or coming down. But we'll take all of that into account.\nAudience: First of all, thank you again for your prescient comments you've made over the past\nmonths. My question is really about the intersection between how you're thinking of the new steady\nstate now that we have some of the shock, and I call it the shock, sort of coming out of the numbers;\nhow are you thinking about NAIRU or a neutral level of rates? Your records saying, for instance, that the\nparticipation, you reckon, was structurally lower early on, which is something that we're seeing\ncontinuously.\nAnd as a result of that, from a cyclical perspective, I'm not sure I understand, and it follows the\nprevious question, how come you have such a low sacrifice ratio to get inflation down? I mean, the way I\nkind of square the SEP is thinking that, as a committee, you have a pretty bullish view on the supply side\nof the economy and you mentioned the goods market.\nBut how do we know that? I mean, there is it's a very holistic structure here in the U.S. And can\nyou really rely so much on supply doing some of the job for you? So, I think it ultimately goes back to the\nproblem of credibility. I think a lot of us are trying to understand that, in fact, when push comes to\nshove, we'll be prepared to go for a recession, because now you face no dilemma, as you said yourself.\nThank you.\nJames Bullard: Yeah. Well, the chair said if it comes to that, that we'll go ahead. And I think we\nwill. But I'm saying we have more cushion probably than we would otherwise have. So, slowing down\nthe jobs market in this situation … suppose unemployment was 5½% today, and then we were doing\neverything that we're doing, and you're talking about, \"Well, maybe it'll go to 7½%.\" Well, that really\nwould be a recessionary scenario and that is the kind of thing that we talked about and dealt with in the\n'80s and '90s.\n8\n\n\fBut now, you're looking at unemployment at 3½%. You have some cushion here. You can go up\nsome ways, which would reduce pressures coming from the labor market. But you're starting from such\na low unemployment rate, that you'd still have a pretty strong labor market even if it went up some.\nNow, one thing people say about this, which is very true, which is that when unemployment\ngoes up, it really goes up a lot. And that, I think, comes back to the idea that most of the time,\nrecessions are really some shock hits the economy. It's got to be some special—I've given the analogy\nthat, okay, what we're doing here is we're going to walk the tightrope between two tall buildings and\nwe're going to balance with our stick here. You don't want a big gust of wind to come up just as you're\ndoing this. So, that's what I think we're doing. But the base case would be, no, we're going to be able to\nwalk across it. It's going to be fine. But if it's too windy, you might get knocked off.\nAudience: It's not easy even as a general proposition to walk on a tightrope.\nJames Bullard: No, it is not. But hopefully we've got enough practice.\nAudience: We're all pulling for you.\nModerator: [overlapping].\nAudience: And there's another one behind you as well.\nModerator: Okay. So, one, two and [unintelligible].\nAudience: So, I wanted to get your thoughts on strategy because at some point, a downshift\nand a pause may be inevitable. Maybe they'll be influencing one another. Maybe they won't be. And it\nseems over the last three meetings or so that if there's been data surprises, that the reaction function\nthe market has is to immediately price another 75 basis point. So, given that the terminal rate,\nconditional on the data that we've had since the last meeting and since the spring really has just defined\na higher terminal rate, what's the path or what's the strategy that you see from going from 75 to the\nhigher terminal rate?\nJames Bullard: For me, if you take this minimal Taylor rule calculation and, like I said, in the\nspring, it was three and a half, but now it's gone up because inflation has gone up, so it's kind of a little\nbit of a moving target in terms of what you're calling the terminal rate. And obviously, we were starting\nfrom such a low level, close to zero. So, I would love the 75-basis-point policy because it enables us to\nget to the correct level much faster and have a much bigger chance of success in this whole process.\nBut yeah, once you get to some minimum level, then you can become data dependent at that\npoint. And I would say there's a phase some people in the policy world or financial markets would call it\na catch-up phase. I don't know if I quite want to call it that. But there'd be this phase where, okay, we're\nat zero. We shouldn't be at zero. We should be somewhere way up here. So, we're doing that phase\nright now. And we have to follow through at the coming meetings. But it won't take long. And it's 75\nbasis points, where you'll get to something where you can say, \"Okay, this, I can say with a straight face,\nI think I'm putting meaningful downward pressure on inflation with this policy.\"\nAnd then, at that point, it becomes ordinary monetary policy. Now it's like, \"Okay, what kind of\nshocks are coming in? How's the data coming in? Are we doing enough? Are we not or doing too much?\"\nYou can make adjustments at that point and I don't think we're that far or at least according to the SEP, I\ndon't think we're that far from that, but we're not there yet. We're only at 3.13 sitting here today. So,\n9\n\n\fyou'd have to move, you'd have to move again, maybe first quarter, depending on how the data are\ncoming in at that point. But you will get this transition phase into something that's more like what I\nwould call an ordinary monetary policy phase. Doesn't mean we wouldn't raise rates further at that\npoint, but we'd raise them further based on data. You'd be out of this first phase, where you really\nneeded to get up to something more credible.\nAudience: Okay. And the Fed has adopted average inflation targeting in 2020. Does that mean\nthat the Fed has to keep the rates higher for longer [unintelligible]?\nJames Bullard: Flexible average inflation targeting, this was something that was in the works\nduring 2019. We were supposed to finish the process in January of 2020. That timeline got delayed.\nThen we got a huge shock, so we didn't end up doing that until Jay Powell's speech at Jackson Hole in\n2020. I think that's unfortunate. I really wish we would've been able to get that done before we got into\nthis pandemic shock.\nBut the spirit of that was to talk about the experience of the previous 10 years, where inflation\nwas below target all the time, and to recognize that the period of the zero lower bound or the effective\nlower bound was a period that also pulled down inflation from the target relative to what it otherwise\nwould've been. So, the question is how can you conduct monetary policy when you're stuck at the\neffective lower bound in such a way that you hit your 2% inflation target? And so, it has a lot of things in\nthere about how that would work.\nBut the spirit of it was this is meant to talk about the effective lower bound and the effects of\ninflation when you're at the effective lower bound. Everyone said all the way through, \"Well, if inflation\ngets high, we know what to do because see Volcker.\" So, I would draw two branches. I would say the\nfirst branch would be you get into a very low inflation, low interest rate environment, see flexible\naverage inflation targeting. If you're in a high inflation environment, forget about flexible average\ninflation targeting; see Volcker. That's what I told.\nModerator: We have 10 minutes left.\nAudience: Just wanted to touch on the point, so the steady state, right, when somebody's\nalready asked about the steady state, so even though it's a very bad price on labor productivity now for\nthe last few quarters, what's your view about sort of the steady state labor productivity and how that\nimpact therefore union labor costs and therefore how much slack you might need to generate in the\nlabor market in order to get the wage brought down to a level consistent with the inflation target? Once\nyou take productivity into account, what's your thinking of it?\nJames Bullard: Let me be clear if I haven't been clear enough that I don't think wage price spiral\nis a good way to think about inflation. It's true that nominal wages and prices will move up in tandem in\na high inflation economy. But that's not the cause of inflation. So, if you look at Turkey today, Turkish\ninflation is 83%. Sure, prices are moving up very rapidly. Nominal wages have to move up just as rapidly\nor roughly speaking in order to keep up with that. But that isn't the cause of the 83% inflation in Turkey:\nIt's crappy central bank policy. That's what's causing that.\nAnd so, I hate to blame the people that are going across the street and trying to get a better\nmatch or a little bit higher wage or something. I don't want to blame them for the inflation because I\ndon't think that's where this is coming from. And I think this disinflationary process that you get going\ncomes from the business product side where you've got fear of God of losing market share in a price10\n\n\fsetter's heads and because of that, they are very reluctant to raise their prices any more than the next\nguy is raising their prices. And then that leads to ratcheting down.\nBut this is very dependent on business expectations of prices and what they think they can get\naway with. And that's why I think the expectations are so important and the credibility of the central\nbank is so important that'll get you back to 2% inflation in a relatively benign way. So, I got a little off\ntrack. Sorry. But you wanted to focus on—\nAudience: Yeah. So, the steady state combination of labor productivity [overlapping]—\nJames Bullard: Oh, labor productivity, yeah.\nAudience: ... that is [unintelligible] and therefore [overlapping].\nJames Bullard: On labor productivity, we do have a regime-switching model. This, we're clearly\nstill in the low productivity growth regime. The readings for the first half of this year on labor\nproductivity were terrible, but I do think that will get revised at some benchmark revision in the future,\nand it won't be quite as bad as it looks. There are some stories around about why it's so low. You've got\nthis scramble for workers, so firms have to train the workers all the time, and they're spending—And\nyou do hear that anecdotally. I hear that anecdotally around the Eighth District and around the country\nthat you have to spend so much time training people and everything, that this was taking away from\nother time that you would normally be spending. And your worker isn't that productive for a while. And\nthen they might leave and go across the street.\nSo, I think those factors lead to ideas about labor hoarding. You probably don't want to lose any\nworkers in this environment if you don't have to, even if you think they're not the greatest worker. So,\nthat's probably hurting productivity as well. On the flip side of this, I am very hopeful that some of the\ntechnology that we used and played around with during the pandemic would diffuse more and we'd get\nmore productivity gains out of that. But we're going to have to see if that materializes or not.\nModerator: And then after, we probably have time for one more question.\nAudience: Given the two monetary policy tools that you use today from loading hikes and QT,\nand given the illiquidity and volatility that we're seeing in credit markets, what are you going to be\nrepeating, one of the two? How do you find out for yourself?\nJames Bullard: I was also very pleased that we were able to pull up the balance sheet reduction.\nIt started it in the second quarter of 2022, and it's now going at full strength. However, I think we've also\nsucceeded in focusing our own attention and everyone else's attention on the policy rate as the main\ntool of monetary policy. But being a hawk on the committee, I wanted also that the quantitative\ntightening would be going on. And it's not very clear. The literature's all over the map about how much\neffect this has. But if you think that the quantitative easing was lowering rates on the margin at the\nlonger term, longer maturities, then we didn't want to be putting upward pressure on the longer\nmaturities as we were raising the policy rate.\nSo, I'm pleased that we're doing that. Exactly how big that is or how much effect that's having is\na good question. But I do think it's wind in our sales as we're trying to get inflation down. I do think that I\nwant to simply observe how this process works until the first half of 2023 or maybe all of 2023. And then\nwe'll sort of evaluate at this point. But I think, for now, we can let this run and focus on the policy rate as\nthe main tool of policy.\n11\n\n\fOne other thing about balance sheet, a lot of theories about the balance sheet, and some that I\nhave talked about are that it's more about signaling future changes in the policy rate than it is actual\neffects from the balance sheet. Now, you guys, I know some of you might disagree with that. But if you\nthink of it that way, then when you're at the zero bound, the quantitative easing has a big effect\nbecause you're signaling that you're going to stay lower for longer.\nBut now you've come off of the zero bound, and you can signal directly by doing stuff with the\npolicy rate so you don't get as much signal value out of this as you would've had previously. But still, I\nthink it's good to be moving in the hawkish direction on the balance sheet. And we've got plenty of\nroom, I think, to maneuver there.\nModerator: It'd be interesting to discuss it with the Bank of England. It's just open it for the last\nquestion.\nAudience: Just a question slightly related: How are you thinking about the tradeoff between\nfighting inflation and financial stability? Because we understand that you need to keep interest and the\ninterest rates to fight inflation. But markets have been dealing with a lot this year: liquidity, upgrade\nvolatility. The dollar is very strong. So, it feels like the probability of something breaking in the market is\nincreasing. So, in your view, what would be a credible strategy for the Fed to balance the two then? This\nis an unusual high-inflation environment. But something [unintelligible] in the markets. How do you\n[unintelligible] that?\nJames Bullard: So, I think if you look at the 1994 tightening cycle, you did have Orange County\nas kind of a famous case there. And then even in the late '90s, you had LTCM was a famous case there.\nSo, you will get some of this, I think. And frankly, I would've expected somewhat more of this already\nthan what we've seen. But overall, I would again cite the St. Louis Fed's Financial Stress Index, which is\nnot at a high, it's at a low. And so, according to that metric, it doesn't seem like there's that much\nfinancial stress out there. And I think that's partly because you've got all this transparency and all this\nforward guidance. So, it's not easy. You still have to reprice a lot of assets. And that makes you guys\nhave to work 18-hour days. But nevertheless, you can do it in sort of a orderly manner because you\nknow what's coming from the central bank. You're not getting as surprised as you would otherwise be.\nAnd so, you're not getting as much shock value, let's say, as you would've had.\nSo, I'm hopeful that this will carry us through, although we do track this very carefully. We have\na whole unit that tracks financial stability at the Board and reports to the FOMC on a regular basis. And\nwe do look for mispriced markets and ones that we think are subject to volatility.\nAnother thought on this is that what the higher interest rates have done is made the more\nspeculative assets fall out of favor. And in some ways, that's kind of the most gentle of repricing that you\ncan do. So, if you're doing something in Silicon Valley, and you're playing around with the technology,\nand the payoff is 10 years away, and you're uncertain about the payoff, that kind of bet is not looking as\ngood in the higher-interest-rate environment, so the valuation of that goes way down. So, that's kind of\na soft deflating of asset values and should be less disruptive than other types that we've seen.\nSo, I do think some of the stuff, some of the revaluation is going on there, where people can't\nafford to be as patient as they would've been with a startup company or with investments in speculative\ntechnology.\nModerator: And with that, let me thank you ever so much for your generous time and insights\n[overlapping].\n12\n\n\fJames Bullard: Thank you.\nModerator: Thanks, everybody else too.\n\n13\n\n\f",

Prasad, who delivered the 2022 Homer\nJones Memorial Lecture. Prasad is Tolani Senior Professor of Trade Policy and professor of\neconomics at Cornell University. He is also a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Prasad’s\n2021 book, The Future of Money: How the Digital Revolution Is Transforming Currencies and\nFinance, was the subject of his lecture.\nFull text of remarks:\nPrepared Welcoming Remarks\nJames Bullard\nPresident and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nThe 2022 Homer Jones Memorial Lecture\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nOct. 19, 2022\nAny opinions expressed here are my own and do not necessarily re�ect those of the Federal\nOpen Market Committee.\nWelcome to the 31st Homer Jones Memorial Lecture! It’s been more than two years since the\n30th lecture, which was held here at the Bank on March 4, 2020, very shortly before the onset of\nthe pandemic. Although the pandemic delayed the return of our annual lecture, we couldn’t be\nhappier to resume the lecture series now and to welcome our speaker and all of you to our\nauditorium this evening. So, thank you for coming and welcome back!\nIt’s great to see so many friends of the Bank with us this evening. I’d like to take just a moment to\nrecognize one of our friends—Professor Phil Dybvig from the Olin Business School at Washington\nUniversity in St. Louis. As I’m sure many of you know, Phil was recently awarded the Nobel Prize\nin economics, along with Ben Bernanke and Douglas Diamond, for their pioneering work on\n“Financial Intermediation and the Economy.” Phil and Diamond wrote one of the classic papers\n\n\fin economics, “Bank Runs, Deposit Insurance and Liquidity,” published in the Journal of Political\nEconomy in 1983. Phil has had a distinguished career and we’re glad that he is joining us this\nevening. Congratulations, Phil!\nThe Homer Jones Memorial Lecture honors the memory and institutional contributions of a\nformer St. Louis Fed research director. Homer Jones and his legacy are probably well known to\nthose of you with ties to the St. Louis Fed or who have attended these lectures in the past. But for\nthose who may be attending the lecture for the �rst time, it might be useful to provide a brief\nbackground on the professional life of Homer Jones.\nHomer Jones taught at Rutgers University in the early 1930s. Arthur Burns, who later chaired the\nFed’s Board of Governors in the 1970s, was also on the Rutgers faculty at that time. One of their\nstudents was a young man named Milton Friedman. Because of his interest in mathematics,\nMilton planned to become an actuary. However, Homer introduced Milton to the Chicago school\nof economics and made it possible for him to attend the University of Chicago for graduate\nstudies.1 To make a long story short, at the University of Chicago, Friedman helped found the\nimportant branch of monetary economics known as “monetarism” and eventually won the Nobel\nPrize in economics.\nIn an unusual twist, Homer Jones also matriculated to Chicago, where he completed his Ph.D.\nunder Friedman’s tutelage. Thus, Homer was both a teacher and student of Friedman!2 Homer\neventually joined the St. Louis Fed as its research director and was instrumental in starting the\nBank’s own monetarist tradition. It boggles the mind to think how much different monetary\neconomic history, let alone the monetarist legacy of the St. Louis Fed, would have been if Homer\nJones hadn’t succeeded in encouraging Milton Friedman to become an economist rather than an\nactuary!\nAs director of research, Homer Jones built the St. Louis Fed into the powerhouse of monetary\neconomics that it remains to this day. Homer had a two-pronged approach: Rigorous research\nusing economic and monetary data, and the public dissemination of that data. Jerry Jordan—who\nbegan his career at the St. Louis Fed under Homer and was later president of the Cleveland Fed—\nsaid that Homer’s philosophy was very much aligned with the Show Me State ethos of “prove it.”\nSaid Jordan: “His philosophy essentially was, if the people see it often enough, they’ll come to\nbelieve it whether they understand it or not.”3\nIn time, the St. Louis Fed’s research and many publications played no small role in the economic\nand policy debates of the 1960s and 1970s. To this day, the Bank remains strongly committed to\nmacroeconomic and monetary policy research and to disseminating economic data and\ninformation to the public. We’ve followed a formula started by Homer that has proved quite\nsuccessful. As one example, the Bank’s FRED and family web services garnered more than 20\nmillion visits last year. That’s nearly 55,000 visits a day!\nShortly after Homer Jones’ death, several of his colleagues, friends and academic acquaintances\n\n\fin the St. Louis community organized the �rst Homer Jones Memorial Lecture in 1987. The\nlecture has continued, in large part, because of the past support of many organizations and\npeople. These have included the St. Louis Gateway Chapter of the National Association for\nBusiness Economics, Saint Louis University, Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, the\nUniversity of Missouri-St. Louis, and Washington University in St. Louis. The St. Louis Fed has\ncontinued this tradition by hosting and sponsoring the lecture for many years now.\nThe annual renewal of this lecture is our attempt to honor the timeless contributions of Homer\nJones—while at the same time honoring those who speak with authority on the myriad\nchallenges confronting today’s economic policymakers.\nThis year’s speaker is Eswar S. Prasad. Dr. Prasad is the Tolani Senior Professor of Trade Policy\nand professor of economics at Cornell University. He is also a senior fellow at the Brookings\nInstitution, where he holds the New Century Chair in International Economics, and a research\nassociate at the National Bureau of Economic Research.\nDr. Prasad is the author of many professional journal articles and three books. His latest book,\npublished in 2021, is the subject of today’s talk: The Future of Money: How the Digital Revolution\nIs Transforming Currencies and Finance.\nAs most of you undoubtedly know, digital currencies—whether named Bitcoin, Ethereum or\nsomething else—have become prominent components of the �nancial landscape with increasing\nmainstream acceptance. Just recently, for example, the oldest bank in the United States, Bank of\nNew York Mellon, announced that it would begin offering digital asset custodial services. Some\ncentral banks have even issued—or contemplated—issuing a digital currency. So, in the best\nShow Me State spirit of Homer Jones, Dr. Prasad is going to tell us if digital currencies are hype,\nhope, or history-making.\nPlease join me in welcoming Dr. Prasad.\n1.

During 2022, the FOMC has been moving toward policy settings that will\nput meaningful downward pressure on inflation to return it to the target, he said.\nBullard addressed the question of what is a “sufficiently restrictive” policy rate for the current\nmacroeconomic environment. His approach is based on generous assumptions that tend to favor a\nmore dovish policy. Still, the policy rate isn’t yet in a zone that may be considered sufficiently\nrestrictive, he said.\nVideo:\n\n\f",
