The conference is sponsored by the Federal\nReserve System, the Conference of State Bank Supervisors and the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corp.\nDuring his remarks, Bullard discussed ways in which the conference has expanded over the\nyears.

(FDIC)\nSt. Louis, Mo.\nOct. 1, 2019\nI welcome you to this research and policy conference that we somewhat boldly entitled\n\n\fCommunity Banking in the 21st Century when it began in 2013. The conference then, as\nnow, was sponsored by the Federal Reserve System and the Conference of State Bank\nSupervisors. Last year, we welcomed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to this effort. We\nare pleased with this expanded partnership.\nThe content of that �rst conference was relatively simple: We worked to combine the latest\nin community bank research with the comments of bankers that were voiced during various\n“town hall” meetings held by state banking commissioners around the country.\nThe conference has expanded signi�cantly since. I’d like to highlight some of those changes.\nFirst, we have seen strong sponsorship from senior of�cials of regulatory agencies and the\nCSBS. This support is re�ected by the keynote addresses in this year’s agenda. The morning\nkeynote address is by Federal Reserve Governor Michelle “Miki” Bowman, the Fed’s �rst\ngovernor with responsibility for community banking matters. Her experience as a state\nbanking regulator and as a community banker gives her unique insights into the\ncommunity bank business model. In addition, we are again joined by FDIC Chairman Jelena\nMcWilliams, who has been a strong voice for the community banks since her appointment. I\nlook forward to her talk this afternoon. Another one of my Fed colleagues, Philadelphia Fed\nPresident Patrick Harker, will speak tomorrow morning.\nI also want to acknowledge CSBS President John Ryan and the state banking commissioners\nwho continue to serve as a vital backbone to our unique state-federal supervisory model\nand, of course, to this conference.\nThe conference has expanded in other ways as well.\nSeveral years ago, we introduced a panel discussion to provide a business perspective to\ncomplement the academic research. This year, we will present a panel discussion focused\non the future of community bank funding, a signi�cant issue to banks in the Eighth Federal\nReserve District and across the U.S.\nOf special interest to many bankers is the student case study competition, an innovative\nidea of the CSBS that was introduced four years ago. This year, we will hear the presentation\nof a case study of community banks presented by the winning undergraduate student team\nfrom Juniata College in Huntingdon, Pa.\nFinally, several years ago, we introduced the voices of community bankers through a video\nseries. This year, we have a montage of video interviews with community bankers from\nacross the U.S. We’ll also hear directly from a community banker from Massachusetts who\ndemonstrates that community banks can not only compete against some of the largest\nbanks in the nation but also win.\n\n\fAs you can see, voices of community bankers will continue to be heard throughout nearly\nevery aspect of this conference, including in connection with the research being presented\nthis year.\nOf course, this conference is fundamentally a research conference. So let me offer a few\nthoughts on the research.\nOver the years, more than 60 academic papers have been presented at this conference.\nThese papers have been published in leading economic, �nance and accounting journals.\nThey have been widely cited by other researchers. In other words, they have become the\nreference point for academic research for community banking that the conference\nsponsors envisioned when this endeavor �rst began.\nThis year, 12 papers were selected for presentation from what I’ve been told was an\nimpressive number of high-quality submissions. They are organized in four sessions. One\nsession looks at how regulation in�uences small-business lending. Another examines how\nfunds are transferred among geographic markets in response to local economic shocks.\nAnother examines relationships between regulation and risk. The last one connects\ntechnology to the growth and pro�tability of banks.\nAgain this year, a community banker will participate on every research panel alongside an\nacademic moderator. While it may sound simple, combining a researcher’s perspective with\na practitioner’s perspective is not the norm in the research world. I’ve spent much of my\ncareer in the research world and can tell you: This approach is unusual!\nIn fact, we’ve received inquiries from other institutions asking us about the structure of this\nconference and the inclusion of the voices of practitioners in our research proceedings. I do\nhope we see this approach used more frequently. We have learned a lot from our\ncommunity bankers through this conference, and many of our researchers have told us the\nperspectives they’ve gleaned have helped them improve their research.\nFinally, I’d like to offer a few thoughts on this year’s National Survey of Community Banks,\nwhich was conducted by state banking commissioners and the CSBS. The survey offers a\nsnapshot of the opportunities and challenges faced by community banks. Speci�cally, the\nsurvey has resulted in the creation of a unique data set around compliance costs.\nResearchers here in St. Louis and from other institutions around the country have been\nable to use these data to help us better understand the compliance cost of regulation. The\nsurvey has also offered evidence on how the burden of compliance costs disproportionately\naffects the smallest community banks.\nBank commissioners are cognizant of the time it takes for bankers to complete this survey.\nBut we have seen the value. The survey results not only have added to our knowledge of\n\n\fissues affecting community banks but also have been cited by, among others, the\nCongressional Research Service, the U.S. Government Accountability Of�ce and the White\nHouse Council of Economic Advisers. Clearly, this conference is making its presence felt\nthroughout the research and policy spectrum.\nIn closing, the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis is delighted to host this conference.\nCommunity banking is important to the Midwest economy. We have learned from\ncommunity banks as, hopefully, they have learned from us.\nI wish everyone here today in St. Louis and those joining us through the webcast a great\nconference.\nAnd now I’d like to introduce our opening keynote speaker: Michelle Bowman.\n“Miki” Bowman joined the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System on Nov. 26,\n2018. She is the �rst person to �ll the seat for Federal Reserve governor that had been\nreserved for someone with experience in community banking or community bank\nsupervision. As I mentioned earlier, Governor Bowman has both of those quali�cations.\nPrior to her appointment to the Board, she served as the state bank commissioner of\nKansas. She also served as vice president of Farmers & Drovers Bank in Council Grove, Kan.\nGovernor Bowman received a Bachelor of Science degree in advertising and journalism\nfrom the University of Kansas. She received a Juris Doctor degree from the Washburn\nUniversity School of Law in Topeka, Kan. She is a member of the New York Bar.\nPlease join me in welcoming Governor Bowman.\n1 Any opinions expressed here are my own and do not necessarily re�ect those of the\n\nFederal Open Market Committee.\n\n\f"

I am pleased you have\njoined us for “Banking and the Economy: A Forum for Minorities in Banking.” This forum,\nnow in its fourth year, is growing into what we hoped it would become—a valuable resource\nfor minority leaders in the banking industry. Our vision is that this forum will assist\nminority leaders in the banking industry in enhancing their industry knowledge,\n\n\fconnecting with other professionals in the industry and at the Federal Reserve, and\npreparing to better serve the future �nancial needs of our communities.\nDiversity and inclusion are top priorities across the Federal Reserve System. In many ways,\nthe need to recognize and embrace a variety of viewpoints and experiences is central to the\nFederal Reserve’s unique structure as a decentralized institution. The 12 Federal Reserve\nbanks serve districts that differ in geography, demographics and economics. The needs of\ncommunities here in the St. Louis Fed’s District, while similar in many respects to\ncommunities in other Fed districts, are also distinct.\nThis regionalized structure enables the Federal Reserve to gather data and other\ninformation about the economy, as well as the needs of local communities throughout the\nnation. Inputs from various sources are necessary to inform a national monetary policy\naimed at maintaining the health of the economy and the stability of the nation’s �nancial\nsystem for everyone.\nAs neighborhoods and communities across the country become more diverse, it is\nimportant for policymakers and regulators to hear different viewpoints and perspectives.\nBut recognizing a multiplicity of views throughout the different districts is just one way\ndiversity is embraced at the Fed.\nThe Federal Reserve is also committed to a diverse and inclusive workforce. We believe that\nthe best ideas, decision-making and service to the public are borne from diverse\nperspectives. Diversity and inclusion aren’t just good for morale; they’re a good business\nstrategy. We can attract and recruit the best possible talent by casting a wide net and\nexpanding recruiting efforts. A diverse workforce enhances our ability to be innovative and\nbetter serve the communities in which we operate.\nAt the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, we are committed to building a workplace where\ndifferences provide a foundation for better decisions and services. We have various\ninitiatives here at the St. Louis Fed to ensure that the decisions and recommendations we\nproduce re�ect a variety of perspectives.\nIn 2018, the St. Louis Fed’s staff re�ected a diverse employee population when compared\nwith relevant job groups in the St. Louis MSA.2 Broadly speaking, the St. Louis Fed\nworkforce is more than a quarter (26%) minority. Of the new hires by the St. Louis Fed last\nyear, 35% were minorities.\nDiversity among our employees allows for unique perspectives when generating ideas and\nsolving problems. We encourage an environment where innovation and excellence thrive.\nFor a public-serving institution, having diverse leaders and employees is critical to earning\nand keeping the public’s trust.\n\n\fSimilarly, workforce diversity is also incredibly important throughout the �nancial\nindustry. It is essential to ensuring a safe, sound and accessible banking system that\nprotects consumers and promotes competition.\nOverall, representation of minorities throughout all levels of management positions in the\n�nancial services industry has increased since 2007, from about 17% to 21% in 2015,\naccording to a 2017 report by the Government Accountability Of�ce.3 However, the level of\nrepresentation by minorities varied by race and ethnicity group, as well as by seniority.\nSpeci�cally, representation of African Americans at various management levels decreased\nslightly during this period, while representation of other minorities increased, as noted in\nthe report.\nProspects for minorities are favorable. The management pipeline at �nancial industry\norganizations—through which diverse candidates can move into senior-level management\npositions—has grown. Representation of minorities in �rst- and mid-level management\npositions was 22.4% in 2015, up from 18.7% in 2007. This compares to the 12.3%\nrepresentation of minorities in senior-level management positions in 2015, according to\nthe GAO.\nEvents like this forum contribute to a robust pipeline of new banking leaders who are\ninformed, engaged and ready to serve their communities. Helping minority leaders develop\nthe skills and connections to advance in the �nancial services industry is important to\nindividual advancement, but also for increasing representation of minorities at all levels of\nan organization. Visibility, networking and information are vital for professional\ndevelopment, and there are many examples of information sharing, engagement and\nnetworking continuing long after the forum concludes.\nMinority ownership in the �nancial services industry is also crucial to the promise of\ndelivering broad-based economic gains and �nancial solutions.\nAs the minority representation in the �nancial services industry ticks up, the number of\nMinority Depository Institutions (MDIs) has declined since the �nancial crisis, which is\nconsistent with industry trends. From 2008 to 2018, the number of MDIs declined 31%, a\nsigni�cant decline but a more gradual decline than community banks as a whole, which\ndeclined by 33% over the same period, the FDIC reported.4\nAgain, there are racial and ethnic disparities, as noted in the FDIC report. From 2001 to\n2018, the number of depository institutions owned by Asian Americans, Hispanics and\nNative Americans increased, while the number of MDIs owned by African Americans\ndeclined by more than half. African American MDIs represented just 15% of all MDIs at the\nend of last year.\n\n\fAnd compared with the more than 5,400 insured �nancial institutions, the number of MDIs\nis still small, the FDIC noted. There were only 149 MDIs in the U.S. last year, down from 215\nbefore the �nancial crisis.\nOn the plus side, �nancial performance at MDIs has improved signi�cantly over the past\n�ve years in terms of revenue generation and loan performance, according to the FDIC.\nThese institutions make a greater share of mortgage originations—as well as small business\nloans—to borrowers in low- and moderate-income census tracts.\nThey are more likely to have branches in minority neighborhoods and are more likely than\nnon-MDIs to focus on lending within communities of diverse ethnic backgrounds. This puts\nminority depository institutions in place to be valuable partners and to create an economic\nmultiplier effect for communities of color.\nOne way the Federal Reserve is working to assist these banks is through Partnership for\nProgress,5 a program launched in 2008 to help preserve and promote minority-owned\ninstitutions and enhance their ability to thrive in a competitive banking environment.\nThe program seeks to help minority institutions confront the unique challenges of their\ncommunities and cultivate safe and sound practices throughout their life cycle. Through\nprogramming that includes one-on-one guidance and workshops, as well as an online\nresource and information center, Partnership for Progress helps minority-owned and de\nnovo banks grow to a size that allows them to continue providing capital and �nancial\nservices to a growing population. This adds strength and vitality to the local communities\nthey serve and helps provide stability to the U.S. economy.\nThe program also helps the Fed better understand the challenges these institutions face in\nraising capital, growing their institutions and attracting as well as retaining talent.

This meeting is part of the FOMC’s comprehensive\nreview of its monetary policy strategy, tools and communications.\n“Miki and I, as well as the rest of our colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee,\nwant and need to hear from you today to understand how our monetary policy decisions\naffect people and communities in the Fed’s Eighth District,” Bullard told the advisory\ncouncils.\nFull text of remarks:\n\nWelcoming Remarks1\nJames Bullard\nPresident and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\n\nFed Listens\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nSept. 4, 2019\nA good late morning to everyone. I’m Jim Bullard, president of the St. Louis Fed, and I’m\nvery pleased to welcome you all to the Bank and today’s Fed Listens meeting. Joining us are\nFederal Reserve Governor Miki Bowman, members of the St. Louis Fed’s advisory councils,\nmembers of the media, Bank staff and others via livestream. Welcome everyone.\nToday we’ve brought together our six advisory councils to hear their views about the\neconomy, employment, in�ation, interest rates and Federal Reserve communications.\n\n\fThese are members of our Community Development Advisory Council, Agribusiness\nIndustry Council, Health Care Industry Council, Real Estate Industry Council,\nTransportation Industry Council and Community Depository Institutions Advisory Council.\nTogether, they are both an industry-diverse and a geographically diverse set of advisors who\nhail from and represent communities throughout the St. Louis Fed’s seven-state District.\nListening is built into the St. Louis Fed’s DNA. In addition to meeting with each of these\nadvisory councils at least twice a year, we regularly meet with business, community and\nlabor leaders, as well as the general public, in order to get a direct sense of how they are\nexperiencing the economy. Listening to their viewpoints helps keep us informed about the\nkey economic issues they’re facing, which in turn ensures that the concerns and\nperspectives of those throughout the Eighth Federal Reserve District are heard during\nmonetary policy deliberations. This dialogue allows us to put context to data and research\nwhile gathering direct and un�ltered information on a variety of topics. Models and data are\ncritical, but they don’t tell the whole story. Hearing from people like you helps us �ll in the\ngaps.\nBut our work doesn’t stop there. My staff and I regularly tour our District, visiting\ncommunities both large and small to hear directly from Main Street and from people such\nas yourselves. We do this because there’s no substitute for visiting these communities and\nhearing �rsthand. Experiencing what’s happening on the ground helps us build strong\nconnections and get feedback on business, economic and banking conditions. Being the\nvoice of Main Street is one of the key roles of the regional Federal Reserve bank, and it’s\nbaked into how the Federal Reserve System was designed 105 years ago.\nMiki and I, as well as the rest of our colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee, want\nand need to hear from you today to understand how our monetary policy decisions affect\npeople and communities in the Fed’s Eighth District. In many ways, today’s meeting is\nbusiness as usual for our council members: We will be listening to you. What’s not business\nas usual, however, is that today’s meeting is part of the �rst-ever public comprehensive\nreview by the FOMC of our monetary policy strategy, tools and communications. Our\nmeeting today—along with other Fed Listens events around the Federal Reserve System this\nyear—is at the core of that review.\nAs part of its Fed Listens initiative, the Federal Reserve is asking a wide range of\nstakeholders throughout 2019 to provide feedback on our approach to policymaking. We’re\nasking for perspectives on our performance in using monetary policy to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices—the goals Congress has assigned to us. In addition, we’re\nasking about how well we are communicating our policies and actions.\nThe comprehensive review gives us an opportunity to think about possible changes to our\n\n\fmonetary policy framework outside of the current-day decision-making on monetary\npolicy. Given that macroeconomic outcomes have been quite good for the U.S. in recent\nyears, now is a good time to do strategic thinking for the future—say, over the next �ve or 10\nyears. Doing this review and considering new ideas in good times are important so that\nwhen bad times return, policymakers have some basis to go ahead and make decisions. The\nresults of this review will help ensure that we are well positioned to meet our goals for many\nyears to come.\nThe Board of Governors and other Federal Reserve banks have hosted several Fed Listens\nevents so far this year, including a System research conference at the Federal Reserve Bank\nof Chicago with academic experts and panelists from outside the Fed. Today’s meeting is\nthe ninth event across the Federal Reserve System that is designed to hear from people and\ncommunities that are positioned to see the direct effects of monetary policy. As we listen to\nhow monetary policy impacts your businesses and industries, consumers, small\nbusinesses, banks and people in low- and moderate-income communities, we’ll be thinking\nabout how to use this information to help shape our strategies going forward. Information\nheard during these events will ultimately be considered when the FOMC performs its own\nassessment of its tools and strategies, including an assessment of the approaches we’ve\nused and the approaches that have been proposed but not tried. We expect to make our\nconclusions public in the �rst half of 2020.\nBefore I turn it over to Miki, let me explain how today’s meeting will work. After lunch, the\nadvisory councils will break out into separate working sessions in assigned conference\nrooms, where you will share with each other your insights and answers to the questions I\nsent you in advance. During the breakout session, you’ll also put together a report\nsummarizing your council’s discussion. Miki and I will not be part of your working sessions,\nbut we will rejoin all of the advisory councils at 2:30 p.m. in the auditorium, where one\nrepresentative from each council will report out on the council’s discussion and take a few\nfollow-up questions from Miki and me. After today, we will compile the feedback into a\nwritten report that will be shared with you and posted to our public website. We will also\nsend it to the Board of Governors for inclusion in a larger report. We are livestreaming these\nopening remarks today, and we will be livestreaming the report-out session after the\ncouncils’ working sessions.\nMiki’s and my role here today is to listen, and we look forward to hearing from you. We need\nthe best tools and strategies possible for dealing with the challenges we face, and our\ncommunications about monetary policy must be clear and credible. We welcome your best\nthinking on these issues. Thank you.\nAnd now I would like to introduce my colleague and friend: Federal Reserve Governor\nMichelle “Miki” Bowman.\n\n\fMiki Bowman took of�ce as a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem on Nov. 26, 2018, to �ll an unexpired term ending Jan. 31, 2020.\nPrior to her appointment to the Board, Miki served as the state bank commissioner of\nKansas from January 2017 to November 2018. She also served as vice president of Farmers\n& Drovers Bank in Kansas from 2010 to 2017.\nIn addition to her experience in the banking industry, Miki worked in Washington, D.C., for\nSenator Bob Dole of Kansas from 1995 to 1996 and served as a counsel to the U.S. House\nCommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the Committee on Government\nReform and Oversight between 1997 and 2002. In 2002, she became director of\ncongressional and intergovernmental affairs at the Federal Emergency Management\nAgency. From 2003 to 2004, she served as deputy assistant secretary and policy advisor to\nHomeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge.\nFollowing her time in Washington, D.C., Miki led a government and public affairs\nconsultancy based in London before returning to Kansas in 2010.\nShe received a BS in advertising and journalism from the University of Kansas and a JD\nfrom the Washburn University School of Law. She is a member of the New York Bar.\n1 Any opinions expressed here are my own and do not necessarily re�ect those of the\n\nFederal Open Market Committee.\n\n\f"

Why is the\nFed doing this review, and what does it entail? “I\nwould say that it’s best practice among central\nbanks to review their policymaking framework\non a regular basis,” says St. Louis Fed President\nJames Bullard. He also discusses what\npolicymakers will do with the information\ngathered during the review.\n\nTranscript\nKaren Mracek: Welcome to the Timely Topics podcast series from the Federal Reserve\nBank of St. Louis. I’m Karen Mracek, your host for this podcast. With me today is St. Louis\nFed President James Bullard. President Bullard, thank you for being here.\nJames Bullard: Happy to be here.\nMracek: Today we will be talking about the monetary policy framework review that the\nFederal Reserve is currently undertaking. At a high level, what does this review entail?\nBullard: Well, I would say that it’s best practice among central banks to review their\npolicymaking framework on a regular basis, let’s say �ve years or seven years. This was\n\n\fpioneered by the Bank of Canada. And I think this gives an opportunity to think about\nchanges that might be made outside of the normal policy cycle because you don’t want this\nto get wrapped up with current-day decision-making on monetary policy. This is more longrun thinking about monetary policy strategy.\nMracek: OK. So, to be clear, is the dual mandate or the 2% in�ation target under review?\nBullard: The dual mandate would be part of the legislation in the Federal Reserve Act. So,\nthat’s not under review. The in�ation target is something the [Federal Open Market]\nCommittee adopted in 2012, and Chair [Jerome] Powell has said that we’re not going to\nreview that as part of the discussion.\nMracek: Can you tell us a little bit about why the Fed is doing this review now?\nBullard: Macroeconomic outcomes are quite good for the United States. Unemployment is\nnear a 50-year low. In�ation is low and stable. I’ve argued that it’s a little bit too low, but it’s\nbasically low and stable. The economy’s not in recession. So, it’s actually a good time to do\nstrategic thinking for the future. You’re trying to think over �ve or 10 years into the future\nhere. And so, I think it’s a good opportunity for that.\nMracek: OK. So, let’s discuss some of the speci�cs of the review, starting with the monetary\npolicy strategies. Can you tell us a little bit about the Fed’s current strategy for meeting its\ndual mandate of price stability and maximum employment?\nBullard: I think most people would describe the current strategy as in�ation targeting,\nwhich has swept the world of central banking since the 1990s. We named an of�cial\nin�ation target in January 2012. We conduct policy to try to maintain that rate of in�ation\nover time, but we also adjust appropriately to meet the employment side of our mandate.\nAnd ideally, we’d be able to hit both of them at the same time.\nThe only problem with this framework is that it may lead to in�ation being too low on\naverage over time because, as we found out in the last 10 years, the policy rate can hit the\neffective lower bound. And when it does that, then you have to resort to other types of\npolicies like quantitative easing and so on. And because of that, people are thinking about:\nWell, are there ways to better manage the monetary policy framework going forward?\nMracek: What are some ways that the economy has evolved since the �nancial crisis and\nGreat Recession that you might have to take into consideration when looking at the\nmonetary policy framework?\nBullard: I think the biggest issue has been this zero lower bound. We started calling it\neffective lower bound because some countries have negative interest rates now. But the zero\nlower bound means that you kind of get stuck in monetary policy. You can’t move the policy\n\n\frate anymore. And then you have to resort to other types of policies as I was just noting.\nAnd the question is whether you might get stuck at an in�ation rate that’s lower than your\nin�ation target. Certainly, the case in Japan where their policy rate hasn’t been above 50\nbasis points in 20 years and their in�ation rate has been low or negative over that horizon.\nSo, how can we stay out of that kind of trap, I think, is a key issue for this review.\nMracek: What are some possible alternative strategies that the Fed is discussing during this\nreview?\nBullard: The key alternative would be to target the price level instead of targeting the\nin�ation rate, which sounds like a minor change. But what it would say is that you pay\nattention to the fact that you might miss your in�ation target, let’s say, to the low side for a\nwhile. And then you might make up for that by missing your in�ation target to the high side\nfor a while so that, on average, you still hit the in�ation target. That’s often called price-level\ntargeting as opposed to in�ation targeting, which has a subtle difference. In in�ation\ntargeting, if you were below target, you would just try to go back to the target. You wouldn’t\ntry to go above the target.\nSo, the good thing about price-level targeting type strategies is that you hit the in�ation rate\nbetter on average during the long run. And this better cements in�ation expectations, and\nso you get better policy out of that. I would also say that price-level targeting is closely\nrelated to nominal GDP targeting, which is another version of the same idea basically.\nMracek: Turning to the review of monetary policy tools, are the tools that the Fed currently\nuses adequate for setting the stance of monetary policy?\nBullard: Well, that’s part of this discussion. Normal times would call for adjustments to the\npolicy rate up or down in various situations depending on how the economy’s evolving. And\nthat’s how you would conduct monetary policy. Certainly all during the [former Fed\nChairman Alan] Greenspan era, for instance, that’s exactly what we did. A lot of theory and\nempirics grew up around analyzing just that particular channel.\nBut when you hit the zero lower bound or the effective lower bound, then a whole new set of\ntools comes on board. Probably the most famous one is quantitative easing or bond-buying\nprograms by central banks. The Fed did a lot of that during the period when we were at the\neffective lower bound.\nBut there are other policies. Forward guidance is another one. And I think a good question\nfor this review is how effective forward guidance is when you’re not at the zero lower bound.\nWhen you’re away from the zero lower bound, should you be giving guidance on where you\nthink the policy rate is going to go in the future?\n\n\fAnd then there are other types of policies that probably aren’t getting as much analysis. But\none is negative interest rate policies. Those are being used in Europe and in Japan. They\nhaven’t been as popular in the U.S., but that’s something else that certainly could be looked\nat. There are probably a host of others that we could talk about, but those are probably the\nmain ones.\nMracek: And the review also looks at ways in which the Fed communicates monetary policy.\nSo, to start with, what do you think is going well?\nBullard: The U.S. has begun to meet an international standard by having press conferences\nafter every meeting. I think markets always want to know what the Federal Reserve is\nthinking, what the Committee is thinking. Even if nothing is happening, they want to know,\n“OK, nothing is happening.” So, we’ve begun to do that this year, and I think it does provide\nbetter communication on the whole. So, I think it’s working well.\nMracek: And are there further improvements in communication that you’d like to see?\nBullard: The Committee has a Summary of Economic Projections, [with] the so-called dot\nplot, which is put out once a quarter. I don’t think our communication there is as good as\nforeign central banks have. The Bank of England [and] the ECB [European Central Bank] put\nout more comprehensive descriptions of their forecasts—usually their staff forecasts—and\nthen the policymakers themselves can comment on the staff forecast, which I think is\nmaybe one way that we could change the system that we use. So, I think there are some\nimprovements that could be made.\nMracek: And this monetary policy framework review includes Fed Listens events\nthroughout the Federal Reserve System. What is the purpose of holding these events? And\ncan you describe for us the setup for the upcoming meeting here in St. Louis in September\nand what you hope to learn from that meeting?\nBullard: Well, we wanted the framework review to get input from a wide variety of sources,\nand we’re certainly doing that. We’ll basically talk to anybody who is interested in this, but,\nin particular, constituents in the various parts of the country. And we’re doing that in the\nEighth District.\nAnd what we’re going to do for our Fed Listens event is bring all our councils together on a\nsingle day into St. Louis and get the whole shebang at one time. That’s a special event. But it\njust re�ects part of what we do all the time here at the St. Louis Fed, which is try to stay in\nclose touch with economic actors on the ground and see what’s happening in their lives and\ntheir businesses on a day-to-day basis in order to allow that to be an input into monetary\npolicy.\nMracek: And what will policymakers at the Fed do with the information gathered during\n\n\fthis whole review?\nBullard: Well, I think the code word here is evolution, not revolution. I don’t think we want\nto give the impression that we’re going to overturn the current Fed operating framework or\nstrategic framework overnight. I don’t think that’s realistic or desirable. But I do think that\nmany of these ideas will feed into future monetary policy as we go forward and creep in in\nvarious ways. Some of them might be more visible than others, but I would not expect a\nmanifesto to come out that radically reorients Fed policy.\nThere is one focal point, which is the January statement of long-run monetary policy\nstrategy and goals. We could make changes to that statement, but it is a relatively terse\nstatement. It has only a few paragraphs. And the most we could do is make some changes to\na few parts of those paragraphs. So, I don’t think the person on the street would take that as\ntoo signi�cant. But that’s the nature of evolution, not revolution. I think we could tweak that\na little bit, and that might be a visible outcome of this process.\nAnother outcome could just be that we’re happy with our in�ation-targeting process and we\nthink it’s a good strategy going forward. Some of the Bank of Canada reviews that they’ve\ndone over the years have come exactly more or less to that conclusion, where they reviewed\neverything but then they reaf�rmed the previous strategy. And I think that’s a perfectly �ne\noutcome as well.\nThis is not necessarily meant to suggest that there are big changes afoot. But it is meant to\nbe thoroughgoing, get lots of input, think about these issues deeply on a calendar basis,\nsomething like �ve years or seven years. Because otherwise you might go 50 years and you\nnever changed your framework, and it gets badly out of date and it really doesn’t work very\nwell. But because you’ve never thought about the strategy, you’ve never changed it. And if\nyou are going to change it, you would have to change it in small ways in order to make\nprogress.\nMracek: So, you mentioned the Bank of Canada and their review. Do you think that the Fed\nwill start reviewing its monetary policy framework on a regular frequency?\nBullard: Well, that would be the hope. We’re not done with this one yet, so we’ll see how\nsuccessful this is. But we’re certainly learning as we go along. I would be hopeful that we\nwould get �ve or seven years down the line and then we would say, “OK, let’s go through this\nagain and see if anything’s changed or if we want to change our approach.”\nMracek: And is there anything else you want our listeners to know about the Fed’s\nmonetary policy framework review?\nBullard: Well, I just think this is such a good kind of corporate practice. So, I do think it’s a\ngood thing that we’re doing. When you think about the crisis 10 years ago, we had to do a lot\n\n\fof improvisation, on-the-run changes in monetary policy, new tools being introduced. That\ncauses a lot of volatility. People aren’t really sure how this is going to work. Policymakers\nthemselves aren’t really sure how it’s going to work. So, I think it’s very useful to try to do as\nmuch as you can in good times so that when bad times come again, you’ve at least got some\nbasis to go ahead and make decisions.\nMracek: All right.

He noted that the Federal\nOpen Market Committee’s monetary policy normalization program has been successful in that\nU.S. real economic performance has been very good during the normalization.\nThe normalization of U.S. monetary policy has come to a close at an appropriate point, Bullard\nnoted. “Going forward, the FOMC may adjust monetary policy, but any changes would be in\nresponse to incoming macroeconomic data and not part of an ongoing normalization strategy,”\nhe said.\nThe FOMC faces many macroeconomic challenges, Bullard explained, including unresolved\ntrade disputes and below-target inflation. “These challenges suggest that the FOMC needs to\ntread carefully in order to help sustain the economic expansion,” he said.\nHe noted that the FOMC may want to consider ways to re-center inflation and inflation\nexpectations at the 2% target. “A downward policy rate adjustment even with relatively good\nreal economic performance may help maintain the credibility of the FOMC’s inflation target\ngoing forward,” Bullard said. “A policy rate move of this sort may become a more attractive\noption if inflation data continue to disappoint.”\n\nFOLLOW US\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/from-the-president/speeches-and-presentations/2019/a-successful-normalization-of-monetary-policy\n\n1/2\n\n\f12/21/22, 5:39 PM\n\nA Successful Normalization of Monetary Policy in the U.S. | James Bullard | St. Louis Fed\n\nSIGN UP FOR EMAIL ALERTS\nReceive updates in your inbox as soon as new content is published on our website\nSIGN UP\nQUICK LINKS\nAbout Us\nLegal Information\nContact Us\nPrivacy Policy\nCareers\nDoing Business with the Fed\nEvents\nFederal Reserve Services\nVisiting the St. Louis Fed\nFederal Banking Regulations\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/from-the-president/speeches-and-presentations/2019/a-successful-normalization-of-monetary-policy\n\n2/2\n\n\f"

Bullard, 2018, “R-Star Wars: The Phantom Menace,” Business Economics, 53(2), pp. 60-65.\n3\n\n\fKey themes\n• The main themes are:\no r* is, in practice, a low-frequency trend measure of a short-term real\n\ninterest rate, and this talk will take a regime-switching view of this issue.\n\no Observed low real interest rates are associated with government debt, not\n\nnecessarily with capital.\n\no There appears to be a large demand for safe assets globally, and this may\n\nbe the largest factor driving real interest rates to low levels in the past\nthree decades.\n\no There is only modest evidence that key trends influencing the natural rate\n\nof interest are changing today.\n\n4\n\n\fRaw Data and the Trend\n\n5\n\n\fShort-term real interest rates\n• This talk views the natural real rate of interest as the trend component\n•\n•\n•\n\nof short-term real interest rates.\nThe Fed can influence the real rate of interest but not the trend in the\nreal rate of interest, which is viewed as driven by fundamental factors.\nI will call the slow-moving trend value “r-dagger” (or r†).\nThere are many ways to detrend the data.\n\n6\n\n\fRaw data\n• The raw data for this talk are one-year ex-post real interest rates on\n•\n\nU.S. Treasury bills from 1984 to the present.1\nMany possible methods to detrend the data:\no Use a constant as in Taylor (1993).2\n\no Use a model, such as Holston et al. (2017) or Del Negro et al. (2017).3\no Use a linear trend.\n\no Use an atheoretical filter, like the Hodrick-Prescott filter.\n\n1 Forward-looking\n\nmeasures, based on the FRB of Cleveland data, are similar but more volatile.\nTaylor, 1993, “Discretion versus policy rules in practice,” Carnegie-Rochester Conference Series on Public Policy,\n39, pp. 195-214.\n3 K.

Last observations: 2019-Q1 and 2018-Q4.\n9\n\n\fA regime-switching view\n• In this talk, I will give a regime-switching view of these issues.\n• Fundamental factors—mostly the same as those that others have\n•\n•\n\nlooked at—are viewed as switching between high-mean and low-mean\nstates.\nTo center the analysis, I will consider all issues in the context of a\nTaylor-type policy rule.\nI will give the policy implications of my view at the end of the talk.\n\n10\n\n\fThe Natural Rate of Interest in a\nTaylor-Type Policy Rule\n\n11\n\n\fWhy worry about r†?\n• In a Taylor-type rule, the trend natural real interest rate, rt† ,\n\n•\n•\n\ndetermines the intercept:\nit = rt† + πte + ϕπ πtGAP + ϕy ytGAP,\nwhere πte = π* = 2 percent, the FOMC’s inflation target.\nWhen the gaps are zero, a Taylor-type rule simply recommends setting\nthe policy rate equal to the value of rt† plus the inflation target.\nBut what is the value of rt†?\n\n12\n\n\fDecomposing the natural real rate\n• One way to think of the underlying or trend natural real rate of interest\n•\n•\n•\n\nis to divide it into three factors:\nrt† = λt + ψt + ξt, where\nλt: the labor productivity growth rate\nψt: the labor force growth rate\nξt: an investor desire for safe assets. A strong desire for safe assets\nwould imply a relatively large negative value for ξt, whereas an\nordinary desire for safe assets would imply a value closer to zero.\n\n13\n\n\fA model with this decomposition\n• One model that produces a decomposition of this sort is outlined in\n•\n•\n•\n\n1 J.\n\n“Optimal Monetary Policy for the Masses.”1\nThe model is a 241-period life-cycle DSGE with certain “symmetry\nassumptions.”\nA balanced growth path of the model would have a decomposition\ncomparable to the one outlined in the previous slide.\nThis provides one concept of the Wicksellian natural real rate of\ninterest.\n\nBullard and R. DiCecio, 2019, “Optimal Monetary Policy for the Masses,” FRB of St. Louis Working Paper No. 2019-009C.\n14\n\n\fLonger-run outcomes as regimes\n• This conception of the natural real rate of interest suggests r† will have\n•\n•\n\na constant mean associated with a single possible balanced growth\npath.\nThe point of this presentation is that this mean may be better modeled\nas shifting over time.\nShifting means can be modeled as regime-switching processes.\no For example, relatively long eras of high productivity growth may be\n\nfollowed by relatively long eras of low productivity growth, and the\nnatural rate of interest would be different in the two regimes.\n\n15\n\n\fThe declining trend is on government paper\nonly, not on capital\n• The raw data show a declining trend on an ex-post real return to\n•\n•\n•\n\nholding government paper.\nThe declining trend does not appear to extend to ex-post real returns on\nclaims to capital as measured from the U.S. GDP accounts.\nThat return has been fairly constant since the 1980s, as shown in the\nnext chart.\nThis provides a rationale for the inclusion of the ξ factor above, which\nmeasures the desirability of holding safe assets relative to capital.1\n\nFor an alternative perspective on this issue, see J.C. Williams, “Three Questions on R-star,” FRB of San Francisco\nEconomic Letter No. 2017-05, Feb. 21, 2017.\n\n1\n\n16\n\n\fReal returns on capital and safe assets\n\nSources: P. Gomme, B. Ravikumar and P. Rupert. “Secular Stagnation and Returns on Capital,” FRB of St. Louis Economic\nSynopses No. 19, 2015; Federal Reserve Board; FRB of Dallas; and author’s calculations. Last observation: 2019-Q1.\n17\n\n\fMain question\n• Which of the three factors is most important in accounting for the\n•\n\n•\n•\n\ndownward trend? Is it productivity growth, labor force growth or the\ndesirability of safe assets?\nI will treat each of these three factors as following a two-state Markovswitching intercept process:\nxt = x(st) + εt , where εt is an i.i.d. error term\nst can take two values, high and low.\nThe two possible mean values are called regimes.\nThe idea is that these types of factors generally have constant means,\nbut that there can be infrequent shifts in mean. I want to characterize\nthese shifts statistically.\n\n18\n\n\fLabor Productivity Growth\n\n19\n\n\fU.S. labor productivity growth has been low\n• A statistical model that estimates the probability that the U.S. economy\n•\n•\n\nis in a low-productivity-growth regime puts nearly all the probability\non the low-growth regime.1\nThe most recent estimates, based on the Kahn and Rich (2006, 2007)\nmethodology, put the growth rate in the low (high) state at 1.33 percent\n(2.96 percent).2\nThe U.S. economy was in the high-productivity-growth regime from\nearly 1997 to late 2004.\n\nSee J.A. Kahn and R.W. Rich, 2006, “Tracking Productivity in Real Time,” FRB of New York, Current Issues in\nEconomics and Finance, 12(8); and J.A. Kahn and R.W. Rich, 2007, “Tracking the New Economy: Using Growth Theory\nto Detect Changes in Trend Productivity,” Journal of Monetary Economics, 54(6), pp. 1670-1701.\n2 In previous talks, I have used even lower productivity growth assumptions.\n1\n\n20\n\n\fLabor productivity growth\n\nSources: Kahn and Rich (2006, 2007) and FRB of New York. Last observation: 2019-Q1.\n21\n\n\fLabor Force Growth\n\n22\n\n\fLabor force growth has been low\n• The U.S. labor force had been growing at a 1.33 percent annual rate\n•\n•\n•\n\nuntil the financial crisis.\nThe growth rate has been 0.53 percent since the financial crisis.\nIt appears that the U.S. is in a low-growth state, but statistically the\ntwo regimes are not precisely estimated.\nIn discussing the policy implications below, I will consider the\npossibility that the U.S. is in either state.\n\n23\n\n\fLabor force growth\n\nSources: Bureau of Labor Statistics and author’s calculations. Last observation: April 2019.\n24\n\n\fInvestors’ Desire for Safe Assets\n\n25\n\n\fStrong desire versus a more normal desire\nfor safe assets\n• I now remove the regime-switching trends for both labor productivity\n•\n•\n\nand labor force growth from the raw data on ex-post safe real returns.\nThis leaves us with a time series of adjusted safe real returns, and this\nseries still has a downward trend.\nI then fit a two-state regime-switching process to these residual values,\nand I interpret the two states as a strong desire for safe assets versus a\nmore normal desire for safe assets.\n\n26\n\n\fHigh-desire-for-safe-assets regime\n• The estimated values for ξ are -2.94 percent in the high-desire-for-safe•\n•\n\nassets regime and 0.62 percent in the normal-desire-for-safe-assets\nregime.\nThe U.S. is currently in the regime with a high desire for safe assets.\nThe difference between the two regimes is largest for this factor; in\nsome sense, it is the “most important” of the three.\n\n27\n\n\fDesire-for-safe-assets regimes\n\nSource: Author’s calculations. Last observation: March 2019.\n28\n\n\fHigh-desire-for-safe-assets regime:\nsmoothed probabilities\n\nSource: Author’s calculations. Last observation: March 2019.\n29\n\n\fWhat Does This Imply for the\nNatural Real Rate of Interest?\n\n30\n\n\fr†: data and fitted values\n\nSources: Federal Reserve Board, FRB of Dallas and author’s calculations. Last observation: March 2019.\n31\n\n\fState values for each factor\n\nFactor\nLabor productivity growth, λ\nLabor force growth, ψ\nInvestor desire for safe assets (inverse), ξ\nMax/min natural rate, r†\n\n296\n133\n62\n\nHigh-low\nstate\ndifference\n133\n163\n53\n80\n-294\n356\n\n491\n\n-108\n\nHigh\nstate\n\nLow\nstate\n\n599\n\nAll values are expressed as basis points. The max (min) natural rate is the value corresponding to all\nthree factors taking the value in the high (low) state.\n\n32\n\n\fUsing the regime-switching approach\n• Labor productivity appears to be in the low-growth regime: λ = 1.33\n•\n•\n•\n\npercent.\nThe labor force appears to be in the low-growth regime as well: ψ =\n0.53 percent. Plausibly, labor force growth could be interpreted as still\nconsistent with the high-growth regime, ψ = 1.33 percent.\nThere also appears to be a high desire for safe assets: ξ = -2.94 percent.\nAccording to this analysis, r† = λ + ψ + ξ is either -108 basis points or\n-28 basis points, depending on how one views labor force growth.\n\n33\n\n\fRecent Related Estimates\nfrom the Literature\n\n34\n\n\fRelated literature and regime switching\n• There is a fairly large and growing literature trying to understand the\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\ndownward trend in the natural real rate of interest.\nThe literature tends to be quite a bit more sophisticated than the\nanalysis presented here.\nThe only point here is to think in terms of regime switching.\nTwo of the three factors analyzed—labor productivity growth and the\ndesire for safe assets—are in the low state and do not appear to be\nshifting to the high state.\nThis suggests the natural safe real rate of interest, and hence the Fed’s\npolicy rate, can remain low over the forecast horizon.\n\n35\n\n\fRelated literature on the natural rate\n• Laubach and Williams (2003) impose a structural model and estimate a\nrelatively low r*.1\n\no Holston et al. (2017) extend the analysis to other countries.\n\n• Curdia (2015) performs a similar analysis with somewhat altered\n•\n•\n\nassumptions and gets a very low r*.2\nDel Negro et al. (2017) impose a structural model, include an evolving\ndemand for safe assets and get a low value for r*.\nI have imposed less structure along with an alternative stochastic\nconception, regime switching. This suggests a different view of meanreversion properties.\n\n1 T.\n\nLaubach and J.C.

Taylor (1993): ϕπ = 1.5, ϕy = 0.5\n2. Taylor (1999): ϕπ = 1.5, ϕy = 1\no Inflation target:\n\nπ e = π* = 200\n\no The inflation gap:\n\nπ GAP ∈ [-51, -4]\n\no Natural real rate:\no The output gap:\n\nr† ∈ [-108, -28]\n\ny GAP ∈ [44, 207]\n\n42\n\n\fPolicy rate recommendations\n• Based on these data and rules, then\n1. Taylor (1993) implies i ∈ [38, 270].\n2. Taylor (1999) implies i ∈ [60, 373].\n\n• The Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) target range for the\n•\n\nfederal funds rate today is 225 to 250 basis points, and the federal\nfunds rate is trading at about 240 basis points.\nThis value is within the range of the Taylor (1993, 1999)\nrecommendations.\n\n43\n\n\fObservations for Policymakers\n\n44\n\n\fAlternative Taylor-type rules\n• Modernized Taylor-type policy rules tend to put less weight on the\n•\n•\n\noutput gap term.1\nIf we use a coefficient ϕy = 0.1, keeping other values the same, then the\nTaylor rule recommends lower policy rates: i ∈ [20, 187].\nIn this case, the actual U.S. policy rate setting would appear to be\nsomewhat high.\n\nSee J. Bullard, “Modernizing Monetary Policy Rules,” remarks delivered at the Economic Club of Memphis, Memphis,\nTenn., Oct. 18, 2018; and J.

I’m\nKaren Mracek, your host for this podcast. With me today is St. Louis Fed President Jim\nBullard, and we will be discussing nominal GDP targeting. President Bullard, thank you for\nbeing here.\nJames Bullard: Thanks for having me.\nMracek: Before we jump into speci�cs of nominal GDP targeting, can you tell us a bit about\nhow the Fed maintains price stability now, and why we are talking today about a different\napproach?\n\n\fBullard: My view of this is that, beginning in the 1990s, there was a coming together of the\nacademic literature and practitioners in central banking around the concept of in�ation\ntargeting, which, roughly speaking, meant that central banks named an in�ation target and\nconducted monetary policy in such a way as to hit that in�ation target over the medium\nterm. And this is commonplace today, but at the time was a big shift compared to the ’70s\nand ’80s where there weren’t any in�ation targets, and it wasn’t at all clear, relatively\nspeaking, what the various central banks were doing.\nI have to say, in the big picture, that in�ation targeting has been crazy successful. In�ation\nhas been much lower and much closer to these in�ation targets across the countries that\nadopted them. In�ation’s been much less variable than it was in the ’70s and ’80s. The\nin�ation expectations in these various countries have become much less volatile and much\nmore clustered around the in�ation targets. So, in�ation targeting has been a great success\nstory, and the question now would be, can you improve on that?\nMracek: Can you explain, then, what nominal GDP targeting is, and how is it different from\nin�ation targeting?\nBullard: In in�ation targeting, we would name the in�ation target, but if we missed the\nin�ation target, either on the high side or the low side, you wouldn’t be too worried about it.\nYou’d say, “Well, OK, we’ll try to hit it again next year or over the medium term, and we\nwon’t worry about the fact that we’ve missed it this year or maybe several years in a row.”\nWith price-level targeting or its close cousin nominal income targeting, you would worry\nabout past misses, and you would try to make up for past misses in such a way that you\nwould stay on a path for the price level or a path for nominal GDP, depending on which route\nyou went. But they’re closely related.\nSo the main difference is that private-sector investors would understand that you were\ngoing to make up for past losses, and they would understand that if you missed to the low\nside in the past, this would mean that future policy would likely miss to the high side for a\nlittle while. And, vice versa, if you missed on the high side for a while, then you would\nprobably miss on the low side in the future for a little while.\nAnd, in so doing, at least in theory, this would further cement in�ation expectations—even\nmore than they’ve already been controlled by the in�ation targeting regime that’s been in\nplace the last 25 years. You would further pin down in�ation expectations, and therefore,\nget even better monetary policy than what we’ve had over that period of time.\nMracek: To clarify, when you talk about nominal GDP targeting, are you referring to\ntargeting the level of GDP or the growth rate?\nBullard: At least in the simplest examples, it would be the level of nominal GDP. You’d have\n\n\fa projected path for that level, and you would be right on that path all the time, every year. I\nmean, practically speaking, that’s not what would happen, but ideally that’s what would\nhappen.\nMracek: How would nominal GDP targeting work in theory?\nBullard: I do have this paper called “Optimal Monetary Policy Masses,” which is only one\nout of a sea of papers on this issue. In that paper, there are big private credit markets as\nthere are in the real world. But in the model, those credit markets don’t quite work the way\nthey should because all the trading takes place in nominal terms and it is non-state\ncontingent.\nAnd because of that, the monetary policy can follow this nominal GDP targeting rule, and\nthat �xes the problem that would otherwise exist in credit markets, and therefore gets a\nmore smoothly operating credit market than you would otherwise have.\nSo, this would be an improvement to the equilibrium of the economy and everyone in the\neconomy would be much happier than if you didn’t do this. And so that provides one\nrationale for nominal GDP targeting in a theoretical setting.\nThat’s just one possible way you could talk about this issue inside of a model, but I think it’s\nan interesting one.\nMracek: Can you give us an example of when the monetary policy response under nominal\nGDP targeting might be different from in�ation targeting?\nBullard: Yeah, even right now, when the Fed looks back on the in�ation outcomes since\n2012, we’ve generally missed to the low side of our in�ation target. And, as I was saying\nearlier, under in�ation targeting, that’s just treated as a bygone, and you don’t worry about\nthat, which means that the way the Fed is treating it right now is that, yes, we’ve missed in\nthe past, but we’re just going to promise to hit the target in the future, and then that will be\nthat.\nBut under nominal GDP targeting, you wouldn’t be satis�ed with that. You would say, “I want\nto make up for the fact that I missed to the low side over several years,” and therefore it’d be\nOK if you allowed in�ation to be higher for several years in order to have it average out over\na longer period of time to hit your 2% in�ation target.\nIn some ways, at a very simple level, there’s just more commitment to the idea that you’re\nactually going to hit the 2% target instead of saying that, “Well, we’ll try to hit it, but if we\nmiss it, then there’s no guarantee.”\nThis nominal income targeting idea would be a way to make sure that you hit the target over\n\n\flonger periods of time.\nMracek: What would be the advantages of using nominal GDP targeting?\nBullard: The biggest advantage is this idea that you would really cement in�ation\nexpectations around the target. This would give investors and �nancial market participants,\nhouseholds, businesses, the con�dence that the central bank really was going to deliver on\nwhat it said. It was going to deliver this 2% in�ation rate. They could use that in their\nplanning, and they could be reasonably con�dent that that was going to be the actual\noutcome in the economy over longer periods of time. This would help with getting the best\nallocation of real resources that we can get. So, that would be the principal advantage.\nI think the question about both nominal GDP targeting and price-level targeting is whether\nthe additional gains that you would get are going to be that big compared to what you\nalready are getting from in�ation targeting. I started this off by saying in�ation targeting\nhas been crazy successful, and I think that’s the right view of the last 25 years in the\ncountries that have adopted in�ation targeting. I said it’s been a way better experience than\nthe ’70s and ’80s where you had in�ation expectations bouncing all over the place and a lot\nmore volatility. You got both nominal volatility, but also more recessions and more frequent\nrecessions.\nMost of that has smoothed out, the �nancial crisis notwithstanding. We’ve managed to have\nmore moderation in real variables and nominal variables in the in�ation targeting era, even\nthough we had the big �nancial crisis. But that’s only one part of the last 25 years.\nMracek: And are there any disadvantages to nominal GDP targeting?\nBullard: Some people say it hasn’t been tried, and it would be hard to communicate. And I\nthink one way to convey that idea is that it really relies on private-sector expectations\nunderstanding the policy, and because they understand the policy, they expect in�ation to\nbe right around 2%. And because of that, you get good things to happen in the economy.\nIt’s the kind of thing where you might say, “OK, we switched to nominal GDP targeting.”\nNobody notices in the entire economy. No one pays any attention whatsoever, and you don’t\nget any of these effects at all. I think that would be the kind of thing that is very practical and\ncould possibly happen, because private-sector people might say, “Well, I don’t understand\nit,” or, “I don’t see what the difference is between this and in�ation targeting. It’s all too\nsubtle.”\nThe theories are relying on these things being really tight and really affecting these\nexpectations a lot. But the reality might be a lot more distant than that.\nMracek: One common criticism is that stag�ation is consistent with nominal GDP targeting.\n\n\fWhat is your thought on that?\nBullard: Stag�ation is a term from the ’70s when both unemployment and in�ation were\nhigh—at one point both in double-digit ranges in the early 1980s—and this came to be called\nstag�ation. It was considered a bad outcome.\nThere is an aspect of this with price-level targeting and nominal GDP targeting because\ngood times are the times when in�ation would run below target, and bad times are the\ntimes when in�ation would run above target. And that’s different than what we’re used to.\nBut when you think about it, bad times are times when you want the somewhat higher\nin�ation because that’s supposed to drive the real interest rate lower, and that is what is\nsupposed to get you out of the recession and help you during recessionary times. So it does\nhave a certain logic to it, even though we had this sour experience from the ’70s.\nI don’t think anybody’s talking about that kind of in�ation or that kind of volatility that we\nhad at that time. That’s not something you’d want. You’d want sort of mildly higher in�ation\nin bad times, and mildly softer in�ation during good times. So I think it’s more contained\nthan anything that happened during the ’70s, which was quite volatile.\nMracek: I think you touched on this, but have any central banks used nominal GDP\ntargeting?\nBullard: No, not to my knowledge. And one of the criticisms is that we barely got everybody\nconverted over to in�ation targeting, and now you’d be switching again. The U.S., in\nparticular, only named its in�ation target in 2012. Japan’s another country that didn’t come\naround to in�ation targeting until relatively recently.\nAnd so it’s not clear that you want to, then, make another change. Although I would say, if\nyou’re going to make a change, you should make it during good times, not try to improvise\nwhen it’s a very volatile area or high recession risk or something like that. If you wanted to\nmake the change during calm, successful times for the economy, that’s probably the time to\ndo it.\nI do think that one of the advantages of in�ation targeting was that smaller countries took it\non �rst and experimented with it, showed how it could be done, and then you had,\neventually, the founding of the ECB [European Central Bank] coming on in the late ’90s, and\nthen the Fed following through later. And so you kind of tested it out in other places before\nyou had the world’s leading economies adopting it.\nIf the U.S. moved �rst and went with price-level targeting or nominal GDP targeting, that\nwould be a different kettle of �sh, and that would be something that has to be thought about\ncarefully, I think. You’d be setting a trend in a global environment, and other countries\n\n\fwould likely follow.\nMracek: That make sense. Would the average consumer notice a difference if a central bank\nswitched from in�ation targeting to nominal GDP targeting?\nBullard: I don’t really think so. I think the person on the street would regard everything as\nbeing about the same. But again, this is really more about cementing expectations in\n�nancial markets and the way bond markets, in particular, would operate under this kind of\na regime as opposed to the one we’re using now. And so I don’t think a typical person would\nsee much difference.\nMracek: Theoretically, if the Fed were to adopt nominal GDP targeting, would it capture\nboth sides of the dual mandate—that is, stable prices and maximum sustainable\nemployment?\nBullard: It would, because—at least in theory, if this was the true optimal policy—this would\nmean you’d get the best allocation of resources, which would include labor resources so that\nlabor would be supplied exactly at the rate that households would desire. And this would be\nthe best employment outcomes that you could get for the economy. So it’s all supposed to\nwork at least on paper. Whether that actually works in the real world is certainly an area\nthat people like to debate.\nMracek: Got it. Is there anything else you want our listeners to know about this topic or how\nthe Fed thinks about maintaining price stability?\nBullard: Well, I think it’s under review in 2019, and it’s something the Fed will consider, I\nthink, as part of its review. I think it’s good to be thinking about possible innovation in\nmonetary policy frameworks as time goes on. Surely, the framework we’re using today will\nnot be the same one we’re using 50 years from now. And, in order to be able to evolve at the\nright moments, we have to have regular reviews and think about these issues. And I think\nthat’s the purpose of this framework review in 2019.\nMracek: Great.

Regarding normalization, he said, “The campaign has been largely\nsuccessful: Nominal short-term interest rates have been raised from near-zero levels, and\nthe size of the Fed’s balance sheet has been reduced as the economic expansion has\ncontinued.”\nWhile normalization has come to an end, the conduct of monetary policy has not, Bullard\npointed out. “The FOMC may elect to adjust monetary policy going forward, but any such\nadjustments would be in response to incoming macroeconomic data and not part of an\nongoing normalization strategy,” he said.\nBullard went on to discuss the macroeconomic challenges facing the FOMC during 2019,\nincluding weak feedback from labor markets to in�ation. He also noted that in�ation\nexpectations remain somewhat low and parts of the Treasury yield curve are inverted.\n“These market-based signals indicate that the FOMC needs to tread carefully going forward\nin order to sustain the economic expansion,” he added.\nBullard was on a two-day tour of Tupelo and Greenwood, Miss., and the surrounding\ncommunities. Besides meeting with business and civic leaders, Bullard also toured the\nToyota Motor Manufacturing Mississippi Inc. plant in Blue Springs and visited Staplcotn, the\noldest and one of the largest cotton marketing cooperatives in the U.S. On Thursday night,\nBullard also spoke before community and business leaders on the St. Louis Fed’s efforts to\npromote community development.\nBullard frequently visits communities in the four zones that make up the St. Louis Fed’s\nDistrict.
