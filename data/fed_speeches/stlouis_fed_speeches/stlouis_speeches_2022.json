He is also a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Prasad’s\n2021 book, The Future of Money: How the Digital Revolution Is Transforming Currencies and\nFinance, was the subject of his lecture.\nFull text of remarks:\nPrepared Welcoming Remarks\nJames Bullard\nPresident and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nThe 2022 Homer Jones Memorial Lecture\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nOct. 19, 2022\nAny opinions expressed here are my own and do not necessarily re�ect those of the Federal\nOpen Market Committee.\nWelcome to the 31st Homer Jones Memorial Lecture! It’s been more than two years since the\n30th lecture, which was held here at the Bank on March 4, 2020, very shortly before the onset of\nthe pandemic. Although the pandemic delayed the return of our annual lecture, we couldn’t be\nhappier to resume the lecture series now and to welcome our speaker and all of you to our\nauditorium this evening. So, thank you for coming and welcome back!\nIt’s great to see so many friends of the Bank with us this evening. I’d like to take just a moment to\nrecognize one of our friends—Professor Phil Dybvig from the Olin Business School at Washington\nUniversity in St. Louis. As I’m sure many of you know, Phil was recently awarded the Nobel Prize\nin economics, along with Ben Bernanke and Douglas Diamond, for their pioneering work on\n“Financial Intermediation and the Economy.” Phil and Diamond wrote one of the classic papers\n\n\fin economics, “Bank Runs, Deposit Insurance and Liquidity,” published in the Journal of Political\nEconomy in 1983. Phil has had a distinguished career and we’re glad that he is joining us this\nevening. Congratulations, Phil!\nThe Homer Jones Memorial Lecture honors the memory and institutional contributions of a\nformer St. Louis Fed research director. Homer Jones and his legacy are probably well known to\nthose of you with ties to the St. Louis Fed or who have attended these lectures in the past. But for\nthose who may be attending the lecture for the �rst time, it might be useful to provide a brief\nbackground on the professional life of Homer Jones.\nHomer Jones taught at Rutgers University in the early 1930s. Arthur Burns, who later chaired the\nFed’s Board of Governors in the 1970s, was also on the Rutgers faculty at that time. One of their\nstudents was a young man named Milton Friedman. Because of his interest in mathematics,\nMilton planned to become an actuary. However, Homer introduced Milton to the Chicago school\nof economics and made it possible for him to attend the University of Chicago for graduate\nstudies.1 To make a long story short, at the University of Chicago, Friedman helped found the\nimportant branch of monetary economics known as “monetarism” and eventually won the Nobel\nPrize in economics.\nIn an unusual twist, Homer Jones also matriculated to Chicago, where he completed his Ph.D.\nunder Friedman’s tutelage. Thus, Homer was both a teacher and student of Friedman!2 Homer\neventually joined the St. Louis Fed as its research director and was instrumental in starting the\nBank’s own monetarist tradition. It boggles the mind to think how much different monetary\neconomic history, let alone the monetarist legacy of the St. Louis Fed, would have been if Homer\nJones hadn’t succeeded in encouraging Milton Friedman to become an economist rather than an\nactuary!\nAs director of research, Homer Jones built the St. Louis Fed into the powerhouse of monetary\neconomics that it remains to this day. Homer had a two-pronged approach: Rigorous research\nusing economic and monetary data, and the public dissemination of that data. Jerry Jordan—who\nbegan his career at the St. Louis Fed under Homer and was later president of the Cleveland Fed—\nsaid that Homer’s philosophy was very much aligned with the Show Me State ethos of “prove it.”\nSaid Jordan: “His philosophy essentially was, if the people see it often enough, they’ll come to\nbelieve it whether they understand it or not.”3\nIn time, the St. Louis Fed’s research and many publications played no small role in the economic\nand policy debates of the 1960s and 1970s. To this day, the Bank remains strongly committed to\nmacroeconomic and monetary policy research and to disseminating economic data and\ninformation to the public. We’ve followed a formula started by Homer that has proved quite\nsuccessful. As one example, the Bank’s FRED and family web services garnered more than 20\nmillion visits last year. That’s nearly 55,000 visits a day!\nShortly after Homer Jones’ death, several of his colleagues, friends and academic acquaintances\n\n\fin the St. Louis community organized the �rst Homer Jones Memorial Lecture in 1987. The\nlecture has continued, in large part, because of the past support of many organizations and\npeople. These have included the St. Louis Gateway Chapter of the National Association for\nBusiness Economics, Saint Louis University, Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, the\nUniversity of Missouri-St. Louis, and Washington University in St. Louis. The St. Louis Fed has\ncontinued this tradition by hosting and sponsoring the lecture for many years now.\nThe annual renewal of this lecture is our attempt to honor the timeless contributions of Homer\nJones—while at the same time honoring those who speak with authority on the myriad\nchallenges confronting today’s economic policymakers.\nThis year’s speaker is Eswar S. Prasad. Dr. Prasad is the Tolani Senior Professor of Trade Policy\nand professor of economics at Cornell University. He is also a senior fellow at the Brookings\nInstitution, where he holds the New Century Chair in International Economics, and a research\nassociate at the National Bureau of Economic Research.\nDr. Prasad is the author of many professional journal articles and three books. His latest book,\npublished in 2021, is the subject of today’s talk: The Future of Money: How the Digital Revolution\nIs Transforming Currencies and Finance.\nAs most of you undoubtedly know, digital currencies—whether named Bitcoin, Ethereum or\nsomething else—have become prominent components of the �nancial landscape with increasing\nmainstream acceptance. Just recently, for example, the oldest bank in the United States, Bank of\nNew York Mellon, announced that it would begin offering digital asset custodial services. Some\ncentral banks have even issued—or contemplated—issuing a digital currency. So, in the best\nShow Me State spirit of Homer Jones, Dr. Prasad is going to tell us if digital currencies are hype,\nhope, or history-making.\nPlease join me in welcoming Dr. Prasad.\n1.

        "content": "Unofficial Transcript:\nSt. Louis Fed President and CEO James Bullard’s Remarks at Citi Macro Forum\nOct. 14, 2022\n\nyou.\n\nModerator: Thank you again. Much look forward to your introductory remarks, and over to\n\nJames Bullard: Okay. Thanks very much. It's a pleasure to be here today and great to see a lot\nof you in person again. So, let me just start out with some kind of level-setting comments about how I'm\nseeing the economy generally, the U.S. situation. Then I'll get to the global situation. Then I'll stop, and\nwe'll go with questions from there.\nSo, I think, first of all, if you're looking at the U.S. situation, as you guys have been all day, the\ntop issue is inflation, and I think it's just the, I think, markets and policymakers have been recognizing all\nthrough 2022 that the inflation problem is very serious in the U.S. and requires very forthright\naddressing by the central bank. And we are doing that. And I think we've made very good moves during\n2022 here to try to get to a place where we can mitigate inflation risk, push inflation back down to 2%.\nAnd the sooner we can get this job done, the better off we'll be both for the U.S. economy and for the\nglobal economy.\nSo, that has argued for frontloading effects. If you look at an impulse response function and\noptimal monetary policy, and you got some big shock like this, it would tell you, raise your policy\ninstrument quickly. And then the inflation will dissipate in the future, and you'll be able to get back to\nnormal. So, that's very much been in my mind about where we are with policy and what we're trying to\ndo.\nLet me talk about the inflation numbers a little bit. The news has been unremittingly bad, I\nwould say, even since spring. A lot of you and a lot of the policy community was predicting even in the\nfall of 2021 that inflation would be back to 2% by the spring of 2022. By the time we got into the spring\nof 2022, we were saying that inflation would be back to maybe not 2% but much lower by the end of\n2022. That's not happening. So, this has all gone in the wrong direction here. And I think it really\nvindicates our strategy that we really needed the risk management. We needed to prepare for this case.\nSo, I'm glad that we have. And we're in a much better position today to get inflation under better\ncontrol in 2023. And I am hopeful now that we're in good position to do that.\nThe story that inflation was due to lumber prices and that inflation was due to this special factor\nand that special factor has been blown out of the water. It's not. It's broad-based. Ideas that it was just\ndue to a supply shock of this type or that type has been blown out of the water. This is a serious inflation\nproblem, and it requires action by the central bank. That's what we're doing.\nNow, I actually think that we've benefitted dramatically here from transparency and forward\nguidance, which didn't exist the last time we had inflation this high in the United States in the Volcker\n1\n\n\fera. Volcker was very secretive. He moved behind the scenes. He surprised markets. He had to earn\ncredibility. He didn't have any credibility at all when he started because the United States had dithered\nall the way through the 1970s. But here, it's a different era, and I think once we got the FOMC on board\nto fight back against inflation, then we had a lot of forward guidance. Markets have moved ahead of the\nFed. I think that has helped us tremendously. And it's helped us move policy in the right direction and\nstart to get some mitigating pressure onto inflation even before we actually made any major moves. So,\nit was almost like we barely had to lift our pinky finger. And a lot of things had already happened in\nfinancial markets.\nSo, I think that's a benefit of transparency, and that's a benefit of forward guidance. But forward\nguidance also means that you have to follow through on the promises that you make earlier because if\nyou don't follow through then, you lose some credibility and the forward guidance isn't as effective in\nthe future. And I would give some credit to our former chair Ben Bernanke, who got a Nobel Prize just\nrecently, because Bernanke was the one that was all about really opening up the Fed, providing\ntransparency, and that providing forward guidance would be helpful in trying to do a difficult job.\nSo, I think that is helping us here. Now, we haven't followed through all the way. We're only at 3\nto 3¼% on the policy rate; that's too low for the current environment, so we've got a ways to go. But the\nmarket pricing is definitely anticipating more moves on our part. And I'll come back to that in a minute.\nOn the other part of our mandate, which is labor markets, these are some of the best labor\nmarkets the U.S. has seen since the late 1990s. Unemployment rate at 3.5% is hard to match in U.S.\nmacroeconomic history. Unemployment insurance claims, if you throw out the hurricane here, had been\ntracking below 2017, 2018, 2019 levels for this time of year. If you look at quits, still very high. Number\nof openings per unemployed worker, still at 1.7 times. I've had a hard time seeing, and maybe you guys\ncan convince me, but I've had a hard time seeing why unemployment would go up meaningfully in an\nenvironment where you had that many job openings. Even if your company goes out of business\ntomorrow, it seems like you'd have a lot of opportunity to go get another job, and certainly at the lower\nlevels of the income distribution, this seems to be true.\nSo, instead of having unemployment tick up further, it actually ticked down in the last report.\nWe're still creating jobs fast, much faster than the trend rate that you would expect, which is some\npeople would put at 100k per month or even 75k per month depending on who you talk to. We're still\nway above 200 in the last report. So, even though job growth has slowed, you still have a very, very\nstrong jobs market here.\nSo, I think, and the last comment on this would be if you want to take the indicators of labor\nmarket performance in totality, you can look at the Kansas City Fed's Labor Market Conditions Index.\nThat index is as high as it was in the late 1990s, often considered the best labor market in the whole\npostwar era of the U.S.\nSo, the argument is that, at least for now, labor markets are very, very strong in the U.S. And so,\nthis is giving us a lot of leeway and means that it's the right time to get this inflation problem under\ncontrol. There will be moments in the future where conditions aren't as ideal as they are today to try to\ncontrol an inflation problem. But right now, on our labor market mandate, we're doing very, very well.\nAnd so, I think this is the moment to try to crush inflation in 2023. And hopefully we'll put this episode\nbehind us here.\nLet's see, let me talk about GDP a little bit. So, GDP is negative in the U.S. in the first—GDP\ngrowth was negative in the first half of the year. I find this number not credible. The U.S. economy\n2\n\n\fadded 3.2 million jobs in the first half of the year. I think that will get revised but probably not out until\nthe benchmark revision years from now, so we won't be the beneficiaries of that revision. But I would\nbe willing to say that, okay, well, it was pretty slow growth in the first half of 2022. Some of that, I think,\nis because the transmission of monetary policy is more immediate than it might've been during the '50s\nand '60s and '70s when Friedman talked about long and variable lags.\nAnd so, now you're in a situation where the first half was slow or zero. Maybe the second half\nwill be somewhat faster than that. And then maybe 2023 will be somewhat faster than that, so I actually\nthink because now you'd be returning to trend, the trend pace of growth in the U.S. economy. So, we'll\nsee if that's what happens. I know you guys have other forecasts, recession forecasts. But I would never\nput a recession as a baseline because a recession is a special event that is usually caused by a heavy\nshock. And that's not predictable, so that wouldn't fit into most forecasting frameworks.\nI would say we're at higher risk of [recession] right now as we're trying to carry out this\ndisinflationary policy. And so, we are at risk. But still, something else would have to happen in the next\nlet's say 12 months to knock us off the baseline path and into the [recession] scenario. That could\nhappen. And probably these are higher than they would otherwise be. But it's not my base case if all\ngoes well.\nAnd, again, part of this is the strong labor market. Part of it is also households seem to still have\na lot of cushion of money saved up during the pandemic. The level of wealth to disposable income is still\nvery high despite the equity sell-off this year because house prices are way up and equities on the whole\nare way up over time here, even though they're down this year. So, I think those factors will keep\nconsumption relatively good and keep us in pretty good position here.\nIf you want to talk about recession, I think it's a better story to talk about a global recession or a\nglobal slow-growth scenario, which I think is very plausible. There, you have Europe to talk about with\nthe first major land war since World War II occupying a lot of the mind share. And you have China with\nits inexplicable COVID policy shutting down big parts of the Chinese economy or certainly slowing down\nbig parts of the Chinese economy. China has been a major contributor or maybe the major contributor\nto global growth, so if they're going to be a slower-growing economy, then it makes sense to just say,\nwell, the whole world is going to grow more slowly. And that will come back to hurt the U.S. So, I think\nit's a factor. But again, my base case for the U.S. would not be a recession at this point. Maybe I'll stop\nthere and see if this has jogged anybody's memory, because I think we'll have many questions to—\nModerator: We will have—I will have used them up [overlapping] to ask the first one. … Can I\nask you, you mentioned maybe shorter transmissions lags, then, in the past. But given the pace of hiking\nthe Fed that's carried out so far this year, how do you think about the tightening effects still to come and\nkind of the landing zone for policy to arrive at in this kind of environment? How restrictive are we\nalready? And how much more restrictive do we need to get?\nJames Bullard: When Friedman talked about long and variable lags, he was talking about money\ngrowth and the economy. So, first of all, it's a little bit different object. There was a later literature that\ntalked, did monetary policy in terms of the federal funds rate; that literature did seem to get these\nhump-shaped impulse responses maybe six months after a monetary policy surprise. In the models,\nthose are surprises. So, the question is, when are you going to date that surprise? Are you going to put it\nright here at the November meeting, where we're scheduled to do 75 basis points? Or are you going to\nsay, \"No, no. The surprise was really when Jay, at the hearing last year at this time, said, \"I think we can\nthrow away the term 'transitory,'\" because I think that was more or less the start of the wheels in\nmotion.\n3\n\n\fAnd a lot happened, I would say, also during the first quarter of 2022. I gave an interview to\nBloomberg one day, and I started talking about what Greenspan would do. And this was extremely,\ncame off extremely hawkish, that day anyway. But I think it was because both policymakers and the\nprivate sector had just not kind of internalized what was going to need to happen here and how much\ninflation was moving way beyond what we had forecast.\nSo, if that's when you think the shock was and you believe the literature, then the major effects\nwould only be six months after that, which would be right in the third quarter of 2022. So, I think we\nhave to be careful about exactly what we're saying about long and variable lags. So, a lot of people say,\n\"Well, the major effects won't occur now until late 2023 or the first half of 2024. We'll all have forgotten\nall this by the time we get to that point.\nSo, I do think there's a case to be made, that the transition, that the financial markets are very\ndifferent than they were in the '70s, that transmission is much faster and occurs much more through\nfinancial markets than it would have. Firms react really, certainly on a weekly or a monthly basis, even\non a daily basis. I think they're far more agile than they would've been in that era.\nAnd so, I think the case that you're talking 12 to 18 months for people to get used to 100 basis\npoints higher on the policy rate is a tough case to make these days. And also, this literature has had a\ntough time because it's hard to carry out the same kind of analysis during the period of the zero lower\nbound. And that was a very long period, and it took up the whole decade. So, where exactly are we with\nthe empirical evidence on long and variable lags? I don't know, but I think there's a case to be made that\nthey're much shorter than they used to be and that we're getting a lot of the impacts probably now in\n2022. And it certainly shows up as GDP, looks like a zero-growth year on the whole if you take the data\nliterally. And so, there's a case to be made, and I think that it's having the impact now.\nInflation would be more persistent and especially something like Dallas Fed Trimmed Mean or\ncore PCE inflation would be slower-moving, more persistent, takes longer to come down. But I think it\nhas peaked. Or I wouldn't say \"peaked,\" but stopped increasing. And then, hopefully we'll get this\ndisinflationary process going during 2023. And that'll be a great dynamic, I think, if we can get that going\nand get this disinflationary process going very soon. The data isn't really cooperating, but hopefully it\nwill cooperate very soon.\nModerator: Thank you.\nAudience: Thank you, Jim. First, congratulations on having championing the front-loading of the\nhiking cycle argument, which I think it was the right thing to do. On the two questions, one, you\nmentioned that you don't see a recession in your baseline, but also you mentioned that you were always\ntold crash inflation. So, how do the two go together? I mean, I understand for official sector, it's hard to\nput in forecast the recession. But don't you need to see a higher end on the rate, sufficiently higher to\nput inflation down.\nAnd the second question is more about the policy half. From your own perspective, what do you\nneed to see to slow the pace of the hiking cycle and then eventually to pause?\nJames Bullard: On the unemployment, the SEP does have unemployment rising into the mid 4%\nrange. However, my interpretation of that would be that that would be a return to mean. 3.5% is surely\nnot the most common unemployment rate we've observed in the U.S. over time, and it wouldn't be\nunusual for the employment rate to go up from here. You don't have to get a Nobel Prize to say, \"Well,\nprobably unemployment won't go down from here, it'll probably go up from here.\"\n4\n\n\fBut even if we're in the mid-4% range, that would still be a strong labor market. So, I think that's\na sense in which we have a lot of room to maneuver here on the inflation side and get inflation down.\nAnd we'll all be happier if we can do this during 2023. Now, as far as how the disinflationary process\nwork, I've been mystified at the discussion around this, that it emphasizes labor markets so much\nbecause we just spent a decade saying that the Phillips curve is extremely flat. And so, therefore, you\nwouldn't get much disinflationary pressure coming from that channel, at least according to the flat\nPhillips curves. And even the ones that aren't quite as flat, there isn't very much there as far the\ncorrelation between labor market action and inflation, at least price inflation.\nSo, I think the way the disinflationary process is going to work is very different. It's going to\ncome through product markets instead and the price-setters in the economy. And my interpretation of\nthe 1980s disinflation is that firms had the fear of God in them that if they raised prices too rapidly, they\nwould lose market share. And if that happens, market share leaves permanently; and the company\neither loses business permanently or just goes out of business altogether.\nSo, when you think of the Walmart phenomenon in the '80s, especially where they really grew\nrapidly, they were the low-cost provider, they hustled, they were more productive, they were better at\nlogistics, and they put all these other guys out of business; the other guys just wanted to raise prices. So,\nI think that's what will happen this time. But we need to see that dynamic get started.\nModerator: [unintelligible]. And, please, one—\nJames Bullard: You had something else, though.\nAudience: Yes. On the path for policy from here on, will you need to go slow and then\neventually pause?\nJames Bullard: I have a good answer. At the Stanford Conference in May—called something like\n\"Why is the Fed Behind the Curve?\" which shows you the mentality of the conference—I gave a\ncalculation about if you used the Taylor Rule and you made all the most generous assumptions that you\ncould possibly make—generous to us, the central bank—what would be the minimal level of the policy\nrate you'd have to be at, given the inflation situation in the U.S.?\nAnd if you want to go check it out, it's on my webpage. The answer was 3.5%. And that's what I\nstarted saying during the spring of 2022. However, there's been bad news since then on inflation. And\nthat number has moved up to 4.5 or maybe 4.75. But this gives you some idea that that calculation says,\nwell, suppose you take the real short-term global interest rate. The most generous assumption you\ncould make is maybe minus half a percent on that, and you take the inflation gap, the most generous\nthing that you can say is, \"I'll take Dallas Fed Trimmed Mean minus 2%.\" That'd give you kind of the\nsmallest inflation gap that the central bank would have to actually act upon and be active in reducing.\nYou put a coefficient on the inflation gap of 1.25, which is smaller than most people would use,\nyou still get something in the 4% range now for what the central bank has to do. So, I think this is a way\nto think about it, about why we need to be up where we were talking about going at a minimum. And\nthen from there, you'd have to assess the data and see how the data comes in or whether it's reacting\nor whatever.\nSo, I don't think we're really in danger of doing too little based on that kind of calculation. I'm\nsorry, we're not in danger of doing too much based on that kind of calculation. We're sort of at risk of\n5\n\n\fnot getting up to this minimum level. But the committee has really got religion here. And so, we're\nmoving very quickly.\nI've been pleased that we've been able to do the 75-basis-point moves. That's just helped\ntremendously, I think. And we've really been able to do that. I know there's a lot of repricing. You've got\ntens of trillions of dollars of assets. And they all change prices because of this. But I think we've\nmanaged to do this in a transparent enough way that we've been able to get through most of 2022,\nhere, without undue international turmoil. And on that issue, I would say this: The St. Louis Fed has a\nFinancial Stress Index. It does a good job of tracking financial stress. It was very high in 2008. It was very\nhigh again, almost the same level, in March and April of 2020. Today, it's far below average. So, it just\ndoesn't look like either of those moments right now as far as financial stress. So, I'll stop.\nModerator: Thank you. Gentlemen, one question.\n[Audience question unintelligible]\nJames Bullard: Well, I hope we're not replaying Volcker, even though we're talking about\nVolcker a lot. So, I think Volcker did not have credibility when he started. So, this is the biggest factor\nthat has to be considered here. And when I say it didn't have credibility, there was no such thing as\ninflation targets. There was no such thing really even as agreement that central banks were responsible\nfor inflation.\nI've often told the story that when I went into my undergraduate institution, there was a big\nposter on the wall, really big poster, and it said, \"What causes inflation?\" in the middle. And then, there\nwere all these theories in little bubbles around the side. But central banks weren't there; it was unions,\nor it was deficits, or all these other things. So, you didn't have the intellectual agreement that you have\ntoday. And you didn't have the inflation target that you have today. And you didn't have the experience\nthat you have today of 25 years of actually having low inflation.\nSo, all those things are helping us tremendously today compared to Volcker. Volcker was in a\nsense, hacking through a jungle at that time that we don't have to hack through. So, when we're raising\nrates today, everyone says, people say a lot of things, and there's a lot of things going on, but they say,\n\"Oh yeah, they've got to do that because you've got to get inflation down.\" And it would be better if we\ngot inflation down.\nSo, I think there's more, far more acceptance of what we're doing. And I think that gives us a\nmuch better shot at a soft landing than Volcker had. One of the things that happened with Volcker, if\nyou read about the era, is that he increased the discount rate early in his term. And it was 50 basis\npoints, as I recall. And nothing happened. No one in markets paid any attention at all. Nothing\nhappened. So, it's like he didn't exist.\nSo, it was after that that he said, \"We're going to have to switch to the monetarist experiment.\"\nAnd he had the Saturday night meeting where they dropped interest rate targeting and started doing\nreserves targeting. But this shows you how much they had to do and how much they had to shake up.\nHe was looking for something that would shake up the system and allow interest rates to go much\nhigher.\nAnd so, it's just a much different situation. Here, Powell barely says anything. He says, \"I think\nwe have to retire the word 'transitory.'\" That's enough to make a lot of movement. So, I think it's\n6\n\n\fdifferent from that perspective. And I think that's giving us a much bigger chance of success than Volcker\nhad. He was the one that had to earn all this credibility. But we have it, and we can use it.\nAudience: Simple question, but maybe not so easy. The interest rate transmission channel that\nyou envisage in your mind when you think about raising rates so much, which one is it? Because if it’s\nnot so much leverage anymore and U.S. economy is quite healthy that way, are you trying to eliminate\nall the savings or cause so much fear that consumers will just keep their savings? And where's the\ntransmission channel [unintelligible]?\nJames Bullard: So, I think one way to think about the, well, it's mostly inflation expectations, so\none way to think about why we ended up with so much inflation is to think about a war scenario: World\nWar I, World War II, and the pandemic is kind of World War III. And we know by looking at historical\nexperience across many times and places that wars are associated with inflation, both for the winning\nside and the losing side. And why is that?\nWell, what happens during the war is that there's a social crisis. There's a lot of government\nborrowing without too many questions about how you're going to pay for this in the future because\nyou're in the middle of a crisis. The central bank is requested to help with the war effort and keep\ninflation or keep interest rate very low. This is a recipe for inflation. And so, what was the pandemic? It\nwas exactly that, both in the U.S. and around the world. And no, it wasn't like a world war, but kind of\nwas, against the virus.\nAnd so, you got lots of government borrowing with low interest rates accompanying that\nborrowing. And so, too much, and this led to some inflation overhang after we're all done. Now, how do\nyou get rid of that inflation? Well, you switch back to the pre-pandemic policy or the pre-war policy,\nwhich is you don’t borrow so much on the fiscal side without the future taxes there, and you get the\nmonetary policy guys to get on the ball and start moving the policy rate to the appropriate level for that\nsituation.\nI think both those things are happening in the U.S. Cook Political Report tells me there'll be\ndivided government in the U.S. very soon. That doesn't sound like very much fiscal actions coming from\nthat angle. And the central bank is absolutely convincing; I think, that we're intent on moving the policy\nrate to the right level to get inflation under control. So, what is this going to do?\nThis means that inflation expectations are staying low, and TIPS-based inflation expectations are\nlooking pretty good. I suppose they're up after the inflation report here. But basically, they're in the two\nrange as opposed to being in the five range, where they could be if our policy wasn't so credible. So,\nthat's looking pretty good. And it looks like we're making progress on expeditiously moving to a\nreasonable level of the policy rate. Hopefully, we'll get there very soon. So, I think we have every chance\nof success here. But, man, you're in the middle of the war. You don't know what's going to come around\nthe corner here.\nAudience: I think there's a question back there. Yes.\nAudience: A question around rental inflation. So, my impression is rent inflation makes\n[unintelligible] part of the core inflation that he's looking at. And it's driven by historically lower\nvacancies, and at hikes, probably exacerbated by [unintelligible] on it, slowing down. The housing\nconstruction, I guess they're saying that's what happened. So, in the short term, rents will probably keep\ngoing up. Is there something you [unintelligible]. Or are you willing to go through with the rent inflation?\n7\n\n\fJames Bullard: Yeah. Rent inflation is very serious in the U.S. It has been very hot. There are a\ncouple of things happening. One is that the increase in the policy rate has driven up mortgage interest\nrates very quickly. And house prices in the U.S. did not decline during the pandemic, but instead\nboomed during the pandemic. So, what has happened is the affordability for a median house by a\nmedian family has declined dramatically. And I think a lot of this is sticker shock. Somebody that was in\nthe market to build a house or buy a house now realizes that they can only afford a limited amount of\nsquare footage compared to what they could previously get.\nSo, that's all doable. They could adjust their expectations about that. But it's hard to do that in a\nshort time period. Those people are dropping out of the market and are going to rentals. And that's\nputting extra pressure on the rental market compared to what it otherwise would've been. Overall,\nthere hasn't been that much housing supply either. And so, a lot of people think that total housing\nsupply in the U.S. is too low. It takes a long time to fix that.\nSo, I do think that the rental inflation is going to be persistent as one of the components that\nsuggests that inflation is not being driven just by special factors. It's widespread and going to be\npersistent. And that's why we're going to have to be higher for longer in order to help get inflation\ndown.\nModerator: Just to follow up on that quickly, isn't that also suggesting that you will see the\neffects of your current policy on rental inflation, just much later?\nJames Bullard: Yes. But we're aware of this. So, a lot of people are saying, \"Well, you're going to\nbe too slow because it's going to be a whole year before this goes away,\" even though new rentals are\nactually tailing off or coming down. But we'll take all of that into account.\nAudience: First of all, thank you again for your prescient comments you've made over the past\nmonths. My question is really about the intersection between how you're thinking of the new steady\nstate now that we have some of the shock, and I call it the shock, sort of coming out of the numbers;\nhow are you thinking about NAIRU or a neutral level of rates? Your records saying, for instance, that the\nparticipation, you reckon, was structurally lower early on, which is something that we're seeing\ncontinuously.\nAnd as a result of that, from a cyclical perspective, I'm not sure I understand, and it follows the\nprevious question, how come you have such a low sacrifice ratio to get inflation down? I mean, the way I\nkind of square the SEP is thinking that, as a committee, you have a pretty bullish view on the supply side\nof the economy and you mentioned the goods market.\nBut how do we know that? I mean, there is it's a very holistic structure here in the U.S. And can\nyou really rely so much on supply doing some of the job for you? So, I think it ultimately goes back to the\nproblem of credibility. I think a lot of us are trying to understand that, in fact, when push comes to\nshove, we'll be prepared to go for a recession, because now you face no dilemma, as you said yourself.\nThank you.\nJames Bullard: Yeah. Well, the chair said if it comes to that, that we'll go ahead. And I think we\nwill. But I'm saying we have more cushion probably than we would otherwise have. So, slowing down\nthe jobs market in this situation … suppose unemployment was 5½% today, and then we were doing\neverything that we're doing, and you're talking about, \"Well, maybe it'll go to 7½%.\" Well, that really\nwould be a recessionary scenario and that is the kind of thing that we talked about and dealt with in the\n'80s and '90s.\n8\n\n\fBut now, you're looking at unemployment at 3½%. You have some cushion here. You can go up\nsome ways, which would reduce pressures coming from the labor market. But you're starting from such\na low unemployment rate, that you'd still have a pretty strong labor market even if it went up some.\nNow, one thing people say about this, which is very true, which is that when unemployment\ngoes up, it really goes up a lot. And that, I think, comes back to the idea that most of the time,\nrecessions are really some shock hits the economy. It's got to be some special—I've given the analogy\nthat, okay, what we're doing here is we're going to walk the tightrope between two tall buildings and\nwe're going to balance with our stick here. You don't want a big gust of wind to come up just as you're\ndoing this. So, that's what I think we're doing. But the base case would be, no, we're going to be able to\nwalk across it. It's going to be fine. But if it's too windy, you might get knocked off.\nAudience: It's not easy even as a general proposition to walk on a tightrope.\nJames Bullard: No, it is not. But hopefully we've got enough practice.\nAudience: We're all pulling for you.\nModerator: [overlapping].\nAudience: And there's another one behind you as well.\nModerator: Okay. So, one, two and [unintelligible].\nAudience: So, I wanted to get your thoughts on strategy because at some point, a downshift\nand a pause may be inevitable. Maybe they'll be influencing one another. Maybe they won't be. And it\nseems over the last three meetings or so that if there's been data surprises, that the reaction function\nthe market has is to immediately price another 75 basis point. So, given that the terminal rate,\nconditional on the data that we've had since the last meeting and since the spring really has just defined\na higher terminal rate, what's the path or what's the strategy that you see from going from 75 to the\nhigher terminal rate?\nJames Bullard: For me, if you take this minimal Taylor rule calculation and, like I said, in the\nspring, it was three and a half, but now it's gone up because inflation has gone up, so it's kind of a little\nbit of a moving target in terms of what you're calling the terminal rate. And obviously, we were starting\nfrom such a low level, close to zero. So, I would love the 75-basis-point policy because it enables us to\nget to the correct level much faster and have a much bigger chance of success in this whole process.\nBut yeah, once you get to some minimum level, then you can become data dependent at that\npoint. And I would say there's a phase some people in the policy world or financial markets would call it\na catch-up phase. I don't know if I quite want to call it that. But there'd be this phase where, okay, we're\nat zero. We shouldn't be at zero. We should be somewhere way up here. So, we're doing that phase\nright now. And we have to follow through at the coming meetings. But it won't take long. And it's 75\nbasis points, where you'll get to something where you can say, \"Okay, this, I can say with a straight face,\nI think I'm putting meaningful downward pressure on inflation with this policy.\"\nAnd then, at that point, it becomes ordinary monetary policy. Now it's like, \"Okay, what kind of\nshocks are coming in? How's the data coming in? Are we doing enough? Are we not or doing too much?\"\nYou can make adjustments at that point and I don't think we're that far or at least according to the SEP, I\ndon't think we're that far from that, but we're not there yet. We're only at 3.13 sitting here today. So,\n9\n\n\fyou'd have to move, you'd have to move again, maybe first quarter, depending on how the data are\ncoming in at that point. But you will get this transition phase into something that's more like what I\nwould call an ordinary monetary policy phase. Doesn't mean we wouldn't raise rates further at that\npoint, but we'd raise them further based on data. You'd be out of this first phase, where you really\nneeded to get up to something more credible.\nAudience: Okay. And the Fed has adopted average inflation targeting in 2020. Does that mean\nthat the Fed has to keep the rates higher for longer [unintelligible]?\nJames Bullard: Flexible average inflation targeting, this was something that was in the works\nduring 2019. We were supposed to finish the process in January of 2020. That timeline got delayed.\nThen we got a huge shock, so we didn't end up doing that until Jay Powell's speech at Jackson Hole in\n2020. I think that's unfortunate. I really wish we would've been able to get that done before we got into\nthis pandemic shock.\nBut the spirit of that was to talk about the experience of the previous 10 years, where inflation\nwas below target all the time, and to recognize that the period of the zero lower bound or the effective\nlower bound was a period that also pulled down inflation from the target relative to what it otherwise\nwould've been. So, the question is how can you conduct monetary policy when you're stuck at the\neffective lower bound in such a way that you hit your 2% inflation target? And so, it has a lot of things in\nthere about how that would work.\nBut the spirit of it was this is meant to talk about the effective lower bound and the effects of\ninflation when you're at the effective lower bound. Everyone said all the way through, \"Well, if inflation\ngets high, we know what to do because see Volcker.\" So, I would draw two branches. I would say the\nfirst branch would be you get into a very low inflation, low interest rate environment, see flexible\naverage inflation targeting. If you're in a high inflation environment, forget about flexible average\ninflation targeting; see Volcker. That's what I told.\nModerator: We have 10 minutes left.\nAudience: Just wanted to touch on the point, so the steady state, right, when somebody's\nalready asked about the steady state, so even though it's a very bad price on labor productivity now for\nthe last few quarters, what's your view about sort of the steady state labor productivity and how that\nimpact therefore union labor costs and therefore how much slack you might need to generate in the\nlabor market in order to get the wage brought down to a level consistent with the inflation target? Once\nyou take productivity into account, what's your thinking of it?\nJames Bullard: Let me be clear if I haven't been clear enough that I don't think wage price spiral\nis a good way to think about inflation. It's true that nominal wages and prices will move up in tandem in\na high inflation economy. But that's not the cause of inflation. So, if you look at Turkey today, Turkish\ninflation is 83%. Sure, prices are moving up very rapidly. Nominal wages have to move up just as rapidly\nor roughly speaking in order to keep up with that. But that isn't the cause of the 83% inflation in Turkey:\nIt's crappy central bank policy. That's what's causing that.\nAnd so, I hate to blame the people that are going across the street and trying to get a better\nmatch or a little bit higher wage or something. I don't want to blame them for the inflation because I\ndon't think that's where this is coming from. And I think this disinflationary process that you get going\ncomes from the business product side where you've got fear of God of losing market share in a price10\n\n\fsetter's heads and because of that, they are very reluctant to raise their prices any more than the next\nguy is raising their prices. And then that leads to ratcheting down.\nBut this is very dependent on business expectations of prices and what they think they can get\naway with. And that's why I think the expectations are so important and the credibility of the central\nbank is so important that'll get you back to 2% inflation in a relatively benign way. So, I got a little off\ntrack. Sorry. But you wanted to focus on—\nAudience: Yeah. So, the steady state combination of labor productivity [overlapping]—\nJames Bullard: Oh, labor productivity, yeah.\nAudience: ... that is [unintelligible] and therefore [overlapping].\nJames Bullard: On labor productivity, we do have a regime-switching model. This, we're clearly\nstill in the low productivity growth regime. The readings for the first half of this year on labor\nproductivity were terrible, but I do think that will get revised at some benchmark revision in the future,\nand it won't be quite as bad as it looks. There are some stories around about why it's so low. You've got\nthis scramble for workers, so firms have to train the workers all the time, and they're spending—And\nyou do hear that anecdotally. I hear that anecdotally around the Eighth District and around the country\nthat you have to spend so much time training people and everything, that this was taking away from\nother time that you would normally be spending. And your worker isn't that productive for a while. And\nthen they might leave and go across the street.\nSo, I think those factors lead to ideas about labor hoarding. You probably don't want to lose any\nworkers in this environment if you don't have to, even if you think they're not the greatest worker. So,\nthat's probably hurting productivity as well. On the flip side of this, I am very hopeful that some of the\ntechnology that we used and played around with during the pandemic would diffuse more and we'd get\nmore productivity gains out of that. But we're going to have to see if that materializes or not.\nModerator: And then after, we probably have time for one more question.\nAudience: Given the two monetary policy tools that you use today from loading hikes and QT,\nand given the illiquidity and volatility that we're seeing in credit markets, what are you going to be\nrepeating, one of the two? How do you find out for yourself?\nJames Bullard: I was also very pleased that we were able to pull up the balance sheet reduction.\nIt started it in the second quarter of 2022, and it's now going at full strength. However, I think we've also\nsucceeded in focusing our own attention and everyone else's attention on the policy rate as the main\ntool of monetary policy. But being a hawk on the committee, I wanted also that the quantitative\ntightening would be going on. And it's not very clear. The literature's all over the map about how much\neffect this has. But if you think that the quantitative easing was lowering rates on the margin at the\nlonger term, longer maturities, then we didn't want to be putting upward pressure on the longer\nmaturities as we were raising the policy rate.\nSo, I'm pleased that we're doing that. Exactly how big that is or how much effect that's having is\na good question. But I do think it's wind in our sales as we're trying to get inflation down. I do think that I\nwant to simply observe how this process works until the first half of 2023 or maybe all of 2023. And then\nwe'll sort of evaluate at this point. But I think, for now, we can let this run and focus on the policy rate as\nthe main tool of policy.\n11\n\n\fOne other thing about balance sheet, a lot of theories about the balance sheet, and some that I\nhave talked about are that it's more about signaling future changes in the policy rate than it is actual\neffects from the balance sheet. Now, you guys, I know some of you might disagree with that. But if you\nthink of it that way, then when you're at the zero bound, the quantitative easing has a big effect\nbecause you're signaling that you're going to stay lower for longer.\nBut now you've come off of the zero bound, and you can signal directly by doing stuff with the\npolicy rate so you don't get as much signal value out of this as you would've had previously. But still, I\nthink it's good to be moving in the hawkish direction on the balance sheet. And we've got plenty of\nroom, I think, to maneuver there.\nModerator: It'd be interesting to discuss it with the Bank of England. It's just open it for the last\nquestion.\nAudience: Just a question slightly related: How are you thinking about the tradeoff between\nfighting inflation and financial stability? Because we understand that you need to keep interest and the\ninterest rates to fight inflation. But markets have been dealing with a lot this year: liquidity, upgrade\nvolatility. The dollar is very strong. So, it feels like the probability of something breaking in the market is\nincreasing. So, in your view, what would be a credible strategy for the Fed to balance the two then? This\nis an unusual high-inflation environment. But something [unintelligible] in the markets. How do you\n[unintelligible] that?\nJames Bullard: So, I think if you look at the 1994 tightening cycle, you did have Orange County\nas kind of a famous case there. And then even in the late '90s, you had LTCM was a famous case there.\nSo, you will get some of this, I think. And frankly, I would've expected somewhat more of this already\nthan what we've seen. But overall, I would again cite the St. Louis Fed's Financial Stress Index, which is\nnot at a high, it's at a low. And so, according to that metric, it doesn't seem like there's that much\nfinancial stress out there. And I think that's partly because you've got all this transparency and all this\nforward guidance. So, it's not easy. You still have to reprice a lot of assets. And that makes you guys\nhave to work 18-hour days. But nevertheless, you can do it in sort of a orderly manner because you\nknow what's coming from the central bank. You're not getting as surprised as you would otherwise be.\nAnd so, you're not getting as much shock value, let's say, as you would've had.\nSo, I'm hopeful that this will carry us through, although we do track this very carefully. We have\na whole unit that tracks financial stability at the Board and reports to the FOMC on a regular basis. And\nwe do look for mispriced markets and ones that we think are subject to volatility.\nAnother thought on this is that what the higher interest rates have done is made the more\nspeculative assets fall out of favor. And in some ways, that's kind of the most gentle of repricing that you\ncan do. So, if you're doing something in Silicon Valley, and you're playing around with the technology,\nand the payoff is 10 years away, and you're uncertain about the payoff, that kind of bet is not looking as\ngood in the higher-interest-rate environment, so the valuation of that goes way down. So, that's kind of\na soft deflating of asset values and should be less disruptive than other types that we've seen.\nSo, I do think some of the stuff, some of the revaluation is going on there, where people can't\nafford to be as patient as they would've been with a startup company or with investments in speculative\ntechnology.\nModerator: And with that, let me thank you ever so much for your generous time and insights\n[overlapping].\n12\n\n\fJames Bullard: Thank you.\nModerator: Thanks, everybody else too.\n\n13\n\n\f"

        "content": "Home > Latest from President Bullard > Speeches, Presentations and Commentary\n\nFrom the President\n\nBullard Discusses Policy Rate Increases and U.S.\nIn�ation\nSeptember 29, 2022\nSt. Louis Fed President Jim Bullard discussed the pace of increases in the Fed’s policy rate\nand the impact on in�ation. He made the comments during a virtual discussion at an HSBC\nGlobal Emerging Markets Forum.\nBullard said the U.S. in�ation rate was way above the Federal Open Market Committee’s 2%\ntarget, which is why the FOMC has moved aggressively to raise its policy rate. He also\npointed to forecasts made by FOMC members in September’s Summary of Economic\nProjections that suggest additional moves in the policy rate this year.\n“We’re hopeful that by acting sooner and with transparency and with clear communication\nthat we’ll be able to get in�ation down now, as opposed to the 1970s where in�ation at these\nlevels lingered for 15 years or so,” he said.\nMarkets and policymakers are coming around to the view that in�ation will take a while to\ngo back to 2%, Bullard said, adding that in�ation probably won’t fall in a straight line. These\nfactors seem to indicate higher policy rates for longer than markets might have thought\neven a year ago, he said. Since labor markets remain strong, this is a good time to try to get\nin�ation under control, he noted.\nBullard was asked whether the Fed’s 2% in�ation target should be adjusted higher. The\nnotion of changing the target when the Fed is challenged by high in�ation sounds like a\nreplay of the 1970s, he said, adding that “this is just a totally bad idea.”\n“I know people are talking about that, but we'll maintain credibility of the in�ation target,\nwe will push in�ation to 2%, and we'll do it in a reasonably compact time frame,” he said.\nBullard noted the steady reduction in the Fed’s balance sheet, which started in the second\nquarter, is hitting full stride in September. He said his preference is to wait and see on the\nbalance sheet runoff to determine how things were developing.\n\n\fBullard emphasized that other central banks around the world are reducing their balance\nsheets as well and that he’ll be keeping an eye on how this global quantitative tightening\naffects global �nancial conditions.\nIn addition, Bullard said he believes that the rise in interest rates alone isn’t enough to\ncause a recession in the U.S., and that a recession instead would be caused by a shock. “I\nthink we're at higher recession risk, but I don't think that's the base case at this point,” he\nsaid.\n\n\f"

Held in-person and\nvirtually this year, the conference is sponsored by the Federal Reserve System, the Conference of State\nBank Supervisors (CSBS) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.\nBullard discussed some of the challenges and opportunities that community banks have faced since\nthe event’s inception. He recognized several conference features added in the past decade, while\nacknowledging the passing earlier this year of John Ryan, CSBS president and CEO and a founder of\nthe conference. Bullard also introduced a pre-recorded special video conference message delivered by\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.\n\nPrepared Introductory Remarks\nJames Bullard\nPresident and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nCommunity Banking Research Conference (Hybrid)\nFederal Reserve System, Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS) and Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corp. (FDIC)\nSept. 28, 2022\n\nAny opinions expressed here are my own and do not necessarily re�ect those of the Federal Open\nMarket Committee.\nGood morning and welcome to St. Louis for the 2022 Community Banking Research Conference. I’m\npleased to welcome you back into our building after presenting the conference virtually for the past\ntwo years. The pandemic gave us an opportunity to learn how to operate in a virtual environment and\nensure that all our participants can be fully engaged in these proceedings—whether you’re here in\nperson or joining us on Zoom.\nOn behalf of the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and\n\n\fthe Federal Reserve System, I welcome you all.\nThis year’s conference is particularly special, as it marks the 10th year of these proceedings. It began\nsomewhat humbly, but with ambition. The goal of the conference, as outlined then by Governor\nJerome Powell, now chair of the Board of Governors, was to “inform discussions among policymakers,\nto collect unique and innovative practices of successful community banks and to serve as a reference\npoint for future research conferences.”\nI think this conference has achieved that goal.\nIn my remarks at the 2014 conference, I noted a signi�cant increase in the number of paper\nsubmissions relative to the inaugural year and predicted continued expansion. While I am reluctant to\nmake predictions—as St. Louis native Yogi Berra once said, “It’s tough to make predictions, especially\nabout the future”—on this one I was right. We’ve seen a steady increase in submissions each year of\nthe conference.\nThe conference grew in other ways as well.\nThe organizers added several other important features over the past decade. To name a few:\n• Community bankers were added to each of the research panels to provide a practitioner’s\nperspective on the research presented.\n• An Emerging Scholars program was created to support Ph.D. students interested in community\nbanking-related topics.\n• CSBS developed an undergraduate case study competition to motivate interest in banking and\nbanking research among students.\n• Expert panels were assembled to address highly topical issues and offer ideas for future\nresearch—and starting last year, the FDIC started rebroadcasting these conference discussions\nthrough its popular “FDIC Podcast.”\nAdditionally, in the second year of the conference, CSBS developed a National Survey of Community\nBanks. The survey is administered by the state banking commissioners and has given us current\ninformation on the state of community banking.\nMiki Bowman, who is here with us today and is a longtime supporter of the conference, previously as\nKansas state bank commissioner and now as a member of the Board of Governors, described the\nsurvey as “a window into what community bankers are experiencing.” I agree. It serves as a backdrop\nfor the research presented and is valuable in its own right—�ndings have been cited over the years in\npolicy discussions conducted by, among others, the U.S. Government Accountability Of�ce and the\nEconomic Report of the President.\nThe challenges and opportunities faced by community bankers have also changed over the 10 years of\nthe conference. Initially, bankers were concerned about lingering impacts of the �nancial crisis and\nnew regulations responding to it under the Dodd-Frank Act. Later came the COVID crisis, which\ncommunity banks confronted as prominent providers of lifelines to small businesses through the\nPaycheck Protection Program. And now, banks face high in�ation and an uncertain economic outlook.\n\n\fBut other challenges and opportunities have persisted. The community banking industry continues to\nconsolidate. Bankers are �nding that regulatory costs, particularly those incurred by smaller banks,\nremain burdensome. Bankers face now, as they did a decade ago, technological advances and\ncompetition from nonbank providers of �nancial services.\nAt the inaugural conference in 2013, John Ryan called for “robust, honest, disciplined research and a\nwillingness to challenge our assumptions.” John was president and CEO of the Conference of State\nBank Supervisors until his untimely passing earlier this year. I believe this conference has met his\nchallenge, and I think he would be pleased with the agenda again this year.\nThroughout this year’s proceedings, we will hear from leaders in community banking, banking\nsupervision and academic research and from the conference sponsors, who will share their views on\nthe importance and signi�cance of this year’s event. Before we play a special conference message sent\nto us by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, I’d like to offer my own congratulations, to the\nconference organizers, to everyone on this year’s program and to all of you—here in St. Louis and\nvirtually—for sustaining this important conference for the past decade.\nI look forward to seeing what the next decade will bring.\n\n\f"

He spoke while participating virtually at a forum hosted by Barclays and the\nCentre for Economic Policy Research in London.\n“No matter how you look at it, we have a serious in�ation problem in the U.S., and we’re missing our\n(2%) in�ation target and the credibility of our in�ation targeting regime is at risk,” Bullard said. He\nadded that this level of in�ation hasn’t been experienced since the late 1970s and early 1980s, when\nPaul Volcker was chairman of the Fed.\nBullard said he recently recalculated the minimal level of the policy rate that could be argued was\nrestrictive monetary policy, and that rate was close to 4.5%, higher than he had calculated in May. He\nalso pointed out that at its last meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee moved up its projections\nof the needed policy rate level to more in the 4% range.\nGiven the level of in�ation, the policy rate will need to be high compared with rates over the last 15\nyears, Bullard said. “In addition, I think we’ll have to stay at that higher rate for some time to make\nsure that we’ve got the in�ation problem under control,” he said.\nBullard also noted that tighter monetary policy was in place sooner through market pricing than would\nbe apparent if one just looked at the policy rate itself and did not consider other aspects, including\nquantitative tightening. “This market pricing leading the Fed is a bene�t of the modern era of forward\nguidance and transparency and has helped us enormously, I think, so far during this episode,” Bullard\nsaid.\nSo strict comparisons with Volcker are inappropriate at this point, he added.\nModern central banks including the Fed have an explicit in�ation target of 2%, which is an\ninternational standard, Bullard said. That wasn’t the case in Volcker’s time, he noted. “So I think we've\ngot a better chance of success with less disruption to the economy than Volcker would have had,”\nBullard said.\nView video from the Barclays-CEPR International Monetary Policy Forum.\n\n\f"

He\nspoke before the Money Marketeers of New York University.\nCurrent in�ation in the U.S. and the euro area (EA) is near 1970s levels, Bullard said. The\ndisin�ation under former Fed Chair Paul Volcker was costly, he added, but it was not\ncredible initially—Volcker had to earn credibility.\nNobel laureate and economist Thomas Sargent initiated a literature on costless disin�ation\n(“soft landings”) that emphasized in�ation expectations as the key variable, not the Phillips\ncurve, Bullard noted. Subsequent literature illustrated how credibility might be earned in\nmodels that depart from rational expectations, he said.\n“The Fed and the ECB [European Central Bank] have considerable credibility compared\nwith their 1970s counterparts, suggesting that a soft landing is feasible in the U.S. and the\nEA if the post-pandemic regime shift is executed well,” Bullard concluded.\n\n\f"

Looking at the “hot” inflation report, he said that his\nreaction is that instead of trying to achieve a Fed policy rate of 3.5% by the year’s end,\nwhich has been his baseline for several months, “I would now say that we may have to try\nto hit 3.75 to 4% by the end of 2022.”\nInflation is staying “stubbornly high,” Bullard said later.\n“But we've got the right policy to bring it back to 2% in a relatively short timeframe, and I\nwould say something like 18 months,” he said.\n\n\f"

Last observation: May 2022.\n6\n\n\fWhat the Fed Has Done So Far\n\n7\n\n\fThe FOMC’s moves so far\n• Beginning in the second half of 2021, the Fed began to move in a more\n•\n•\n•\n\nhawkish direction to take better control of inflation risks.\nWith respect to the policy rate: The FOMC has increased the rate’s level\nat the last three meetings and is poised to make further increases at\ncoming meetings.\nWith respect to the balance sheet: The FOMC has ceased asset\npurchases and has begun to allow passive runoff, known in markets as\nquantitative tightening, or QT.\nForeign central banks are simultaneously increasing their policy rates\nand allowing their balance sheets to shrink.\n8\n\n\fApproaching global quantitative tightening\n\nSources: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, European Central Bank, Bank of Japan and author’s\ncalculations. Last observation: June 2022.\n9\n\n\fThe Pre-Pandemic Benchmark\n\n10\n\n\fThe pre-pandemic benchmark\n• Before the pandemic, at the end of 2019:\no The U.S. economy was growing at 2.6%, the headline PCE inflation rate\n\nwas 1.5%, and the unemployment rate was 3.6%.†\no The policy rate associated with these outcomes was 1.55%.‡\no Policy was not expected to change much going forward. Accordingly, the\n\n2-year Treasury yield was 1.61%.‡\no Longer-term rates were moderate, with the 10-year Treasury yield at 1.86%\n\nand the 30-year fixed rate mortgage at 3.96%.‡\n\n• This may provide a practical benchmark for where the constellation of\nrates may settle once inflation comes under control in the U.S.\n†\n‡\n\nReal GDP growth and inflation are Q4-over-Q4 values. Unemployment is the December 2019 value.\nInterest rates are monthly averages of daily data for December 2019.\n11\n\n\fMarket pricing based on Fed credibility\n\nSources: Optimal Blue and Department of the Treasury. Last observation: July 1, 2022.\n12\n\n\fMarket rates are above pre-pandemic benchmarks\n• The fact that market interest rates have moved above their pre-pandemic\n•\n\nbenchmarks while the policy rate has not can be read as an illustration of\nthe effect of credible forward guidance.\nThe Fed still has to follow through to ratify the forward guidance\npreviously given, but the effects on the economy and on inflation are\nalready taking hold.\n\n13\n\n\fLabor Markets Remain Robust\n\n14\n\n\fRobust labor markets\n• U.S. labor markets remain robust, according to recent data and anecdotal\n•\n•\n•\n\nreports.\nThe Kansas City Fed’s labor market conditions index, which aggregates\nvarious measures of labor market performance into a single metric,\nremains near highs last seen in 1999-2000.\nReal-time indicators of U.S. GDP growth suggest continued expansion\nin the quarters ahead.\nRisks remain substantial and stem from uncertainty around the RussiaUkraine war and the possibility of a sharp slowdown in China.\n\n15\n\n\fLabor market conditions: as good as in 1999-2000\n\nSource: Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.

Last observation: Week ending June 25, 2022.\n17\n\n\fBanks and Financial Stability\n\n18\n\n\fU.S. banks are strong and expected to remain so\n• The Fed’s 2022 stress tests concluded that the 33 largest U.S. banks\n\n•\n\ncould absorb significant losses in a “severely adverse” economic\nscenario and remain well-capitalized, able to continue lending to\nhouseholds and businesses.†\nRegional and community banks are also strong, according to a Fed\nreview of banking conditions.‡\n\n† See\n‡ See\n\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 2022 Federal Reserve Stress Test Results, June 2022.\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Supervision and Regulation Report, May 2022.\n19\n\n\fFinancial system vulnerabilities appear moderate\n• The Fed’s Financial Stability Report highlighted four areas of\npotential vulnerability:†\n1.\n\nAsset valuations: Moderate concern.\n\n2.\n\nLeverage in nonfinancial sectors: Low concern.\n\n3.\n\nLeverage in financial institutions: Low concern.\n\n4.\n\nFunding risks: Moderate concern.\n\n† Board\n\nof Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Financial Stability Report, May 2022.\n20\n\n\fNear-term risks to financial stability\n• In early 2022, New York Fed staff surveyed a broad range of contacts,\nwho expressed particular concern about these near-term risks to\nfinancial stability:†\no Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine.\no Elevated and persistent inflation.\no The possibility that stresses in China, including in the real estate sector,\n\ncould spill over to the U.S.\no The possibility that inflationary pressures and adverse external shocks could\n\nlead to stresses in other emerging market economies (EMEs) that could\naffect the U.S.\n† See\n\nSection 5 of Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Financial Stability Report, May 2022.\n21\n\n\fConclusion\n\n22\n\n\fConclusion\n• Inflation in the U.S. is far above target and is at levels last seen in the\n•\n•\n•\n\n1970s and early 1980s.\nThe Fed has raised the policy rate, promised to raise the policy rate\nfurther in the future, and begun passive balance sheet reduction.\nFed credibility along with forward guidance on these dimensions is\nhelping the Fed move policy more quickly to the degree necessary to\nkeep inflation under control.\nThe Fed recently reported stress test results indicating that the largest\nbanking institutions in the U.S. remain on solid financial footing.\n\n23\n\n\fConnect With Us\nVisit stlouisfed.org\nBrowse publications featuring\nexpert research and analysis\nDiscover free economic education\nresources for all learners\nFind community development tools\nthat support an economy for all\nExplore the Economy Museum online\nand see how to visit in person\n\nFollow @stlouisfed\non Twitter, Instagram,\nLinkedIn and more\nKeep up with\nPresident Jim Bullard’s\nlatest remarks\n\nGet timely economic\ndata from FRED®\n24\n\n\f"

Bullard’s remarks were pre-recorded.\nFull text of remarks:\n\nPrepared and Pre-recorded Introductory Remarks\nJames Bullard\nPresident and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\n2022 Federal Reserve Community Development Research Seminar Series\nToward an Inclusive Recovery: Achieving an Equitable and Inclusive Wealth Recovery\nJune 29, 2022\n\nAny opinions expressed here are my own and do not necessarily re�ect those of the Federal\nOpen Market Committee.\nGood afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. My name is Jim Bullard, and\nI’m the president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. It’s my pleasure and\nhonor to welcome you today to our research seminar on an inclusive wealth recovery. We\nare most pleased to partner with our excellent colleagues at the Boston Fed and the Board of\nGovernors in bringing you today’s seminar, the �rst of three in the 2022 series.\nI regret not being with you in real time for today’s seminar, but I am eager to hear what was\nlearned and how the St. Louis Fed can continue and deepen its commitment to economic\n\n\fequity.\nWhen we say a wealth recovery, we mean: How can households recover the savings and\nassets they may have lost during the pandemic, and how can they pay down the debts they\nmay have accumulated? While what a family earns is, of course, critical, without some\nwealth they lack economic resilience as well as the ability to make investments in their\nfuture.\nYet today’s seminar isn’t just about an inclusive wealth recovery; it’s also about wealth\nequity. That is, our goal shouldn’t simply be to restore the large and enduring wealth gaps\nthat existed prior to the pandemic, but to narrow those gaps by reducing barriers and\nadding more incentives for disadvantaged groups to build wealth. To illustrate, the St. Louis\nFed’s most recent data show that, on average, white families owned over $1 million more in\nwealth than Black and Hispanic families—a gap that’s grown since the onset of the\npandemic.\nAnd it’s not just narrowing gaps that matters but also raising the level of wealth among,\nespecially, women, less educated, younger and non-white Americans. For instance, Fed data\nshow that the median Black family owns about $23,000 in wealth compared with the\nmedian white wealth of $184,000. I ask all of you to imagine what you could do with\n$184,000 in wealth compared to $23,000—what it means for your economic resilience and\nfor your ability to buy a home, start a business, send your kids to college without debt,\nprepare for a secure retirement, or pass on some wealth to the next generation. Remember:\nWealth begets wealth. The challenge is to have some in the �rst place—a real challenge\ngiven that the bottom half of the population owns just 1% of the nation’s wealth, down from\n3% a generation ago.\nClearly, we’re far from reaching gender, educational, racial and generational economic\nequity—but it’s imperative that we try. Doing so will reap bene�ts not just for our families\nbut for the broader economy as well.\nWe have a fabulous lineup today. Our �rst panel will establish a fact base of wealth trends\nsince the onset of the pandemic, while the second will focus on evidence-based solutions.\nWe’ll close out today with remarks from my St. Louis Fed colleague Bill Rodgers, who heads\nup our Institute for Economic Equity, and the Boston Fed’s Prabal Chakrabarti, CAO\n[community affairs of�cer] and executive vice president. We’re also eager to engage all of\nyou in today’s discussion.\nThanks again for joining us.\n\n\f"

He went on to say that the Fed’s interest rate\nincreases will slow down the economy, but probably to more of a trend pace of growth as\nopposed to going below trend.\nHe later reiterated that front-loading policy rate increases is a good idea in this situation.\n“What you would like to do, if we can, is nip in�ation in the bud before it gets entrenched in\nthe economy, get in�ation back down toward 2% and converge to our long-run balanced\ngrowth path from the high side,” he said. He noted that headline PCE in�ation is 6.3%,\nsimilar to the 1970s median rate of 6.4%.\nBusiness in�ation expectations have gone up substantially, Bullard said. He said he thinks\npricing decisions on the business side, rather than from the labor market, is where the\ndisin�ation dynamic will get started and will continue, as businesses start to worry about\nlosing market share if they increase prices.\nWatch the discussion.\n\n\f"

Last observations: May 2022 and April 2022.\n4\n\n\fD ISINFLATION AHEAD\n\nRhetoric from the Fed and the ECB suggests disinflationary\nmonetary policy ahead.\nThe Fed is raising its policy rate sharply and allowing its balance\nsheet to decline, while the ECB looks set to pursue related\nactions.\nWith inflation near 1970s levels, will the Fed and the ECB be able\nto disinflate relatively easily and quickly, or will a substantial\nrecession occur as was the case of the Fed under Volcker?\nMany financial market observers and participants are arguing\nthat a substantial recession is likely.\n\n5\n\n\fI NCREDIBLE DISINFLATIONS\n\nThis talk reviews selected literature post-Volcker on credible\nversus incredible disinflations.\nThe Volcker disinflation was incredible: Initially, few believed\nthat the Fed was serious about reducing inflation after an entire\ndecade of allowing inflation to build.\nFor instance, see Lindsey, Orphanides and Rasche (StL Fed\nReview, 2005), Nelson (working paper, 2022), Goodfriend and\nKing (JME, 2005, “The Incredible Volcker Disinflation”), and\nSargent (Goodfriend conference volume, 2022, “Rational\nExpectations and Volcker’s Disinflation”).\n\n6\n\n\fC REDIBLE DISINFLATIONS\nThe post-Volcker literature turned to analyze credible\ndisinflations, inspired by Sargent (1982, “The Ends of Four Big\nInflations,” and 1981, “Stopping Moderate Inflations: The\nMethods of Poincaré and Thatcher”).\nAvailable in Sargent (2013), Rational Expectations and Inflation, 3rd\ned., Princeton University Press.\n\nThis literature explored the idea that credible disinflations do not\nhave large output costs.\nRather, because of rational expectations, they can be costless.\nThe apparent real-world “cost” only comes from having to “earn\ncredibility.”\n“If you have to cut off the tail of a dog, don’t do it one inch at a\ntime.”\n\n7\n\n\fL ESSON FOR THE COMING DISINFLATION\n\nThe current situation for the euro area and the U.S. seems to fall\nmore closely under the rubric of a “credible disinflation,” rather\nthan the “incredible disinflation” experienced by Volcker.\nSince modern central banks have more credibility than their\ncounterparts 50 years ago, it appears that both the Fed and the\nECB may be able to disinflate and achieve a relatively soft\nlanding.\n\n8\n\n\fPure Phillips Curve Disinflation\n\n9\n\n\fD ISINFLATION AND\n\nUNEMPLOYMENT\n\nLet’s suppose we begin with a pure Phillips curve analysis (not\nsomething I advocate).\nCurrent estimates for the U.S. point to an essentially flat Phillips\ncurve.\nFor instance, Stock and Watson (JMCB, 2020) report a slope of\n0.03 for both core and headline PCE inflation post-2000.\n\nStrictly speaking, using this mechanism alone would require\nunemployment to go to very high levels to get inflation to return\nto 2% in the U.S.\nWhile numbers could vary, this is the genesis of the idea that\nthere will have to be a large recession to get inflation under\ncontrol in the U.S.\nBut this is a mechanical calculation that says nothing about\ninflation expectations.\n\n10\n\n\fT HE ROLE OF EXPECTATIONS\nThe New Keynesian Phillips curve (NKPC) has two arguments,\nan output gap term as well as an inflation expectations term.\nThe NKPC has a coefficient near unity on the inflation\nexpectations component, which theoretically suggests that the\nrelationship between actual inflation and expected inflation\nshould be very close.\nThe following chart seems to confirm that this relationship holds\nin broad terms.\nThese considerations suggest that inflation expectations may\nplay a large role in the coming disinflation, as opposed to the\nsize of the output gap.\n\n11\n\n\fA CTUAL AND EXPECTED\n\nINFLATION\n\n6\n5-year breakeven inflation rate\nCore PCE inflation\n\n5\n4\n\nPercent\n\n3\n2\n1\n0\n-1\n-2\n2005\n\n2010\n\n2015\n\n2020\n\nSources: St. Louis Fed and BEA. Last observations: May 2022 and April 2022.\n\n12\n\n\fT HE ROLE OF EXPECTATIONS\n\nThe NKPC inflation expectations term is for near-term inflation\nexpectations—strictly speaking, one period ahead.\nWhen expectations are discussed in policy circles, the emphasis\nis often on longer-term inflation expectations and the notion that\nlonger-term expectations remain “well anchored.”\nNearer-term inflation expectations in the U.S. may be on the\nprecipice of becoming unmoored.\n\n13\n\n\fS URVEY- BASED\n\nINFLATION EXPECTATIONS MOVED\n\nHIGHER\n4\n1-yr U.S. CPI inflation SPF forecast\n1-yr euro area HICP inflation SPF forecast\n\nPercent\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n2019\n\n2020\n\n2021\n\n2022\n\nSources: Philadelphia Fed and ECB.

Last observation: June 7, 2022.\n15\n\n\fCostless Disinflations\n\n16\n\n\fS ARGENT ON THE IMPORTANCE OF EXPECTATIONS\nImportant arguments concerning the role of expectations were\ngoing on in macroeconomics during the early 1980s disinflation.\nSargent (1981, 1982) emphasized the role of expectations in a\ncredible disinflationary process: It is the credibility of the future\npolicy that causes substantial adjustment in inflation\nexpectations.\nIn “Methods of Poincaré and Thatcher,” he drew a contrast\nbetween the successful and rapid monetary-fiscal adjustment of\nPoincaré in France in 1926 and the then-proposed slow and\ngradualist approach of the monetarist Thatcher government in the\nU.K. circa 1980.\nIn “The Ends of Four Big Inflations,” he documented how ongoing\nhyperinflations came to sudden ends following credible\nmonetary-fiscal adjustments in post-WWI economies.\n\nSargent emphasized both monetary and fiscal adjustment.\n\n17\n\n\fF URTHER S ARGENT COMMENTARY\nGoodfriend and King (2005) stressed the idea that Volcker had to\ntake actions to earn credibility.\nIn recent comments on Goodfriend and King, Sargent (2022)\nnotes that there can be little concept of earning credibility under\nrational expectations.\nIn fact, the “communism” of the RE model—all actors forecast\nthe same way—makes it hard to attribute outcomes to particular\nplayers at all.\nThe subtext is that one has to back off of the rational expectations\nassumption to discuss how a policymaker could be earning\ncredibility.\n\n18\n\n\fL EARNING AND CREDIBILITY\nA literature subsequent to Sargent (1981, 1982) investigated\ncredible disinflations in models.\nCredibility: Ireland (JMCB, 1997), Goodfriend and King (2005),\nSargent (2022), Bonomo and Carvalho (JMCB, 2010), Walsh\n(working paper, 2022).\nLearning: Barnett and Ellison (JMCB, 2013), Cogley, Matthes and\nSbordone (JME, 2015), Nunes (MD, 2009), Schaling and\nHoeberichts (DE, 2010), Bomfim, Tetlow, Von zur Muehlen and\nWilliams (working paper, 1997), Nicolae and Nolan (JMCB, 2006),\nGibbs and Kulish (EER, 2017), Lu, King and Pasten (JME, 2016),\nWieland (book chapter, 2009).\n\nAs one example, Gibbs and Kulish (2017) consider a model with\nlearning along with evolving credibility, and they fit the model\nto a range of observed disinflations across time and place. Their\nmodel attributes the cost of disinflation to the degree of\ncredibility.\n\n19\n\n\fDisinflation Today\n\n20\n\n\fT HE MONETARY- FISCAL MIX TODAY\nThe COVID-19 pandemic induced large deficit spending\ncombined with accommodative monetary policy, including\nlarge-scale asset purchases.\nThis could be thought of as akin to an intentional, temporary,\nhigh-inflation regime, as the monetary authority did not attempt\nto offset the inflationary impulse unleashed by the fiscal\nauthority.\nIn keeping with the spirit of Sargent (1981, 1982), what is now\nrequired is a regime switch back to the previous, pre-pandemic\nregime that featured inflation near target.\nIs such a switch occurring?\n\n21\n\n\fD ISINFLATION TODAY\nThe regime shift back to the pre-pandemic fiscal-monetary mix\ndoes appear to be taking shape in the U.S.\nFiscal situation in the U.S.: Additional large-scale deficit\nspending may be less likely due to the possibility of divided\ngovernment following the 2022 midterm elections.\nMonetary situation in the U.S.: The Fed is committed to an\ninflation target; it has taken actions to increase the policy rate\nand to begin quantitative tightening (QT).\nConsequently, medium- and longer-term inflation expectations\ncurrently tend to be lower than shorter-term inflation\nexpectations.\nA similar narrative for the euro area?\n\n22\n\n\fM EDIUM - AND LONG - TERM INFLATION EXPECTATIONS\nLOWER THAN SHORT- TERM EXPECTATIONS\n4\n\nPercent\n\n3\n\n1yr-1yr fwd.\n5yr-5yr fwd.\n1yr-1yr fwd.\n5yr-5yr fwd.\n\nU.S. CPI infl. swap\nU.S. CPI infl. swap\neuro area HICP infl. swap\neuro area HICP infl. swap\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\nJan 2020\n\nJan 2021\n\nJan 2022\n\nSource: Barclays.

Accordingly, the 2-year Treasury yield was 1.61%.‡\nLonger-term rates were moderate, with the 10-year Treasury yield at\n1.86% and the 30-year fixed rate mortgage at 3.96%.‡\nThis may provide a practical benchmark for where the constellation of\nrates may settle once inflation comes under control in the U.S.\n\nReal GDP growth and inflation are Q4-over-Q4 values.

Last observation: May 24, 2022.\n15\n\n\fMarket rates above pre-pandemic benchmark\n• The fact that market interest rates have moved above their pre-pandemic\n•\n•\n\nbenchmarks while the policy rate has not can be read as an illustration of\nthe effect of credible forward guidance.\nThe Fed still has to follow through to ratify the forward guidance\npreviously given, but the effects on the economy and on inflation are\nalready taking hold.\nAs I have stressed, U.S. inflation is far above target, which means that\nmarket rates will have to move well above their pre-pandemic\nbenchmarks this year before converging back to lower levels in\nsubsequent years. But how far?\n16\n\n\fMinimal Taylor-type rule calculation\n• In a recent talk, I suggested a minimal Taylor-type rule calculation,\n•\n•\n•\n\nwhich recommended a policy rate of 3.63%.†\nThe calculation involved various judgments concerning the elements\nof a minimal Taylor-type rule.\nThe calculation gives an idea of where the FOMC may need to move\nthe policy rate to address the inflation problem now taking hold in the\nU.S.\nThe 2-year Treasury yield, which embodies forward guidance by the\nFed, has been trading around 2.6%, still somewhat short of the\nminimal level to bring inflation under control.\n\n†\n\nSee J.

During an event hosted by the Energy Infrastructure\nCouncil in West Palm Beach, Fla., he also shared his views on recent monetary policy and further\nanticipated moves.\nOn the real economy, Bullard said that he is expecting above trend growth in the U.S. over the\nnext 18 months, although he acknowledged that there are risks to growth, such as what will\nhappen with the European and Chinese economies. He also noted that U.S. labor markets are\nstrong.\nCiting recent remarks by Fed Chair Jerome Powell, Bullard said that in�ation is the Federal Open\nMarket Committee’s No. 1 concern and that the FOMC is going to bring in�ation back down to\n2%, which means raising interest rates.\nBullard noted that the FOMC has raised the policy rate twice this year (by 25 basis points in\nMarch and by 50 basis points in May) and that further anticipated increases are already priced\ninto �nancial markets.\n“I think we have a good plan for now, and I think the base case is good,” he said, adding that Chair\nPowell has said it looks like the FOMC is on course for 50-basis-point increases at coming\nmeetings.\nBullard also discussed the FOMC’s plan for reducing the size of the Fed’s balance sheet, saying\nthat, all else equal, it should put upward pressure on the longer end of the yield curve. He said\nsome of that has already occurred, with the 10-year Treasury yield and 30-year mortgage rate up\nsubstantially, and he expects to see more upward pressure on longer-term yields going forward.\nWatch the discussion.\n\n\f"

He spoke at the Asian Investment\nConference in an interview that was recorded March 22.\nBullard noted that the U.S. inflation data in October through February were hotter\nthan expected, and inflation rates are the highest in 40 years. The Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC) has adjusted a lot in the last six months, and more at\nlast week’s meeting, with the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections now\nsuggesting that the policy rate would rise substantially this year, he said.\nHe discussed his dissent at last week’s meeting, saying that he thought the FOMC\nshould start moving sooner and faster in terms of removing monetary policy\naccommodation. In particular, Bullard favored raising the policy rate by 50 basis\npoints (instead of the FOMC’s 25-basis-point increase) and getting going on Fed\nbalance sheet runoff. (See “President Bullard Explains His Recent FOMC Dissent”\nfor more details.)\n“We’re certainly moving in the right direction, but you have to move at a pace that\nmakes sense for the situation, and right now we’re putting upward pressure on\ninflation” while headline PCE inflation is running 400 basis points over target,\nBullard said. “So, I think we have to move faster to keep inflation under control,” he\nsaid, noting that he has in mind something like the 1994 reset of monetary policy,\nwhere the policy rate was increased 300 basis points in one year with good results\nfor the economy and inflation.\nBullard also discussed his main concern about the Russia-Ukraine war from an\neconomic point of view (whether Europe can stay out of recession in response to the\nshock), the robust labor markets in the U.S., and the importance in central banking\nof thinking about new ways to approach monetary policy and deal with unique\nsituations.\nHaving trouble with the video?

The\nfederal debt is therefore not backed by future taxes.\nImportant private credit market: The young borrow from the\nmiddle-aged, who are saving for when they are old.\nEnough realistic features to provide an interesting calibrated\nbenchmark.\nSubstantial inequality in income and financial wealth—enough\nto generate Gini coefficients close to those observed in U.S. data.\n\n4\n\n\fI NTRODUCTION\n\nE NVIRONMENT\n\nM APPING TO D ATA\n\nC ONCLUSIONS\n\nM AIN FINDING\n\nMain result: The optimal federal debt-to-GDP ratio in the\nbenchmark calibrated equilibrium of this economy is 100%, a\nsubstantial share of the current U.S. federal debt-to-GDP ratio.\nIntuition: Our model provides a demand for government debt as\na type of “interest-bearing money,” and the amount needed to\nsupport the first-best allocation of resources turns out to be large.\nThe results in this paper are best thought of as applying to large\nstable economies with high fiscal and monetary policy credibility.\nWhether these results would apply to countries within the EMU\nis an open question.\n\n5\n\n\fI NTRODUCTION\n\nE NVIRONMENT\n\nM APPING TO D ATA\n\nC ONCLUSIONS\n\nR EMARKS\nComplete characterization of optimal monetary/fiscal policy.\nThe fiscal authority issues one-period nominal debt at the expected\nrate of nominal output growth.\nThe monetary authority sets the price level to ensure that the real\nrate of return on this debt and other assets is equal to the stochastic\nrate of real output growth.\n\nThe optimal fiscal-monetary mix works equally well whether\ninterest rates are high or low.\nMonetary policy provides a form of insurance to investors by\nmaking the real return on government debt appropriately\nstate-contingent in an economy with non-state-contingent\nnominal contracting.\n\n6\n\n\fI NTRODUCTION\n\nE NVIRONMENT\n\nM APPING TO D ATA\n\nC ONCLUSIONS\n\nM ORE REMARKS\n\nIn the equilibrium we describe, federal government debt coexists\nwith capital and with privately issued debt, which can be\ninterpreted as mortgage-backed securities.\nWe focus on one-period debt, but the model can price\nmany-period debt.\nWe abstract from international considerations, but this is an\nimportant area for future research.\n\n7\n\n\fI NTRODUCTION\n\nE NVIRONMENT\n\nM APPING TO D ATA\n\nC ONCLUSIONS\n\nB OTTOM LINE EXAMPLE\nThe U.S. federal debt-to-GDP ratio is 122.5% (Q3 2021).\nStandard macroeconomics would consider this entirely as\nBarro-Ricardian debt that must be backed by future taxation.\nAlso, levels in excess of 60% (according to the Maastricht Treaty)\nare excessive and suggest a future crisis.\nThis paper calibrates a first tranche of 100%, which is\n“interest-bearing money” and not backed by future taxation.\nThis would leave 22.5% as Barro-Ricardian debt (not modeled)\nthat must be backed by future taxes—a level that would\nnormally be considered easily sustainable.\nThe paper provides wide scope for interpreting how large the\ntwo tranches may be—the case with a first tranche of 100%\npresented here provides one illustration that the first tranche\nmay be quite large.\n\n8\n\n\fI

as a\ndecision-maker at age 20 and exiting as a decision-maker at age\n80, inclusive of end points, and making economic decisions at a\nquarterly frequency.\nResults are perfectly general for the choice of T, with higher\nvalues corresponding to decision-making at more frequent\nintervals.\nThis class of models has a “paper-and-pencil” equilibrium\nsolution, and so it provides a simple benchmark model for\nheterogeneous-agent macroeconomies with aggregate shocks.\n\n10\n\n\fI NTRODUCTION\n\nE NVIRONMENT\n\nM APPING TO D ATA\n\nC ONCLUSIONS\n\nR ISK FACED BY HOUSEHOLDS\n\nThere is both aggregate risk and idiosyncratic risk.\nAll idiosyncratic risk is borne as the agent enters the economy.\nMacroeconomic policymakers provide a form of insurance\nagainst the aggregate risk.\nA

ONCLUSIONS\n\nA SSETS AND NOMINAL CONTRACTING\nThere are three nominally denominated assets: privately issued\ndebt, publicly issued debt and capital.\nWe think of these as representing U.S. data counterparts: (1)\nmortgage-backed securities, (2) federally issued debt and (3)\nphysical capital, respectively.\nIn the U.S. data, MBS net out, but federally issued debt and\nphysical capital are in positive net supply and we target a value\nof assets-to-GDP equal to 1.00 + 3.32 = 4.32.\nThe credit market friction is non-state contingent nominal\ncontracting (NSCNC): All debt contracts are stated in nominal\nterms, with a stated nominal interest rate, and repayment is not\nstate-contingent.\nThe role of monetary policy is to adjust the price level each\nperiod in order to convert these nominal, non-state contingent\ncontracts into real, state-contingent contracts in order to achieve\nthe first-best allocation of resources.\n12\n\n\fI NTRODUCTION\n\nE NVIRONMENT\n\nM APPING TO D ATA\n\nC ONCLUSIONS\n\nH OUSEHOLD TYPES\n\nThere are two household types: “life cycle” and\n“hand-to-mouth.”\nThe life-cycle households are assigned a hump-shaped\nproductivity profile at the beginning of their life cycle.\nAccordingly, they need to use credit markets (hold assets) to\nsmooth life-cycle consumption.\nThe hand-to-mouth households are assigned a perfectly flat\nproductivity profile as they enter the economy. Accordingly, they\nnever need to use credit markets and instead consume their\nlabor income each period.\nThe economy with all life-cycle households wants to hold assets\nworth 5.71 times the size of GDP, higher than what we see in the\ndata.\nThe economy with all HTM households would be “Spartan,”\nand would hold no assets at all.\nWe will adjust the fraction of HTM households in order to match\nthe assets-to-GDP ratio in the U.S. data.\n13\n\n\fI NTRODUCTION\n\nE NVIRONMENT\n\nM APPING TO D ATA\n\nC ONCLUSIONS\n\nP REFERENCES\nEach household i 2 (0, 1) entering the economy at date t has\npreferences (both types)\nT\n\nUt,i =\n\n∑ [η ln c̃t,i (t + s) + (1\n\nη ) ln `t,i (t + s)] .\n\ns=0\n\nWe define c̃t,i (t + s) = D (t + s) ct,i (t + s) , where D (t + s) is the\nstate of aggregate demand at date t + s.
