        "content": "Welcoming Remarks by James Bullard, President and CEO\nThe 2015 Homer Jones Memorial Lecture\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nJune 3, 2015\nWelcome to the Homer Jones Memorial Lecture.\nIt was June 1990. The average U.S. household owned five radios; the “worldwide web” was a\nterm associated with either spiders, spies or organized crime; 1 the first season of The Simpsons\nrecently ended; the inflation rate was just under 4 percent; and the Maestro—Alan\nGreenspan—deftly ruled the roost at the Fed. At just that moment, Athanasios Orphanides took\na position as an economist at the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\nWhile it is true that shortly afterward, the U.S. economy entered a recession—never mind that!\nAthanasios in 1990 began a remarkable career that has emphasized both outstanding research\nand excellent policy advice. As he rose through the ranks of economists at the Board of\nGovernors, he took his role as an insider on U.S. monetary policy seriously and used it to\nprovide insight both to policymakers and to academics. To get an idea of the flavor of his work,\nconsider his 2004 Journal of Money, Credit and Banking paper titled “Monetary Policy Rules,\nMacroeconomic Stability, and Inflation: A View from the Trenches.” It was trench warfare\nindeed, and Athanasios was on the front line.\nFast-forward to May 2007. Athanasios departed the Federal Reserve. A Greek Cypriot, he was\nappointed to the governorship of the Central Bank of Cyprus. Cyprus at that point had just won\nentry into the eurozone, and one of the first tasks Athanasios faced was to transition the island\neconomy to the new currency. Membership in the eurozone also meant that Athanasios\nbecame a member of the powerful Governing Council of the European Central Bank, the\nEuropean counterpart of the Federal Open Market Committee. He held this position until 2012,\nlong enough to help shape the euro area response to the deepest economic and financial crisis\nsince the 1930s and to deal directly with the 2011-2012 European sovereign debt crisis, vestiges\nof which remain with us today.\n\n1\n\nSee http://www.infoplease.com/year/1990.html.\n\n\fGiven this unusual career history, it may well be that Athanasios Orphanides is the only person\non the planet who has attended Federal Open Market Committee meetings as well as European\nCentral Bank Governing Council meetings. Accordingly, he can provide a unique perspective on\nglobal monetary policy.\nThis is the 26th annual Homer Jones Memorial Lecture. The lecture series began in 1987,\nshortly after Homer’s death. The lecture series has persisted, first, because of the initial efforts\nof Homer’s former colleagues and friends at the St. Louis Fed and elsewhere in the community,\nand, second, because of the long-lasting support of many people and organizations. These\ninclude the St. Louis Gateway Chapter of the National Association for Business Economics, Saint\nLouis University, Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville, the University of Missouri at St.\nLouis and Washington University in St. Louis.\nHomer Jones is often described as “Milton Friedman’s teacher.” This is because Jones taught\nFriedman when Milton was an undergraduate at Rutgers University in the early 1930s. At that\ntime, macroeconomics was in its infancy, and monetary policymakers struggled to come to\ngrips with their newfound powers—and their limitations. Eventually, Milton and Homer, each in\ntheir own way and employing different methods, would help to fundamentally transform the\nscience and practice of monetary economics and monetary policy.\nJones had come to the Rutgers faculty after studying at the University of Chicago, where he was\na student of legendary Chicago professor Frank Knight. Also on the Rutgers faculty at the time:\nArthur Burns, future chairman of the Federal Reserve.\nAccording to Friedman, Jones was one of the primary influences in Friedman’s choice to study\neconomics, as opposed to mathematics or statistics. In Friedman’s 1976 reminiscence, he says\nJones opened his eyes “to the broader reaches of economics and to the beauties and intricacies\nof economic theory.” 2\nMilton Friedman went on to graduate study in economics at Columbia, and in 1958 Homer\nJones came to the St. Louis Fed as director of research. Homer Jones became the founding\nfather of the tradition of rigorous economic research, not just at the St. Louis Fed but for the\nFederal Reserve System as a whole. Homer’s original efforts to make the St. Louis Fed a leader\n\n2\n\nSee Friedman, Milton. “Homer Jones: A Personal Reminiscence.” Journal of Monetary Economics, November\n1976, 2(4), pp. 433-6.\n\n\fin monetary research and statistics bear an imprint today on an array of Bank products,\nincluding FRED, mobile FRED, ALFRED, GeoFRED, CASSIDI, FRASER and IDEAS.\nThe most important legacy of Homer Jones is the St. Louis Fed’s unwavering commitment to\nrigorous, independent research. Independence of views continues to be a critical component of\nU.S. monetary policy. The Fed’s ability to absorb and be open to multiple viewpoints helps\nprevent groupthink and leads to superior monetary policy and ultimately to better\nmacroeconomic performance. Those of us in the Federal Reserve System who believe that the\nability to question and re-examine conventional wisdom leads to better policy outcomes owe a\ngreat debt to Homer Jones.\nWe are pleased and honored today to welcome Athanasios Orphanides to give the 2015 Homer\nJones Memorial Lecture. He has moved on from sunny Cyprus and is currently Professor of the\nPractice of Global Economics and Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s\nSloan School of Management. Orphanides is also a Research Fellow of the Centre for Economic\nPolicy Research, a Senior Fellow of the Center for Financial Studies, a Research Fellow of the\nInstitute for Monetary and Financial Stability, and a member of the Shadow Open Market\nCommittee.\nAthanasios has published extensively in professional, peer-reviewed journals and co-edited\nthree books. Much of his work has focused on the difficulty of making good monetary policy\nchoices in real time. The difficulty of interpreting real-time data has often led to questionable\nmonetary policy decisions, according to his research. For example, Orphanides has attributed\nthe Great Inflation of the 1970s to policymakers’ misreading of trends in productivity in the\nearly 1970s. His widely-cited professional publications include co-authored work with current\nSan Francisco Fed President John Williams, “Imperfect Knowledge, Inflation Expectations, and\nMonetary Policy”; 3 an American Economic Review article titled “Monetary Policy Rules Based\non Real-Time Data”; and a Journal of Monetary Economics article titled “The Quest for\nProsperity without Inflation.” He also co-authored an important historical article that I highly\nrecommend, “The Reform of October 1979: How It Happened and Why,” with David Lindsey\nand Robert Rasche in the St. Louis Fed Review. He obtained his Ph.D. in economics from MIT.\nPlease join me in welcoming Athanasios Orphanides, who will speak to us today about “Fear of\nLiftoff: Uncertainty, Rules and Discretion in Monetary Policy Normalization.”\n3\n\nPublished in The Inflation-Targeting Debate, Ben S. Bernanke and Michael Woodford, editors, University of\nChicago Press, 2005.\n\n\f",

        "content": "Neo-Fisherianism\n\nJames Bullard\nPresident and CEO, FRB-St. Louis\nExpectations in Dynamic Macroeconomic Models\nUniversity of Oregon\n13 August 2015\nEugene, Oregon\nAny opinions expressed here are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n\fIntroduction\n\n\fPurpose of the talk\nThis talk considers “neo-Fisherianism,” a topic of academic\ninterest, especially within the macroeconomics learning\nliterature.\nThe direct links between this topic and current monetary\npolicy are limited.\nNeo-Fisherianism may, however, prove to be an important\nconsideration for monetary policy in the medium and longer\nterm.\n\n\fBackground\nThe Fisher equation is central to macroeconomics.\nBenhabib, et al., (2001) combined the Fisher equation with a\nTaylor-type policy rule and the ZLB.\nThey argued that global analysis reveals a second,\n“unintended” steady state characterized by near-zero shortterm nominal interest rates and low or negative inflation.\nBullard (2010) argued that unmitigated ZIRP may cause\nconvergence to this unintended steady state.\nThe learning literature says otherwise.\n\n\fNeo-Fisherianism\nThe idea that the Fisher equation could dictate the\nconvergence dynamics over the medium or longer term has\ncome to be called “Neo-Fisherian.”\nThe core idea is that maintaining and committing to ZIRP for\na sufficiently long period of time could lead to low inflation\nexpectations and low actual inflation.\n Garcia Schmidt and Woodford (2015, slides) verify this\npossibility under RE in a standard NK model.\n\nFor a discussion, see John Cochrane’s blog, “The NeoFisherian Question,” November 6, 2014, and July 14, 2015.\n\n\fThis talk\nJapan has been the poster child for the low nominal interest\nrate, low inflation (LL) steady state for two decades.\n This motivated the original BSU (2001) “perils” paper.\n\nIn this talk I will look informally at the state of more recent\nempirical evidence for convergence to the LL steady state\nacross key developed economies.\nThis evidence is arguably pointing toward LL convergence.\nThe macro learning literature results tend to be at odds with\nthis empirical evidence.\n\n\fBenhabib, Schmitt-Grohe, and Uribe\n\n\fWhat Benhabib, et al. (2001) said\nPolicymakers control a short-term nominal interest rate.\nPolicymakers are rigidly committed to a Taylor-type rule\nwith inflation as the single argument.\n (How does this mesh with unconventional monetary policy?)\n\nThe rule obeys the Taylor principle: The policy rate responds\nmore than one-for-one with deviations of inflation from\ntarget near the “targeted” steady state.\nThe zero lower bound constrains the policy rate from below.\nResult: Models with these features have a LL steady state.\n\n\fThe U.S. and Japan through the lens of BSU (2001)\n\nSource: OECD’s Main Economic Indicators and author’s calculations. Last observation: June 2015.\n\n\fHow relevant is the LL steady state?\nFinancial markets tend to put high weight on the possibility\nof convergence to LL.\n August 10, 2015 news item: A survey at a recent gathering of\nWall Street professionals said 78 percent are “more worried\nabout deflation than inflation.”\n\nThe learning literature and policymakers tend to put low or\nzero weight on convergence to LL.\n The LL steady state tends to be unstable under standard\nlearning analyses—a sort of “victory” for the learning\nliterature.\n\n\fSome sample academic literature\nWerning (2012): NK model has no LL steady state included,\nyet analyzes R=0 and associated dynamics.\nGarcia Schmidt and Woodford (2015, slides): LL in NK\nmodel is a RE curiosum, and a reasonable departures from\nRE suggest it is not a relevant medium-term outcome.\nEvans (2013): Alternative NK model with LL as a locally\nstable “stagnation regime” under learning.\nSchmitt-Grohe and Uribe (2013): Alternative NK model\nunder RE includes LL in which raising the policy rate raises\ninflation.\n\n\fSlaves to the NK abstraction?\nDepartures from the NK model may fit the data better.\nThe stability properties of these equilibria under learning are\nunknown.\nAndolfatto and Williamson (2015): Assume RE. Allow for\nliquidity premia on bonds and possible asset shortages. LL\ncan be persistent.\nCaballero and Farhi (2015): Assume RE. Shortage of safe\nassets. LL can be persistent.\nEggertsson and Mehrotra (2014): “Secular stagnation” under\nRE.\n\n\fThe Recent Time Series Evidence\n\n\fThe recent time series evidence\nLet’s consider a schematic representation of the two BSU\nsteady states.\nAssume an inflation target of 2 percent across countries.\nAssume a short-term steady state real interest rate of 1\npercent for all countries.\nUse headline inflation measured from one year earlier from\nthe OECD main economic indicators for comparability.\n inflation rates have been smoothed using a MA(5) filter.\n\nIn these charts, the policy rate is on the left axis and inflation\nis on the right axis, and the difference in scale is the real rate.\n\n\fJapan\nJapan has spent a lot of time near the LL steady state since\n1995.\nJapan did not have an inflation target until recently.\nAbenomics dates from the political rise of Shinzo Abe\nbeginning in late 2012.\nThe BOJ “QQE” program has arguably had an important\nimpact and may be moving inflation closer to the 2 percent\ntarget.\n\n\fJapan\n\nSource: OECD’s Main Economic Indicators and author’s calculations. Last observation: June 2015.\n\n\fU.S.A.\nThe U.S. had inflation above target as of January 2012, but\nhas since seen inflation decline.\nThe Fed pursued unconventional monetary policy following\nthe crisis, once beginning in 2010 and again beginning in\n2012.\nThe most recent program ended in 2014.\nThose programs have left the Fed with a $4.5 trillion balance\nsheet.\n\n\fUnited States\n\nSource: OECD’s Main Economic Indicators and author’s calculations. Last observation: June 2015.\n\n\fEuro area\nEuro area inflation was above target as of 2012, but has also\ndeclined since that time.\nThe ECB generally resisted unconventional monetary policy,\neither forward guidance or quantitative easing, until this year.\nKey motivation: Inflation was falling far below target.\nThe current ECB QE program is expected to continue until\nSeptember 2016.\nMain development in the global economy in the last two\nyears is that the Euro Area has begun to look more like\nJapan.\n\n\fEuro area\n\nSource: OECD’s Main Economic Indicators and author’s calculations. Last observation: June 2015.\n\n\fUnited Kingdom\nThe United Kingdom generally has been thought to be less\naffected by neo-Fisherian concerns.\nInflation has generally been above target since 2008.\nRecently, however, inflation has fallen to low levels.\n\n\fUnited Kingdom\n\nSource: OECD’s Main Economic Indicators and author’s calculations. Last observation: June 2015.\n\n\fSweden\nLet’s look at some smaller open economies.\nThe Riksbank raised rates to combat rising inflation during\n2011 and 2012, but inflation then fell considerably below\ntarget.\nInflation has stabilized at zero over the last two years, and the\nRiksbank has experimented with negative policy rates\nrecently.\n\n\fSweden\n\nSource: OECD’s Main Economic Indicators and author’s calculations. Last observation: June 2015.\n\n\fSwitzerland\nThe Swiss economy has arguably been almost as close to the\nLL steady state as Japan over the last decade.\nSwiss inflation has been zero or negative for 3.5 years.\nThe SNB has also experimented with negative policy rates.\n\n\fSwitzerland\n\nSource: OECD’s Main Economic Indicators and author’s calculations. Last observation: June 2015.\n\n\fLessons from this evidence\nThe policy rates in these countries have been near zero for\nmost or all of the last 6.5 years.\nConventional NK theory suggests higher inflation should\nhave materialized, and on a time scale far shorter than 6.5\nyears.\nLet’s assess whether these countries are closer today to the\ntargeted steady state or the LL steady state.\nLet’s use Euclidean distance in the policy rate and the\ninflation rate.\n\n\fDistances from steady states in June 2015\nHigh s.s.\n\nLow s.s.\n\nUnited States\n\n3.52\n\n0.97\n\nJapan\n\n3.04\n\n2.20\n\nEuro area\n\n3.68\n\n1.05\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\n3.23\n\n1.10\n\nSweden\n\n3.77\n\n0.94\n\nSwitzerland\n\n5.13\n\n1.15\n\nSource: OECD’s Main Economic Indicators and author’s calculations. Last observation: June 2015.\n\n\fDistance from the LL steady state\nThe table indicates that as of June 2015, all countries are\nbetter described as close to the LL steady state than the\ntargeted steady state.\nSome of this is because policy rates remain near zero.\nOne could interpret recent QQE in Japan and QE in Europe\nas indicating that policymakers intend to remain at the zero\npolicy rate for quite some time into the future.\nThis commitment may be long enough to strengthen neoFisherian dynamics.\n\n\fFurther Considerations\n\n\fBottom line\nThe bottom line is that a case can be made that the LL steady\nstate has, in an empirical sense, a basin of attraction.\nThis conflicts with the general result from the learning\nliterature that the LL steady state is locally unstable.\nThere are of course many other possibilities.\nThe standard NK model may not be the right abstraction, as\nEvans, Andolfatto-Williamson, Caballero-Fahri, EggertssonMehrotra, Schmitt-Grohe-Uribe and others suggest.\nAlso, other global factors may be important. One is the price\nof oil.\n\n\fOil price shock in 2014 has affected inflation\n\nSource: Energy Information Administration and Haver Analytics. Last observation: week of August 7, 2015.\n\n\fExtent of the oil price effect on measured inflation\nI have argued in interviews and commentary that the Fed\nshould look through the oil price shock and expect inflation\nto rise in the coming quarters and years.\nA rigorous measure of smoothed inflation like the Dallas Fed\ntrimmed-mean PCE inflation rate suggests headline inflation\nmay be closer to target soon.\nThe Atlanta Fed’s “sticky price CPI inflation” measure is\nsomewhat above target. True believers in NK theory would\ntarget sticky price inflation (see Eusepi et al., 2011).\n One has to adjust for differences in CPI vs. PCE inflation.\n\n\fSmoothed measures of U.S. inflation\n\nSource: FRB Atlanta and FRB Dallas. Last observation: June 2015.\n\n\fSmoothed measures of inflation were lower in 2010\nIn the summer of 2010, I began arguing via the “seven faces”\npaper that inflation was “too low.”\nAt that time, even smoothed measures of inflation had fallen\nbelow 1 percent.\nThis is apparent in the previous chart.\nToday, smoothed measures of inflation look less threatening,\nbolstering the case that policymakers may be wise to expect\ntemporary influences on headline inflation to abate.\n\n\fInflation expectations\nThe neo-Fisherian story requires that inflation expectations\ntend to fall as the ZIRP policy continues.\nCentral banks like the Fed have put heavy weight on the idea\nthat actual inflation expectations are well-anchored.\nOne way to look at inflation expectations is to consider TIPSbased measures.\n For many countries considered here, 10-year expected inflation\nis below 2 percent. The exception is the U.K.\n\n\fInflation expectations generally below target\n\nSource: Bloomberg. Last observation: August 11, 2015.\n\n\fLonger-term bond yields\nThe neo-Fisherian story would also suggest that nominal\nbond yields should decline over time as expected inflation\nand possibly inflation risk premia would tend to move lower\nas convergence occurred.\nThis may be happening.\n\n\fBond yields\n\nSource: Financial Times. Last observation: week of August 7, 2015.\n\n\fSummary\n\n\fSummary\nPolicymaker conventional wisdom and NK theory both\nsuggest low nominal rates should cause inflation to rise.\nThe simple empirical evidence reviewed here suggests this is\nnot happening even after 6.5 years of ZIRP.\nThere are still reasons for maintaining faith in the\nconventional wisdom, including a major oil price shock and\narguably anchored inflation expectations.\nThe general result from the learning literature on the local\ninstability of the LL steady state seems unhelpful—it predicts\na natural return of inflation.\n\n\fFuture policy\nEven if the Fed begins normalization this year, U.S. and other\nrates will still be exceptionally low over the medium term.\nThese very low rates may be pulling inflation and inflation\nexpectations lower via the neo-Fisherian mechanism.\nFor now, I am willing to argue that current inflation is low in\npart due to temporary commodity price movements, and that\ninflation expectations remain well anchored.\nIf the neo-Fisherian effect is strong in the quarters and years\nahead, however, we will need to think about monetary policy\nin alternative ways.\n\n\fReferences\nD.

        "content": "Welcoming Remarks by James Bullard, President and CEO\nThird Annual Community Banking in the 21st Century Research and Policy Conference\nThe Federal Reserve System and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS)\nSt. Louis, Mo.\nSept. 30, 2015\nGood afternoon, and welcome to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The St. Louis Fed is\nproud to serve as the host site for the third annual Community Banking in the 21st Century\nresearch and policy conference. It is jointly sponsored by the Federal Reserve System and the\nConference of State Bank Supervisors.\nLast year, in addition to hearing some of the latest research on community banking from a wide\nrange of academic institutions and regulatory agencies, we also engaged in a spirited debate on\nthe opportunities and challenges facing community banks. Perhaps not surprisingly, regulatory\nburden was at the forefront of the discussion.\nThe energy from last year’s event helped inform much of the debate that has already taken\nplace in 2015.\nFor example, last December, the federal regulatory agencies conducted their first of six\nmeetings under the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996. Under\nthe law, agencies are required, every 10 years, to conduct a review for the specific purpose of\nidentifying outdated, unnecessary or unduly burdensome regulations.\nMany of the individuals who either attended last year’s conference or were part of the\nconference program were actively involved in these discussions. We have received numerous\ncomments from the four meetings that have taken place so far, and look forward to seeing the\noutcomes from these meetings next year.\nThere have been additional actions. Importantly, in April, the Fed announced that it was\nincreasing the asset-size threshold for small bank holding companies and savings and loan\nholding companies from $500 million to $1 billion. This change means that more holding\ncompany organizations are not subject to consolidated capital requirements, making it easier\nfor parent companies to borrow to finance certain transactions.\nIn addition, some changes to call report requirements were announced several weeks ago by\nthe Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council. The Federal Reserve is conducting its\n\n\fown review of the call report and other areas and is searching for additional burden-reducing\nchanges that may be applicable in the future.\nFrom my own perspective, more could be done. There appear to be some areas where we have\nsufficient information and experience to warrant additional action.\nFor example, we may want to consider the transaction value threshold under which a property\nrequires an appraisal by a state-certified or licensed appraiser. The current limit of $250,000\nhas been in place since 1994, when it was increased from $100,000. Inflation adjustment alone\nsuggests that the threshold in 2015 should be higher. Based upon a sample of community bank\nexaminations recently performed in the St. Louis Fed’s District, we estimate the number of\nrequired appraisals would decline significantly. Appraisals on properties in rural areas are often\nof limited value, especially when the nearest appraiser may be a significant distance away. In\nmany rural communities, bankers know local land values better than anyone outside, and likely\neven inside, their market. This is a reality of rural markets.\nAs another example, serious consideration should be given to mandatory escrow requirements\nfor taxes and insurance premiums on mortgages that are held in a community bank’s portfolio.\nRecent amendments to Regulation Z were helpful in that they provided a number of\nexemptions for certain types of loans made in rural or underserved areas. However, these\nexemptions do not go far enough. More can likely be done to address escrow requirements for\ncommunity banks in locations that hold mortgages in portfolio.\nWe have touched upon these and other issues in past conferences, and I look forward to a\nhealthy debate during this year’s conference.\nI want to express my appreciation to our conference co-sponsors and to all of the researchers,\ncommunity bankers and regulators who make this conference possible. This conference has\ngained a lot of momentum in the three years since it first launched, and I expect that to\ncontinue.\nBefore we move on to the research portion of our program, however, it is my great pleasure to\nintroduce Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen.\nJanet Yellen became chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System on Feb. 3,\n2014. She is the first woman to hold this position in the history of the Fed. She is an outstanding\nresearch economist with a long and influential research record, much of which was established\nduring her time as a professor at the University of California at Berkeley, one of the premier\neconomics departments in the world. Prior to her appointment as chair, she provided stellar\n2\n\n\fpublic service as a member of the Board of Governors, the vice chair of the Board of Governors,\nchair of the Council of Economic Advisers, chair of the Economic Policy Committee of the\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and as president and chief executive\nofficer of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. She is a member of both the Council on\nForeign Relations and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\nPlease join me in welcoming my esteemed colleague and chair of the Federal Reserve, Janet\nYellen.\n\n3\n\n\f",

Since 2007-2009, the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) has pursued a very aggressive\nmonetary policy strategy. This strategy has been\nassociated with a signi cantly improved labor market,\nmoderate growth, and in ation relatively close to target, net\nof a large oil price shock.\nA key question now is how to think about monetary policy\ngoing forward.\nThe FOMC has long suggested that the appropriate exit\nstrategy from the highly accommodative monetary policy\nfollowing the 2007-2009 recession would be slow and\n\nRSS\n\"Rationally, let it be said in a\nwhisper, experience is certainly\nworth more than theory.\"\nAmerigo Vespucci\n\n\fgradual, and would proceed in several well-de ned steps.\nIn the rst step, the Committee tapered and then ended its\nquantitative easing (QE) program during 2014. In the\nsecond step, the Committee waited for further\nimprovement in labor markets and signaled that the policy\nrate would soon move off the zero lower bound, albeit in\nsmall increments that would leave substantial monetary\npolicy accommodation in place. In the third step, still in the\nfuture, the Committee would begin to gradually shrink the\nbalance sheet, most likely through an end to\nreinvestments. The fourth step, well in the future, would\nsee the balance sheet closer to pre-crisis levels and the\npolicy rate more consistent with the Committee view of its\nlonger-term level.\nThe liftoff of the policy rate from near zero might be viewed\nby some as a momentous event, since the Committee has\nnot changed this element of monetary policy since\nDecember 2008, nearly seven years ago. Still, it would be a\nrelatively minor part of the normalization story I have\noutlined. It is, after all, just one portion of a long-running\nrecovery process from the events of 2007-2009. Eventually,\none would surely expect to see nominal interest rates at\nmore normal levels to be consistent with a pre-crisis\nequilibrium in which in ation is at target and labor markets\nare functioning well.\nOn the eve of policy rate normalization, however, the\ngeneral view outlined above is being challenged from\nseveral directions. In this talk, I will provide my own\ncharacterization of some of these challenges in what I\nhope is an easy-to-digest format.\nI will describe four broad categories of thinking about\ncurrent U.S. monetary policy. None of these four broad\nthemes are strictly identi ed with any one individual or\norganization, but instead represent threads of argument\none often hears in nancial market commentary, academia,\nand policymaking circles. Of these four approaches, the\nrst will be what I think is a \"classic\" interpretation of\ncurrent events based on traditional ideas of successful\ncentral banking practice. This is the central banking\northodoxy referenced in the title of this talk. The other\nthree approaches are mildly heretical. Each claims that an\naspect of the orthodoxy is clearly de cient in the current\npolicy environment. Each has some appeal, but also\nimportant drawbacks. Each departs from the classic view\nby arguing that \"this time is different.\"\nMy conclusion will be that each challenge to orthodoxy is\ninteresting and potentially helpful, but ultimately has one or\nmore drawbacks that make the orthodox view my favored\nbasis for near- and medium-term monetary policy\ndecisions.\nI will begin by rst describing my version of central banking\northodoxy. This part of the talk will be familiar to those\nwho have followed recent speeches of mine on the state of\n\n\fmonetary policy.2 I will then move on to the three\nchallenges to this orthodoxy that I wish to discuss. These\nchallenges are: (1) A weakening Phillips curve relationship\nthat can lead to arguments for a more intense focus on\nin ation relative to the orthodox view; (2) very low real\ninterest rates that can undermine the part of the orthodox\nview that claims monetary policy is very accommodative\ntoday; and (3) citation of ongoing globalization as a\npossible reason to heed foreign economic developments\ndistinctly and separately when making domestic monetary\npolicy decisions. I will explain all of these challenges to\northodoxy as I proceed through these arguments.\n\nA Simple Description of Central Banking Orthodoxy\nWhat I am calling the \"classic\" or \"traditional\" way to view\ncurrent U.S. monetary policy emphasizes the cumulative\nsuccess that has been achieved so far with respect to\nCommittee goals. The Committee has clear objectives\nassociated with labor market performance and in ation.\nRegarding in ation, the Committee set an o cial target of\n2 percent beginning in 2012. Concerning labor market\nperformance, the Committee, through its most recent\nSummary of Economic Projections (SEP), has indicated\nthat an unemployment rate of around 4.9 percent is likely\nto be consistent with longer-run equilibrium.3 The value of\nthe longer-run unemployment rate has drifted down\nrecently—it was 5.6 percent within the last few years.4\nIs the Committee achieving these objectives? The classic\nview emphasizes that indeed, these Committee objectives\nare close to being met.\nThe unemployment rate is currently 5.1 percent and has\nbeen on a downward trend. Given the large amount of\nuncertainty around the concept of a long-run or natural rate\nof unemployment, the current 5.1 percent value is\nstatistically indistinguishable from the Committee's\nstatement of the likely long-run level. In the last two\nexpansions, unemployment fell well into the 4 percent\nrange, and, barring a major recessionary shock,\nunemployment is likely to fall to similar levels in the\nquarters and years ahead. This is likely regardless of the\ndate of liftoff, because monetary policy will remain\nexceptionally accommodative even after normalization\nbegins. In short, the Committee has already hit its objective\non this dimension.5 In addition, labor markets are likely to\ncontinue to improve going forward, barring a major\nnegative shock.\nMany have argued that other dimensions of labor market\nperformance should be considered in the current\nenvironment. I think this is fair, since labor markets were\nseverely disrupted in 2007-2009. Indicators such as job\nopenings and initial unemployment insurance claims look\nvery good, while other indicators like part time for\neconomic reasons and long-term unemployment seem not\n\n\fas good. One way to get a handle on this issue is to\nconsider a labor market conditions index. Such an index\ncan be constructed by combining many different indicators\nof labor market performance into a single index number,\nand then taking that index number as a better and more\ninformed judgment of the state of the labor market than\nthe unemployment rate alone. We have calculated the level\nof such an index.6 The current level of the index is well\nabove its average level since 1976. Labor markets might be\nviewed as even better than normal according to this\nmetric.7\nWhat about the in ation side of the mandate? In ation is\ncertainly low today; in fact, near zero on a year-over-year\nbasis due in part to the very large decline in oil prices\nbeginning in 2014. In addition, recent oil price volatility\nsuggests stabilization of oil and related commodities\nprices may still be some ways in the future. While the drop\nin oil prices is a net positive for the U.S. economy, the\nsharp downward movement does inhibit year-over-year\nreadings on headline in ation. The classic view has an\nanswer for this—it suggests looking through large oil price\nshocks, either positive or negative.\nAccordingly, at this particular juncture, it may be more\nuseful to consider the Dallas Fed's trimmed mean PCE\nin ation measure. This measure is running at about 1.7\npercent year-over-year, about 30 basis points below the\nFOMC target. This is low, but still reasonably close to\ntarget.\nThe classic view, as I am outlining it here, would then say\nthat unemployment of 5.1 percent and underlying in ation\nof 1.7 percent constitute values that are exceptionally\nclose to the objectives of the Committee. This is so much\nso that based on a quadratic objective in deviations of\nunemployment and in ation from target, today's\ncombination of labor market performance and in ation\nperformance is about as good as it has ever been in the\npostwar era.8\nWhile the metrics concerning Committee objectives are\nclose to normal, the policy settings are not. The Committee\nhas used two tools in the last seven years to conduct\nmonetary policy. One tool has been to set the policy rate to\na near-zero value, where it remains today. The Committee's\nSEP indicates that participants view the longer-run level of\nthe policy rate to be about 3.5 percent, so that the current\npolicy rate is more than 325 basis points lower than the\nlong-run level. The other tool has been quantitative easing.\nAs a result of several rounds of QE, the Fed's balance sheet\nhas increased from a pre-crisis value of about $800 billion\nto about $4.5 trillion today.\nThese considerations—objectives met, but policy settings\nfar from normal—suggest a policy path that will return the\neconomy to the well understood pre-crisis equilibrium.\nBased on central bank orthodoxy, the most prudent course\n\n\fof action is to begin to normalize the policy rate slowly and\ngradually, under the interpretation that the Committee will\nstill be providing considerable monetary accommodation\nto the economy to guard against potential pitfalls and risks\nas the quarters and years ahead unfold. By adopting this\nprudent approach to monetary policy strategy, policy tools\nwill eventually be returned to the toolbox, and the\nCommittee may be able to lengthen the expansion longer\nthan it may otherwise extend.\nI have set up this simple classic view because I think that,\non balance, this view suggests the best path forward for\nU.S. monetary policy. But there are certainly other views\nwith considerable merit, and I will now turn to a discussion\nof these alternatives. All of the alternatives depart from an\nimportant aspect of the classic view. Again, I would\nhesitate to associate these alternatives with speci c\nindividuals or organizations, as most or all of us (including\nme at times) appeal to parts of these arguments when\ndiscussing contemporary monetary policy.\n\nStrict In ation Targeting\nThe classic view I have outlined places heavy emphasis on\nthe attainment of Committee goals with respect to labor\nmarket outcomes. A possible challenge to the classic view\nis that labor markets have been overemphasized, and that\nit is the low in ation outcomes that are more critical today.\nThis brings us to a second way to think about current U.S.\nmonetary policy strategy and the rst of the mildly heretical\nviews. I will provocatively label this view \"strict in ation\ntargeting,\" a term often applied to Taylor-type monetary\npolicy rules that place no weight on real variables like\noutput or unemployment gaps.\nHow could labor market outcomes be overemphasized?\nOne version of this view is that Phillips curve relationships\non which much of modern central banking practice rely\nhave either broken down completely or are badly damaged,\nmeaning that further expansion of the economy and tighter\nlabor markets in the quarters and years ahead are unlikely\nto lead to more in ation.9 This being the case, one may\nwish to pursue substantially more monetary policy\naccommodation than otherwise—one may, for instance,\nkeep the policy rate near zero longer.\nAnother version of this story is that the normal Phillips\ncurve relationship remains intact, but the in ation rate\nitself contains all the information one needs to determine\nthe extent of slack in the economy. That is, one may be\nable to reverse engineer the degree of slack in the\neconomy by considering the in ation rate alone. One does\nnot really need to know that much about the Phillips curve\nand its mysteries. The Phillips curve is temporarily dormant\n—it may or may not reassert itself in the future—and we can\nwatch in ation for signs of life in the in ationunemployment nexus.\n\n\fEither way, whether one thinks the Phillips curve has\nbroken down or is merely dormant, a student of the current\nU.S. economy taking this broad view may tend to cite\nin ation alone as the key indicator on which monetary\npolicy should rely, and hence I label this view \"strict\nin ation targeting.\" We could think of an advocate of this\nview as employing a Taylor-type rule in which the\ncoe cient on the unemployment gap has been set to zero.\nIn short, in this alternative view, policy rates should be\nnormalized only when in ation threatens. It challenges the\nclassic view by dispensing with or substantially\ndiscounting the empirical evidence on labor market\nimprovement as a reason to begin policy normalization.\nSince I am not an advocate of the Phillips curve as an\norganizing principle for monetary economics, the strict\nin ation targeting approach has some appeal for me.\nTaken to its logical extreme, one could greatly deemphasize current data on economic growth and labor\nmarket performance, focusing instead on in ation\ndevelopments alone in considering monetary policy\nstrategy.\nNevertheless, I do see an important drawback with this\nview. This type of argument might work better if the policy\nrate was not near zero, but instead was only mildly below\nits long-run level. But to use this alternative to the classic\nview to justify a very low policy rate near zero implies a\nvery large elasticity between the policy rate and the\nin ation gap.10 One would be saying, in effect, that\nbecause a smoothed measure of in ation such as the yearover-year Dallas Fed trimmed mean PCE was somewhat\nbelow the in ation target (let's say 50 basis points below),\nthe policy rate itself must be set 325 basis points below its\nnormal value. The ip side would be, in the context of strict\nin ation targeting, that when a smoothed measure of\nin ation is 50 basis points above target, the policy rate\nwould need to be set to something like 325 basis points\nabove its normal value, on the order of a 7 percent policy\nrate. Few would have this kind of sensitivity of the policy\nrate to in ation developments in mind when interpreting\nevents using this view, but that is the implication of strict\nin ation targeting in the current environment. Given the\nnatural variation in actual in ation, such a large elasticity\nwould probably be unwise, as it might imply rapid\nadjustment of the policy rate in response to relatively\nbenign in ation developments, possibly causing additional\nvolatility in the economy. For this reason, I think it may be\nunwise to follow this particular alternative to the classic\nview.\n\nLow Real Interest Rates\nThe classic view as I have formulated it does not say\nanything about real interest rates. It implicitly assumes that\npolicy can be conducted with a standard Taylor-type policy\n\n\frule in which the intercept term represents a constant longrun or normal value for the policy rate. This is indeed the\nway Taylor-type rules were initially proposed and t to\nmacroeconomic data. Still, we have to be cognizant of the\nevidence, and current real interest rates on government\ndebt and related instruments are exceptionally low.11\nAnother alternative and mildly heretical way to think about\ncurrent U.S. monetary policy is to appeal to time-varying\nreal interest rates, and to argue that the intercept term in\nthe Taylor-type rule is exceptionally low in the current era.\nTo see this, consider a generic Taylor-type monetary policy\nrule without too many bells and whistles. The rule is stated\nin linear terms, with in ation gaps and output or\nunemployment gaps as key arguments. Let us suppose for\npurposes of discussion that these gaps are zero—in ation\nis at target and unemployment is at its long-run level, so\nthese terms go away completely. Then the Taylor-type rule\nsimply says that the policy rate should be equal to its longrun or steady state level, often referred to as r*.\nAnd what is this r*? It is simply the sum of the short-term\nreal rate and the in ation target. That is, the Taylor rule\ncollapses to a Fisher relation, stating that the current value\nof the nominal policy rate is equal to the real rate plus\n(expected) in ation which is equal to the in ation target at\nthe steady state.\nThe real interest rate argument is that r* is actually a very\nlow value in the current macroeconomic environment. Let\nus suppose that the relevant short-term real interest rate is\nminus 2 percent. Then, given an in ation target of 2\npercent and gaps which are zero, the recommended policy\nrate from a Taylor-type rule in this class would be zero.\nThis provides an argument rationalizing today's near-zero\npolicy rate. In other words, yes, in ation and unemployment\nare near target, implying that the policy rate should also be\nnear r*, but r* is itself zero, so everything is exactly\nrationalized.\nWhat should we make of this alternative view?\nFirst, this argument as stated is saying that monetary\npolicy is not accommodative right now, contrary to\nconventional wisdom.12 Most observers of monetary policy\nseem to believe (via the orthodox view given earlier) that\nmonetary policy is exceptionally accommodative and that\nit will continue to be accommodative going forward. This\nprovides one reason why the low real rates view is\nsomewhat heretical. In other contexts, many might say that\nit is the central bank actions themselves which are driving\nreal interest rates to very low levels.\nSecond, there are many competing methods for computing\nthe real interest rate. One method would emphasize labor\nforce growth and the pace of technological improvement.\nAnother method would draw on economic theory and use\nconsumption growth rates. Using these and other methods\n\n\ffrom the literature suggests that one can reasonably reach\na wide variety of conclusions about the appropriate\nestimate of the real interest rate.13\nFor both of these reasons, the implied level of\naccommodation and the measurement uncertainty\nsurrounding the estimation of the real interest rate, I think\nthis alternative view suggests an unwise modi cation to\nthe classic orthodoxy.\n\nGlobalization\nThe classic view as I outlined it did not make reference to\nevents outside U.S. borders. This may be viewed as a\nshortcoming in an age of globalization. The nal challenge\nto the classic view is to go global.\nIt may seem obvious that increasing reference to foreign\neconomic events will be part of U.S. monetary policy going\nforward. But it has not been as popular as one might think,\nat least in portions of the international monetary policy\ncoordination literature.14 In models, the ideas are clear.\nThere are many countries with independent monetary\npolicies. Each country is its own New Keynesian economy\nwith its own shocks. Exchange rates are exible. Monetary\npolicymakers in each country attempt to stabilize their own\neconomies as well as they can by reacting appropriately to\nthe shocks in their own country. A general conclusion from\nmy reading of the literature is that in this situation, there\nwould be little to gain from international monetary policy\ncoordination. Roughly speaking, if policymakers in each\ncountry pursue the best domestically oriented stabilization\npolicy available to them, the global equilibrium will be as\ngood, or nearly as good, as the fully optimal outcome that\ncould be attained through an appropriate coordination of\nmonetary policy.\nWhat does this mean in practical terms? \"Domestically\noriented stabilization policy\" means policymaker reaction\nfunctions include only domestic variables, and these\ndomestic variables contain all the information needed to\npursue optimal policy, regardless of what is occurring in\nthe rest of the world. Alternatively, one could imagine\nmonetary policymakers in each country incorporating, in\naddition to their own output gaps and in ation gaps,\nforeign output gaps in their Taylor-type rules as they\nconduct monetary policy. The policymakers would then be\nadjusting their own policy rates in reaction to domestic\nin ation developments, domestic real developments, and,\nseparately and distinctly, foreign real developments. The\nbaseline result from an important class of models is that\nthis situation does not lead to a better global equilibrium,\nand all countries would be just as well off focusing only on\ndomestic in ation and domestic real developments. Why?\nThe short answer is that it is the job of the foreign central\nbank to use stabilization policy in reaction to shocks in its\nown economy. That, in conjunction with the exible\n\n\fexchange rate regime, makes it unnecessary for the\ndomestic policymaker to react to foreign shocks.\nOf course, this is just one set of models. But as a baseline,\nI think this provides food for thought concerning\nglobalization and monetary policy. The models I am\nreferring to are \"fully globalized\" as the economies involved\nare simply carbon copies of one another with different\nshocks. Even within this environment of full globalization,\nthe gains from international policy coordination may be\nsmall.\nThere is another angle on the role of foreign developments\nin domestic monetary policy. This is the literature on socalled global output gaps.15 This literature argues that the\noutput or resource gap that is most relevant for domestic\nin ation may actually be a global gap, which is sort of an\naverage of output gaps across countries. In other contexts,\nI have explored the idea that especially for China and the\nU.S., which are linked by a managed exchange rate regime,\nit may be more appropriate to think of the resource gap for\nthe two countries jointly.16 While this is interesting and I\nthink deserving of further research attention, in truth, the\nmeasurement problems are all the more severe in\nattempting to calculate a global output gap as opposed to\nsimpler domestic resource gaps.\n\nConclusion\nIn this address, I have outlined an interpretation of current\nevents in U.S. monetary policy that I called the orthodox\nview. This view stresses the currently stark difference\nbetween FOMC objectives, which are arguably nearly\nattained, and FOMC policy tools, which remain on\nemergency settings. A simple and prudent approach to\ncurrent policy would be to begin normalizing the policy\nsettings in an effort to extend the length of the expansion\nand to avoid taking unnecessary risks associated with\nexceptionally low rates and a large Fed balance sheet. This\nwould be done with the understanding that policy would\nremain extremely accommodative for several years, even\nas normalization proceeds, and that this accommodation\nwould help to mitigate remaining risks to the economy\nduring the transition.\nThese remarks have described what I see as three\nimportant challenges to this orthodox view. All challenges\nhave a certain clear appeal, but also important drawbacks.\nAll challenges contain an element of the argument that\n\"this time is different.\"\nThe rst challenge concerned possible overemphasis on\nlabor market improvement in the orthodox view. One\nversion would be that the empirical Phillips curve\nrelationship is broken, and therefore the Fed can continue a\nvery accommodative policy without worry of pressing\nin ation concerns. I called this view, somewhat\n\n\fprovocatively, \"strict in ation targeting.\" A key issue with\nthis challenge to orthodoxy is that it is di cult to use this\nargument to justify the exceptionally low policy rate\nobserved in the U.S. today. Actually trying strict in ation\ntargeting in the current environment would imply an\nexceptionally sensitive policy reaction function that might\ndestabilize rather than stabilize the economy.\nThe second challenge concerned the observed low real\ninterest rates on government debt and related instruments\nin the U.S. and globally versus the orthodox view that real\ninterest rates of this type move very little and only very\nslowly. Time-varying and low real rates can be used, via a\nTaylor-type rule, to rationalize the current policy rate setting\nof zero. An important question for this challenge to\northodoxy is whether the resulting characterization of\ncurrent policy as neutral instead of accommodative is\nconsistent with Committee statements and nancial\nmarket interpretations of current monetary policy. In\naddition, simple alternative measurements of an\nappropriate real interest rate suggest considerable\nuncertainty around this concept.\nThe nal challenge deals with global concerns versus the\northodoxy that de-emphasizes international\nconsiderations. While it may seem that with increasing\nglobalization, policy in one country has to take increasing\naccount of developments in other countries, some of the\nliterature on international monetary policy coordination in\nNew Keynesian models suggests otherwise. In particular,\nat least as a baseline concept, the global equilibrium will\nbe close to optimal if each country reacts only to domestic\nvariables and the world is characterized by exible\nexchange rates. This provides some food for thought on\nwhat globalization does and does not imply for monetary\npolicy strategy.\nIn sum, while the challenges to orthodoxy presented here\nare certainly tangible and interesting, I do not think they\nprovide su ciently robust arguments to guide U.S.\nmonetary policy over the near and medium term. The U.S.\neconomy will likely enjoy better outcomes if the monetary\npolicy orthodoxy I have described is preserved as the\nguiding principle.\n\nEndnotes\n1\n\nThe views expressed here are my own and do not\n\nnecessarily re ect the views of others on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee.

I thank Ray and Yvonne and their teams for doing all the hard work of putting this\nevent together. I also thank Michael Sherraden and his excellent team at the Center for Social\nDevelopment at Washington University in St. Louis, our partner for this and many other events\norganized by the center.\nThe St. Louis Fed is excited about the potential of child accounts—whether structured through\nfinancial institutions or through 529 college savings plans—to help children and their families\nsave for a brighter future. The evidence on the effectiveness of child savings accounts thus far\nis encouraging and has inspired exciting programs and policies in the St. Louis region and\nnationwide. We are fortunate to have many of those initiatives featured here today. Let me\noffer a special thank you to all of our speakers, many of whom traveled from all over the U.S. to\nshare their experience and expertise with us.\nResearch led by Bill Emmons from the Center for Household Financial Stability suggests that\ntoday’s younger Americans are not likely to accumulate as much wealth as previous\ngenerations of younger Americans at a similar age. For example, an American born in 1970 is\non a path to accumulate 40 percent less wealth over his or her lifetime than an American born\nin 1940. By enabling savings for college early in life, children and youth are more likely to\naccumulate wealth—which is essential for their own financial security, as well as for the\neconomic health of our nation.\nOther research, led by many of the scholars in this room, shows that child accounts contribute\nto child development, parental expectations for children’s educational achievement, maternal\nmental health, college access and completion, more savings later in life, and financial capability.\n\n\fThese results suggest that more should be done to ensure that these accounts are available to\nmore children and younger Americans.\nAs everyone here knows well, the relative cost of education is increasing, and today about\nseven in 10 students have to rely on loans to finance their education. Savings not only make it\nmore likely children will attend and complete college, savings also reduce the amount of\nborrowing necessary to get the degree that is so essential to success in today’s economy. In\nfact, recent research by Guillaume Vandenbroucke of the St. Louis Fed shows that the lifetime\nfinancial benefits of an education—sometimes called the skill premium—have never been so\nhigh.\nIn short, it is important to save, save early and save often. Households can accomplish all three\nby making sure every child has his or her own savings account. That is a big part of the appeal\nof many of the policies and programs we will be discussing today: Through an automatic, initial\ndeposit, child accounts enable every child—regardless of income, race, ethnicity or family\nbackground—to get on a path toward college savings, making lifelong savings more likely as\nwell. The St. Louis Fed is proud to be part of this exciting public policy discussion.\nThank you and, again, welcome to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.\n\n2\n\n\f",

        "content": "Opening Remarks by James Bullard, President and CEO\n40th Annual Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Fall Conference\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nSt. Louis, Mo.\nOct. 15-16, 2015\nIt is my pleasure to welcome you to the St. Louis Fed’s 2015 Fall Conference. This is the 40th\nyear for this conference. I want to thank Paulina Restrepo-Echavarria and Guillaume\nVandenbroucke for putting this program together. I am looking forward to the stimulating\ndiscussion these papers are sure to inspire over the next day and a half.\nAt the St. Louis Fed, we have long tried to provide perspectives on whether the economic\npolicies adopted in the past still serve us well today and whether recent developments at the\nfrontier of research can be fruitfully applied to improve policy. This agenda has become\nespecially important in the past few years, as the Fed and other central banks around the world\nhave struggled to devise appropriate policy responses to the current macroeconomic situation.\nIn polite economist society, there has long been a distinction between what is known as\n“frontier” research and what is sometimes called “policy” research. In my view, this has been\nand continues to be a false dichotomy. There is no such distinction: “Policy” and “frontier”\nresearch are two sides of the same coin. We need to understand both how fundamental\nmechanisms in the economy operate as well as how current data and policy measures can be\ninterpreted in terms of fundamental theory.\nIn short, advanced economic theory has to be made more relevant for actual policy, and actual\npolicy has to understand and embrace the sometimes difficult ideas advanced in the theoretical\nliterature. The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis has long been a leader in supporting research\nat the intersection of economic theory and economic policy.\nWe are fortunate this year to have an outstanding group of speakers, whose research is sure to\nexpand our understanding of key contemporary issues in macroeconomics.\nThis year’s agenda includes papers on a host of macroeconomic topics, including:\n•\n\na paper on the extent to which recent developments in neoclassical models can improve\nour understanding of aggregate economies;\n\n\f•\n\na paper that incorporates intangible investments into a multi-sector general equilibrium\nmodel to estimate processes for latent sectorial total factor productivity;\n\n•\n\na paper on the role of wholesale banking and bank runs in modeling financial crises;\n\n•\n\na paper seeking to understand the behavior of the Chinese savings rate, which has more\nthan doubled since 1980; and\n\n•\n\na paper using regional business cycle data to study the determinants of prices, wages\nand employment during the Great Recession.\n\nWe will hear about monetary policy, including:\n•\n\na paper studying the macroeconomic effects of a shortage of safe assets and the\nemergence of a deflationary equilibrium; and\n\n•\n\na paper exploring monetary policy when fractional reserves are set at 100 percent.\n\nWe will also learn about the quantitative implications of wealth taxation through a paper that\nstudies an incomplete markets model where individual rates of return are heterogeneous.\nAnd, finally, we will see a dynamic model of health insurance used to evaluate both the shortand long-run effects of policies that prevent firms from conditioning wages on the health\nconditions of their workers.\nI know that these papers and the ideas they contain will contribute importantly to the\nmacroeconomic discussion in the coming years as the papers are eventually published and the\nresults become more widely known in the profession. The St. Louis Fed is proud to provide this\nforum for discussion and analysis of the leading issues of the day.\nLet me again welcome all of you to the St. Louis Fed’s 2015 Fall Conference. Thanks very much\nfor coming.\n\n2\n\n\f",

One of the most popular and enduring\nviews in all of monetary economics since the 1970s, and\nindeed since the 1940s, has been that a nominal interest\nrate peg is poor monetary policy, and that attempts to\npursue such a policy would lead to ruin. Yet, post-crisis U.S.\nmonetary policy could be interpreted as exactly that—an\ninterest rate peg—and an extreme one at that, since the\npolicy rate has remained near zero for nearly seven years.\n\n\"Rationally, let it be said in a\nwhisper, experience is certainly\nworth more than theory.\"\nAmerigo Vespucci\n\n\fIn this talk, I will summarize some recent academic work\non the idea of a stable interest rate peg and what its\nimplications may be for current monetary policy choices. I\nwill argue that a stable interest rate peg is a realistic\ntheoretical possibility; that it has some mild empirical\nsupport based on a cursory look at the data; and that,\nshould we nd ourselves in a persistent state of low\nnominal interest rates and low in ation, some of our\nfundamental assumptions about how U.S. monetary policy\nworks may have to be altered.\nMy Current Policy Recommendations\nLet me begin by describing brie y my current monetary\npolicy recommendations. Those of you who have followed\nmy commentary during 2015 know that I have been an\nadvocate of ending the Federal Open Market Committee's\n(FOMC's) near-zero nominal interest rate policy. My case\nhas been straightforward. Essentially, I have argued that\nwhile the Committee's goals have been met, the\nCommittee's policy settings remain as extreme as they\nhave been at any time since the recession ended in 2009.\nWith respect to these goals, the current unemployment rate\nof 5 percent is statistically indistinguishable from the\nCommittee's view of the equilibrium long-run rate of\nunemployment. In addition, the current year-over-year\nin ation rate, while low, re ects an outsized oil price shock\nthat occurred during 2014. A measure that tries to control\nfor this effect, the Dallas Fed's trimmed mean in ation rate,\nmeasured year-over-year, is currently running at 1.7\npercent, just 30 basis points below the FOMC's in ation\ntarget of 2 percent. By these measures, the Committee's\ngoals have been met.\nOn the other hand, the Committee's policy settings remain\nfar from normal. The policy rate remains near zero, and the\nbalance sheet is very large relative to its pre-crisis levels. In\nthe past, the Committee has acted to normalize policy well\nbefore goals have been completely met.\nA simple and prudent approach to current policy is to move\nthe policy settings closer to normal levels now that the\ngoals of policy have been attained. There is no reason to\ncontinue to experiment with extreme policy settings.\nImplicit in my argument is a desire to return to the 19842007 U.S. macroeconomic equilibrium, which involved\nrelatively good monetary policy, relatively long economic\nexpansions, and a higher nominal interest rate than we\nhave today. Part of the nature of that equilibrium was a\nmonetary policy that was relatively well understood by both\nnancial market participants and monetary policymakers.\nWe gained much experience with the equilibrium over this\ntime period, and we think we know how it works, in part\nbecause it has been studied extensively from both a\ntheoretical and empirical perspective.\n\n\fRethinking Monetary Policy\nNevertheless, as the topic of this conference is \"Rethinking\nMonetary Policy,\" I plan to devote the bulk of my remarks\nnot to the return to the standard macroeconomic\nequilibrium that I recommend, but to the possibility that\nsuch a return is not achieved, despite the Committee's best\nefforts to engineer such an outcome for the U.S. economy.\nWe have, after all, been at the zero lower bound in the U.S.\nfor seven years. In addition, the FOMC has repeatedly\nstressed that any policy rate increase in coming quarters\nand years will likely be more gradual than either the 1994\ncycle or the 2004-2006 cycle. In short, the FOMC is already\ncommitted to a very low nominal interest rate environment\nover the forecast horizon of two to three years. Perhaps\nshort-term nominal rates will simply be low during this\nperiod, or perhaps the economy will encounter a negative\nshock that will propel policy back toward the zero lower\nbound.\nOur experience is not unique. In Japan, the policy rate has\nnot been higher than 50 basis points for two decades, and\nin the eurozone, the policy rate looks set to remain near\nzero at least through September 2016.\nThe thrust of this talk is to suppose, for the sake of\nargument, that the zero interest rate policy (ZIRP) or nearZIRP remains a persistent feature of the U.S. economy.\nHow should we think about monetary stabilization policy in\nsuch an environment? What sorts of considerations should\nbe paramount? Should we expect slow growth? Will we\ncontinue to have low in ation, or will in ation rise? Would\nwe be at more risk of nancial asset price volatility? What\ntypes of concrete policy decisions could be made to cope\nwith such an environment? Would it require a rethinking of\nU.S. monetary policy?\nI will provide tentative answers to all of these questions.\nBut rst, I want to argue that it may indeed be possible to\nconverge to an equilibrium at the zero lower bound, and\nthat this situation has some surprising consequences.\nChief among these consequences is that the policy itself\nmay put downward pressure on in ation in the medium\nand long term, rather than upward pressure as\nconventionally thought. This is a simple consequence of\nthe Fisher equation having to hold in concert with\nmonetary neutrality. I will now turn to developing this point.\nPermazero\nMost analyses of U.S. monetary policy since the crisis of\n2007-2009 have suggested that ZIRP in the U.S. is a\ntemporary affair, one that was part of an important set of\npolicy actions designed to mitigate a particularly large\nshock to the U.S. economy. But how temporary is it?\n\n\fWe have been at the zero lower bound for nearly seven\nyears. This is well beyond an ordinary business cycle time.\nNormally, we would think of a shock hitting the economy,\nwith the effects of that shock largely wearing off well\nwithin a seven-year time span. What are the consequences\nof spending such a long time with the policy rate at one\nvalue? Arguably, it is an interest rate peg.\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, the typical reply to this question\nwas that an interest rate peg was poor policy. Trying to\nkeep the nominal policy rate unnaturally low for too long a\nperiod would ultimately be in ationary, and indeed, this\nwas widely viewed as a large part of the problem leading to\nglobal in ation during this era.2 Indeed, during the past six\nyears I have warned along with many others that the\nCommittee's ZIRP has put the U.S. economy at\nconsiderable risk of future in ation. In fact, my monetarist\nbackground urges me to continue to make this warning\nright now!\nIn any case, after seven years, one might want to consider\nother models. One important possibility is that the 1970s\nwere an era when U.S. monetary policy was not very\ncredible with respect to ghting in ation, whereas the\n2000s were an era when U.S. monetary policy had already\nearned a lot of credibility for keeping in ation low and\nstable. One way to interpret this is to say that market\nexpectations of future in ation today move to stay in line\nwith the FOMC's desired policy rate instead of becoming\n\"unanchored\" as they did in the 1970s. In particular, this\nwould mean that a low nominal interest rate peg, far from\nbeing a harbinger of runaway in ation, would instead\ndictate medium- and longer-run low in ation outcomes.\nThis theme is sometimes labelled \"neo-Fisherian,\" because\nit emphasizes that the Fisher equation holds in virtually all\nmodern macroeconomic models. The Fisher equation\nstates that the nominal interest rate can be decomposed\ninto a real interest rate component and an expected\nin ation component. If we view the real interest rate as\ndetermined by supply and demand conditions in the private\nsector, then a permanent nominal interest rate peg would\nalso pin down the long-run rate of in ation. The Fisher\nequation implies, among other things, that the monetary\nauthority cannot choose the long-run value of the nominal\npolicy interest rate separately from the long-run value of\nin ation.\nThis Fisher effect is well known and is not likely to be\ndisputed in macroeconomic circles. However, how long\nbefore this Fisher effect sets in? Over what time period can\nthe monetary authority maintain an interest rate peg before\nthe peg itself begins to pull in ation expectations in a\ndirection consistent with the peg? Is seven years a\nsu cient length of time? How about 20 years, as in Japan?\nCochrane (2015)\n\n\fA new paper by Cochrane (2015) provides an interesting\nanalysis of this issue in the context of the most canonical\nof modern macroeconomic models, the linearized threeequation New Keynesian model.3 I will not provide any\ndetails of the model here, but for those who are unfamiliar\nwith it, I will brie y describe its essential ingredients. The\nkey friction in the model is that prices are sticky, meaning\nthat they do not adjust immediately in response to supply\nand demand conditions. Households and rms solve\noptimization problems taking the friction as given. The\npolicymaker controls a one-period nominal interest rate,\nand through this channel can have temporary effects on\nreal output and in ation. The Fisher equation holds at all\ntimes. The model can be described by three simple\nequations that depend on expectations of future real\noutput, future in ation and future monetary policy. The\nspirit of Cochrane's analysis is to suggest that neoFisherian effects are part of even the most ordinary of\nmacroeconomic models used to inform current monetary\npolicy.\nCochrane (2015) uses a solution technique for the model\ndue to Werning (2012). We can think of the economy as\ncontinuing from the distant past to the distant future. The\npolicymaker chooses the short-term nominal interest rate\nsequence, and, given this sequence, the model traces out\nwhat would happen to the real output gap (x) and in ation\n(π).\nI use Cochrane's model to trace out the effects on the\neconomy of the following thought experiment. Suppose the\neconomy begins with the nominal interest rate equal to 2\npercent, a real interest rate equal to 0 percent (for\nconvenience), and an in ation rate equal to 2 percent. The\nFisher equation holds, as it must, so that in the long run the\npolicy rate will equal the in ation rate in this example. The\npolicymaker then lowers the policy rate by 200 basis points\nto zero, and leaves it there for a considerable time.\nFigure 1 illustrates the effect of such a policy experiment in\nCochrane's (2015) model. The green triangles show the\npolicy rate, which begins at 200 basis points, but is lowered\nto zero at date 0. If the policy move is anticipated, as many\nactual policy moves are, then the effects on in ation are\ndescribed by the red squares, and the effects on the real\noutput gap are given by the black circles. If the policy\nchange is completely unanticipated, then the effects on\nin ation are given by the magenta squares, and the effects\non the real output gap are given by the blue circles. In the\ncase of a \"surprise\" policy move, nothing happens until the\ndate of the move, whereupon the in ation and real output\ngap variables jump to the path they would have been on,\nhad the policy change been known in advance. For our\npurposes here, it does not matter that much if we focus on\nan anticipated or an unanticipated policy change.\n\n\fInstead, I want to focus on the right hand side of this\npicture, after the policy move has occurred. The\npolicymaker has lowered the policy rate to zero, and in\nresponse, the real output gap has increased.4 This is one\nway to gauge the real effects of monetary policy according\nto the model: A pure change in the policy rate, with no other\nshocks occurring, would temporarily increase output. This\nis what the model is designed to do, and if we added more\nshocks to the model, the policymaker could use this power\nappropriately to smooth real output over time. Smoother\noutput would be preferred to more volatile output by the\nhouseholds in the model, and thus the model provides a\ntheory of monetary stabilization policy.\nBut now let us look at in ation in response to the policy\nchange. It falls in response to the policy change, very little\nat rst, but more substantially as the zero interest rate\npolicy continues. After about 2.5 years (10 quarters), at the\nfar right of the chart, the transitory effects of the policy\nchange have nearly completely died out. The real output\ngap is zero, the policy rate remains at zero, and the in ation\nrate has fallen to zero. This can be interpreted as a neoFisherian result: The policy rate is lowered, and after some\ntransitory dynamics, the in ation rate falls to be consistent\nwith the new interest rate peg.\n\nFigure 1. The policy rate falls 200 basis points. Adapted\nfrom Cochrane (2015).\nIt is clear from Figure 1 that, should the policymaker simply\nelect to keep the nominal interest rate at zero for a much\nlonger time, nothing further would happen in this economy.\nThe black, red and green lines would simply remain at zero.\nCochrane's (2015) analysis, as I have translated it into\nFigure 1, yields a very different interpretation of current\nevents compared to conventional wisdom. Conventional\ndescriptions of current monetary policy, including my own\ndescription earlier in this very speech, suggest that the\nCommittee's ZIRP is putting upward pressure on in ation,\nperhaps dangerously so. Figure 1 suggests otherwise.\nWhat's going on? The model does have a Phillips curve in\nthat today's in ation rate does depend in part on today's\nreal output gap. When the policy rate is lowered, the output\n\n\fgap is higher than it otherwise would have been, and this\ndoes put upward pressure on in ation in the model.5\nHowever, the model also has a Fisher relation, which\nmeans that as the real output gap returns to normal (that\nis, monetary neutrality asserts itself), the in ation rate will\nhave to fall to be consistent with the new level of the\nnominal interest rate. Another aspect is that the\npolicymaker is viewed as choosing the interest rate\nsequence, and in ation follows as dictated by the Fisher\nequation. The policymaker cannot set the nominal interest\nrate and the in ation target in an inconsistent way.\nA few of you may be aware of a closely related analysis by\nBenhabib, Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2001) that I have\nchampioned in discussing dimensions of monetary policy\nsince 2007-2009.6 In that analysis the Fisher relation also\nplays a prominent role, but the analysis is nonlinear and\nglobal. Benhabib et al. (2001) nd two steady states, one\nof which is associated with a low nominal interest rate and\nin ation below target. Arguments in this context then\ncenter around which of the two steady states is the stable\none in a reasonable expectation dynamic (\"learning\"). Often\nthe argument is that the traditional steady state is the\nstable one and therefore the one worthy of the most\nattention from policymakers.7 The Cochrane (2015)\nanalysis is of a linear system, and consequently ideas\nabout \"getting stuck at the wrong steady state\" are not\nnearly as clear. Rational expectations prevail at all times.8\nTo illustrate that policymakers can reverse their actions in\nthe Cochrane (2015) model, Figure 2 illustrates an\nalternative policy experiment. This experiment is almost\nthe same as the one described in Figure 1, except that the\npolicymaker chooses the nominal policy rate sequence to\nremain at zero for seven years before gradually raising the\npolicy rate back to 2 percent.\n\nFigure 2. A gradual policy rate increase. Adapted from\nCochrane (2015).\nThe left hand side of Figure 2 simply repeats what is in\nFigure 1. The middle portion of Figure 2 shows how the\ncase where the policy rate remains near zero simply keeps\nthe in ation rate low and the output gap steady as the\neffects of the rst policy move wear off. The gradual policy\n\n\frate increase is shown in the right hand portion of Figure 2\nvia the green triangles. This policy move is portrayed as\nbeing anticipated here, so in ation and the output gap\nbegin to react before the actual date of liftoff. The rising\nrate environment puts downward pressure on the output\ngap, reversing the effects of the previous policy rate move.\nAs before, in ation moves in tandem with the policy rate as\nthe Fisher equation asserts itself.\nIs this what will actually happen in the U.S. economy?\nDe nitely not, since we are looking here at pure policy\neffects with no other shocks added to the model. At best,\nFigures 1 and 2 can illustrate the directions that monetary\npolicy can be expected to push in this particular model, but\na more realistic analysis would include additional shocks,\nand monetary policy would have to react appropriately to\nthose changes in macroeconomic conditions. Still, the key\npoint is that this canonical model has a clear interpretation\nin neo-Fisherian terms, and that this interpretation is hardly\nsurprising, since the Fisher equation is built into the model.\nI have spent a lot of my time with these particular gures\nbecause I think they are interesting and can communicate\nto a wide audience in the monetary policymaking\ncommunity. But I do want to stress that the New Keynesian\nmodel is just one model in a sea of possibilities. In\naddition, it is a model that was designed to describe the\nrelatively good monetary policy in the U.S. from 1984-2007,\nwithout features that turned out to be quite important\nduring the 2007-2009 crisis and its aftermath. While I do\nnot have time to emphasize other more novel work here, let\nme just say that there is important recent work in monetary\ntheory and policy that has tried to explain very low real\nrates of return on safe assets along with the implications\nfor monetary policy. Andolfatto and Williamson (2015), for\ninstance, think of all consolidated government debt as\nhaving value in conducting transactions. Their model has a\nliquidity premium on government debt under some\ncircumstances, and offers novel interpretations of current\npolicy dilemmas. Caballero and Farhi (2015) similarly study\nsafe asset shortages and suggest important ways that our\nunderstanding of the effectiveness of various policies at\nthe zero lower bound would be affected. These are just\nsome examples of interesting work going on outside the\nrelatively narrow New Keynesian framework to try to come\nto terms with the reality of the post-crisis macroeconomy.\nEmpirical Evidence\nFigures 1 and 2 suggest that low nominal interest rates and\nlow in ation may go hand-in-hand, at least over relatively\nlong horizons in which the policy rate is kept at a constant\nlevel. Over shorter horizons with more policy moves and\nmore shocks, the correlation may not be very high. Policy\nrates have generally been very low, near zero, continuously\nin the G-7 economies since the 2007-2009 period.\nConsequently, we may be able to look at the data since\n\n\f2009 to see to what extent neo-Fisherian effects are\nexerting themselves in the G-7.9\nTo get at this issue in just one picture, Figure 3 shows the\ncentered ve-quarter moving average of the G-7 headline\nin ation rate and the average, GDP-weighted, G-7 nominal\npolicy rate since 2002.\n\nFigure 3. G-7 countries' aggregated in ation and policy\nrates. Source: OECD's Main Economic Indicators and\nauthor's calculations. Last observation: September 2015.\nIn Figure 3, the in ation rate is the solid line on the right\nhand scale, and the GDP-weighted nominal policy rate is\nthe dotted line on the left hand scale. The horizontal green\nline is an in ation rate of 2 percent, and the horizontal\nblack line is an in ation rate of negative 1 percent. The\nvertical line in the middle of Figure 3 marks the LehmanAIG event. On the left part of Figure 3, interest rates and\nin ation arguably behaved according to traditional\ninterpretations of New Keynesian theory. On the right half\nof Figure 3, the nominal policy rate falls to near zero and\nremains there. In ation initially falls across the G-7, but\nthen impressively returns close to target. In fact, in ation\nwas above target as of the beginning of 2012, about 2.5\nyears after the end of the recession in the U.S. Since then,\nhowever, policy rates have remained near zero and in ation\nhas drifted down, to the point where G-7 in ation is around\nzero today.\nConventional wisdom would have suggested that the zero\npolicy rates in the G-7 were putting upward pressure on\nin ation during the nearly four years since January 2012,\nbut instead, in ation fell. This could be viewed as\nconsistent with neo-Fisherian effects asserting\nthemselves. Of course, we have to be cautious about\ncarrying such an explanation too far. There have been\nmany other shocks during the past four years, notably a\nvery large oil price shock beginning in the summer of 2014.\nConsequences\nLet us suppose for the sake of argument that the G-7\neconomies will spend still more time at or near the zero\n\n\flower bound. This would occur because either liftoff does\nnot materialize in most or all countries or because\nadditional negative shocks drive those countries that do\nraise their policy rates back to the zero lower bound.\nPrudent policymaking suggests that we should at least\nentertain this as a realistic possibility for the path of G-7\nmonetary policy in the coming years. What are the\nconsequences of remaining in such a state for a long\nperiod of time?10\nI can think of six consequences, based on the discussion in\nthe earlier part of this speech:\nFirst, consider the near-zero policy rate path illustrated on\nthe right hand side of Figure 1. In this situation, promising\nto keep the nominal interest rate sequence at the zero\nlower bound simply reinforces the equilibrium and does not\nprovide accommodation as in the traditional New\nKeynesian equilibrium. Nothing happens in response to\nsuch promises. Policymakers would have to come to grips\nwith such a situation.\nSecond, in such a situation, in ation remains persistently\nbelow the stated in ation target. The near-zero policy rate\nis not putting upward pressure on in ation, but is instead\nthrough the Fisher equation dictating a rate of in ation\nlower than the original target. It could be that policymakers\ndo not intend to return to the original equilibrium—that is,\nthey may intend to remain with the near-zero policy rate. In\nthat case, policymakers may wish to lower the in ation\ntarget to remain more consistent with the actual in ation\noutcomes.\nThird, longer-run economic growth would still be driven by\nhuman capital accumulation and technological progress,\nas always, but without the accompanying stabilization\npolicy as conventionally practiced from 1984-2007. In\nprinciple, the economy would still be expected to grow at a\npace dictated by fundamentals.11\nFourth, the celebrated Friedman rule would arguably be\nachieved, so that household and business cash needs are\nsatiated. In many monetary models this is a desirable state\nof affairs.\nFifth, the risk of asset price uctuations may be high. In the\nNew Keynesian model, the near-zero interest rate policy\nwith little or no response to incoming shocks is associated\nwith equilibrium indeterminacy. This means there are many\npossible equilibria, all of which are consistent with rational\nexpectations and market clearing. In a nutshell, a lot of\nthings can happen. Many of the possible equilibria are\nexceptionally volatile. One could interpret this theoretical\nsituation as consistent with the idea that excessive asset\nprice volatility is a risk.\nSixth, and nally, the limits on operating monetary policy\nthrough ordinary short-term nominal interest rate\n\n\fadjustment in this situation would surely continue to re a\nsearch for alternative ways to conduct monetary\nstabilization policy. The favored approach during the past\nve years within the G-7 economies has been quantitative\neasing, and there would surely be pressure to use this or\nrelated tools.12\nConclusion\nDuring 2015, I have been an advocate of beginning to\nnormalize the policy rate in the U.S. My arguments have\nfocused on the idea that the U.S. economy is quite close to\nnormal today based on an unemployment rate of 5 percent,\nwhich is essentially at the Committee's estimate of the\nlong-run rate, and in ation net of the 2014 oil price shock\nonly slightly below the Committee's target. The\nCommittee's policy settings, in contrast, remain as extreme\nas they have ever been since the 2007-2009 crisis. The\npolicy rate remains near zero, and the Fed's balance sheet\nis more than $3.5 trillion larger than it was before the\ncrisis. Prudence alone suggests that, since the goals of\npolicy have been met, we should be edging the policy rate\nand the balance sheet back toward more normal settings.\nImplicit in my argument has been a yearning to return to\nthe monetary equilibrium of 1984-2007, which is one\naround which a great deal of theory and empirical work has\nbeen done. We would be returning to a world in which\nmonetary policy is better understood, the effects of\npolicies are more closely calibrated, and private sector\nexpectations can move and adapt to ordinary adjustments\nof the policy rate.\nMy current policy views have not changed. But in the spirit\nof the conference, I have tried to contribute to the topic of\n\"Rethinking Monetary Policy\" by focusing on a situation\nwhere the nominal policy rate and the in ation rate remain\nlow, either because liftoff does not materialize or because\nfuture negative shocks to the economy force a return to the\nzero interest rate policy. I have illustrated by reference to\nrelatively new research how such a situation could become\npermanent. In addition, I have suggested several\nconsequences of remaining at such an equilibrium over the\nlong term. It is my hope that my characterizations here will\nspur further thinking and research on these important\ntopics.\nEndnotes\n1\n\nThe views expressed here are my own and do not\n\nnecessarily re ect the views of others on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee.
