Williams, special research assistant to the\npresident, provided assistance. I take full responsibility for\nerrors. The views expressed are mine and do not\nnecessarily re ect o cial positions of the Federal Reserve\nSystem.\n\nIntroduction\n\nJames Bullard\n\nThe U.S. economy continues to face substantial turmoil.\nFinancial markets are under unusual stress. Wall Street has\nbeen racked by seismic change. Uncertainty over the future\nprospects for the U.S. economy has caused consumers\nand businesses to pull back on discretionary consumption\nand investment spending. Doubts concerning the true\nvalue of complex securities continue to weigh heavily on\n\nPresident and Chief\nExecutive O cer\n\nnancial markets worldwide. The still-uncertain fate of\nhousing markets has kept the value of the underlying\nmortgage assets obscured.\n\nPhotos\n\nThe Federal Reserve has been active and innovative in\nresponding to the evolving turmoil during 2008. In addition\nto deploying interest rate cuts, the Fed has implemented a\nseries of new and unconventional tools. This innovation\nhas intensi ed in response to market events over the past\nseveral weeks. There may be many more twists and turns\nin the policy response going forward.\nTonight I will discuss the challenges my Federal Reserve\ncolleagues and I face as we strive to implement a policy\nthat is designed to deliver low and stable in ation along\nwith maximum sustainable employment.\nTo organize my talk, I will describe three funerals and a\nwedding—that is, three ideas about the U.S. economy that\nmay be going to their nal resting place and one idea that,\n\nBio\nCurriculum Vitae\nStaff Contacts\nIDEAS/RePEc Pro le\n\nVideos\nSubscribe:\nEmail alerts\nRSS\n\"Rationally, let it be said in a\nwhisper, experience is certainly\nworth more than theory.\"\nAmerigo Vespucci\n\n\fonce left for dead, may be taking on a new life. I will keep\nyou all in suspense about what ideas I have in mind.\nAs always, any views expressed here are my own and do\nnot necessarily re ect the o cial views of other Federal\nOpen Market Committee members.\nThe Fate of the Great Moderation\nA common description of current events is that some\ncherished theories about the macroeconomy have been\nshattered. One idea is that the fabled resiliency of the U.S.\neconomy over the past several decades is being called into\nquestion. Policymakers and academics alike have\ndescribed the period since the mid-1980s as the Great\nModeration, meaning that the volatility of the economy has\nbeen markedly lower during recent decades than it was in\nthe earlier part of the postwar era, and certainly much less\nthan during the interwar period during the 1920s and\n1930s. Now, that moderation and resiliency may be coming\nunraveled. If so, it would be a funeral for the Great\nModeration.\nIs it really true that the Great Moderation is coming to an\nend? My sense is that it is too early to tell. Let's begin with\na description of why policymakers and academics started\ntalking about moderation and resiliency in the rst place.\nThe main idea is simple: Our primary measures of\nmacroeconomic performance have been a lot less volatile\nthan they were before 1984. In particular, quarterly GDP\ngrowth rates for the U.S. economy since 1945 show a clear\nchange in behavior beginning in the middle 1980s. After\n1984, these growth rates are only about half as volatile as\nthey were during the earlier period.(1) So, for the past 25\nyears, growth rate volatility has dramatically moderated\nfrom what it was in the 1950s, '60s, and '70s.\nFurthermore, this phenomenon is not limited to real GDP\ngrowth rates. Almost all macroeconomic data have been\ndramatically less volatile since the mid-1980s, according to\nacademic research.(2) So the Great Moderation is a clear\nfeature of the U.S. macroeconomic data since the mid1980s. And, as is often the case when the data show a\nclear pattern, theories abound about the causes of this\nphenomenon. But all the theories have a common theme—\nnamely, that some important macroeconomic event\ntriggered a more stable, more resilient American economy\nover the past 25 years.\nUnderstandably, many are yearning for a sense of stability\ntoday, and many are questioning what happened to the\nresiliency and moderation in the U.S. economy. Two areas\nstand out where volatility has been particularly high since\nthe current nancial turmoil began in earnest in August of\n2007. One is in certain interest rates and interest rate\nspreads, especially in markets that have experienced\nsevere di culties since the turmoil began. The closely\nwatched LIBOR-Overnight Index Swap spread, for instance,\n\n\fpeaked at more than 300 basis points before retreating in\nrecent weeks. In July of 2007, this spread was less than 10\nbasis points. Another is in equity markets: The Wilshire\n5000 stock price index, one of the broadest measures of\nequity valuation, is currently trading near its lows of 2002\nand 2003. The Chicago Board Options Exchange market\nvolatility index, or VIX, has often been above 60 during\nOctober and November of this year; in July of 2007 it was\nbelow 20. The dramatic rise in volatility based on numbers\nlike these is clear.\nStill, it is far too early to organize a funeral for the Great\nModeration. Even though nancial market volatility is\nexceptionally high and even though the U.S. economy is\ncontracting during the second half of 2008, the demise of\nthe Great Moderation would require much more evidence\nthan currently exists. Real economic variables, in particular,\nwould have to swing much more than they have to date,\nand the increased volatility would have to continue for a\nnumber of years before we could start to compare the\ncurrent environment to the pre-1984 experience and\npronounce the moderation dead. So far, real GDP has fallen\nby 0.3 percent at an annual rate, which is the number\nreported for the third quarter of this year. To be sure,\ncurrent quarter output is expected to fall sharply, followed\nby further but less-severe contraction in the rst quarter of\n2009. If that scenario materializes, the contour of the\ncurrent recession will look much the same as that of the\n1990-91 recession. As bad as that feels, it is not enough to\nundo 25 years of moderated behavior in the U.S. economy.\nChanges in the Financial Marketplace\nIt is no secret that the current nancial market turmoil has\nbrought about once-unimaginable changes on Wall Street.\nOne telling sign of the magnitude of these changes is that\nthe U.S. economy began the year with ve large investment\nbanks, but will exit the year with zero. Without question, the\npast 15 months of nancial market turmoil is radically\naltering the nature of U.S. nancial intermediation. I think it\nis fair to say that we are witnessing a funeral for the\nnancial system we knew over the past two decades.\nA key culprit has been the illiquidity of mortgage-backed\nsecurities and related nancial instruments. Many nancial\nrms simply did not manage risk exposure on these\nsecurities well and, as a result, have struggled with losses\nand write-downs. The International Monetary Fund has\nestimated that more than $1.4 trillion of losses will have to\nbe absorbed by the nancial sector before all is said and\ndone in this episode, and that only a portion of these\nlosses has been accounted for to date.(3) The opacity of\nthe nancial instruments involved has kept everyone\nguessing as to where these losses truly lie, which explains\na lot about how events have unfolded during 2008. No rm\nhas an incentive to declare that they may suffer debilitating\nlosses, and; so, markets have to discover which rms are\n\n\finsolvent and which are likely to survive and build market\nshare in the post-shakeout industry structure. The sharp\ndownturn in the real economy during the fall has intensi ed\nthe pressure. In the meantime, rms have become wary of\ntrading with one another, certain markets have ceased\nnormal functioning, and market participants and\npolicymakers alike have been confronted with a series of\nannouncements from rms near bankruptcy. In a recent\nNew York Times editorial, Treasury Secretary Paulson\nnamed the litany of rms experiencing \"failure, or the\nequivalent of failures\": Bear Stearns, IndyMac, Lehman\nBrothers, Washington Mutual, Wachovia, Fannie Mae,\nFreddie Mac and the American International Group.\"(4)\nThe Federal Reserve has been forced to improvise in\nresponse to rms' announcements of this nature. The key\nconcern has been that, if important nancial market\nplayers are failing, the failure should occur in an orderly\nway with the lowest level of market disruption. In the\nbanking sector, there are well-established procedures for\nresolving a failed institution in an orderly way. These\nprocedures have served the nation well both during the\ncurrent crisis and during the savings and loan episode\nduring the late 1980s and early 1990s. It is very important\nto recognize that in the non-bank nancial sector today\nthere are no such procedures. This regulatory gap is likely\nto be a primary focal point for discussions of the future of\nnancial market regulation. In particular, any reform has to\naddress the question of whether and how to set up\nsystems to resolve failing non-bank nancial rms in an\norderly way.(5) The current system—bankruptcy court—is\nnot working.\nAs the shakeout process has unfolded this year, markets\nhave been continually bracing for further surprise\nannouncements from nancial rms. The policy response\nto this situation has been exceptionally aggressive.\nConsider the S&P 500 largest nancial rms by assets as\nof the fourth quarter of 2007. The rst 47 rms on the list\naccounted for 95 percent of the total assets held by the\nsector at that date. As of mid-summer 2008, just one of\nthese nancial rms had been the focus of a direct policy\nresponse of any kind. That rm was Bear Stearns, which,\nback in March, was purchased by JPMorgan Chase with\nhelp from the Fed. Almost all the others were operating as\nthey had during recent years. The situation is dramatically\ndifferent today. As of today, 20 out of the 47 have received\ncapital injections under the Treasury's TARP effort. Three\nof these are non-bank nancial rms that changed their\ncharters to become bank holding companies, including two\nof the largest rms on the list, Goldman Sachs and Morgan\nStanley, and, just recently, American Express. Several other\nrms on the list merged with stronger partners, including\nCountrywide Financial and Merrill Lynch (both acquired by\nBank of America), National City (acquired by PNC),\nWachovia (acquired by Wells Fargo) and Sovereign\nBancorp (proposed acquisition by Banco Santander). The\n\n\fassets and debt obligations of Washington Mutual were\npurchased by JPMorgan Chase. Lehman Brothers went to\nbankruptcy court, but important portions of the company\nwere acquired by Barclay's Capital. Fannie Mae and Freddie\nMac were placed into conservatorship. American\nInternational Group has a restructured loan arrangement\nwith the Treasury and the Federal Reserve. These events\nhave touched 31 of the 47 rms on the list. This means\nthat much of the uncertainty surrounding the fate of U.S.\nnancial companies has been addressed in one manner or\nanother during the past several months. Turmoil is still\nsigni cant, to be sure, but the policy response has been\nvery aggressive, and many of the largest uncertainties have\nbeen addressed.\nFuneral for a Friend\nThe nancial market turmoil began during the summer of\n2007. The initial analysis—widely accepted among\npolicymakers and forecasters—suggested that problems in\nthe subprime sector of the mortgage markets were unlikely\nto be large enough to have a substantial impact on the U.S.\neconomy outside of the nancial sector. Markets seemed\nto con rm this judgment during the fall of 2007, as equity\nindexes peaked. Late last year, however, it became\napparent that problems were going to be more di cult and\nlong-lasting than the original analysis suggested. Real GDP\ngrowth in the fourth quarter of last year was slightly\nnegative based on the revised data available today.\nEmployment growth turned negative in January 2008.\nThe Fed responded to the weakening economy by easing\naggressively, lowering the target federal funds rate by 225\nbasis points during the rst few months of the new year, all\nthe way down to 2 percent. During the summer, the FOMC\nwent on hold, but intensi ed turmoil during the fall\ncombined with weaker-than-expected data on the real\neconomy triggered further easing moves during the past\nseveral weeks. This has left the FOMC with a federal funds\ntarget at the 1 percent level, with further easing possible as\nweak data roll in over the next several months.\nWhether the FOMC decides to stay on hold at this point or\neases further and then stays on hold at some lower level,\neven zero, may not be the most critical question. The fact\nis, monetary policy de ned as movements in short-term\nnominal interest rates is coming to an end, at least for now.\nIt's a funeral for a friend.\nThe end of nominal interest rate targeting in the U.S. for the\nnear term means that much more attention will have to be\npaid to alternative ideas about controlling in ation and\nin ation expectations going forward. An important\ncharacteristic of the current environment is that mediumterm in ation expectations seem to be spreading out\ndramatically, with some analysis warning of high in ation,\nothers warning of de ation and still others expecting\nin ation to remain near the levels recently experienced.\n\n\fOne focus of analysis over the coming quarters will be the\nexperience in Japan. Japan was buffeted by large declines\nin equity and real estate markets in the early 1990s. In\nresponse, the Bank of Japan lowered nominal interest\nrates to near-zero by the middle of that decade, and it has\nnot been above 1 percent since. An important part of the\noutcome in Japan has been a rate of de ation that has\naveraged about 1 percent since the mid-1990s. De ation,\nshould it occur in the U.S., might be particularly challenging\nbecause some of the core problems we have are in\nhousing markets, where contracts are written in nominal\nterms. An unexpected de ation would make those\ncontracts more expensive for borrowers.\nOne idea from the Japanese experience is that, with\nnominal interest rates at very low levels, more attention\nmay have to be paid to quantitative measures of monetary\npolicy. By announcing and maintaining targets for key\nmonetary quantities, the Fed may be able to keep in ation\nand in ation expectations near target and ward off either a\ndrift toward de ation or excessively high in ation. This will\nbe an important issue for the Fed in coming months and\nrepresents a challenge in the communication of monetary\npolicy going forward.\nA Rebirth\nSo far, I have discussed three funerals, ideas whose times\nmay have passed. I now want to turn to a macroeconomic\nidea that is being rehabilitated as we speak. That idea is\nscal policy, in particular the spending side of scal policy\nand the idea of more direct intervention in the affairs of\nprivate sector rms.\nAt least since the 1980s, scal policy de ned by de cit\nspending has had a negative connotation in many\nmacroeconomic policy circles. Former Council of\nEconomic Advisers Chairman N. Greg Mankiw, writing in\n1991, listed as his \"dubious Keynesian proposition #4\" the\nidea that \" scal policy is a powerful tool for economic\nstabilization.\" He included this sentence: \"In the United\nStates today, scal policymakers have completely\nabdicated responsibility for economic stabilization.\"(6)\nThat was 1991, but I think it is a fair assessment of the\nthinking in much of the economics profession up until the\ncurrent nancial market turmoil. Fiscal policy, at least in\nthe U.S., was viewed as important for the macroeconomy,\nbut from a longer-run perspective. To the extent there are\nstabilization goals—goals requiring time-critical policy\ninterventions—the usual idea is that certain types of tax\ncuts might be bene cial, but that otherwise the effort is\nbest left to monetary policy. Not least in this thinking is\nthat the Fed can act relatively quickly, while the political\nprocess tends to be much slower and more cumbersome.\nYet, during the past two months in particular, scal policy\nconceived of as more direct intervention in the operation of\nprivate sector rms has emerged as a leading tool to\n\n\fcombat ongoing nancial market turmoil. This is so, not\njust in the U.S., but globally. The passage of the Emergency\nEconomic Stabilization Act (EESA), with authorization for\nthe Treasury to spend up to $700 billion to help return\nnancial markets to more normal operation, has put the\nfocus going forward squarely on scal responses. This has\ncreated, in a matter of weeks, a very different policy\nenvironment from the one that had existed in the U.S.\nduring the past 25 years.\nThe original idea behind the EESA was to create a market\nfor the illiquid asset-backed securities and related\ninstruments that are at the heart of the present situation.\nThese assets have current prices, to the extent that they\ncan be determined, that are very low, the so-called re sale\nprice, because so many rms would like to sell their\nholdings and few buyers exist in the current climate.\nHowever, these securities also have a higher, hold-tomaturity price that re ects the likely value of the stream of\nrevenue for a patient investor who is willing to simply hold\nthe asset for a period of time. Under the original EESA\nproposal, the government would play the role of the patient\ninvestor, buying the securities at a reverse auction and\nholding them or selling them at a future moment when\nnancial market stress has receded. In principle, this idea\ncould be executed at no ultimate cost to the taxpayer,\nalthough taxpayer money would be put at risk. An\nimportant part of the concept is that taxpayer money\nwould be used to purchase assets that would then be sold\nin the future, recouping most or all of the initial outlay. The\ngovernment would not have to purchase all assets, only\nenough to credibly create a market. I thought such a\nprogram, if it could be executed on a su cient scale, may\nhave helped to liquefy illiquid asset-backed securities\nmarkets and so may have helped progress toward an\norderly nancial market consolidation. This in turn would\nhave helped to reduce or eliminate the downside risk to\neconomic performance.\nAs events have transpired, the asset-purchase program has\nbeen put on hold. Given the rapid ow of events, capital\npurchases came to be viewed as a simpler, more timely\nand more direct method of intervention. The Treasury's\ncapital injection program, for which $250 billion is\ncommitted, has taken the bulk of the resources from the\nrst $350 billion tranch of the $700 billion appropriation.\nRestructuring of the deal with American Insurance Group\nhas taken an additional $40 billion. With $60 billion\nremaining, Secretary Paulson has indicated that he does\nnot want to commit further funds at this point without input\nfrom the new administration. Also, the remaining amount\nfrom the rst tranch may be too small to run an effective\nprogram.\nConclusions\n\n\fTonight I talked about three funerals and a wedding. The\nongoing nancial market turmoil may have caused the\ndeath of many cherished ideas about how the\nmacroeconomy operates. One funeral was for the idea of\nthe Great Moderation. Certainly nancial markets have\nseen exceptional volatility recently, and some behavior in\nthose markets has been unprecedented. Still, I am not\nready to bury the Great Moderation yet—we will need a lot\nmore very volatile data on the real side of the economy to\ntruly depart from the experience of the past 25 years. A\nsecond funeral was for our nancial system as we have\nknown it. That transformation has occurred and continues,\nwith repercussions for U.S. and global nancial market\nregulation. A third funeral was for monetary policy de ned\nas nominal interest rate targeting. At least over the near\nterm, any additional in uence through interest rate\nreductions will be limited, and the focus of monetary policy\nmay turn to quantity measures. The wedding—the idea on\nthe rise—is scal policy de ned as more direct intervention\nin certain parts of the private sector. While the Fed will\ncontinue to be innovative in providing liquidity to markets\nthrough existing facilities and possibly some new\nprograms, an important part of the response to ongoing\nnancial market turmoil will come from scal policy\nintervention. This runs counter to much of the thinking in\nmacroeconomic policy circles over the past two decades.\nIt may be discomforting or rewarding or both, but\nstabilization policy in the coming months and quarters is\nlikely to look very different from what we have been\naccustomed to seeing.\nFootnotes\n1.

        "content": "President’s Welcome\nJames Bullard\n\nA\n\ns president of the Bank, it is my\npleasure to welcome you to the ThirtyThird Annual Policy Conference of\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.\nThis conference concerns measurement of\nthe economy’s potential output. The concept of\npotential output is straightforward to define—the\neconomy’s maximum sustained level of output—\nbut difficult to measure. Inclusion of the term\nsustained suggests that the concept of potential\ngrowth is closely tied to inflation—a low, stable\ninflation rate is essential if an economy is to\nattain maximum economic growth and, hence,\nremain through time at or near its potential level\nof output.\nIn macroeconomic stabilization theory and\npractice, the concept of potential growth has a\nlong history. Early analyses focused on the output\ngap. Fortunately, belief in an exploitable long-run\ntradeoff between the unemployment rate and\nthe rate of inflation was rejected by economists\ndecades ago. Today’s classical and New Keynesian\nmodels suggest that, given enough time for adjustment and a benign pattern of shocks, the economy\nwill adjust in the long run toward its potential\nlevel of output. The speed of such adjustment\ndepends on the relative flexibility or inflexibility\nof wages, prices, and expectations—aptly summarized by Keynes’s quip that “In the long run,\nwe are all dead.” But, taken literally, Keynes’s\ncall to action, as we now recognize, can be quite\ndangerous when near-term preliminary data\ncontain significant uncertainty and measure-\n\nment error, as demonstrated by the papers of\nAthanasios Orphanides, John Williams, and\nSimon van Norden (e.g., Orphanides and\nvan Norden, 2002; and Orphanides and Williams,\n2005).\nThe concept of potential output is an important feature of monetary policymaking. At our\nconference in 2007 in honor of Bill Poole, Lars\nSvensson and Noah Williams (2008, p. 275)\ncharacterized the task of policymakers as seeking\nto “navigate the sea of uncertainty.” Correct economic stabilization policy, like correct navigation,\nrequires a focus on the destination, or long-run\nobjective. The Federal Reserve, in particular, operates with a dual mandate from the Congress to\nachieve both price stability and maximum employment. These goals are not in conflict—both require\nfostering an environment to support maximum\nsustainable growth. Academic policy models,\nwhile differing one from another, typically include\na concept of potential output. Fixed-parameter\npolicy rules, such as the Taylor rule, feature an\noutput gap. Flexible inflation targeting models,\nsuch as those of Lars Svensson (e.g., Svensson,\n1997) emphasize that inflation can, and does, at\ntimes, move away from the desired level. Thus,\nthe choice of an optimal policy that will return\ninflation to its target depends on a tradeoff between\nthe costs of the higher-but-falling inflation and\nany induced output gap (i.e., an output gap judged\nrelative to some measure of potential output). One\nlesson of such models is that, even when monetary policymakers focus solely on achieving price\n\nJames Bullard is president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Review, July/August 2009, 91(4), pp. 179-80.\n\n© 2009, The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.

I take full responsibility for errors. The\nviews expressed are mine and do not necessarily re ect\no cial positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nGood evening.(1) The nancial turmoil in the U.S. has been\ngoing on for more than one year. The investment bank Bear\nStearns collapsed in March, and over the summer the\nhealth of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\nwas called into question. Financial markets have been on\nedge. Financial strains intensi ed two weeks ago with the\nbankruptcy of another investment bank, Lehman Brothers,\nand threatened bankruptcy of insurer American\nInternational Group.\nIn a short period of time, the landscape of Wall Street and\nthe American nancial system has changed radically.\nFinancial market turmoil is widely considered to be the\nprimary near-term threat to U.S. economic performance,\nand market commentary focuses on which nancial\ninstitutions the government considers \"too big\" or \"too\nconnected\" to fail.\nOver the past year, several large global nancial institutions\nhave either failed or have been signi cantly restructured to\navoid failure. But why should any rm, large or small, be\nprotected from failure? After all, in a dynamic, competitive\neconomy, individuals can raise capital, organize rms and\nenter markets. Obsolete rms, either because the demand\nfor their products has declined or their management has\nnot adapted to environmental change, must be allowed to\nfail. Why not apply this principle universally?

If such contagion became\nwidespread, it could severely affect the macroeconomy.\nSystemic concerns were at the heart of many recent public\npolicy decisions. For instance, regarding Bear Stearns,\nChairman Bernanke recently explained: \"Our analyses\npersuaded us . . . that allowing Bear Stearns to fail so\nabruptly at a time when the nancial markets were already\nunder considerable stress would likely have had extremely\nadverse implications for the nancial system and for the\nbroader economy. In particular, Bear Stearns' failure under\nthose circumstances would have seriously disrupted\ncertain key secured funding markets and derivatives\nmarkets and possibly would have led to runs on other\nnancial rms.\"(2)\nIn my remarks this evening I will try to make sense of\nsystemic risk. An important theme of systemic risk is its\nexpectations component: In particular, if a rm is known to\nbe at risk of failure for a substantial period of time, it\ncannot normally be thought to pose important systemic\nrisk. Counterparties in such a case are well aware of the\npossibility of failure and can take action to mitigate their\nown risk. A second theme is that nancial regulation\nshould seek to ensure that no nancial rm is \"too big\" or\n\"too connected\" to fail. The nation needs a regulatory\nregime that can liquidate in an orderly fashion non-bank\nnancial rms that fail the market test. A third theme is\nthat an overly aggressive public sector response to the\npotential failure of a nancial institution can exacerbate\nsystemic risks in the nancial system by creating the\nexpectation that taxpayers will pick up losses for failing\nrms. This is the well-known \"moral hazard\" problem.\nLet me stress that I am presenting my personal views,\nwhich are not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market\nCommittee or the Federal Reserve System.\nWhat Is Systemic Risk?\nLet me begin with a discussion of what is commonly\nmeant by systemic risk and why failures of nancial\ninstitutions sometimes are believed to be more likely to\npose systemic risks than failures of non nancial\ninstitutions.\nSystemic risk is di cult to de ne precisely. The leading\npractical de nition seems to be that \"we know it when we\nsee it.\" In part because systemic risk is considered to be\nsomething of a rare event, it does not play a signi cant role\nin commonly used macroeconomic models. As a\nconsequence, the discussion of systemic risk can be rather\nloose. Macroeconomists sometimes de ne systemic risk\nas the danger of widespread disruption of nancial\nmarkets and institutions that, in turn, affects the\n\n\fmacroeconomy. For example, former Fed Gov. Frederic\nMishkin de nes systemic risk as \"the risk of a sudden,\nusually unexpected, disruption of the information ows in\nnancial markets that prevents them from channeling\nfunds to those who have the most productive pro t\nopportunities.\"(3) A key part of this de nition is the word\n\"unexpected.\" Should a disruption cause nancial markets\nto become badly damaged, all other parts of the economy\nmay be adversely affected because the ensuing level of\nnancial intermediation services may be considerably\nlower than they were before the disruption.\nFor example, consider a banking system. Traditionally,\nbanks have held deposits with other banks to settle\npayments and exchange for services. Large money center\nbanks often hold deposits for hundreds of other banks. The\nfailure of a large money center bank thus could tie up the\ndeposits of other banks, possibly causing large losses for\nthem as well. Continental Illinois Bank was the largest\ncorrespondent bank in the United States when it failed in\n1984. Regulators stepped in to protect Continental's\ncreditors —even those with deposits exceeding the normal\ninsurance limit—to guard against the possible failure of a\nlarge number of banks that held deposits at Continental.\nSystemic risk is often associated with incomplete\ninformation. In the case of a banking system, systemic risk\ncan arise when a bank's depositors—even relatively\nsophisticated depositors, such as other banks—become\nunsure about the condition of the bank in which they hold\ntheir funds. If Continental Illinois' depositors had realized\nthat the bank was nearly insolvent, they would have\nprotected their assets by moving their deposits to banks\nthey considered sound. In fact, many large depositors did\njust that, suggesting that the systemic risk associated with\nContinental's failure was not very large. Indeed, one study\nconcluded that few banks would have suffered signi cant\nlosses even if the FDIC had not fully guaranteed all of the\ndeposits in Continental.(4)\nRecent concern about systemic risk has focused not so\nmuch on depositor runs on depository institutions, but\nrather on investment banks that deal in complex nancial\ncontracts. For example: Suppose Bank A purchases an\noption from Bank B to hedge some risk, perhaps the risk of\na change in the term structure of interest rates. If Bank B\nlater fails, perhaps because of bad investments in the\nhousing market, then the option that Bank A purchased\nbecomes worthless. Thus, Bank A—which thought it was\ncarefully hedging its risk—is adversely affected by Bank B's\nproblems in housing markets.\nOf course, nancial rms can take steps to protect\nthemselves to some degree in simple situations like the\none I just described. Inside the framework of an economic\nmodel, such steps would in fact fully compensate Bank A\nagainst the possible failure of Bank B. The logic of self-\n\n\finterested behavior combined with market clearing would\nlead to an appropriate pricing of risk—Bank A would have\nconsidered the possibility of the failure of Bank B and\ntaken this into account in its contingency plan. The\npossibility of counterparty failure would be fully priced into\nmarket transactions.\nEconomic models are abstractions, of course, but they do\ncontain insight about the world. Is counterparty risk\nsomehow mispriced in actual markets? It may be that, in\nactual markets, nancial arrangements are so complex\nthat the nature of risk that rms face might not be obvious.\nIf so, that may be a challenge for those managing the risks.\nNevertheless, as we saw with Bear Stearns and Lehman\nBrothers, sophisticated investors and counterparties will\ncease to do business with a rm once the rm's weak\ncondition becomes known.\nIn recent years, concerns about bank runs have tended to\ncenter on individual institutions, rather than on the banking\nsystem as a whole. However, sometimes all rms in an\nindustry are \"tarred by the same brush\" and the failure of\none rm leads investors to shun an entire industry. Banking\npanics are the classic example: During the early 1930s,\nbank failures were so widespread that the public shifted a\nlarge portion of their funds out of bank deposits and into\ncash. Many economists believe that the Federal Reserve's\nunwillingness to counteract the resulting decline in the\nnation's money supply was an important cause of the Great\nDepression.\nWhy should the failure of a single rm cause the public to\nbecome suspicious of an entire industry? One answer is\nrelated to the fact that people have imperfect information,\ntheir own private noisy signal, and as a result they may try\nto infer information from the behavior of others. I'll give you\na well-known example. Suppose you are driving down a\nhighway and stop in a small town to eat. There are two\nrestaurants on Main Street. Would you prefer to eat in the\none with the crowded parking lot or the one whose parking\nlot is empty? Many people will infer that the restaurant with\nthe crowded parking lot has better food and go there.\nMany in this audience will know that a situation in which\npeople infer information from the actions of others is\ncalled an \"information cascade,\" and that it is an active eld\nof research. Inferring others' information from their actions\ncan be misleading, however. For example, suppose the rst\nperson to stop for lunch that day chose a restaurant\narbitrarily. That uninformed choice might in uence all the\nsubsequent hungry people who attempt to determine a\nrestaurant's quality from the number of cars parked in its\nlot.\nAs in the restaurant example, if depositors see others\nwithdrawing money from a bank, they might infer that\nthose making withdrawals have private information about\nthe bank's condition. Similarly, if one bank fails, then\n\n\fdepositors—who are unable to independently distinguish\ngood and bad banks—might decide that the problems that\nbrought down the failed bank will also affect other banks.\nAs a consequence, depositors might withdraw their money\nfrom all banks.(5) The collapse of the asset-backed\ncommercial paper market in 2007 appears to exemplify\nsuch herding behavior, because investors shunned the\nasset-backed commercial paper of all issuers more or less\nindiscriminately. Herding may explain why all rms in an\nindustry are \"tarred by the same brush\" by investors, even if\nthey are not necessarily tied to each other through explicit\ncontractual obligations.\nWhy the Financial System Is Special\nNothing I have said thus far about systemic risk is\nnecessarily unique to nancial institutions or markets.\nEven the failure of a non nancial rm, such as an\nautomobile manufacturer, will affect the rm's suppliers\nand distribution networks. Spillovers to the non-auto sector\nwill also occur, but the regional effects might be larger than\nthe national effects. By the same token, a default by an\nairline company on its debt obligations might cause\ninvestors to shun the debt of other airline companies if\ninvestors believed that the default re ected an industrywide problem, such as rising fuel prices. Still, over the past\ndecade, some very large rms have failed, including Enron,\nWorldCom and several major airlines, yet none caused\nsigni cant problems beyond its immediate shareholders,\nemployees, suppliers and customers. In fact, in recent\nyears systemic risk has not been a public policy concern\nwhen a non nancial rm has failed. Rarely would the\nfailure of a non nancial rm threaten the solvency of a\ncompetitor, let alone signi cantly affect the economy more\nbroadly. Instead, failure of a large industry player often\nsuggests opportunity for the remaining players to increase\nmarket share and pro tability.\nWhy do we think the failure of a large nancial rm\npresents risks that the failure of a non nancial rm does\nnot? Several reasons have been emphasized.\nThe rst is interconnectedness. In the normal course of\nbusiness, large commercial and investment banks may\nbecome signi cantly exposed to one another through\ninterbank deposit markets, transactions in over-the-counter\nderivatives, and wholesale payment and settlement\nsystems. Settlement risk—the risk that one party to a\nnancial transaction will default after the other party has\ndelivered—is a big concern for large nancial institutions\nwhose daily exposures routinely run into many billions of\ndollars. The lightning speed with which nancial\ntransactions take place and the complex structures of\nmany banks and securities rms make it especially di cult\nfor a rm to fully monitor the counterparties it deals with,\nlet alone the counterparties of counterparties. A seemingly\nstrong bank that fails quickly may potentially expose other\n\n\frms to large losses. Even rms that do not make direct\ntransactions with the affected bank may be exposed\nthrough their dealings with third parties that do trade with\nthe affected bank.\nA second reason is leverage. Compared with most\nnon nancial rms, banks and other nancial institutions\nare highly leveraged—that is, they have relatively thin\ncapital margins to absorb losses. Firms acquire their\nassets either by selling equity or borrowing funds. If a\nnancial rm has borrowed the equivalent of 95 percent of\nits assets, a 5 percent loss in asset value will render the\nrm insolvent. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the giant\ngovernment-sponsored enterprises that have nanced or\nguaranteed nearly 50 percent of all U.S. home mortgages,\nran into nancial di culties in part because of their\nextreme leverage. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were able\nto operate with very little capital because investors widely\nviewed their debt as guaranteed by the federal government.\nMy predecessor, Bill Poole, warned several years ago that\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac held too little capital and\nwere vulnerable to a downturn in the housing market.(6)\nHis comments were prescient: Both Fannie Mae and\nFreddie Mac have lost billions, prompting sharp declines in\ntheir share prices and ultimately a government\nconservatorship.\nA third reason is maturity mismatch. Not only are nancial\ninstitutions typically highly leveraged, but the nature of\ntheir business entails an inherent mismatch in the\nmaturities of their assets and liabilities that can make\nthem vulnerable to liquidity shocks. Most nancial\nintermediaries borrow short and lend long—that is, they\nfund long-term, relatively illiquid investments with shortterm debt. For example, commercial banks traditionally\nhave used demand deposits, which depositors can\nwithdraw at any time, to fund loans and other long-term\ninvestments. Similarly, many banks and securities rms\nrely heavily on commercial paper, repurchase agreements\n(repos) and other short-term funding sources. If depositors\nsuddenly pull their funds from a commercial bank, or\nlenders cease to roll over the commercial paper or repos\nissued by a securities rm, the bank or securities rm\ncould be forced into bankruptcy. Bear Stearns collapsed\nwhen investors refused to roll over the rm's short-term\ndebt, collateral notwithstanding. Other rms have faced\nsharply higher funding costs as markets have reevaluated\nthe creditworthiness of borrowers. The speed with which\nthe markets can \"turn off the tap\" makes nancial\ninstitutions especially vulnerable to temporary disruptions\nof liquidity in nancial markets. A parallel was the \"hot\nmoney\" that was withdrawn from Thailand and other East\nAsian countries in the late 1990s—or Mexico prior to that.\nRecent Developments in Financial Markets\n\n\fDuring the past several years, a large number of nancial\ninstitutions have built up considerable holdings of\nmortgage-backed securities and related nancial\ninstruments. These securities provided holders with a ow\nof income derived from the monthly mortgage payments of\nthe underlying asset. The recent decline in house prices,\nalong with a slowing economy, caused many homeowners\nto default or walk away from their homes—especially those\nwith nontraditional mortgages. These conditions have\neroded the value of the mortgage-backed securities and\nthus reduced the net wealth of those investors and\ninstitutions that held them.\nThe resulting illiquidity of mortgage-backed securities and\nrelated nancial instruments has caused severe stress for\nthe U.S. nancial system over the past year. Many nancial\nrms simply did not manage risk exposure on these\nsecurities well and, as a result, have struggled with losses\nand write-downs. A nancial sector shakeout has ensued,\none that was entirely appropriate considering the\nmagnitude of the mismanagement involved. As is normal\nduring an industry shakeout, weaker rms are forced into\nbankruptcy or merge with stronger partners, and\nopportunity abounds for those rms that are able to\nsurvive and build market share in the post-shakeout\nindustry structure.\nThe Federal Reserve has responded vigorously in an\nattempt to mitigate the effects of the shakeout on the rest\nof the economy. The key concern has been that if\nimportant nancial market players are failing, the failure\nshould occur in an orderly way with the lowest level of\nmarket disruption. In the banking sector, there are wellestablished procedures for resolving a failed institution in\nan orderly way. It is very important to recognize that in the\nnon-bank nancial sector there are no such procedures.\nThis has kept the Fed improvising, especially during the\nlast seven months.\nThe Bear Stearns episode provided the rst case of a largescale failure. The novelty of the situation suggested that a\nBear Stearns bankruptcy was largely unexpected within\nnancial markets and therefore likely to cause signi cant\nmarket disruption. In that case, the Fed helped arrange a\nmerger with JPMorgan Chase as the stock price of Bear\nStearns was declining toward zero.\nDuring the summer, mortgage giants Fannie Mae and\nFreddie Mac experienced increasing stress, eventually\ninducing an aggressive policy response. Placing these\nentities into conservatorship was largely a Treasury action\nin conjunction with the primary regulator, the Federal\nHousing Finance Agency (FHFA), with only a consultative\nrole for the Federal Reserve. These government sponsored\nenterprises, or GSEs, were previously implicitly backed by\nthe U.S. government, and the recent action makes that\nbacking completely explicit. The GSE conservatorship\n\n\fremoves a key uncertainty from the scene and should help\nto stabilize markets going forward.\nIn recent weeks, the investment bank Lehman Brothers\nappeared to be in a position similar to Bear Stearns. The\nLehman Brothers situation had been evolving for a year,\nand market players had already seen the demise of an\ninvestment bank. In this case, counterparties had plenty of\ntime to assess the potential for Lehman to fail. As a\nconsequence, nancial market participants were less likely\nto have been surprised and signi cant market disruption\nwas judged less probable. In addition, the Fed had\nimplemented additional liquidity facilities in the wake of\nBear Stearns in an attempt to mitigate adverse\nconsequences from future failures. Lehman led for\nbankruptcy. Since then, important pieces of the company\nhave been sold to Barclays Capital. In a related\ndevelopment, investment bank Merrill Lynch agreed to sell\nitself to Bank of America. The two remaining investment\nbanks, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, last week\nchanged their charters to become commercial banks.\nThese events have left the U.S. with no large investment\nbanks.\nOne di culty in dealing with a crisis is the element of\nsurprise. Just as the events surrounding Lehman were\ncoming to a head, solvency problems at insurer American\nInternational Group, with $1.1 trillion in assets, became\nacute. While AIG's stock price had been declining for some\ntime, its demise was rapid and largely unanticipated. A\nbankruptcy ling in the immediate aftermath of Lehman\nwas judged likely to cause signi cant market disruption.\nThe AIG board of directors agreed to a Fed bridge loan. The\nterms included the ouster of the CEO and an interest rate\nset at Libor plus 850 basis points.\nIt is important to stress that the Federal Reserve's intent in\neach of these cases has not been to save these rms but\nto orchestrate an orderly transition for nancial markets as\nthese rms exit the scene in their current form.\nAgain, because of the lack of a regime for the orderly\nresolution of failed institutions in the non-bank nancial\nsector, the Fed was forced to improvise in the Bear Stearns,\nLehman, and AIG episodes. These improvised actions have\nhad mixed success. In the Bear Stearns episode, there was\nsigni cant, but manageable, turmoil in the aftermath of the\nmerger announcement. In the Lehman-AIG episode, there\nwas signi cant turmoil that threatened to spread globally\nto seemingly unrelated markets. Part of this was\nattributable to the largely unexpected nature of the AIG\nbankruptcy threat within 48 hours of Lehman's bankruptcy\nling. The continuing turmoil prompted Treasury Secretary\nPaulson to approach Congress concerning a more\nsystematic method of handling the shakeout in the\nnancial sector.\n\n\fIt is far from clear how nancial market turmoil of this\nmagnitude will ultimately affect the real economy. The\nleading modern example for large economies is Japan,\nwhere substantial problems in real estate and the banking\nsector were followed by a decade or more of sub par\neconomic performance. Many Asian countries involved in\nthe currency crises of 1997 and 1998 suffered through\nsevere recessions. In the U.S., we have been more\nfortunate so far. The 1987 stock market crash has often\nbeen mentioned in conjunction with recent events, but real\nGDP growth was actually strong during the second half of\n1987: Third quarter growth was 3.7 percent, and fourth\nquarter growth was 7.2 percent. At the time, many\nsuggested that the U.S. was in or would immediately go\ninto recession due to nancial market upset. It did not\nhappen, which provides an object lesson about how\ndi cult it can be to really understand what is driving shortterm dynamics in the economy. Similarly, the collapse of\nLong-Term Capital Management occurred in the second\nhalf of 1998, the culmination of a year of turmoil in global\nnancial markets. But U.S. real GDP growth in the second\nhalf of 1998 averaged about 5.5 percent.\nAll of these events offer clues but also differ in important\nways from the current episode. We do not know what will\nhappen this time around, and we should be humble in our\npredictions. Still, these examples suggest that there is\nsubstantial downside risk. There is some possibility of a\nrelatively benign outcome, where the nancial market\nshakeout plays itself out and real economic performance is\nmuted but not disastrous. But there is also some\npossibility of a very adverse outcome in which the entire\neconomy is drawn into a protracted downturn.\nReducing Systemic Risk\nWhat policies can reduce systemic risk in the nancial\nsystem? Systemic risk may be viewed as a classic \"public\ngoods\" problem, in which private rms invest less in the\ngood than is socially desirable because they are unable to\ninternalize all of the bene ts of their investment. For this\nreason, private rms may invest less in minimizing\nsystemic risks than would be socially desirable. In addition,\nit is likely to be di cult for private rms to coordinate their\nactivities to minimize or eliminate systemic risks. Because\nof these problems, government policy can and should play\na constructive role in reducing systemic risks in the\nnancial system. Several proposed changes might reduce\nsystemic risk in nancial markets: enhanced supervision of\nnancial rms; Federal Reserve oversight of payment and\nsettlement systems; and the creation of a framework to\nliquidate investment banks and other securities rms in an\norderly fashion, similar to the framework already in place to\nliquidate commercial banks.\nAny change in regulation should be designed to ensure that\nno rm is \"too big\" or \"too connected\" to fail because of\n\n\fsystemic concerns. Bailouts are expensive—not just\nbecause they commit taxpayer funds, but because they can\nencourage behavior that increases subsequent systemic\nrisk. A rm that expects government protection if its\ninvestments go awry may take bigger gambles than a rm\nthat expects no protection. And if no securities rm were\nallowed to fail, then investors would have little incentive to\nmonitor the activities of the rms in which they invest or to\ndemand higher interest rates on loans to the riskiest rms.\nIn short, the expectation of government intervention in the\nevent of loss reduces market discipline and increases the\nincentive for rms to act imprudently.\nMonetary policy plays an important role in the stability of\nour nancial system. A monetary policy focused on\npreserving long-run price stability will, as a by-product,\npromote nancial stability. By contrast, nancial rms and\nmarkets are less resilient to shocks when the price level is\nunstable. An unstable price level can lead to poor price\nsignals and cause inaccurate forecasts of real returns to\ninvestment projects. Errors in disentangling nominal and\nreal returns can result in a misallocation of resources and\neventually in nancial distress that would not have\noccurred if the price level had been stable. Business\ndecisions based on expectations of continuing in ation\noften turn out badly when in ation falls, resulting in higher\nrates of loan defaults and business failures. In short,\nin ation and in ation instability put an economy's nancial\nsector at risk. Therefore, it is critical that monetary\npolicymakers not lose sight of the importance of\nmaintaining price stability—even during periods of nancial\nturbulence.\nConclusion\nIn summary, the near-term outlook for economic growth\nand in ation is above all uncertain. Two keys to future\neconomic performance will be stabilization in housing and\nnancial markets. Financial market turmoil has recently\nbeen severe, and the consequences of this turmoil on real\neconomic performance entail clear downside risk. If\nnancial market turmoil can be contained, the FOMC can\nturn attention to achieving better in ation results than\nthose recently experienced. Until in ation clearly\nmoderates, my colleagues and I will need to be especially\nwatchful that our accommodative policy stance does not\nbegin to worsen the outlook for long-run price stability.\nFootnotes\n1.

The views\nexpressed are mine and do not necessarily re ect o cial\npositions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nIntroduction\nThe U.S. economy has faced severe challenges over the\nlast year. Some of these challenges arose from price\ndeclines in housing markets and the associated turmoil in\nmortgage nancing. Others were the product of a\nbreathtaking run-up in energy and commodity prices. The\nFederal Reserve has responded to these challenges in\ntimely and innovative ways. Our actions have included\ntraditional monetary policy moves, but we have also\nimplemented new and unconventional tools. This\ninnovation has intensi ed in response to market events\nover the last several weeks. Today I will talk about the nearterm outlook for the economy and the challenges my\nFederal Reserve colleagues and I face as we strive to\nimplement a policy that is designed to deliver low and\nstable in ation along with maximum sustainable\nemployment.\nIn the best of times, forecasting is di cult. In times of\nmagni ed uncertainty, it may be unwise to attempt to\nguess the level of economic performance. That said, my\nsense is that the pace of growth in the U.S. economy over\nthe second half of the year will be positive but slower than\nits pace over the rst half of the year. Although recent\ndevelopments suggest that headline in ation may\nmoderate from its current levels, price pressures are\nelevated and several measures of in ation expectations\n\nJames Bullard\nPresident and Chief\nExecutive O cer\nBio\nCurriculum Vitae\nStaff Contacts\nIDEAS/RePEc Pro le\nPhotos\nVideos\nSubscribe:\nEmail alerts\nRSS\n\"Rationally, let it be said in a\nwhisper, experience is certainly\nworth more than theory.\"\nAmerigo Vespucci\n\n\fare inconsistent with the medium-term projections of\nFOMC participants. A key challenge in the current\nenvironment is to navigate through substantial nancial\nmarket turmoil without creating a new and di cult-to-solve\nin ation problem in its wake.\nLet me say before I continue that any views expressed here\nare my own and do not necessarily re ect the o cial views\nof other Federal Open Market Committee members.\nCurrent Economic Developments\nThe economy has shown some strength thus far in 2008.\nThis strength was apparent in the sharp upward revision to\nreal gross domestic product during the second quarter.\nEarlier this year, many forecasters were predicting negative\ngrowth in real GDP in the second quarter. These\nexpectations seemed consistent with the evolving\nslowdown in growth over the nal three months of last year\nand the rst three months of this year. But the sharply\nnegative growth did not materialize. This is only the most\nrecent example of how di cult it can be to get a good\nhandle on short-term economic developments.\nOne of the most signi cant recent developments on the\nreal side of the economy has been the steady slowing in\nthe pace of spending by U.S. households. Economists pay\nclose attention to consumer spending, since it comprises\nabout three-quarters of expenditures on real GDP. After\nincreasing by more than 3 percent per year from 2003 to\n2006, the growth of real consumer spending began to taper\noff in the second quarter of last year. Since then, real\nconsumer spending has increased at a slower pace—\ndespite a sizable scal stimulus package and aggressive\ninterest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.\nThe consumption spending slowdown has occurred\nagainst the backdrop of the sharp increase in oil and other\ncommodities prices that began last year. Retail gasoline\nprices, which had averaged $2.36 per gallon in the rst\nquarter of 2007, jumped to $3.02 per gallon in the second\nquarter of 2007—and they have mostly stayed above $3 per\ngallon since. In response to record-high gasoline prices,\nconsumers have changed their buying patterns. First, sales\nof domestically manufactured cars and light trucks are on\npace to be their weakest since 1991. Although domestic\nauto sales posted a surprising rebound in August, it seems\nlikely that aggressive sales incentives were an important\ncontributing factor. Second, record-high gasoline prices\nhave caused consumers to switch from relatively highpriced, less-fuel-e cient light trucks and SUVs, to relatively\nlower-priced, more-fuel-e cient passenger cars. The end\nresult has been a decline in total expenditures on motor\nvehicles over the past year. Although the demand for\ndurable goods such as cars and trucks is highly cyclical, it\nseems likely that higher gasoline prices can account for a\nlarge percentage of the recent declines in automotive\nsales.\n\n\fIt is entirely possible that recent developments in the labor\nmarkets will compound the slowing in real consumer\nspending over the second half of this year. In August,\nnonfarm payroll employment declined by 84,000, and\nrevisions indicated bigger declines over the previous two\nmonths than were originally estimated. So far this year,\npayroll employment has declined by an average of about\n76,000 per month. Job losses this year have been largest in\nthe manufacturing and construction sectors, as well as in\nprofessional and business services. Interestingly, about 30\npercent of the drop in payroll employment since January\n2008 is attributable to temporary help services workers.\nThis is much larger than the experience over comparablelength intervals seen in 1990-91 and 2001.\nOne of the most startling statistics to come out of the\nAugust employment report was the rise in the\nunemployment rate. Over the past year, the unemployment\nrate has increased sharply—from 4.7 percent to 6.1 percent\n—mostly in the last three months. Although changes in\nemployment can have signi cant effects on consumer\nspending, it is also true that households tend to smooth\ntheir consumption. That is, during di cult times\nhouseholds rely on accumulated saving and borrowing to\nmaintain living standards. While the decline in employment\nwill probably have some adverse effects on consumer\nspending in the aggregate, the effect tends to be small\nrelative to other factors that seem more important to\nhouseholds, such as current and expected real incomes.\nStill, the rise in unemployment is consistent with a cyclical\nslowing in GDP growth, as rms respond to weaker sales\nby scaling back their work force.\nHigher energy prices also have adversely affected the\nbusiness sector. To help protect their narrowing pro t\nmargins, rms have attempted to pass along all or part of\ntheir cost increases to their customers, they have idled\nsome existing capacity, and they have reduced their labor\ncosts. These are typical responses to an oil price shock. At\nthe same time, sharp increases in oil prices also tend to\nincrease uncertainty about future oil prices. In their\ndecisions to build capacity or expand their work force,\nrms must be forward-thinking. Increased uncertainty\nabout future oil prices may cause rms to postpone\nplanned capital outlays and perhaps lead to a costly\nreallocation of resources. As a current example, some\nautomotive manufacturers have announced permanent\nclosures of some plants that produce less-fuel-e cient\nvehicles.\nBeginning late last year, business capital spending on\nequipment and software weakened. In the second quarter\nof 2008, for example, real equipment and software\nexpenditures declined at the fastest rate in ve and a half\nyears. For the most part, the bulk of this weakness was\nconcentrated in the outlays for industrial and\ntransportation equipment; business spending on\n\n\finformation-processing equipment and software has\nremained brisk. Thus, part of this slowdown is undoubtedly\nenergy related.\nSome strength has re-emerged in the manufacturing\nsector. New orders for manufactured durable and\nnondurable goods have risen strongly for ve consecutive\nmonths. One source of this strength may be the robust\nexport sector, which has been a key part of the economy's\nresilience in the face of declining employment. Other areas\nof business capital spending that are not dependent on\nforeign demand, such as business spending on\ncommercial and industrial structures, have remained quite\nstrong. On balance, business capital spending seems to be\nrebounding modestly and may help to offset some\nemerging weakness in consumer spending.\nGoing forward, falling oil prices, if sustained, should help\nhouseholds and businesses cope with existing strains. In\nfact, given that the recent decline in oil prices has probably\nexceeded the near-term assumptions of most forecasters,\nit is conceivable that economic growth over the second\nhalf of the year may turn out to be moderately stronger\nthan the consensus expects.\nTo be sure, the timing and extent of a strengthening in the\neconomy will also largely depend on the recovery of the\nhousing sector. Since the rst quarter of 2006, the\nresidential housing investment component of real GDP has\nsubtracted, on average, almost a full percentage point from\neach quarter's real GDP growth. This has been a signi cant\ndrag on growth, and; so, stabilization in the housing sector\nshould provide a sizable stimulus to overall growth, all else\nequal.\nMost forecasters do not expect to see a bottom in housing\nconstruction until early 2009. By then, homebuilders will\nhave probably worked off the bulk of their excess\ninventories of unsold new homes. However, the inventory\nof existing homes on the market remains near record-high\nlevels, and it seems likely that it will take longer to work off\nthat inventory. Sales of new and previously sold singlefamily homes appear to have stabilized over the past few\nmonths. It seems unlikely that sales would have stabilized\nif buyers were still expecting steep price declines.\nWidely watched house price measures include the\nS&P/Case-Shiller index and the O ce of Federal Housing\nEnterprise Oversight (OFHEO) index. There are some\nsigni cant differences between the two.(1) The CaseShiller index includes homes purchased with\nnonconforming mortgages—also known as jumbo\nmortgages. By contrast, the OFHEO index has broader\ngeographic coverage and only includes conforming\nmortgages, that is, mortgages that are eligible to be\npurchased by government-sponsored enterprises such as\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac.(2) Over the four quarters\nending in the second quarter of 2008, the Case-Shiller\n\n\fnational price index has declined by a little more than 15\npercent, while the OFHEO price index has declined by a\nlittle less than 5 percent.\nThe decline in home prices, which has been most severe in\nparts of the West and in the Southeast—places where\nhome prices had earlier posted the largest increases—has\naffected the economy in important ways. One widely cited\neffect is that falling house prices reduce household equity\nwealth, which may have a depressing effect on consumer\nspending. My sense is that these effects may not be very\nlarge. A recent study published by the Bank of Canada\nnotes that in the United States the extra boost to\nconsumption from an increase in housing wealth ranges\nfrom 2 to 11 percent according to existing empirical\nresearch.(3) That's a large range. Moreover, other studies\nhave found that a decline in housing wealth has no effect\non consumption. These results suggest that we want to be\ncareful not to overstate wealth effects.\nRecent Developments in Financial Markets\nMore substantial macroeconomic effects from falling\nhouse prices may come through nancial markets. A large\nnumber of nancial institutions have had considerable\nholdings of mortgage-backed securities on their balance\nsheets. These securities provided holders with a ow of\nincome derived from the monthly mortgage payments of\nthe underlying asset. The recent decline in house prices,\nalong with a slowing economy, caused many homeowners\nto default or walk away from their houses—especially\nthose with nontraditional mortgages. These conditions\nhave eroded the value of the mortgage-backed securities\nand thus reduced the net wealth of those investors and\ninstitutions that held them.\nThe resulting illiquidity of mortgage-backed securities and\nrelated nancial instruments has caused severe stress for\nthe U.S. nancial system over the past year. Many nancial\nrms simply did not manage risk exposure on these\nsecurities well and, as a result, have struggled with losses\nand write-downs. A nancial sector shakeout has ensued,\none which was entirely appropriate considering the\nmagnitude of the mismanagement involved. As is normal\nduring an industry shakeout, weaker rms are forced into\nbankruptcy or merge with stronger partners, and\nopportunity abounds for those rms that are able to\nsurvive and build market share in the post-shakeout\nindustry structure.\nThe Federal Reserve has responded aggressively in an\nattempt to mitigate the effects of the shakeout on the rest\nof the economy. The key concern has been that if\nimportant nancial market players are failing, the failure\nshould occur in an orderly way with the lowest level of\nmarket disruption. In the banking sector, there are wellestablished procedures for resolving a failed institution in\nan orderly way. It is very important to recognize that in the\n\n\fnon-bank nancial sector there are no such procedures.\nThis has kept the Fed improvising, especially during the\nlast seven months.\nThe Bear Stearns episode provided the rst case of a largescale failure. The novelty of the situation suggested that a\nBear Stearns bankruptcy was largely unexpected within\nnancial markets and therefore likely to cause signi cant\nmarket disruption. In that case, the Fed helped arrange a\nmerger with JPMorgan Chase as the stock price of Bear\nStearns was declining toward zero.\nDuring the summer, mortgage giants Fannie Mae and\nFreddie Mac experienced increasing stress, eventually\nleading to an aggressive policy change. Placing these\nentities into conservatorship was largely a Treasury action\nin conjunction with the primary regulator, the Federal\nHousing Finance Agency (FHFA), with only a consultative\nrole for the Federal Reserve. The GSEs were previously\nimplicitly backed by the U.S. government, and the recent\naction makes that backing completely explicit. The GSE\nconservatorship removes a key uncertainty from the scene\nand should help to stabilize markets going forward.\nIn recent weeks, the investment bank Lehman Brothers\nappeared to be in a position similar to Bear Stearns. The\nLehman Brothers situation had been evolving for a year,\nand market players had already seen the demise of an\ninvestment bank. In this case, counterparties had plenty of\ntime to assess the potential for Lehman to fail. As a\nconsequence, nancial market participants were much less\nlikely to have been surprised and signi cant market\ndisruption was judged less probable. In addition, the Fed\nhad implemented additional liquidity facilities in the wake\nof Bear Stearns in an attempt to mitigate adverse\nconsequences from future failures. Lehman led for\nbankruptcy. Since then, important pieces of the company\nhave been sold to Barclays Capital. In a related\ndevelopment, investment bank Merrill Lynch agreed to sell\nitself to Bank of America. The two remaining investment\nbanks, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, this week\nchanged their charters to become commercial banks.\nThese events have left the U.S. with no investment banks.\nOne di culty in dealing with a crisis is the element of\nsurprise. Just as the events surrounding Lehman were\ncoming to a head, solvency problems at insurer American\nInternational Group, with $1.1 trillion in assets, became\nacute. While AIG's stock price had been declining for some\ntime, its demise was rapid and unanticipated. A bankruptcy\nling in the immediate aftermath of Lehman was judged\nlikely to cause signi cant market disruption. The AIG board\nof directors agreed to a Fed bridge loan. The terms\nincluded the ouster of the CEO and an interest rate set at\nLibor plus 850 basis points.\nIt is important to stress that the Federal Reserve's intent in\neach of these cases has not been to save these rms but\n\n\fto orchestrate an orderly transition for nancial markets as\nthese rms exit the scene in their current form.\nAgain, because of the lack of a regime for the orderly\nresolution of failed institutions in the non-bank nancial\nsector, the Fed was forced to improvise in the Bear Stearns,\nLehman and AIG episodes. These improvised actions have\nhad mixed success. In the Bear Stearns episode, there was\nsigni cant, but manageable, turmoil in the aftermath of the\nmerger announcement. In the Lehman-AIG episode, there\nwas signi cant turmoil, which threatened to spread\nglobally to seemingly unrelated markets. Part of this was\nattributable to the largely unexpected nature of the AIG\nbankruptcy threat within 48 hours of Lehman's bankruptcy\nling.\nThe continuing turmoil has prompted Treasury Secretary\nPaulson to approach Congress concerning a more\nsystematic method of handling the shakeout in the\nnancial sector. The intent of the Secretary's proposal is to\ncreate a market for the illiquid asset-backed securities and\nrelated instruments that are at the heart of the present\nsituation. These assets have current prices that are very\nlow, the so-called re sale price, due to the fact that so\nmany rms would like to sell their holdings, and there are\nfew buyers in the current climate. But these securities also\nhave a hold-to-maturity price that re ects the likely value of\nthe stream of revenue for a patient investor who is willing\nto simply hold the asset for a period of time. Under the\nproposal, the government would play the role of the patient\ninvestor, buying the securities at auction and holding them\nor selling them at a future moment when nancial market\nstress has receded. In principle, this idea could be\nexecuted at no ultimate cost to the taxpayer, although\ntaxpayer money would be put at risk. An important part of\nthe concept is that taxpayer money would be used to\npurchase assets, which would then be sold in the future,\nrecouping most or all of the initial outlay. A program like\nthis would probably go a long way toward liquefying illiquid\nasset-backed securities markets and; so, would help\nprogress toward an orderly nancial market consolidation.\nIt is far from clear how nancial market turmoil of this\nmagnitude will ultimately affect the real economy. The\nleading modern example for large economies is Japan,\nwhere substantial problems in real estate and the banking\nsector were followed by a decade or more of subpar\neconomic performance. Many Asian countries involved in\nthe currency crises of 1997 and 1998 suffered through\nsevere recessions. In the U.S. we have been more fortunate\nso far. The 1987 stock market crash has often been\nmentioned in conjunction with recent events, but real GDP\ngrowth was actually strong during the second half of 1987:\nThird quarter growth was 3.7 percent, and fourth quarter\ngrowth was 7.2 percent. At the time, many suggested that\nthe U.S. was in or would immediately go into recession due\nto nancial market upset. It did not happen, which provides\n\n\fan object lesson about how di cult it can be to really\nunderstand what is driving short-term dynamics in the\neconomy. Similarly, the collapse of Long-Term Capital\nManagement occurred in the second half of 1998, the\nculmination of a year of turmoil in global nancial markets.\nBut U.S. real GDP growth in the second half of 1998\naveraged about 5.5 percent.\nAll of these events offer clues but also differ in important\nways from the current episode. We do not know what will\nhappen this time around, and we should be humble in our\npredictions. Still, these examples suggest that there is\nsubstantial downside risk. There is some possibility of a\nrelatively benign outcome, where the nancial market\nshakeout plays itself out and real economic performance is\nmuted but not disastrous. But there is also some\npossibility of a very adverse outcome in which the entire\neconomy is drawn into a protracted downturn.\nRecent In ation Developments\nOne of the most unsettling aspects of the current\nmacroeconomic environment is the high and volatile rate\nof in ation. In 2007, headline in ation—whether measured\nby the consumer price index (CPI) or the personal\nconsumption expenditures price index (PCE Price Index)—\nreached its highest rate in more than 17 years!\nSkyrocketing oil and commodity prices over the rst seven\nmonths of this year contributed to the high in ation rate.\nAs a result, through August, the CPI has increased at an\nannual rate of more than 5 percent, while the PCE price\nindex has increased at an annual rate of a little less than 5\npercent through July. This is not price stability. In fact,\nthese numbers are very far from meeting any de nition of\nprice stability.\nWhen discussing the outlook for in ation, the FOMC has\ntended to place considerably more weight on core in ation\nmeasures that exclude food and energy prices. The\nrationale for this is that price shocks emanating from\nhigher oil or commodity prices have historically tended to\nbe temporary. However, one could argue that the rise in oil\nprices from a little less than $20 per barrel in late 2001 to\nmore than $100 per barrel this year re ects a permanent\nincrease in the demand for crude oil from rapidly growing\ncountries in Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America. It is\nnatural to think that global demand will continue to rise for\nsome time.\nHigher oil prices have both direct and indirect effects on\nprices paid by households. An example of a direct effect is\nthe increased price of gasoline or diesel fuel, or the natural\ngas to heat one's home. The indirect effects occur when\nbusinesses experiencing compressed pro t margins due to\nhigher energy costs are able to increase their selling prices\non non-energy goods and services or to add on fuel\nsurcharges. These indirect effects typically show up in the\ncore measures of in ation. There is considerable evidence\n\n\f—as most recently discussed in the September Beige Book\nnarrative—that producers are increasingly able to pass\nalong their higher input costs to offset the compression in\ntheir pro t margins. We can perhaps see this most clearly\nin the acceleration in the core in ation rate over the past\nthree months.\nA key concern is that the current level of the federal funds\ntarget rate, at 2 percent, is well below the current rate of\noverall in ation. This means that the real cost of borrowing\nshort-term is negative. In other words, the FOMC's interest\nrate target is unusually low. Over time we will need to\nadjust this rate to a level that is more conducive to long-run\nprice stability and maximum sustainable employment.\nConclusions\nIn summary, the near-term outlook for economic growth\nand in ation is above all uncertain. Two keys to future\neconomic performance will be stabilization in housing and\nnancial markets. Financial market turmoil has recently\nbeen severe, and the consequences of this turmoil on real\neconomic performance entail clear downside risk. If\nnancial market turmoil can be contained, the FOMC can\nturn attention to achieving better in ation results than\nthose recently experienced. Until in ation clearly\nmoderates, my colleagues and I will need to be especially\nwatchful that our accommodative policy stance does not\nbegin to worsen the outlook for long-run price stability.\nFootnotes\n1.

Robert H. Rasche, Senior Vice President and Director of Research,\nand Marcela M. Williams, Special Research Assistant to the President, provided\nassistance. I take full responsibility for errors. The views expressed are mine and do not\nnecessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fRemarks on the U.S. Economy1\n\nIntroduction\nAs many of you know, I joined the Federal Open Market Committee at a difficult\njuncture for the Committee and for the American economy. Growth in real gross\ndomestic product, one of our best measures of overall health in the economy, has been\nsluggish. Financial markets have been struggling to return to normal operation since the\ncurrent turmoil began in earnest 10 months ago. In addition, the housing sector has been\nextraordinarily weak for some time, with prices falling and sales of both new and existing\nhomes on the decline. The Federal Reserve has responded to this situation by instituting\nan array of new lending facilities and sharply lowering interest rates through the fall of\n2007 and into the first several months of 2008.\nToday I will talk about these and related developments in the context of mediumand longer-term objectives for monetary policy. My sense is that the U.S. economy will\nbe able to post stronger growth in the second half of this year despite the ongoing\nfinancial turmoil, the drag from the housing sector, and rising energy prices. Meanwhile,\ninflation is becoming a more pressing concern as both inflation and inflation expectations\nare moving higher.\nLet me say before I continue that any views expressed here are my own and do\nnot necessarily reflect the official views of the Federal Open Market Committee or the\nFederal Reserve System.\n\n1\n\nPortions of this speech were delivered as “A Perspective on the U.S. Economy,” in Rogers, Ark, on June\n4, 2008, and “Remarks on the U.S. Economy and the State of the Housing Sector,” in Madison, Wis., on\nJune 6, 2008.\n\n1\n\n\fThe Objectives of Monetary Policy\nOver the past two decades, much has been said about the benefits of transparency\nand accountability in the conduct of monetary policy. Much has been achieved, both in\nthe United States and abroad, to reach these goals. I applaud these developments, and I\nbelieve that progress in this direction can and should continue. Consistent with these\nprinciples, in my role as the newest participant on the FOMC, I want to talk for a few\nmoments about my fundamental beliefs on the appropriate objectives of monetary policy.\nOne of the guiding principles from contemporary economic theory is that\nmonetary policy should be conducted in a systematic and predictable fashion. The\nexpectations of economic actors are critically important for the nature of equilibrium in\nthe economy. Private sector expectations evolve in part according to the outlook for\nfuture policy itself and the implications of that policy for the path of the economy. This\nview, once considered radical, is now widely accepted in academia and by monetary\npolicymakers around the world.\nSystematic monetary policy must start with a clear statement of the ultimate\npolicy objectives. The Federal Reserve is commonly characterized as striving to foster\nprice stability along with maximum sustainable employment. Other central banks,\nincluding the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, for\nexample, are charged with a single mandate: to maintain price stability. In the 1960s, the\ndual mandate was perceived to require a policy trade-off. Under the then-prevailing\nPhillips curve hypothesis, lower inflation could be achieved only at a cost of higher\nunemployment. Today, the consensus view is that there is no long-run tradeoff between\n\n2\n\n\finflation and unemployment. Indeed, a succession of Fed Chairmen—Paul Volcker, Alan\nGreenspan, and Ben Bernanke—have emphasized the complementarity of the two\nobjectives: namely, that price stability is a precondition for maximum sustainable\nemployment.2 I agree with this perspective.\nMoreover, I have been very impressed during my 18-year career as a Fed\neconomist considering the contrast in the behavior of the U.S. economy between highinflation and low-inflation eras. Between 1965 and 1984, U.S. inflation rose to doubledigit levels before falling again. Since 1984, inflation has remained under better control.\nThe earlier era was associated not only with higher and more variable inflation, but also\nwith a relatively volatile real economy. The more recent era has been associated with\nlower and less variable inflation and a substantially less volatile real economy. In the\nrecent macroeconomics literature, this has been called the “great moderation.” I think\nthat an important part of the volatility reduction is due to a monetary policy betterfocused on price stability since 1984.3 The volatility reduction—a reduction in the level\nof uncertainty faced by economic actors—is no small matter. It has meant a lot to\nbusinesses and households in our nation: long periods of growth punctuated by just two\nmild recessions since the mid-1980s.\nIn contemporary discussions, the term “price stability” has come to mean\nsomething other than “stable prices.” In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, price\nstability meant that variations in the general level of prices would be transitory and the\nprice index would revert to a mean. In recent policy discussions, however, price stability\n\n2\n\nSee, for example, Ben S. Bernanke, “The Benefits of Price Stability,” February 24, 2006.\n<www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20060224a.htm>.\n3\nFor a discussion of this possibility, see John B. Taylor, “Monetary Policy and the Long Boom,” April 16,\n1998. < http://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/98/11/9811jt.pdf>.\n\n3\n\n\fgenerally is interpreted as a small positive rate of inflation. If there is ongoing inflation,\nthe level of prices does not revert to a constant, but trends upward. I am willing to accept\nthis latter definition of price stability because there may be theoretical and practical\nreasons to believe that the best price indexes we have available are subject to upward\nbiases. While I am not a big fan of the upward-bias argument—after all, the bestavailable adjustments are already made to the indexes—I admit that I do not have better\nmeasures myself. My preferred definition of price stability is that trend inflation,\ncorrectly measured, is zero. In practice, this likely converts into a trend in measured\ninflation on the order of ½ to 1½ percent, depending on the particular price index\nreferenced.\nA sustained era of price stability requires that central banks create and maintain\nan environment in which financial market participants and the general public hold the\nexpectation that future inflation will remain low and stable. This commitment is an\nimplicit contract between the central bank and the public, and it should not be taken\nlightly. Such a commitment is frequently characterized as having an “anchor for inflation\nexpectations.” Some central banks have established such an anchor for the economy by\nannouncing an explicit numeric inflation target. The FOMC has chosen not to announce\nsuch a quantitative guideline, although many past and current participants on the\nCommittee have expressed individual preferences or “comfort zones” about ranges of\ninflation that they personally feel are appropriate objectives for policy.\nEven absent an explicit numeric inflation objective, the FOMC has achieved a\nnominal anchor for the economy over the past 25 years. The Committee accomplished\nthis the old-fashioned way—the Fed earned credibility for the expectation of low and\n\n4\n\n\fstable trend inflation based on the successful outcome of about 25 years of policy history.\nThe Volcker disinflation in the early 1980s succeeded in stabilizing inflation around 4\npercent per annum. After a mild and short-lived inflation breakout in the late 1980s, the\nGreenspan Fed produced a declining trend in inflation throughout the 1990s and into the\nfirst few years of the 21st century.\nDespite this past success, it is my judgment that at the present time inflation\nexpectations are fragile. By some measures, inflation has trended up in recent years. In\nthe decade from 1994 through 2003, the annual headline personal consumption\nexpenditures (PCE) inflation rate was less than 2.0 percent for five of the years, and was\nnever above 2.5 percent. Despite all that happened during that decade, it was credible to\nbelieve that the target for inflation was around 2.0 percent. Indeed, the average annual\nheadline PCE inflation rate was 1.86 percent. In contrast, in the past four years, the\nannual headline PCE inflation rate has consistently been above 2.5 percent; and, in the\npast six months, readings for headline PCE inflation measured from one year earlier have\nall been in excess of 3.0 percent. The step-up since 2004 has been due, in large part, to\nthe rapid increase in energy and other commodity prices during these years. Still, one\nwould expect that policy can be designed to deliver actual inflation rates near target over\nperiods as long as four or five years.\nInflation expectations have remained remarkably stable, but not at the 1.86\npercent headline PCE inflation rate established during the decade from 1994 to 2003.\nRecent market-based measures calculated from Treasury inflation-protected securities\nspreads indicate an implied five-year forward inflation rate of about 2.5 percent. One\nmight wonder how long inflation expectations can remain stable in this range. My sense\n\n5\n\n\fis that actual headline inflation in excess of 3.0 percent coupled with inflation\nexpectations near 2.5 percent will not be compatible for long. If inflation remains\nelevated, inflation expectations will begin to move higher. Market participants,\nbusinesses, and consumers will come to view higher inflation as part of the economic\nlandscape, in part because of doubts about the Fed’s ability and willingness to keep\ninflation contained. These expectations, if allowed to persist, will then feed into the\nequilibrium of the economy and will be difficult to reverse. In short, credibility is much\neasier to keep than it is to recover.\nA breakdown in inflation expectations has not occurred yet, to be sure, but the\nrisk is real. It is possible that a breakdown could happen over a very short horizon.\nIndeed, in the May 2008 University of Michigan/Reuters survey, the 12-month-ahead\nmedian expected inflation rate jumped to 5.2 percent (from 4.8 percent) and 25 percent of\nrespondents reported expecting inflation in excess of 10 percent over the next 12 months!\nMost likely these extraordinary readings were driven in part by recent exceptional\nincreases in certain commodities prices, especially gasoline. Still, the five-year-ahead\nmedian expected inflation in the survey has drifted up to 3.3 percent.\nDespite these worrisome numbers, I think that the Fed can contain the potential\nfor inflation expectations to drift higher. It is rule number one in modern central banking\nthat inflation and inflation expectations be kept under control. Let me repeat that: It is\nrule number one in modern central banking that inflation and inflation expectations be\nkept under control. After a 10-month period in which the dominant policy concern has\nrightly been the state of financial markets, policy can begin to address pressing\ninflationary concerns during the remainder of the year. While it is too early to say that\n\n6\n\n\fthe financial market turmoil has completely abated, the Fed’s new lending facilities\ncombined with an environment of low interest rates have gone some distance to return\nmarkets to more normal operation.\n\nSome Implications for the Current Policy Environment\nIn August of last year, the FOMC took the first of a sequence of policy actions\nthat reduced the target for the federal funds rate 325 basis points, from 5.25 percent to 2\npercent. The initial actions were motivated by turmoil in credit markets. By the end of\nlast year, evidence of slowing economic growth emerged. By early this spring, many\ncommentators and some economic forecasters were predicting that the economy was in or\nabout to enter a recession. The most recent Blue Chip consensus forecast projects\npositive growth in real GDP for each quarter in 2008, though the projected growth in the\nsecond quarter is close to zero. The most recent quarter-by-quarter outlook from the\nSurvey of Professional Forecasters is very similar to the Blue Chip consensus. Within\nthe past month, consistent with some stronger-than-expected economic data, forecasters\nhave generally backed off substantially in their estimates of the probability that the\neconomy is now in or will soon enter a recession.\nWhy have forecasts become more optimistic through the spring? I think it is\nbecause financial market turmoil is waning. A financial crisis is, naturally, a time of\ngreat uncertainty, as market participants are all wondering what will happen next.\nForecasters have to take into account the possibility that the crisis will worsen to the\npoint that a great deal of harm is done to U.S. financial markets. My sense is that, during\nthe first several months of this year, some forecasts were putting a high probability on\n\n7\n\n\fsuch an outcome. They were putting non-negligible weight on the prospect of the\neconomy switching to an equilibrium in which financial intermediation activity would be\nsharply curtailed. Now, however, it seems that such a prospect is more remote. As the\nprobability of severe damage to the financial system recedes, the likelihood of a\nmeasurable contraction in growth this year has lessened. These conditions complicate\nthe inflation outlook, in which significant economic slack had been seen as helping to\nkeep inflation in check.\nDespite these complications for the inflation outlook, my view is that policy is\nappropriately calibrated at this time, given the current economic environment and the\noutlook for the next 18 months. I see several reasons why maintaining the current policy\nis a good option for now.\nFirst, while the economy is clearly sluggish now, the FOMC has already reduced\nthe target federal funds rate by 325 basis points. These policy actions were preemptive\nand involved more aggressive rate cuts than in previous episodes, such as 1990-91 or\n2001. The rate reductions were based on forecasts that economic activity would slow in\nthe face of contracting housing activity and substantial turmoil in financial markets.\nGrowth has indeed been slow, at least for the first half of 2008, but that cannot now be\njustification for further rate reductions. Surprises to forecasts of economic activity, if\nany, have been to the upside. Acting preemptively means that patience is required when\ncircumstances play out in a way that is consistent with the forecast. Further action in the\nabsence of substantial forecast errors would be double counting: in effect, reacting twice\nto the same concern.\n\n8\n\n\fSecond, the full impact of monetary policy actions is not realized immediately. It\nis likely that additional stimulus to economic activity from the monetary policy actions\ntaken in January and March will peak in the second half of 2008. In addition, there is a\nfiscal stimulus program in place that may shift some spending into the second and third\nquarters of this year. Any additional monetary policy actions must be judged by their\nexpected impacts in light of current forecasts of the evolution of the economy. The best\njudgment, as incorporated in current forecasts, is that the pace of economic activity will\nbegin to strengthen in the second half of 2008 and throughout 2009.\nThird, at the current federal funds rate target of 2 percent, real interest rates are\nquite low by historical standards. Short-term real rates—computed by subtracting nearterm forecasts of headline inflation from nominal rates—are significantly negative.\nThree- to six-month-ahead headline CPI inflation forecasts exceed 3 percent; some\nforecasts for this period exceed 3.5 percent. Three-month Treasury bill rates are less than\n2 percent. Even when evaluated against forecasts of core inflation rates, these yields are\nzero to slightly negative in real terms. Five-year inflation-indexed Treasury note yields\nare essentially zero.\nIn short, the Fed has created a low-interest-rate environment that should allow the\neconomy to continue to adjust to the drag from the housing sector and the aftermath of\nfinancial market turmoil.\n\nHeadline versus Core Inflation\nLet me turn now to make a few comments on the issue of core versus headline\ninflation. Since July 2004, the FOMC has focused on inflation measured by the core\n\n9\n\n\fPCE price index in the semiannual Monetary Policy Reports. I think everyone in this\nroom is aware of the fact that, for most of the time since 2003, headline inflation has\nexceeded core inflation. According to core PCE measures of the price level, prices are\nabout 11 percent higher than they were in the beginning of 2003. But according to the\nheadline PCE measures, prices are about 15 percent higher than they were in 2003.\nUnfortunately for all of us, we face the headline prices, not just the core prices. Many are\nasking, What are the relative merits of focusing on core rather than headline inflation?4\nCore measures of inflation defined as excluding food prices have been\nconstructed by the BLS at least since 1957. Core measures of inflation excluding both\nfood and energy prices have been published since 1977. The rationale for these measures\nis not well documented, but it is likely that the original intent was to better reveal\nunderlying inflation trends. Historically, real food prices have exhibited large transitory\nmovements. Some of the major changes in real energy prices in the 1970s and mid-1980s\nalso proved transitory. Under these conditions, a focus on core measures gave\npolicymakers a clearer indication of changes in the trend of inflation that was subject to\npolicy control. Much of the volatility of these prices originated with supply shocks in\nparticular markets: droughts, crop failures, abundant harvests, OPEC boycotts, political\ndisturbances in major oil-producing countries, and the collapse of the world oil market.\nSupply disturbances of this sort do not produce the persistent spreads between headline\nand core inflation measures that have been observed over the past five years.\nI believe that consideration has to be given to the hypothesis that different forces\nhave driven the relative prices of food and energy in the recent past—namely, shifts in\n\n4\n\nFor a discussion of this issue, see Mark Wynne, “Core Inflation: A Review of Some Conceptual Issues,”\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Review, May/June 2008, 90(3, Part II), pp. 205-28.\n\n10\n\n\fdemand in world markets. These forces are likely to persist for some time. In particular,\nI have in mind rapid increases in standards of living in large emerging-market economies.\nAssociated with these increases in living standards are higher consumption of calories\nand higher consumption of energy and thus increasing demand in the global markets for\nthese products. With low short-run elasticity of supply for food and energy production,\nthese trends in demand generate trends in relative prices.\nThe best forecast is that China, in particular, will continue to grow at a rapid rate\nfor the next decade. Longer-run elasticities of supply for agricultural products are likely\nsubstantially larger than short-run elasticities, and hence the recent trend in relative prices\nof food may be expected to moderate. Trends in relative energy prices may moderate\nwith the emergence of new technologies. Nevertheless, a plausible case can be made that\ncurrent trends in these relative prices will persist and that, therefore, headline measures of\ninflation will remain above core measures.\nShould policymakers take into consideration persistent differences in headline and\ncore measures of inflation? I believe that consistency requires attention to such\ndifferences in the formulation of policy. Unless there are compelling reasons to do\notherwise, policy has to focus on the prices actually faced by households and businesses.5\nPersistent and substantial trends in other relative prices are not factored out in measuring\noverall inflation trends. The relative prices of computers, communications equipment,\nand consumer electronics, for instance, have been falling for decades. However, no one\n\n5\n\nOne recent analysis of this issue is by Bodenstein, Erceg, and Guerrieri (2007), which provides some\nsupport for focusing on core inflation when energy prices are volatile. I think this is a good example of the\ntype of research required, but I also think that conclusions in this area will be sensitive to the details of the\nmodel used and that the possibility of a relative price trend has to be addressed.\n\n11\n\n\fto my knowledge has argued that we are understating the fundamental trend in inflation\nbecause our core measures do not exclude these items.\nLet me stress that I do not have an answer to this question, but I think it has\nbecome an important concern for the FOMC. Again, what is new here is relative price\ntrends in food and energy that may plausibly be expected to persist for some time. If it\nwere just a matter of the food and energy components being volatile, I think a theoretical\ncase could be made that these prices contain too much noise and so should be ignored in\nday-to-day policy decisions. Historically, the ex-food and energy calculation seems to\nhave worked well, even though arbitrarily ignoring certain prices is not very elegant.\nWith relative price trends, the ad hoc approach to this question is becoming increasingly\nuntenable.\n\nConclusions\nIn conclusion, I appreciate having this opportunity to share with all of you some\nof my thoughts on the current state of the U.S. economy. While these are challenging\ntimes for monetary policymakers, I am cautiously optimistic that we can move into the\nsecond half of 2008 on firmer footing with reduced financial market turmoil, reduced\ndrag from the housing sector, more rapid economic growth, and a renewed effort on\nkeeping inflation low and stable.\n\n12\n\n\fReferences\nBernanke, Ben S. “The Benefits of Price Stability.” Speech delivered at The Center for\nEconomic Policy Studies and on the occasion of the Seventy-Fifth Anniversary of the\nWoodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, Princeton University,\nPrinceton, New Jersey, February 24, 2006;\n<www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20060224a.htm>\nBodenstein, Martin, Christopher Erceg, and Luca Guerrieri (2007). \"Optimal Monetary\nPolicy in a Model with Distinct Core and Headline Inflation Rates,\" unpublished paper,\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\n<http://dallasfed.org/news/research/2007/07taylor_erceg.pdf>\nWynne, Mark A. “Core Inflation: A Review of Some Conceptual Issues,” Federal\nReserve Bank of St. Louis Review, May/June 2008, 90(3, Part2), pp. 205-28.\nTaylor, John B.

Robert H. Rasche, Senior Vice President and Director of Research,\nand Marcela M. Williams, Special Research Assistant to the President, provided\nassistance. I take full responsibility for errors. The views expressed are mine and do not\nnecessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fRemarks on the U.S. Economy and the State of the Housing Sector 1\nIntroduction\nAs many of you know, I joined the Federal Open Market Committee at a difficult\njuncture for the Committee and for the American economy. Growth in real gross domestic\nproduct, one of our best measures of overall health in the economy, has been sluggish. Financial\nmarkets have been struggling to return to normal operation since the current turmoil began in\nearnest 10 months ago. In addition, the housing sector has been extraordinarily weak for some\ntime, with prices falling and sales of both new and existing homes on the decline. The Federal\nReserve has responded to this situation by instituting an array of new lending facilities and\nsharply lowering interest rates through the fall of 2007 and into the first several months of 2008.\nMy intention today is to talk about these developments in the context of medium- and\nlonger-term objectives for monetary policy. My sense is that the U.S. economy will be able to\npost stronger growth in the second half of this year despite the ongoing financial crisis and the\ndrag from the housing sector. As I will make clear, such growth is likely to make the inflation\noutlook a more pressing concern for the Fed in the second half of this year.\nLet me say before I continue that any views expressed here are my own and do not\nnecessarily reflect the official views of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal\nReserve System.\nBefore saying more about the current situation in the U.S. economy, let me provide some\ncontext for my current views by describing the goals and objectives of monetary policy as I see\nthem.\n\n1\n\nPortions of this speech were delivered as “A Perspective on Monetary Policy,” in Fayetteville, Arkansas, June 4,\n2008.\n\n1\n\n\fA General Perspective on the Objectives of Monetary Policy\nOver the past two decades, much has been said about the benefits of transparency and\naccountability in the conduct of monetary policy. Much has been achieved, both in the United\nStates and abroad, to reach these goals. I applaud these developments, and I believe that\nprogress in this direction can and should continue. Consistent with those principles, in my role\nas the newest participant on the FOMC, I want to talk for a few moments about my fundamental\nbeliefs on the appropriate objectives of monetary policy.\nOne of the guiding principles from contemporary economic theory is that monetary\npolicy should be conducted in a systematic and predictable fashion. The expectations of\neconomic actors are critically important for the nature of equilibrium in the economy. These\nexpectations evolve in part according to the outlook for future policy itself and the implications\nof that policy for the path of the economy. This view, once considered radical, is now widely\naccepted in academia and by monetary policymakers around the world. This perspective rejects\nan alternative view, common in an earlier era in macroeconomics, that policy actions are most\nuseful when they surprise participants in financial markets and the public more generally.\nSystematic monetary policy must start with a clear statement of the ultimate policy\nobjectives. The Federal Reserve is commonly characterized as striving to foster price stability\nalong with maximum sustainable employment. Other central banks, including the European\nCentral Bank (ECB) and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, for example, are charged with a\nsingle mandate: to maintain price stability. In the 1960s, the dual mandate was perceived to\nrequire a policy trade-off. Under the then-prevailing Phillips curve hypothesis, lower inflation\ncould be achieved only at a cost of higher unemployment. Today, the consensus view is that\nthere is no long-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment. Indeed, a succession of Fed\n\n2\n\n\fChairmen—Paul Volcker, Alan Greenspan, and Ben Bernanke—have emphasized the\ncomplementarity of the two objectives: namely, that price stability is a precondition for\nmaximum sustainable employment. 2 I agree with this perspective.\nMoreover, I have been impressed during my 18-year career as a Fed economist in\nconsidering the contrast in the behavior of the U.S. economy between high-inflation and lowinflation eras. Between 1965 and 1984, U.S. inflation rose to double-digit levels before falling\nagain. Since 1984, inflation has remained under better control. The earlier era was associated\nnot only with higher and more variable inflation, but also with a more volatile real economy. My\nsense is that a monetary policy better-focused on price stability has made an important\ncontribution to the improved stability on the real side of the economy that we have observed\nsince 1984. 3\nThis stability has meant a lot to the average household in our nation: long periods of\nuninterrupted growth punctuated by just two mild recessions since the mid-1980s.\nPrice stability has multiple interpretations. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, price\nstability meant that variations in the general level of prices would be transitory: the price index\nwould revert to a mean. In recent policy discussions, price stability generally is interpreted as a\nsmall positive rate of inflation. Under these conditions, the level of prices does not revert to a\nconstant, but trends upward. I accept this latter definition of price stability. There may be\ntheoretical and practical reasons to believe that the best price indexes we have available are\nsubject to upward biases. While I am not a big fan of the upward-bias argument—after all, the\nbest-available adjustments are already made to the indexes—I admit that I do not have better\n\n2\n\nSee, for example, Ben S. Bernanke, “The Benefits of Price Stability,” February 24, 2006.\n<www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20060224a.htm>.\n3\nFor a discussion of this possibility, see John B. Taylor, “Monetary Policy and the Long Boom,” April 16, 1998. <\nhttp://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/98/11/9811jt.pdf>.\n\n3\n\n\fmeasures myself. My preferred definition of price stability is that trend inflation, correctly\nmeasured, is zero. In practice, this likely converts into a trend in measured inflation on the order\nof ½ to 1½ percent, depending on the particular price index referenced.\nA sustained era of price stability requires that central banks create an environment in\nwhich financial market participants and the general public maintain the expectation that future\ninflation will remain low and stable. Such an environment frequently is characterized as having\nan “anchor for inflation expectations.” Some central banks have established such an anchor for\nthe economy by announcing an explicit numeric inflation target. The Reserve Bank of New\nZealand was the first institution to choose this approach. During the 1990s it was followed by\nthe Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, and the European Central Bank, among others.\nThe FOMC has chosen not to announce such a quantitative guideline, although many past\nand current participants on the Committee have expressed individual preferences or “comfort\nzones” about ranges of inflation that they personally feel are appropriate objectives for policy.\nWithin the past year, the FOMC has started publishing the ranges and central tendency of the\ninflation forecasts of the participants on a three-year horizon. These forecasts generally have\nbeen consistent with the revealed “comfort zones.” In the media, midpoints of these forecasts\nare often associated with an implicit FOMC objective for trend inflation. This represents\nimportant progress concerning the transparency of the FOMC inflation objective. Still, there is\nsome risk that if the evolving inflation situation appears inconsistent with the inflation objective\nthat is inferred from the revealed preferences of the individual FOMC participants, the anchor for\ninflation expectations may start to drag or come completely loose.\nI take some comfort that, even absent an explicit numeric inflation objective, the FOMC\nhas achieved a nominal anchor for the economy over the past 25 years. The Committee\n\n4\n\n\faccomplished this the old-fashioned way—the Fed earned credibility for the expectation of low\nand stable trend inflation based on the successful outcome of about 25 years of policy history.\nThe Volcker disinflation in the early 1980s succeeded in stabilizing inflation around 4 percent\nper annum. After a mild and short-lived inflation breakout in the late 1980s, the Greenspan Fed\nproduced a declining trend in inflation throughout the 1990s and into the first few years of the\n21st century.\nDespite this past success, it is my judgment that at the present time inflation expectations\nare fragile. By many measures, inflation itself has trended up in recent years, while inflationary\nexpectations, whether measured from survey data or from Treasury inflation-protected securities\nspreads, have remained remarkably stable. How long can this situation continue? My sense is\nthat, absent stabilization or reversal of the recent trend in inflation, inflation expectations will\nbegin to move higher. That is, market participants, businesses, and consumers will come to view\nhigher inflation as part of the economic landscape. These expectations, if allowed to persist, will\nthen feed into the equilibrium of the economy and will be difficult to reverse.\nA breakdown in inflation expectations has not occurred yet, to be sure, but the risk is real.\nIt is possible that a breakdown could happen over a very short horizon. Indeed, in the May 2008\nUniversity of Michigan/Reuters survey, the 12-month-ahead median expected inflation rate\njumped to 5.2 percent (from 4.8 percent) and 25 percent of respondents reported expecting\ninflation in excess of 10 percent over the next 12 months! My sense is that these extraordinary\nreadings were driven in part by recent exceptional increases in certain commodities prices,\nespecially gasoline. Still, the five-year-ahead median expected inflation has drifted up to 3.3\npercent.\n\n5\n\n\fDespite these worrisome numbers, I think that the Fed can contain the potential for\ninflation expectations to drift higher. It is rule number one in modern central banking that\ninflation and inflation expectations be kept under control. Let me repeat that: It is rule number\none in modern central banking that inflation and inflation expectations be kept under control.\nAfter a 10-month period in which the dominant policy concern has rightly been the state of\nfinancial markets, policy can begin to address pressing inflationary concerns during the\nremainder of the year. While it is too early to say that the financial market turmoil has\ncompletely abated, the Fed’s new lending facilities combined with an environment of low\ninterest rates have gone some distance to return markets to more normal operation.\n\nSome Implications for the Current Policy Environment\nIn August of last year, the FOMC took the first of a sequence of policy actions that\nreduced the target for the federal funds rate 325 basis points, from 5.25 percent to 2 percent. The\ninitial actions were motivated by turmoil in credit markets. By the end of last year, evidence of\nslowing economic growth emerged. By early this spring, many commentators and some\neconomic forecasters were predicting that the economy was in or about to enter a recession. The\nmost recent Blue Chip consensus forecast projects positive growth in real GDP for each quarter\nin 2008, though the projected growth in the second quarter is close to zero. The most recent\nquarter-by-quarter outlook from the Survey of Professional Forecasters is almost identical to the\nBlue Chip consensus. Within the past month, consistent with some stronger-than-expected\neconomic data, forecasters have generally backed off substantially in their estimates of the\nprobability that the economy is now in or will soon enter a recession.\n\n6\n\n\fThese forecasts may have a more optimistic tone than many of you have heard earlier this\nyear. I think this is because financial market turmoil is waning. A financial crisis is, naturally, a\ntime of great uncertainty, as market participants are all wondering what will happen next.\nForecasters have to take into account the possibility that the crisis will worsen to the point that a\ngreat deal of harm is done to U.S. financial markets. My sense is that, during the first several\nmonths of this year, some forecasts were putting a high probability on such an outcome. As the\nprobability of especially severe damage to the financial system recedes, forecasts are being\nrevised upward. This is complicating the inflation outlook for those projecting that significant\neconomic slack would help to keep inflation in check.\nCurrent consensus forecasts show no sign of relief for the near-term inflation situation.\nThe Blue Chip consensus forecast for core CPI inflation for 2008 over 2007 is 2.4 percent. The\nforecast for 2009, at 2.3 percent, is essentially unchanged. The Survey of Professional\nForecasters puts inflation at 2.3 percent in both years. These forecasts show little change from\nthe inflation experience in 2007. Forecasts of headline CPI inflation are more disturbing, with\nboth the Blue Chip and the Survey of Professional Forecasters current forecasts in excess of 3\npercent. These forecasts suggest that headline CPI inflation will moderate from its recent pace\nover the past six months, which is 4.5 percent. While heartening, this inflation outlook is still\nnot consistent with my view of price stability.\nStill, given the current economic environment and the outlook for the next 18 months, my\nview is that policy is appropriately calibrated at this time. I see several reasons why maintaining\nthe current policy is a good option for now.\nFirst, while the economy is clearly sluggish now, the FOMC has already reduced the\ntarget federal funds rate by 325 basis points. These policy actions were preemptive and involved\n\n7\n\n\fmore aggressive rate cuts than in previous episodes, such as 1990-91 or 2001. The rate\nreductions were based on forecasts that economic activity would slow in the face of contracting\nhousing activity and substantial turmoil in financial markets. Growth has indeed been slow, at\nleast for the first half of 2008, but that cannot now be justification for further rate reductions.\nSurprises to forecasts of economic activity, if any, have been to the upside. Acting preemptively\nmeans that patience is required when circumstances play out in a way that is consistent with the\nforecast. Further action in the absence of substantial forecast errors would be double counting:\nin effect, reacting twice to the same concern.\nSecond, the full impact of monetary policy actions is not realized immediately. It is\nlikely that additional stimulus to economic activity from the monetary policy actions taken in\nJanuary and March will peak in the second half of 2008. In addition, there is a fiscal stimulus\nprogram in place that may shift some spending into the second and third quarters of this year.\nAny additional monetary policy actions must be judged by their expected impacts in the future in\nlight of current forecasts of the evolution of the economy. The best judgment, as incorporated in\ncurrent forecasts, is that the pace of economic activity will recover in the second half of 2008 and\nthroughout 2009.\nThird, at the current federal funds rate target of 2 percent, real interest rates are quite low\nby historical standards. Short-term real rates—computed by subtracting near-term forecasts of\nheadline inflation from nominal rates—are significantly negative. Three- to six-month-ahead\nheadline CPI inflation forecasts exceed 3 percent; some forecasts for this period exceed 3.5\npercent. Three-month Treasury bill and prime nonfinancial commercial paper rates are less than\n2 percent. Even when evaluated against forecasts of core inflation rates, these yields are zero to\n\n8\n\n\fslightly negative in real terms. Five-year inflation-indexed Treasury note yields are essentially\nzero.\nIn short, the Fed has created a low-interest rate environment that should allow the\neconomy to continue to adjust to the drag from the housing sector and the aftermath of financial\nmarket turmoil.\n\nThe Housing Sector\nLet me turn now to more specific comments on the housing sector. Private single-family\nhousing starts peaked in January 2006 at an annual rate of 1.823 million units. Since that time,\nhousing starts have continued to fall; in April 2008, they were only at an annual rate of 692\nthousand units, roughly 38 percent of the previous peak value. As striking as these statistics\nappear, they are not unprecedented. To put the contraction in housing production in a longerterm perspective, it is useful to divide housing starts by the number of households. In February\n2006, housing starts per household peaked at 1.65 percent. In March 2008, they had declined to\n0.64 percent per household. A startling fall, to be sure, but it has happened before. In January\n1973, housing starts per household peaked at 2.10 percent before declining to a trough of 0.94\npercent in February 1975. The 1973-75 decline was similar in magnitude to our current\nsituation, according to this metric. A similar phenomenon occurred later in the 1970s. In\nDecember 1977, housing starts per household were 2.03 percent before beginning to fall. They\nfell all the way to 0.66 percent in November 1981. These statistics remind us that housing can be\na highly cyclical industry. They also illustrate that the current contraction has clear precedents.\nIndeed, it is perhaps comforting that the order of magnitude in the previous declines is not unlike\n\n9\n\n\ftoday’s figures and that, when housing starts per household have fallen this low in the past, it\nwas near a turning point.\nA difference in the current environment is that housing prices have declined. The\nnational OFHEO purchase-only house price index in March of this year was about 3.4 percent\nlower than one year ago. The FHLMC conventional mortgage purchase-only home price index\nwas about 4.4 percent lower in the first quarter of this year as compared to one year earlier.\nMore ominously, the national S&P/Case-Shiller home price index was about 14.1 percent lower\nin the first quarter of 2008 compared to one year earlier. The Radar Logic per-square-foot\nmeasure of housing prices in 25 metropolitan statistical areas shows declines similar to those in\nthe Case-Shiller measure. The median sales price of existing homes is off about 8.5 percent from\none year earlier. These various measures have strengths and weaknesses, but they all tell a tale\nof declining prices over the past year.\nA key question for the macroeconomic outlook is whether and to what extent home prices\nwill continue to decline. My sense is that house prices today may be closer to fundamental\nvalue than is commonly believed. Consider the following simple calculation. Starting in the\nfirst quarter of 2001, a recession year, normalize the value of nominal GDP to one and the value\nof the house price index to one. Let’s use the house price index showing some of the most\ndramatic movements, the Case-Shiller national index. Now plot the level of the two indexes\nfrom 2001 to today. The nominal GDP index grows at a more or less steady pace up to the most\nrecent quarter for which data are available, the first quarter of this year. The Case-Shiller index\nshows a dramatic rise—often called a housing price bubble—before falling off again beginning\nin 2006. But, given the recent housing price declines, the level of the Case-Shiller index in the\nfirst quarter of 2008 is not far from the level of nominal GDP. If we expect fundamental house\n\n10\n\n\fprices to grow roughly in line with nominal GDP, then the current level of house prices is not far\nfrom fundamental value. One can reach similar conclusions using the other measures of housing\nprices. I take this as one indication that much of any “bubble component” of house prices is now\nout of the market.\nThis calculation depends on the idea that in 2001, we were not already in a housing\nbubble. I do not think we were. It is true that the Case-Shiller index was growing fairly rapidly\nin the late 1990s, but I interpret that as catching up from lower rates of growth earlier in that\ndecade. The calculation also depends on the idea that nominal GDP provides a rough benchmark\nfor nominal expenditure on housing and that house prices are a good measure of spending on\nhousing services. This is probably broadly true, but there are many details that would need to be\naddressed to produce a good theoretical model of fundamental housing prices. This is a great\narea for research. And finally, the calculation concerns national measures of the level of housing\nprices. Of course, real estate markets are driven by many local factors as well.\nA trend line is not a theory. I want to briefly mention some research that I have seen at\nrecent conferences that has shaped some of my thinking on house prices. These papers have a\ncommon theme that I think is important to emphasize—namely, that there are reasons to think\nthat the run-up in housing prices since the last recession reflect fundamental factors in part, and\nthat not all observed price movements can be attributed to a “bubble.” One paper is by the\nUniversity of Wisconsin’s own Morris Davis and François Ortalo-Magné, called “Household\nExpenditures, Wages, Rents,” which argues that expenditure share on housing is constant over\ntime. This seems important to me from a research perspective because it means we can build\nmacroeconomic models with housing sectors that use standard preferences for households. A\nsecond paper is by Carlos Garriga, who is on the staff at the St. Louis Fed, with co-authors\n\n11\n\n\fMatthew Chambers and Don Schlagenhauf, titled “Accounting for Changes in the\nHomeownership Rate.” The authors look at how changes in mortgage product aspects, such as\ndownpayment requirements and repayment structure change participation of different\ndemographic and income groups in a general equilibrium setting. This is an important topic as a\nkey, long-standing public policy goal in the United States has been to increase homeownership,\nand this paper helps us understand how innovations in financing might shape the participation\nrate in equilibrium. The third paper is by Princeton University economist Nobuhiro Kiyotaki\nwith co-authors Alexander Michaelides and Kalin Nikolov, titled “Winners and Losers in\nHousing Markets.” These authors emphasize that when the share of land value in the value of\nstructures is large, housing prices can be importantly influenced by changes in real interest rates.\nIn all of these studies, and many others that I do not have time to mention here, a theme is that\ntheoretical modeling of the housing sector is a difficult but important problem in\nmacroeconomics. Many details come into play—life cycle and demographic features, housing as\ncapital, housing as an asset, and the role of financing—each of which is a separate topic in the\neconomics literature.

        "content": "Embargoed until:\n7:00 a.m. CDT\nJune 4, 2008\n\nA Perspective on the U.S. Economy\n\nJames Bullard*\nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\n\nNorthwest Arkansas Convention Center\nRogers, Arkansas\nJune 4, 2008\n\n*I appreciate assistance and comments provided by my colleagues at the Federal Reserve Bank\nof St. Louis. Robert H. Rasche, Senior Vice President and Director of Research, and Marcela\nWilliams, Special Research Assistant to the President, provided assistance. I take full\nresponsibility for errors. The views expressed are mine and do not necessarily reflect official\npositions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\fA Perspective on the U.S. Economy\nIntroduction\nIt is a pleasure to be here this morning to talk with you about the state of the U.S.\neconomy. I am impressed that such a large group is willing to come to breakfast to hear an\neconomist like me give a talk. By the time this is over, of course, some of you may wish you had\ndecided to sleep in!\nAs many of you know, I joined the Federal Open Market Committee at a difficult\njuncture for the Committee and for the American economy. Growth in real gross domestic\nproduct, one of our best measures of overall health in the economy, has been sluggish. Financial\nmarkets have been struggling to return to normal operation since the current turmoil began in\nearnest 10 months ago. In addition, the housing sector has been extraordinarily weak for some\ntime, with prices falling and sales of both new and existing homes on the decline. The Federal\nReserve has responded to this situation by instituting an array of new lending facilities and\nsharply lowering interest rates through the fall of 2007 and into the first several months of 2008.\nMy intention this morning is to talk about these developments in the context of mediumand longer-term objectives for monetary policy. My sense is that the U.S. economy will be able\nto post stronger growth in the second half of this year despite the ongoing financial crisis and the\ndrag from the housing sector. As I will make clear, such growth is likely to make the inflation\noutlook a more pressing concern for the Fed in the second half of this year.\nLet me say before I continue that any views expressed here are my own and do not\nnecessarily reflect the official views of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal\nReserve System.\n\n1\n\n\fBefore saying more about the current situation in the U.S. economy, let me provide some\ncontext for my current views by describing the goals and objectives of monetary policy as I see\nthem.\n\nA General Perspective on the Objectives of Monetary Policy\nOver the past two decades, much has been said about the benefits of transparency and\naccountability in the conduct of monetary policy. Much has been achieved, both in the United\nStates and abroad, to reach these goals. I applaud these developments, and I believe that\nprogress in this direction can and should continue. Consistent with those principles, in my role\nas the newest participant on the FOMC, I want to talk for a few moments about my fundamental\nbeliefs on the appropriate objectives of monetary policy.\nOne of the guiding principles from contemporary economic theory is that monetary\npolicy should be conducted in a systematic and predictable fashion. The expectations of\neconomic actors are critically important for the nature of equilibrium in the economy. These\nexpectations evolve in part according to the outlook for future policy itself and the implications\nof that policy for the path of the economy. This view, once considered radical, is now widely\naccepted in academia and by monetary policymakers around the world. This perspective rejects\nan alternative view, common in an earlier era in macroeconomics, that policy actions are most\nuseful when they surprise participants in financial markets and the public more generally.\nSystematic monetary policy must start with a clear statement of the ultimate policy\nobjectives. The Federal Reserve is commonly characterized as striving to foster price stability\nalong with maximum sustainable employment. Other central banks, including the European\nCentral Bank (ECB) and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, for example, are charged with a\n\n2\n\n\fsingle mandate: to maintain price stability. In the 1960s, the dual mandate was perceived to\nrequire a policy tradeoff. Under the then-prevailing Phillips curve hypothesis, lower inflation\ncould be achieved only at a cost of higher unemployment. Today, the consensus view is that\nthere is no long-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment. Indeed, a succession of Fed\nChairmen—Paul Volcker, Alan Greenspan, and Ben Bernanke—have emphasized the\ncomplementarity of the two objectives: namely, that price stability is a precondition for\nmaximum sustainable employment. 1 I agree with this perspective.\nMoreover, I have been impressed during my 18-year career as a Fed economist in\nconsidering the contrast in the behavior of the U.S. economy between the high inflation period of\nthe 1970s and the more-recent period of low inflation. Between 1965 and 1984, U.S. inflation\nrose to double-digit levels before falling again. Since that time, inflation has remained under\nbetter control. The earlier era was associated not only with higher and more variable inflation,\nbut also with a more volatile real economy. My sense is that a monetary policy better-focused on\nprice stability has made an important contribution to the improved stability on the real side of the\neconomy that we have observed since 1984.\nThis stability has meant a lot to the average household in our nation: long periods of\nuninterrupted growth punctuated by just two mild recessions since the mid-1980s.\nPrice stability has multiple interpretations. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, price\nstability meant that variations in the general level of prices would be transitory: the price index\nwould revert to a mean. In recent policy discussions, price stability generally is interpreted as a\nsmall positive rate of inflation. Under these conditions, the level of prices does not revert to a\nconstant, but trends upward. I accept this latter definition of price stability. There may be\n\n1\n\nSee, for example, Ben S. Bernanke, “The Benefits of Price Stability,” February 24, 2006.\n<www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20060224a.htm>.\n\n3\n\n\ftheoretical and practical reasons to believe that the best price indexes we have available are\nsubject to upward biases. While I am not a big fan of the upward-bias argument—after all, the\nbest-available adjustments are already made to the indexes—I admit that I do not have better\nmeasures myself. My preferred definition of price stability is that trend inflation, correctly\nmeasured, is zero. In practice, this likely converts into a trend in measured inflation on the order\nof ½ to 1½ percent, depending on the particular price index referenced.\nOne important aspect of my definition of price stability, which I will revisit this morning,\nis that it concerns only the trend in inflation. Central banks cannot and should not try to control\nperiod-to-period fluctuations in any measured price index. Such fluctuations are largely\ntransitory and reflect different movements of various relative prices. Price stability as a policy\nobjective for a central bank must be focused on the longer-run behavior of the inflation rate.\nGiven the current state of knowledge, a central bank that maintains a low and stable average rate\nof inflation over a horizon of two to three years should be judged successful at achieving price\nstability.\nA sustained era of price stability requires that central banks create an environment in\nwhich financial market participants and the general public maintain the expectation that future\ninflation will remain low and stable. Such an environment frequently is characterized as having\nan “anchor for inflation expectations”; in some cases, the central bank establishes such an anchor\nfor the economy by announcing an explicit numeric inflation target. The Reserve Bank of New\nZealand was the first institution to choose this approach. During the 1990s it was followed by\nthe Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, and the European Central Bank, among others.\nThe FOMC has chosen not to announce such a quantitative guideline, although many past\nand current participants on the Committee have expressed individual preferences or “comfort\n\n4\n\n\fzones” about ranges of inflation that they personally feel are appropriate objectives for policy.\nWithin the past year, the FOMC has started publishing the ranges and central tendency of the\ninflation forecasts of the participants on a three-year horizon. These forecasts generally have\nbeen consistent with the revealed “comfort zones.” In the media, midpoints of these forecasts\nare often associated with an implicit FOMC objective for trend inflation. This represents\nimportant progress concerning the transparency of the FOMC inflation objective. Still, there is\nsome risk that if the evolving inflation situation appears inconsistent with the inflation objective\nthat is inferred from the revealed preferences of the individual FOMC participants, the anchor for\ninflation expectations may start to drag or come completely loose.\nI take some comfort that, even absent an explicit numeric inflation objective, the FOMC\nhas achieved a nominal anchor for the economy over the past 25 years. The Committee\naccomplished this the old-fashioned way—the Fed earned credibility for the expectation of low\nand stable trend inflation based on the successful outcome of about 25 years of policy history.\nThe Volcker disinflation in the early 1980s succeeded in stabilizing inflation around 4 percent\nper annum. After a mild and short-lived inflation breakout in the late 1980s, the Greenspan Fed\nproduced a declining trend in inflation throughout the 1990s and into the first few years of the\n21st century.\nDespite this past success, it is my judgment that at the present time inflation expectations\nare fragile. By many measures, inflation has trended up in recent years. At the same time,\navailable measures of long-term inflation expectations, whether from survey data or from\nTreasury inflation-protected securities spreads, have remained remarkably stable. My sense is\nthat, absent stabilization or reversal of the recent trend in inflation, those expectations will begin\nto move higher. That is, market participants, businesses, and consumers will come to view higher\n\n5\n\n\finflation as part of the economic landscape. These expectations will then feed into the\nequilibrium of the economy and will be difficult to reverse.\nA breakdown in inflation expectations has not occurred yet, to be sure, but the risk is real.\nIt is possible that a breakdown could happen over a very short horizon. Indeed, in the May 2008\nUniversity of Michigan/Reuters survey, the 12-month-ahead median expected inflation rate\njumped to 5.2 percent (from 4.8 percent) and 25 percent of respondents reported expecting\ninflation in excess of 10 percent over the next 12 months! My sense is that these extraordinary\nreadings were driven in part by recent exceptional increases in certain commodities prices,\nespecially gasoline. Still, the 5-year-ahead median expected inflation has drifted up to 3.3\npercent.\nDespite these worrisome numbers, I think that the Fed can contain the potential for\ninflation expectations to drift higher. It is rule number one in modern central banking that\ninflation and inflation expectations be kept under control. Let me repeat that: It is rule number\none in modern central banking that inflation and inflation expectations be kept under control.\nAfter a 10-month period in which the dominant policy concern has rightly been the state of\nfinancial markets, policy can begin to address pressing inflationary concerns during the\nremainder of the year. While it is too early to say that the financial market turmoil has\ncompletely abated, the Fed’s new lending facilities combined with an environment of low\ninterest rates have gone some distance to return markets to more normal operation.\n\nSome Implications for the Current Policy Environment\nIn August of last year, the FOMC took the first of a sequence of policy actions that\nreduced the target for the federal funds rate 325 basis points, from 5.25 percent to 2 percent. The\n\n6\n\n\finitial actions were motivated by turmoil in credit markets. By the end of last year, evidence of\nslowing economic growth emerged. By early this spring, many commentators and some\neconomic forecasters were predicting that the economy was in or about to enter a recession. The\nmost recent Blue Chip consensus forecast projects positive growth in real GDP for each quarter\nin 2008, though the projected growth in the second quarter is close to zero. The most recent\nquarter-by-quarter outlook from the Survey of Professional Forecasters is almost identical to the\nBlue Chip consensus. Within the past month, forecasters have generally backed off substantially\nin their estimates of the probability that the economy is now in or will soon enter a recession.\nThese forecasts may have a more optimistic tone than many of you have heard earlier this\nyear. I think this is because financial market turmoil is waning. A financial crisis is, naturally, a\ntime of great uncertainty, as market participants are all wondering what will happen next.\nForecasters have to take into account the possibility that the crisis will worsen to the point that a\ngreat deal of harm is done to U.S. financial markets. My sense is that, during the first several\nmonths of this year, some forecasts were putting a high probability on such an outcome. As the\nprobability of especially severe damage to the financial system recedes, forecasts are being\nrevised upward. This is complicating the inflation outlook for those projecting that significant\neconomic slack would help to keep inflation in check.\nCurrent consensus forecasts show no sign of relief for the near-term inflation situation.\nThe Blue Chip consensus forecast for core CPI inflation for 2008 over 2007 is 2.4 percent. The\nforecast for 2009, at 2.3 percent, is essentially unchanged. The Survey of Professional\nForecasters puts inflation at 2.3 percent in both years. These forecasts show little change from\nthe inflation experience in 2007. Forecasts of headline CPI inflation are more disturbing, with\n\n7\n\n\fboth the Blue Chip and the Survey of Professional Forecasters current forecasts in excess of 3\npercent. This inflation outlook is not consistent with my view of price stability.\nStill, given the current economic environment and the outlook for the next 18 months, my\nview is that policy is appropriately calibrated at this time. I see several reasons why maintaining\nthe current policy is a good option for now.\nFirst, the FOMC has already reduced the target federal funds rate by 325 basis points.\nThese policy actions were preemptive and involved more aggressive rate cuts than in previous\nepisodes, such as 1990-91 or 2001. The rate reductions were based on forecasts that economic\nactivity would slow in the face of contracting housing activity and substantial turmoil in financial\nmarkets. Growth has indeed been slow, at least for the first half of 2008, but that cannot now be\njustification for further rate reductions. Surprises to forecasts of economic activity, if any, have\nbeen to the upside. Acting preemptively means that patience is required when circumstances\nplay out in a way that is consistent with the forecast. Further action in the absence of substantial\nforecast errors would be double counting: in effect, reacting twice to the same concern.\nSecond, the full impact of monetary policy actions is not realized immediately. It is\nlikely that additional stimulus to economic activity from the monetary policy actions taken in\nJanuary and March will peak in the second half of 2008. In addition, there is a fiscal stimulus\nprogram in place that may shift some spending into the second and third quarters of this year.\nAny additional monetary policy actions must be judged by their expected impacts in the future in\nlight of current forecasts of the evolution of the economy. The best judgment, as incorporated in\ncurrent forecasts, is that the pace of economic activity will recover in the second half of 2008 and\nthroughout 2009.\n\n8\n\n\fThird, at the current funds rate target of 2 percent, real interest rates are quite low by\nhistorical standards. Short-term real rates computed by subtracting near-term forecasts of\nheadline inflation from nominal rates are significantly negative. Three- to six-month-ahead\nheadline CPI inflation forecasts exceed 3 percent; some forecasts for this period exceed 3.5\npercent. Three-month Treasury bill and prime nonfinancial commercial paper rates are less than\n2 percent. Even when evaluated against forecasts of core inflation rates, these yields are zero to\nslightly negative in real terms. Five-year inflation-indexed Treasury note yields are essentially\nzero. In short, the Fed has created a low interest rate environment that should allow the economy\nto continue to adjust to the drag from the housing sector and the aftermath of financial market\nturmoil.\n\nHeadline versus Core Inflation\nAs I mentioned earlier, there are many different ways to measure and discuss inflation.\nSince July 2004, the FOMC has focused on inflation measured by the core PCE price index in\nthe semiannual Monetary Policy Reports. I think everyone in this room is aware of the fact that,\nfor most of the time since 2003, headline inflation has exceeded core inflation. What are the\nrelative merits of focusing on core rather than the headline inflation? 2\nCore measures of inflation defined as excluding food prices have been constructed by the\nBLS at least since 1957. Core measures of inflation excluding both food and energy prices have\nbeen published since 1977. The rationale for these measures is not well documented, but it is\nlikely that the original intent was to better reveal inflation trends. Historically real food prices\nexhibited large transitory movements. Some of the major changes in real energy prices in the\n\n2\n\nFor a discussion of this issue, see Mark Wynne, “Core Inflation: A Review of Some Conceptual Issues,” Federal\nReserve Bank of St. Louis Review, Part II, May/June 2008, pp. 205-228.\n\n9\n\n\f1970s and mid-1980s also proved transitory. Under these conditions, a focus on core measures\ngave policymakers a clearer indication of changes in the trend of inflation that was subject to\npolicy control. Much of the volatility of these prices originated with supply shocks in particular\nmarkets: droughts, crop failures, abundant harvests, OPEC boycotts, political disturbances in\nmajor oil-producing countries, and the collapse of the world oil market. Supply disturbances of\nthis sort do not produce the persistent spreads between headline and core inflation measures that\nhave been observed over the past five years.\nI believe that consideration has to be given to the hypothesis that different forces have\ndriven the relative price of food and energy in the recent past—namely, shifts in demand in\nworld markets. These forces are likely to persist for some time. In particular, I have in mind\nrapid increases in standards of living in large emerging-market economies. Associated with\nthese increases in living standards are higher consumption of calories and higher consumption of\nenergy and thus increasing demand in the global markets for these products. With low short-run\nelasticity of supply for food and energy production, these trends in demand generate trends in\nrelative prices.\nThe best forecast is that China, in particular, will continue to grow at a rapid rate for the\nnext decade. Longer-run elasticities of supply for agricultural products are likely substantially\nlarger than short-run elasticities, and hence the trend in relative prices of food can be expected to\nmoderate. Trends in relative energy prices may moderate with the emergence of new\ntechnologies. Nevertheless, a plausible case can be made that current trends in these relative\nprices will persist and that, therefore, headline measures of inflation will remain above core\nmeasures.\n\n10\n\n\fShould policymakers take into consideration persistent differences in headline and core\nmeasures of inflation? I believe that consistency requires attention to such differences in the\nformulation of policy. Unless there are compelling reasons to do otherwise, policy has to focus\non the prices actually faced by households and businesses. 3 Persistent and substantial trends in\nother relative prices are not factored out in measuring overall inflation trends. The relative prices\nof computers, communications equipment, and consumer electronics, for instance, have been\nfalling for decades. However, no one to my knowledge has argued that we are understating the\nfundamental trend in inflation because our core measures do not exclude these items.\nAvailable price indexes may be viewed as reasonably good estimates of consumer\npurchasing power. Food and energy are significant components of consumer budgets, as\nwitnessed by the abundant commentary on recent price changes. Monetary policy aimed at price\nstability cannot ignore continuing deterioration of purchasing power, regardless of the source. It\nis the overall trend in prices that is the inflation measure on which central bankers must\nconcentrate. If, under current global market conditions, historical core indexes do not measure\nthat trend appropriately, then it is necessary to develop filters that produce unbiased measures of\ntrend inflation.\n\nConclusions\nI appreciate having this opportunity to share with all of you some of my thoughts on the\ncurrent state of the U.S. economy. While these are challenging times for monetary policymakers,\nI am cautiously optimistic that we can move into the second half of 2008 with reduced financial\n\n3\n\nOne recent analysis of this issue is by Bodenstein, Erceg, and Guerrieri (2007), which provides some support for\nfocusing on core inflation when energy prices are volatile. I think this is a good example of the type of research\nrequired, but I also think that conclusions in this area will depend sensitively on the details of the model used and\nthat the possibility of a relative price trend has to be addressed.\n\n11\n\n\fmarket turmoil, reduced drag from the housing sector, more rapid economic growth, and a\nrenewed focus on keeping inflation low and stable.\n\nReferences\nBernanke, Ben S.

eloquently about model fit versus the\ninterpretability of DSGE models.\nGood model fit is often taken as absolutely essential in the\n“frontroom.” But not necessarily in the backroom:\nKocherlakota (2007, FRB-St. Louis Review).\nArgues by example that a better-fitting model can give a\nworse answer to a substantive policy question.\nWhat we want is the answer to the policy question.\n\nI see the recent literature described by Sims as an attempt\nto reach an intelligent compromise in this area.\nThe fit to data gives us confidence that we are on the right\ntrack with our economic concepts.\nBut we do not want to push so hard in getting a good fit\nthat we lose our economic grounding altogether.\nJames Bullard — Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\n\n\fBackrooms\n\nMonetary
