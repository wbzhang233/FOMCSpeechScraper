            "content": "Thank you for inviting me to visit with you this afternoon in London, and morning here in Atlanta. It's an honor to follow the many distinguished speakers you have hosted.\n\nAs you know, the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, met last week and made some news. Not only did the Committee reduce the Fed's policy rate from the 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent range that we've held for just over a year, we also reduced the target by a full ½ percentage point. Though not a total surprise, this was a larger adjustment than some expected.\n\nI fully supported this decision. Further, I share the view that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell expressed at the press conference after the FOMC meeting that commencing the process of reducing the policy rate is an appropriate and necessary first step in recalibrating monetary policy in light of evolving economic conditions.\n\nSpecifically, in my judgment, we have made sufficient progress on inflation, and the labor market has exhibited enough cooling, that the time has come to shift the direction of monetary policy to better reflect the more balanced risks to our price stability and maximum employment mandates that have emerged over the course of the year.\n\nIn fact, progress on inflation and the cooling of the labor market have emerged much more quickly than I imagined at the beginning of the summer. In this moment, I envision normalizing monetary policy sooner than I thought would be appropriate even a few months ago. By \"normalizing,\" I mean returning our policy to a place where it is no longer necessary to promote restrictive financial conditions to achieve our inflation target.\n\nFor me, there were two critical questions to be answered as I approached last week's meeting. First, why now? What gives me confidence that restrictive policy can be relaxed without compromising our price stability mandate? And, with respect to our maximum employment mandate, what would be the downside of not adjusting policy at all?\n\nSecond, how big should this initial move in the policy rate be? My conclusion is now apparent, but why not a more modest cut, or a much more aggressive one?\n\nIn the rest of my remarks, I'll attempt to answer these questions. I want to emphasize that these are my answers. I am speaking only for myself, and my views may not reflect those of my FOMC colleagues or any other representative of the Federal Reserve.\n\nWhy now?\n\nInflation has fallen faster than I had expected, and the most recent data solidify my conviction that the US economy is indeed sustainably on the path back to price stability. This is true pretty much by any measure one considers. Take the personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, price index, which is the Fed's preferred inflation gauge. The PCE print for July was 2.5 percent—notably closer to our 2 percent objective—and is at a level not seen since early 2021. We'll get another report on Friday, and I'm hopeful it will show the progress continuing.\n\nSame story for the consumer price index, or CPI, which some view as an important indicator of how consumers are experiencing the economy. The CPI for August was 2.5 percent, similarly down significantly from its recent heights and at the lowest levels since early 2021. For reference, my staff estimates that the Committee's 2 percent PCE target translates to a 2.3-2.6 percent target for the CPI. So, this, too, is coming into range.\n\nDigging a little deeper, I am especially encouraged by three key signals.\n\nOne, the breadth of price increases is narrowing to a range that accords with price stability. For the three months through July, 27 percent of prices, weighted by expenditures, rose by more than 5 percent in the PCE price index, compared to the same period a year earlier. That is the lowest share since mid-2021. And the figure for July alone was 18 percent, the lowest level since October 2020 and just above the long-term norm of 17 percent.\n\nTwo, we have gotten affirming signals from measures of core PCE inflation, which has historically been a strong predictor of underlying inflation. For the three months through July, core PCE inflation came in at an annualized monthly growth rate of 1.7 percent, which portends well for the future.\n\nThree, core services prices excluding housing—which tend to be particularly persistent—have begun slowing. Over the three months ending in July, PCE services prices excluding energy and housing (what some refer to as the \"supercore\") rose at an annualized rate of just 2 percent, down sharply from readings closer to 5 percent at the beginning of the year.\n\nPerhaps one of the only areas of residual elevated price pressures has been connected to housing. In fact, rising costs for housing and related services have buoyed overall inflation for many months, accounting for nearly 70 percent of the most recent 12-month increase in the core CPI, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. So, even though for the past year we have observed moderation in market-based measures of housing prices—think Zillow and Redfin here in the US—the housing component in the CPI and the PCE inflation indexes has largely remained high. This has been something of a mystery, and I hope that some fitful and nascent signs of declines in the rate of housing price increases in the PCE index take root soon.\n\nI said three things, but let me cite one other promising sign concerning prices. Pandemic-era forces that pumped intense inflationary pressures into the economy have greatly diminished; I'm thinking most notably of supply disruptions and \"revenge spending\" to satisfy pent-up demand.\n\nThose developments are all clear in the data. And to repeat what may seem like a mantra, I am data dependent. But I'm not dependent on data alone. My staff and I also fan out and talk to a lot of people who set prices and hire and invest and consume.\n\nIn recent weeks, reports on prices from our business contacts align neatly with the story the data are telling us. In virtually every industry and sector of the economy, business leaders tell me their pricing power has all but evaporated. In sum, then, after flaring early in 2024, price pressures are diminishing quickly and broadly.\n\nOn the employment side of the ledger, clearly the red-hot job growth coming out of the pandemic is cooling. That said, the labor market is weakening but is not weak, slowing but not slow.\n\nThe unemployment rate has ticked up this year, yet at 4.2 percent it matches the Committee's long-run projection. Monthly job creation paints a similar picture. The 12-month moving average has steadily declined but was a still-healthy 196,000 new jobs a month through August 2024.\n\nAnother key metric, the number of hires as a percentage of employment, or the hires rate, has retreated to roughly the prepandemic trend. Job openings remain above levels that prevailed before 2020, though they're down substantially from the peaks of 2022. This has translated to a narrowing of the gap between labor demand and labor supply by 70 percent, from 5 million in early 2023 to under 1.5 million in June, and a moderation of wage growth to levels more consistent with price stability.\n\nAs with prices, feedback from business leaders about labor markets tells much the same story as the data. The modal outlook I hear from business contacts is that they are approaching hiring more carefully, but generally are not contemplating layoffs.\n\nIn short, it appears that, combined with other forces, restrictive monetary policy has succeeded in bringing aggregate demand and supply into closer alignment and reducing inflationary pressures. Therefore, it is time to normalize policy in pursuit of the Committee's dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment.\n\nFor the past three years, I focused primarily on the price stability component of the mandate. Price stability was clearly the more distant objective as inflation spiked. Today, substantial progress has been made, though the task of subduing elevated inflation is not done, a fact the Atlanta Fed's Underlying Inflation Dashboard clearly shows. In the dashboard, red indicates the number is at least a half percentage point above our target. Note the proliferation of red in April, and then you'll see a bit less red by the June readings, and finally today there is far less red. This progress means that risks have lessened along this dimension. (See slides.)\n\nBy contrast, risks to our employment mandate have grown as labor markets have weakened, such that the possibility we might see broad weakness has increased relative to 12 or 18 months ago. So, I now see the two sets of risks as much more balanced. This is an important change.\n\nIn terms of policy, you might also say that we have two, largely balanced risks. On the one hand, there is a risk of moving too quickly to remove restrictiveness, such that inflation does not get all the way to the objective. On the other hand, there is the risk of leaving policy restrictive for too long, which could result in undue damage to the labor market, and in turn pain and suffering for the American people.\n\nSo that's the case for recalibrating our policy stance to a level more consistent with the balancing of risks to our two mandates, and to avoid the potential mistake of staying too restrictive for too long. What I have not answered is why I didn't feel it was appropriate to ease monetary conditions even more aggressively.\n\nWhy 50?\n\nThis brings me to the critical question I posed before. Why did I support cutting the rate by ½ of a percentage point specifically?\n\nI have argued that the economy is effectively near conditions—with respect to both inflation and employment—that might be considered \"normal.\" In this context, \"normal\" means conditions that largely satisfy our price stability and maximum sustainable employment mandates.\n\nSo, then, the question becomes, if the economy has returned to \"normal\", what should the appropriate policy stance of the FOMC be?\n\nIf the economy is basically satisfying our mandates, then the appropriate policy stance would be one where the federal funds rate is neither stimulative nor restrictive for economic activity, a rate often referred to as the neutral rate.\n\nNow, there is plenty of debate about the level of the neutral rate in the United States and elsewhere. It is unfortunately one of those concepts that is easier to see after the fact than before.\n\nHowever, the disagreement on the true neutral level was inconsequential, at least for me at last week's meeting. Wherever the neutral rate is, I don't know anyone who would plausibly argue with the notion that we are a fair distance above it.\n\nBut that being the case, what is the argument for not pushing the policy rate into the neighborhood of neutral as soon as possible? Why not a series of larger moves of, say, 75 or 100 basis points until we reach a range where disputes about the true neutral level are salient?\n\nFor me, the answer is that there remains some uncertainty about whether we can really be fully confident that both our inflation and employment goals are fully within reach. The path of inflation in 2024 has been choppy, and the unpredictable nature of rents and housing prices still worries me. I will not be comfortable claiming victory if we stall short of our inflation goal, even if virtually all non-housing PCE component prices are increasing at their prepandemic rates.\n\nThat said, it won't surprise me if my concerns turn out to be unfounded. I'm counting on it, actually. But I would like to let a little time pass as we remove restrictiveness, so I can see more inflation evidence and hopefully better understand where we are.\n\nMy residual concern about inflation might have led me to settle on a relatively small first move last week—say, 25 basis points. But such a move would belie growing uncertainty about the trajectory of the labor market that I have already noted.\n\nFor sure, the labor market is not yet flashing red for me. And I want to be clear that I do not believe that labor markets have dangerously weakened. That is not what the data show, nor what business leaders tell us.\n\nBut I also recognize that employment growth over the past year has not been as strong as initial data releases suggested. Any further evidence of material weakening in the labor market over the next month or so will definitely change my view on how aggressive policy adjustment needs to be.\n\nIf the pandemic-era economy has taught us anything, it is to expect to be surprised. In my view, the 50-basis-point adjustment at the meeting last week positions us well should the risks to our mandates turn out to be less balanced than I am thinking.\n\nPolicy remains in the restrictive range, so if my optimism about inflation is unsatisfied, then the Committee can slow or even halt the pace of further reductions. Should labor markets prove substantially less healthy than they appear at the moment, the ½ percentage point reduction puts us in a better position to adjust than a more modest cut would have.\n\nMomentous as the recent decision to begin removing restriction from monetary policy was, taking that step does not lock in a cadence for further moves. As in any circumstance, my approach to policymaking will be guided by the incoming data, input from business contacts, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.\n\nI hope I have provided some clarity on my thinking about the present and the critical months ahead in monetary policy. Thank you for your time and attention. Now I look forward to the conversation with Professor Scobie.",

            "content": "For nearly 20 years of my life, I looked with great anticipation to the time of the year when April rolled into May and June. The explosion of spring and the approach of summer were wonderful.\n\nBut, more importantly, this meant that graduation season had arrived. As a professor at the University of Southern California, it was again time to don my cap and gown and celebrate the amazing accomplishments of an amazing group of people. It was my happiest time of the year.\n\nAt graduation, no matter where it is, everybody seems to be floating on air, almost dancing. Maybe the electric slide? Now I have to tell you, I was a little bit afraid to use that reference, as it might show my age. Do you guys know that dance? Don't worry, I'm not going to demonstrate. At least not in this cap and gown. Can you imagine this hood on that hard turn to the right?! Now I recognize the youngsters in the crowd here might gravitate to a different step, but please bear with this Gen Xer.\n\nMy overarching point is this: it is a great personal privilege to share in the pride, joy, and excitement this evening brings. Congratulations to the class of 2024!\n\nI know that it has taken a lot of effort to get here. You graduates definitely worked hard. But let's not forget the sacrifice from all the others: friends, family, mentors, teachers, administrators. This is truly a team effort. Let me give a particular shout-out to President Jermaine Whirl, who is presiding tonight. And thank you, Dr. Whirl, for inviting me to speak. I've gotten to know Dr. Whirl in his capacity as an adviser to the Atlanta Fed, and I have to say that you've got a special man here.\n\nNow, you just heard my bio, so you know I'm an economist. That may have triggered an \"uh-oh\" in your mind. Well, don't worry. I'm not going to give a dull economics lecture. I'll leave those discussions for TV interviews. I'm not even going to talk about interest rates. It wouldn't much matter if I did, though, as I'd only be speaking for myself and not for the Fed or any of my Fed colleagues across the country.\n\nTonight is about you. You are about to embark on a wonderful journey, full of twists and turns, for sure. But this journey will also present you with opportunities broader and more diverse than you could imagine. You can't know this right now, but you will have chances to be more than you think, to be bigger than you think, to be more impactful than you think.\n\nI know because it's happened to me. Take this job, for example. Being a Federal Reserve Bank president was nowhere on my dream job list 10 months before I started doing it. I was contacted in August, offered the job in March, and was in the job, living in the South for the first time in June of 2017.\n\nThe same goes for my time in the Obama Administration. In the 2008 election Americans chose Barack Obama as their leader, and I didn't think too deeply about it. I was doing my professor gig. I was happy teaching students like you and doing research on housing.\n\nAt the time, the country was in the midst of a housing crisis. But I was still surprised when I got a call in December from Washington asking if I would be willing to meet with folks about a leadership role in the Administration. Well, I was confirmed by the Senate in the late spring and started work in the summer. That all happened in just seven months, folks!\n\nYou may be wondering why that surprised me. After all, it was during a housing crisis, as I mentioned, and I was a housing expert. Well, the truth was that I didn't see myself that way. Like many of you, I figured my only direct connection to presidential and federal policy was voting. I couldn't imagine myself in a bigger-picture role. My view of what was possible was limited to what I saw and knew. I was where you are now.\n\nSo, having been in your shoes, let me offer two pieces of advice.\n\nFirst, be open to the unexpected. People will see things in you that you haven't seen in yourself, like they did me. Be willing to take risks and explore those options. Second, vote in every election. While it is a duty of citizenship, it is also your chance to weigh in on your future. This is an important time, and your voice needs to be heard. Use it.\n\nOne piece of advice you don't need is about what to study. Through your work here at Augusta Tech, you have put yourselves in a wonderful position.\n\nHere's why I think so. One of the things I love about my job is I get to talk to people who are making big decisions that help to shape our economy. In these conversations, I hear a consistent story about the country's work force—there are not enough people with the skills employers need, especially in fields where many of you are trained to work, like advanced manufacturing and health services. Data and research support that story.\n\nIn the manufacturing sector, attracting and keeping talent is so difficult that a company told our Atlanta Fed staff that they have turned to recruiting high school students to fill the gaps in its workforce. Talent is sufficiently scarce that a big car maker in Alabama is sending its own employees to work in its suppliers' plants because those suppliers are short-staffed.\n\nThis situation might not change soon.\n\nGeorgia state officials say that if plans announced since 2018 come to fruition, electric vehicle firms will need more than 30,000 workers in Georgia. Many of them will need the kinds of cognitive and hands-on skills that you all have acquired.\n\nFor those of you who studied health sciences, you also chose wisely. Between now and 2032, health care is projected to be the fastest-growing category of jobs in the US economy.\n\nIn important ways, you all represent the connective tissue of our economy and society. Without people with your skills and talents, our economy will be less prosperous, less competitive on the world stage, and our overall standard of living will suffer. In a US economy with perpetual labor shortages, you are positioned to be a big part of the solution.\n\nKindred spirits\n\nThis is where I see you and our institution working toward the same goal. At the Atlanta Fed, one of our core strategies is to foster an economy that works for everybody. That means an economy in which everyone can find and keep a good job that makes maximum use of their skills, education, talents, and training.\n\nYou graduates are set to do exactly that. You will play a key role in realizing the aspiration of building an economy that works for everybody.\n\nSo, helping to maximize the number of highly trained, talented workers in our country, and helping those workers find and keep family-supporting employment are important to my institution, just as those goals are at the core of your alma mater's mission. In that respect, Augusta Tech—and that includes you, its graduates—and the Atlanta Fed are kindred spirits.\n\nFrom this point forward, you will be Augusta Tech alumni, and you should take pride in that. But before you're all the way out of here, as a former professor, I'd like to leave you with a little homework. Don't worry. It won't be hard.\n\nAs alumni, you have a stake in the institution's ongoing success. You can help ensure that the school continues to thrive.\n\nWhen I was a professor, I drew on alums to fill many roles. For example, I would invite them to be guest speakers, because it's valuable for students to hear from people in the fields they want to pursue. I asked graduates to grade projects because they bring a real-world, state-of-the-industry perspective to the task.\n\nThere are plenty of ways you can make a difference in the lives of those who come after you. Helping others is one of life's great pleasures. And it is a two-way street.\n\nWhen you help others, you help yourselves. You hone skills, such as public speaking and mentoring. That will make you a lifelong learner, which we all have to be in these days of constant changes in technology and the labor market. As you keep learning, you prepare yourself to solve a broader set of problems than the ones you are ready to tackle now coming out of school.\n\nIn closing, let me repeat my heartfelt congratulations to the class of 2024. You've persevered, through turbulent times in society and the economy, and many of you in ways that even your classmates probably don't know about.\n\nGraduation is a milestone to be cherished, for sure. Yet this is the start of a career journey. The ceremony is called commencement, after all, because it is a beginning, not an end.\n\nI offered two pieces of advice a moment ago, but I'm going to leave you with a little more as I finish.\n\nYour credentials will open doors. But what matters then is what you do once you go through those doors. Give your best effort every day. We are in a place named for a giant of 20th-century music known as the hardest-working man in show business. So, emulate James Brown in that way. Be the hardest-working person in your business.\n\nFinally, be true to yourself. Bring your whole self to every task. Always be open to lessons and opportunities where you find them because they will often turn up in surprising places and at surprising times.\n\nI have a favorite phrase that relates to dancing and the electric slide that I alluded to earlier. I think it applies well here: Never walk where a dance will do. Do all you do with joy and flair, and the rest of us will sit back and watch you soar. Congratulations graduates!",

            "highlights": "Atlanta Fed president and CEO Raphael Bostic spoke at the Confronting America's Housing Crisis conference hosted by Tulane University's Murphy Institute about how the quest to making safe and affordable housing available faces urgent challenges.",
            "content": "Good afternoon. It's a pleasure to be here. I always enjoy visiting New Orleans. It's one of our country's most distinctive and colorful places. Thank you to Hoov, Dean Goes, Dean Alday, and all the organizers for inviting me.\n\nThis conference is exploring one of the bedrock economic issues of our time. Housing is so foundational to family well-being and security that one could argue that it transcends economics.\n\nThat's why I've devoted a great deal of my career to studying housing and the critical role it plays in economic inclusion and the development of cities. Indeed, for many years, a catchphrase that emerged from my time in the Obama Administration that I frequently used was \"housing as a platform,\" meaning that people had better outcomes in other areas, like education and employment, when they were housed well.\n\nUnfortunately, on many fronts our capacity to provide the basic need for housing is not what it should be. So, I'm eager to discuss the urgent challenges we face in the quest to make available safe and affordable housing for as many of our fellow citizens as possible.\n\nBefore I dive into my remarks, let me issue my standard disclaimer: I do not speak for anyone else at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta or the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.\n\nHousing is central to economic inclusion\n\nAllow me to start with a word about why housing supply and affordability and broader economic inclusion matter to a monetary policymaker. Soon after I joined the Atlanta Fed in 2017, we adopted advancing economic mobility and resilience as a strategic focus. We did so because we view economic mobility and resilience as essential to an inclusive economy and especially to the pursuit of sustainable maximum employment, which is one side of the Fed's dual mandate, next to price stability.\n\nIn our work on economic mobility and resilience, we try to understand and explain why some people and places prosper and rebound from shocks while others do not. In other words, we seek to identify those for whom the economy is not working, then understand the reasons why and what might be done to change the relevant conditions.\n\nA substantial literature and history tell us that a more inclusive economy—one in which more people maximize their human capital and secure a job earning a family-supporting income—is a more robust economy, and an economy in which monetary policy is more effective.\n\nIn my view, true economic inclusion requires two core elements: income security and the ability to build wealth. Housing is fundamental to both and therefore essential to economic mobility and resilience and in turn economic inclusion.\n\nThe centrality of home ownership to economic mobility and resilience is apparent both from positive and negative perspectives. On the positive side, mass home ownership following World War II, facilitated by the GI Bill and other programs, catalyzed an enduring American middle class.\n\nOn the negative side, historic barriers to quality affordable housing are among the root causes of persistent economic disparities. The aforementioned GI Bill, for instance, effectively excluded nearly all Black veterans from its housing benefits, depriving countless families of the opportunity to plant the seeds of intergenerational wealth.\n\nIn various ways, the effects of historic barriers still reverberate. Research from Atlanta Fed economist Kris Gerardi and coauthors, for example, examines disparities along racial lines in the ability to tap housing wealth via home equity lines of credit and refinancing. Nutshell version: Black and Latino home owners tap their accumulated equity much less than do White home owners. Kris and his colleagues found that the gaps are primarily but not wholly driven by differences in credit scores and debt-to-income ratios and other observable factors.\n\nIf you want to know more about this, the paper is on the Philadelphia Fed's website, or you can talk to Kris. He's here with us and would be happy to talk with you.\n\nThis work matters because the ability to access housing wealth is vital, especially since housing is the largest asset in most financial portfolios. Home owners tap housing equity for various reasons, including smoothing consumption amid income or employment shocks like losing a job. Thus, identifying gaps along racial lines in the ease of accessing housing equity and addressing their causes are critical to any policy discussion grounded in advancing economic mobility and resilience.\n\nUnfortunately, today, housing—both as shelter and an investment—is not working as well as it could for too many of our neighbors. In the generally thriving metropolitan centers of the Sunbelt, in the major cities of the coasts and the Midwest, and even in smaller towns and rural communities, housing is unaffordable for far too many.\n\nIn describing the state of play, I'll call on our Bank's tools that track affordability: the Home Ownership Affordability Monitor and the Southeastern Rental Affordability Tracker.\n\nLet's start with home ownership.\n\nLike other data, our tools tell a pretty sobering story about affordability. Nationally, a household that earns the median income—roughly $75,000 a year—must spend 41 percent of that just to own the median-priced home, which would cost about $359,000. That percentage far exceeds the standard threshold for affordability, which is 30 percent. But you may be saying to yourself: this could be misleading if people and house prices are not distributed uniformly across geography. Instead, we should be looking at cities or metropolitan areas to make such an assessment.\n\nFortunately, we are able to do just that for our six-state district in the Southeast. Let me cite a couple of examples that tell the general story.\n\nThe Home Ownership Affordability Monitor shows that a household earning the median in the Atlanta metro area must spend 38 percent of its annual income to own the median-priced home in Atlanta—not affordable by definition, but better than the national situation.\n\nThe Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach region is our District's most prohibitive for prospective homebuyers. There, a median-price home gobbles up 54 percent of the earnings of a median-income household.\n\nThat's ownership. Housing affordability is also a challenge for renters. Our Rental Affordability Tracker describes conditions across the six states of the Sixth Federal Reserve district: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Tennessee. The affordability benchmark for renters is the same as for owners: anyone spending more than 30 percent of their income on rent is considered cost-burdened. Across our six states, the share of cost-burdened renters ranges from a low of 42 percent in Alabama to a high of 54 percent in Florida. This means that about half of all renters in our southeastern district are struggling to pay rent.\n\nLet's zoom in on the New Orleans-Metairie metro area. The affordability tracker tells us that more than half of renters—52 percent—are cost-burdened, and 31 percent are severely cost-burdened, meaning their rent payments consume more than half of household income.\n\nWhen renters are unable to pay rent, they are at risk of eviction—a deeply destabilizing event that can harm their ability to work, attend school, or find another place to live. A recent discussion paper by members of our Community and Economic Development team analyzed available eviction filing data and found that during the COVID-19 pandemic—when many renters experienced income shocks from lost work—renters in the Southeast experienced higher rates of eviction than renters across the country, even when eviction moratoria were in place. During this same period, data also show that state-administered emergency rental assistance dollars lagged in reaching renters in most of the states that make up our Bank's District, compared to other parts of the country.\n\nI've talked mainly about metropolitan areas. But rest assured that affordability is a concern in rural places as well. The issue takes on a different cast in rural areas. Median incomes are lower, and in many cases housing quality, even access to infrastructure such as sewage, are pressing concerns.\n\nIntriguing experiments in boosting housing supply\n\nYou might not know it from my remarks so far, but I truly am an optimistic person. So, let me turn to more hopeful tidings.\n\nI'll set this up by reminding you that house price is a result of supply and demand. Demand questions are complex in their own right and involve issues touching on workforce development, education, financial literacy, and interest rates, among other factors. But from here, I'd like to make the point that we must think creatively about how to enhance supply.\n\nI'm happy to say numerous experiments aimed at boosting housing production are taking shape in localities and states, providing real-world laboratories that could yield a great deal of information.\n\nStart in our own District. The state of Florida in 2023 instituted a law intended to relax zoning restrictions to make it easier to build housing, including affordable housing. Both parties in the legislature collaborated to overwhelmingly approve the Live Local Act, as the law is called.\n\nAmong other provisions, the law allows housing to be built in areas zoned for industrial and commercial use and relaxes building height restrictions. It is early yet, and we have not seen much in the way of results.\n\nBut the measure has already sparked pushback from local governments, developers, community groups, and other quarters. In response, the state legislature has amended the law to address some concerns by, for example, tightening the original building height standards. Public feedback and fine tuning are part of the experimentation process, and despite the pushback, the Live Local Act could significantly affect housing supply in the nation's third most populous state. So, it bears watching.\n\nFurther from home, the city of St. Paul, Minnesota, in 2023 overhauled its zoning code to promote housing density, accessibility, and affordability. In particular, the city eliminated zoning classifications that required the building of only detached single-family houses in designated areas.\n\nInteresting experiments are happening outside metropolitan centers as well. Public officials, social entrepreneurs, and others are working to expand housing in rural places. Some of you in the architecture school here at Tulane are probably familiar with the Auburn University College of Architecture's Rural Studio. Over the past 30 years, the studio has designed and built more than 200 projects, mostly homes, in an underserved rural county in west Alabama. I think it would be interesting to assess this long-running initiative to determine whether there are viable ways to scale it.\n\nA newer program from a Louisville-based nonprofit called Next Step Network is championing prefabricated and manufactured housing as a solution to supply constraints, particularly in rural communities. One of Next Step's first projects is underway in Virginia. A Next Step representative will speak on a panel in May at the Richmond Fed's Investing in Rural America conference.\n\nOther efforts are afoot that aim to make manufactured housing a more significant part of the answer to shortages. For example, Maryland's governor is backing a legislative package that, among other measures, would make it harder for cities to outright ban manufactured homes.\n\nTo be sure, the locales I've cited feature cultural and political characteristics that might render the programs and proposals there ill-suited to other jurisdictions. Furthermore, potential solutions to boost housing supply often raise concerns, ranging from a stigma attached to traditional notions of manufactured housing to basic resistance to greater density.\n\nStill, I think we can learn a great deal from the experiments, both in terms of what housing actually gets built and what doesn't, and from the ongoing public debates over the various proposals and programs. Hopefully we can use those lessons to better inform efforts to balance the competing concerns that influence housing production and ultimately produce more housing.\n\nI should note that traditional market forces can also act to boost housing production. As in many places, construction in the Atlanta area has ramped up because of low inventories available for sale. Yet nearly all the production is tilted toward the higher end. Zonda Intelligence, which gathers home building data, calculates that more than 90 percent of new starts are homes priced at $300,000 and up, compared to 48 percent of new housing starts priced in this range before the pandemic.\n\nZoning, permitting getting tougher?\n\nMany of the experiments I mentioned and others like them include provisions meant to ease regulatory and permitting burdens that tend to restrict production. But broader evidence on those conditions paints a complicated picture.\n\nYou all are likely familiar with the Wharton Residential Land Use Regulatory Index, the only comprehensive national measure of the regulatory factors that influence home production. The researchers behind the survey recently updated the work, and their findings were fascinating. They demonstrate that in many localities land-use regulation has become more stringent over time, in contradiction to what numerous surveys suggest is an emerging public preference for regulation more favorable to housing production.\n\nA 2023 survey conducted for the Pew Charitable Trusts, to cite one measure, found that most Americans support a menu of zoning policies meant to enhance housing availability and affordability. Notably, nearly 90 percent of respondents said they would support measures to expedite permitting processes.\n\nYet, even as public sentiment appears to have solidified behind boosting production and affordability, the updated Wharton survey finds little evidence that actual policy has moved accordingly.\n\nA quick exercise by Atlanta Fed researchers revealed a tight correlation between the restrictiveness of land use regulation at the county and metro area levels and the unaffordability of housing, based on our Bank's affordability monitor. Not surprisingly, perhaps, it appears that the tighter the regulatory environment, the costlier the housing market, broadly speaking.\n\nComplex puzzles with more questions than answers\n\nNow, I've covered a fair bit of ground. To synthesize, I think this material underscores the reality that our dearth of housing, and particularly of affordable housing, is a vexing, incredibly complex puzzle.\n\nMost of us say we want more housing yet, at the same time, we appear to be making it hard to get more housing.\n\nThis might sound oversimplified, but what it comes down to in the end is the relative value we place on various public and private goods in our communities and how those values manifest in policy and regulations.\n\nI suspect you may be thinking I've raised more questions than I've offered answers. I won't disagree. As I noted, the affordable housing crisis and general scarcity of housing defy easy solutions.\n\nThat's why conferences like this are so valuable. We need to follow the various experiments taking place, mine the research, and lift up the best thinking. In that spirit, I am looking forward to learning from the panels, papers, and informal conversations we'll enjoy over the coming days.\n\nAs a former professor and kind-of-former researcher, I've participated in a lot of these convenings. And being an academic at heart means I like to assign homework. So, I ask you, as you learn from gatherings like this and as you conduct research, don't imprison your findings in scholarly journals. Take the steps necessary to ensure that laypeople and policymakers understand the knowledge you discover and can employ it to make a real impact and get us closer to solving these critically important puzzles.\n\nIt will take all of us to ultimately assemble the pieces, but it can be done.

            "highlights": "Atlanta Fed president and CEO Raphael Bostic speaks to the Money Marketeers of New York University about how he is formulating his view of the appropriate path of monetary policy.",
            "content": "Good evening. It's a pleasure to be back with the Money Marketeers.\n\nThe last time I was here was in November 2019. If only we had known what was looming four months from then, at which point all of our lives were turned upside down. I think our conversations that night would have been quite a bit different. I'm thankful that we've come a long way from the depths of the pandemic. I imagine you all are, too.\n\nOn that November evening, I talked about how the Atlanta Fed gathers and synthesizes data, survey findings, and anecdotal feedback to formulate a coherent monetary policy stance. These aspects of the policymaking process remain equally important today, though the macroeconomic context is quite different.\n\nAt that time, inflation had been below our 2 percent objective for the better part of a decade; most of us thought of global pandemics as historical oddities if we thought of them at all; and unemployment was continuing a steady decline that started soon after the Great Recession ended in 2009.\n\nFast forward to today. Combined with a healing supply side of the economy—including goods supply chains and labor supply—restrictive monetary policy has helped to decelerate the inflation rate more rapidly than even optimists expected. Yet inflation on a year-over-year basis remains above 2 percent. In a stark departure from historical norms, disinflation has proceeded absent significant weakening of the labor market or economic activity. That has been a most pleasant surprise.\n\nThis difference is stark and presents a challenge for me and my Fed colleagues. Today, I will try to offer some insights on how I'm approaching this challenge as I work to formulate a view of the appropriate path for monetary policy.\n\nNow, I do not speak for the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) nor for the Federal Reserve Board. The thoughts I will share are strictly my own.\n\nThe economy, broadly speaking, is in a good position. But in good times and bad, monetary policymaking is a highly complex endeavor not fit for bumper-sticker solutions. That said, to communicate clearly to the public and markets, I like to identify certain key words that encapsulate my policy stance in the moment.\n\nFor the past two years, my watchwords have been purposeful, cautious, resolute, and patient: purposeful in formulating policy based not on noise but signals extracted from incoming data; cautious in calibrating my stance given broad uncertainty in the economy; resolute in my commitment to keep rates as high as needed to lower inflation to the Committee's price stability objective; and patient in my reaction to incoming data to be sure inflation is on a sustainable path toward 2 percent.\n\nConditions have changed, and so too have my watchwords. Today, my words are grateful yet vigilant: I am grateful for the substantial progress toward price stability. On a year-over-year basis, the headline inflation rate per the Committee's preferred gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, is down to just over 2.5 percent from over 7 percent in mid-2022. Shorter-term measures are even more positive.\n\nYet I am vigilant because, despite clear progress in the fight against inflation with little damage to labor markets and the macroeconomy, the fight is not finished. Look no further than this week's Consumer Price Index (CPI) report for evidence of that. As Chair Jerome Powell pointed out in his press conference following the January FOMC meeting, the Committee will need to see continuing evidence to build confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our goal.\n\nNow you may have noticed that my descriptions of being patient and being vigilant were quite similar, and I concede the point. However, the context moves me to settle on a word that projects more timely urgency and care.\n\nLet me say a bit more about the underpinnings of my vigilant posture.\n\nRisks have become more balanced\n\nSince responding to the 2021 spike in inflation by rapidly increasing the restrictiveness of monetary policy, the Committee has been seeking to manage two primary risks. One is staying in a highly restrictive stance for too long, thus potentially inflicting unnecessary damage to labor markets and the economy. The other is removing restriction too soon, which could leave the inflation rate stalled above 2 percent or spark a reacceleration that moves inflation further from our target. This latter scenario would conjure the unwelcome specter of the 1970s and '80s, when loosening policy too soon sparked repeated flareups in inflation that the Fed did not decisively quell for 15 years, and only then at the cost of two painful recessions.\n\nWhile the second risk—that inflation doesn't get to target—has dominated my thinking since inflation spiked and we raised rates, today I see the risks as much more balanced. For example, absent some new shock to the economy, a reacceleration of inflation seems much less likely in the near and medium terms.\n\nBut let me share a truism I've come to appreciate profoundly: economic forecasting is difficult. If you have a friend you feel needs humbling, tell them to try it some time. (Certainly, none of us in this room needs to be told that.) While this truism holds generally, it is even more deeply true in an economy still seeking a path back to normal after the extreme disruption of everyday life associated with a global pandemic. Thus, one of the core messages of classic economics texts—aggressive rate hikes produce rising unemployment and slowing economic activity that suppress inflation—has not held up in our model-defying reality.\n\nInstead, as inflation decelerated, employment growth has outpaced its performance amid previous tightening cycles (chart 1). The picture illustrates that monthly job growth slowed more dramatically in past cycles. In fact, employment growth turned negative on average within six months of the end of a tightening cycle. That has not happened this time. The disparity has actually widened between the strength of today's labor market and typical labor market conditions at this juncture in past tightening cycles.\n\nEconometric evidence suggests that previous tightening cycles on average led to increases in the unemployment rate of 1.5 percentage points. Research from Christina and David Romer found that contractions in employment were most concentrated in the construction and durable goods manufacturing sectors.\n\nNot this time. Those sectors have so far added employment. As for the entire labor market, when the Committee began raising the fed funds rate in March 2022, the headline unemployment rate was 3.6 percent; now, after 11 rate hikes, it's 3.7 percent.\n\nMonthly payroll employment growth has been roughly a half percentage point stronger this cycle compared to historical norms, as the chart illustrates.\n\nAnd after monthly employment growth slowed last fall, indicating a cooling labor market, job growth surged anew the past two months. Further, average hourly earnings picked up over the past three months. Wage growth will be a key metric to watch in coming months to determine whether these pressures are tied more to year-end salary adjustments or a signal of more persistent pressures from a tight labor market.\n\nThe labor market news is not all pointing in the same direction. Even as headline job growth and wage growth remain strong, another key labor market measure is signaling some cooling. The job openings rate peaked in March 2022 but has steadily declined since. Still, the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that the vacancy rate remains higher than it was at any point before the pandemic.\n\nThe upshot of all this: the labor market is remarkably strong considering tighter monetary policy and the steep decline in the rate of inflation.\n\nAs for GDP growth, the story is much the same. Econometric evidence suggests past tightening cycles on average led to about a half percentage point dip in real GDP over two to two-and-a-half years. By contrast, real GDP grew at a 3.3 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter by the initial estimate, and at a 3.1 percent clip for all of 2023. That's a more robust performance than private sector forecasts anticipated and, quite frankly, more robust than what we at the Atlanta Fed expected.\n\nIt is more than the aggregate data suggesting the economy and labor market may still have gas in the tank. As I discussed in my earlier visit with you, our Bank employs a team that gathers and analyzes anecdotal reports from business contacts across the Southeast.\n\nToday, the gist of the story we hear from contacts is that, despite moderating activity, businesses are not distressed. Rather, many are sitting on pause, awaiting the optimal time to deploy assets and resume hiring to expand their operations. To me, this carries the ring of expectant optimism—perhaps even pent-up exuberance—with the potential to unleash a burst of new demand that could reverse the progress we have observed toward rebalancing supply and demand across the economy. In my view, this constitutes a new upside risk to my outlook that bears scrutiny in coming months.\n\nThat's anecdotal evidence, yes. But I trust our grassroots intelligence as an essential complement to the data. Our methods of gathering and processing feedback are sound, and the information from our Regional Economic Information Network has proven prescient before. To cite one instance, our contacts sounded early warnings in 2021 that emergent price pressures were likely to persist beyond just a few months.\n\nThat feedback was one reason why, if I may say so, I was a relatively early skeptic concerning the transitory inflation narrative.\n\nSo, scanning the broad macroeconomic horizon, one can only conclude that this monetary policy cycle is different. And just like you all as market participants, I as a monetary policymaker must grapple with new realities and formulate policy positions at a time when our go-to templates are of limited utility.\n\nWe are not done with inflation\n\nWhat I am gleaning from those new realities right now is that a durable labor market rally, alongside muscular economic growth and resurgent business optimism, would argue for continued patience in unwinding monetary policy restriction.\n\nBut what of declining inflation? Well, on the surface, rapid deceleration would appear to offer a counterargument to leaving restriction in place much longer. As I noted, headline numbers on a 12-month, six-month, and three-month basis are at or near the Committee's 2 percent objective. Though the upside surprise in the January CPI will probably translate, at least partially, into a higher PCE inflation report, these trends will not likely be substantially reversed as a result of one month's data. But even if that is not the case, I require more confidence before declaring victory in this fight for price stability. Allow me to dig a little deeper and explain why.\n\nFirst, goods inflation may rebound a bit in coming months (chart 2). Many businesses still have inventories to work through, and may ramp up orders for goods once those inventories are exhausted. As the chart illustrates, falling goods prices have accounted for a significant share of the decline in the inflation rate, so a reversal there could complicate the pursuit of price stability.\n\nSecond, a shade over a third of the PCE basket rose at rates at or above 5 percent in December (chart 3). That share is in line with similarly elevated reports over the past six months and remains well above the roughly 20 percent share that would be consistent with a price change distribution when inflation is at its target, as the slide shows. So, inflation pressures are still more broad-based than we'd prefer, frankly.\n\nThe third piece of evidence I'll cite in arguing that it is not yet time to be sanguine about inflation is that the Dallas Fed's trimmed-mean PCE price statistic, which is one of the better predictors of the near-term inflation trend, posted a 2.6 percent annualized increase in December, identical to its reading over the past six months. That suggests that underlying inflation is still loitering just outside the neighborhood of 2 percent.\n\nFinally, note all the red in this picture (chart 4). This is our Underlying Inflation Dashboard. Red means, basically, well above target, and as of December, two-thirds of the metrics that comprise the dashboard are still in the red.\n\nBeyond nuts-and-bolts inflation dynamics, the world at large remains rife with uncertainty that could still derail our progress to price stability. Consumer debt loads are growing, particularly among those at the lower end of the income and wealth distribution. Geopolitical risks could rattle energy markets or financial markets and reintroduce snarls in supply chains, developments that would likely exert upward pressure on prices.\n\nHistory may not be a good guide\n\nFinally, let me plainly state a reality that I think is quite important: economic history does not seem to be repeating itself. While this will be something that economic historians will ultimately debate over coming years, my staff and I have been wrestling with what we think might be two reasons for this.\n\nFor one, we are still navigating the turbulent wake of what we hope was a once-in-a-century global pandemic. Few models contemplated severe kinks in global supply chains resulting from clogged seaports and factory closures; months when tens of millions of consumers would be homebound while retail stores, entertainment venues, and the travel industry were paralyzed; governments providing trillions of dollars in fiscal support; and the US labor market abruptly losing 20 million jobs.\n\nIf there is an overarching lesson I've taken from the pandemic experience, it is humility: to expect to be surprised. If we use that admittedly simple intellectual framing, then the atypical macroeconomic effects of this aggressive monetary policy tightening regime should perhaps be less surprising.\n\nSecond, a case can be made that the US economy has grown less sensitive to interest rates. That's in part because the most interest-sensitive sectors, concentrated in goods production, account for a dwindling share of overall economic activity. In a 2018 paper, Jason Brown of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City calculated that over the past 50 years, the share of GDP from services has risen from nearly 60 percent to 80 percent, while the goods production share shrunk by half.\n\nOn top of the role played by compositional industry shifts, research by Atlanta Fed economist Jon Willis found that the transmission of monetary policy to individual industries has weakened over time. Using the response of employment to changes in the federal funds rate as the measure of monetary policy transmission, the analysis suggests that the interest sensitivity of employment has declined since the mid-1980s for nearly all industries as well as for the overall economy.\n\nIf rate sensitivity has declined, the implications for policy are potentially significant. For example, the efficacy of monetary policy could generally be lower or those making monetary policy might need to hold rates at either a restrictive or stimulative posture for longer to generate the same economic response. These would be big deals.\n\nBut let me acknowledge another thing: this is not settled economics. Even within my building, there is a debate about how enduring these changes will be in the longer term. In my view, this will be something that economists will be debating for many years to come.\n\nBut even if you don't buy arguments for structural change, it remains true today that many households and businesses have refinanced into low-cost loans that have locked them into payments streams that will not be as sensitive to interest rates as they might be in more normal times. That, plus the extra cash that many have on hand, might mean less sensitivity to our policy moves in the shorter term.\n\nSo to close, looking ahead, my expectation is that the rate of inflation will continue to decline, but more slowly than the pace implied by where the markets signal monetary policy should be. As some colleagues and I have noted, we will likely soon contemplate the appropriate time for monetary policy to become less restrictive. Right now, a strong labor market and macroeconomy offer the chance to execute these policy decisions without oppressive urgency.\n\nPut simply, we have made substantial and gratifying progress in slowing the pace of inflation. All things considered, the US economy is in a good spot, even an enviable spot compared to other major economies.\n\nBut from my vantage point, the evidence from data, our surveys, and our outreach says that victory is not clearly in hand, and leaves me not yet comfortable that inflation is inexorably declining to our 2 percent objective. That may be true for some time, even if the January CPI report turns out to be an aberration. So that gratitude will be accompanied by vigilance, and I will be ready to do what it takes to achieve our monetary policy mandates.\n\nThank you, and I'd be happy to take some of your questions.",

            "content": "Thank you for joining us for this important conference. I'm absolutely thrilled that the Atlanta Fed is one of the six regional Reserve Banks that have joined with the Board of Governors to bring you this exploration of persistent disparities in labor market outcomes along with the latest thinking on how we can remedy those disparities.\n\nAt the Atlanta Fed, our tagline is \"an economy that works for everyone.\" Such an economy will feature a labor market in which everyone can maximize their human capital and potential and find work commensurate with that full potential. The appeal of having this kind of economy is that it will be more resilient, more innovative, and more prosperous.\n\nIn this context, few topics are more important than uneven labor market outcomes, because the path to full participation—that is, an inclusive economy—starts with everyone having a good job. Over the next four days, we will see presentations on issues critical to practitioners and policymakers, including:\n\nI'm especially pleased there will be presentations about workforce development and education. These topics have long been a special focus of the Atlanta Fed—we have a Center for Workforce and Economic Opportunity, for example—because we believe workforce development and education are essential for spreading opportunity and advancing the concept of maximum employment.\n\nThe definition of maximum employment has evolved\n\nAs you may know, maximum employment is one of two parts of the Fed's monetary policy mandate. A core goal of this conference is to expand the body of knowledge that informs the definition and measurement of maximum employment by examining and explaining disparities in labor market outcomes within and among demographic segments.\n\nRefining our understanding of maximum employment matters in part because gauging progress toward the two sides of the Fed's mandate differs in an important way. The price stability objective is clear: we pursue 2 percent inflation over time. However, maximum employment is a more ambiguous notion that evolves with changing economic circumstances.\n\nFor instance, when I started this job in 2017, the accepted wisdom was that full employment meant an unemployment rate of roughly 4 1/2 percent.\n\nWell, that's changed. Outside the brief but severe pandemic recession, unemployment has been below 4.5 percent for nearly seven years, and in many months by a significant amount. My colleagues have acknowledged this shift. The median long-run expectation among Federal Open Market Committee participants for unemployment is now about 4.1 percent.\n\nSo, as we formulate policy to try and foster sustained maximum employment, it is critical to ground policy in the best current research and dispense with assumptions and conventional wisdom that do not characterize today's labor markets.\n\nThe challenges we face in closing labor market gaps are as acute as ever. Disparities persist along many dimensions—race, gender, rural-metropolitan geography, and even among ZIP codes within cities. And the pandemic exacerbated many of those challenges.\n\nRemote work is here to stay—but for everyone?\n\nMy staff and I have identified nearly a dozen potentially structural changes to labor markets associated with the pandemic. Now don't worry, I'm not going to review all of them here. Instead, I will discuss a few changes that I think are significant.\n\nFirst, we see signs suggesting that the work-from-home phenomenon is here to stay. That is good news for higher-wage workers in metropolitan areas, but less meaningful to people in lower-wage service jobs.\n\nResearch, including work by Atlanta Fed staff, suggests that in coming years, some 40 percent of workdays will be performed remotely in densely populated areas and about half that much in less populated places. And the occupational breakdown of those likeliest to work from home probably won't change much, as lower-wage workers in frontline, public-facing jobs will be much less likely to work remotely than higher-paid professionals.\n\nThus, it appears that the amenity benefits of the shift to work-from-home could be unevenly distributed across industries, occupations, locations, and demographic groups.\n\nIf historical patterns hold, workers from certain demographic groups will be less likely to enjoy the amenity benefits of working from home. Presentations by practitioners and other participants at the Federal Reserve's Racism and the Economy webinar series suggest that Black and Latino workers may fall into this category, as they are disproportionately in occupations linked to a location, such as food preparation, cleaning, and health service support.\n\nOn a more hopeful note, remote work opportunities may erase barriers to work for some. For example, the chance to work at home could improve job opportunities for those with disabilities. Remote work might also help workers who face transportation challenges or those whose family responsibilities require flexibility in their schedules.\n\nThe narrowing pay hike gap has boosted labor force participation\n\nNext, the pandemic was quite unusual in terms of wages. When the virus's penetration was most intense, in a departure from usual economic downturns, lower-wage workers generally enjoyed the biggest proportional pay increases. Available labor was particularly scarce, so employers had to pay up to attract employees. Our Bank's Wage Growth Tracker shows that growth in the bottom half of the wage distribution was significantly higher than in the upper half during the thick of the pandemic. Coupled with significant pandemic policy support, this has meant that lower-wage workers are in a stronger economic position than they would ordinarily be. This truth may have contributed to the increase in entrepreneurship we witnessed during the past several years.\n\nHowever, that gap in pay hikes has largely closed as a strong labor market has attracted more people off the sidelines, boosting labor force participation to a surprising degree. That means that supply and demand for labor are more aligned and wage growth across the pay spectrum is settling back into more normal patterns.\n\nThe pandemic triggered other meaningful shifts in the labor market. For one, it appears to have sped up a retirement boom that was already in train because of an aging population. The faster-than-usual exodus of older workers early in the pandemic contributed greatly to the extreme tightness of the labor market in 2021 and 2022. Though baby boomers will continue retiring apace, it remains an open question as to whether we will see another sudden spike in retirements.\n\nWe have also witnessed interesting labor force participation effects during the pandemic era. We saw an initial drop in participation among women, especially women with young children, as the virus exploited weaknesses in the childcare sector. Opioid abuse also spiked during this time, resulting in a drop in participation of younger men. These dynamics point to lost economic potential, a barrier to sustainable maximum employment.\n\nMore recently, the surprises in labor force participation have been to the upside. For example, women have returned to the labor market in force, and have enjoyed some of their highest participation rates in US history. This has contributed to supply increasing more than many expected, feeding a more rapid decline in inflation than many had forecast.\n\nPrivate-sector employment growth fueled by health care and social assistance\n\nI want to also point out that we have seen some interesting sectoral labor market developments. As you know, unemployment across the US economy remains historically low. Yet employment growth is slowing, and in recent months job creation has been heavily concentrated in one comparatively small sector: health care and social assistance.\n\nHealth care and social assistance account for only 14 percent of private-sector employment, but have accounted for 60 percent of private employment growth over the past several months.\n\nHealth care makes up the bulk of employment in this sector, and there are good reasons to believe health care employment will continue to punch above its weight in employment growth.\n\nFor one, health care employment plummeted early in the COVID wave and still hasn't caught up to its prepandemic trend line. Longer term, an aging population should continue to fuel job growth in health care and social assistance. An older population uses more health care, and the US Bureau of Labor Statistics recently projected that the 65-and-older population will increase by 14.4 million people over the next 10 years.\n\nIt's dangerous to proclaim with certainty that any pandemic-era phenomenon will shape future labor markets. But these are all potentially significant developments that could be important drivers of labor market dynamics in the future. They, and other forces, will thus shape our understanding of maximum employment and will be important considerations for us as we pursue a monetary policy path seeking to achieve both of our mandates.\n\nLet me stop there.\n\nThis conference is an excellent example of the role the Federal Reserve can play in bringing together research, policy, and practice on these issues, and connecting people who might otherwise not meet. These convenings can be incredibly powerful in moving us forward, toward better understanding and addressing uneven outcomes in labor markets.\n\nThank you again for joining us.

            "content": "Good afternoon. As many of you probably noted, the title of my talk today is an homage to the Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King Jr. as we conclude the week when the nation honors his legacy.\n\nIt's a privilege to be with you. I'd like to especially thank publisher David Rubinger and the staff at the Atlanta Business Chronicle for hosting this event. I spend a good deal of time with journalists and the press more generally, but I don't say often enough that I believe they do our community and our country a service. Informed consumers and business leaders make better decisions, and that in turn improves the efficacy of monetary policy and the workings of our economy. So, thanks to you all.\n\nToday, I will discuss my latest thinking on the macroeconomy and monetary policy, this time in my capacity as a voting member of the Federal Reserve's policymaking Federal Open Market Committee. The Atlanta Fed president votes every three years, and 2024 is my turn.\n\nBefore I go further, though, let me remind you that the thoughts I'll share are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect the views of my colleagues on the Committee or at the Atlanta Fed.\n\nAs we enter a new year, we may be approaching a new phase in the monetary policy cycle that began in March 2022. Then, the Committee initiated a series of moves that raised the federal funds rate from effectively zero to a range of 5 1/4 to 5 1/2 percent, as we took action to subdue a bout of inflation born of pandemic-induced economic imbalances. Where are we now in this fight?\n\nThis slide illustrates that the real federal funds rate—that is, our interest rate adjusted for inflation—is at its highest level in over a decade (chart 1). To summarize one key takeaway for you, my view today is that monetary policy is at an appropriately restrictive stance, sufficient to promote the return of inflation to our 2 percent target over the medium term.\n\nFor me, the primary challenge now shifts to assessing how long the federal funds target range should be held at its current level before it will be appropriate to begin unwinding the restrictive stance of policy.\n\nIn forming this judgment, the Committee must gauge the long and variable lags of monetary policy—that is, how much bite from restrictive policy remains to play out—in determining the path for normalizing the federal funds rate that will be consistent with achieving the dual mandate Congress has given us. As a reminder, our charge is to return inflation to our target of 2 percent over time while supporting the strongest possible pace of employment growth.\n\nYou have no doubt heard the goal of getting inflation to 2 percent while experiencing limited or no employment loss described in the popular press as a \"soft landing.\" While I generally avoid using this term, as it doesn't really have a clear definition, whether one calls this dynamic a \"soft landing,\" \"the golden path,\" \"immaculate disinflation,\" or something else, the fact is that it is quite rare and awfully hard to achieve.\n\nBut so far, so good. Probably the clearest illustration of our progress is this: when the Committee began increasing the federal funds rate in March 2022, the headline unemployment rate was 3.6 percent. It was 3.7 percent last month. So, the Committee has undertaken one of the most aggressive policy-tightening campaigns in recent Fed history without significant damage to the labor market. That is highly unusual.\n\nWhile that progress is encouraging, I want to stress two things. First, we are still a ways from our 2 percent target. Second, there remains considerable uncertainty about how supply and demand in the economy will evolve in 2024 as we seek to promote a return to balance of these two fundamental forces.\n\nInflation rate declining faster than expected\n\nLet me offer context for my policy views. Over the past year, many of the key data points I monitor have moved more rapidly than my team and I, along with most forecasters, expected. In large part, that is why we may be approaching the time to consider removing restriction from our policy.\n\nWhat are these fast-moving indicators?\n\nStart with overall economic activity. In the early and middle parts of 2023, most economic observers, including economists at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, predicted that tight financial conditions would contribute to a mild recession in late 2023 followed by a moderately paced recovery. We at the Atlanta Fed were a tad more optimistic. At the start of 2023, rather than seeing a recession, our staff projected gross domestic product (GDP) growth of about 1 percent for the year.\n\nWell, the US economy proved to be even more vigorous than our more optimistic outlook. We subsequently bumped the forecast up to about 2.1 percent in September, and we are now expecting GDP growth to come in at 2.6 to 2.7 percent for the year. We'll get the first estimate in a week.\n\nInflation has similarly surprised us to the good (chart 2).\n\nIn June of last year, we forecast that year-end 2023 inflation, as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, the Committee's preferred metric, would be around 3.5 percent. Late last year, we lowered our forecast to 2.9 percent.\n\nWell, the latest print has PCE inflation at 2.6 percent for the 12 months through November. (The US Bureau of Economic Analysis will release PCE inflation for December next week.)\n\nTaken together, these data indicate that the golden path of declining inflation and still-solid labor markets and economic growth may stretch farther than most of us figured just a few months ago.\n\nBecause I'm data dependent, I have incorporated the unexpected progress on inflation and economic activity into my outlook, and thus moved up my projected time to begin normalizing the federal funds rate to the third quarter of this year from the fourth quarter.\n\nOn balance, it appears that restrictive monetary policy is indeed working to help lower the rate of inflation. The rub is that if we keep policy too restrictive for too long, we risk doing unnecessary damage to the labor market and the macroeconomy.\n\nHere, I think it is worth considering what my staff and I call \"passive tightening.\" Basically, this means that as the inflation rate declines, and the federal funds rate holds steady, policy in effect becomes tighter.\n\nPut another way, to borrow an analogy from my friend Austan Goolsbee at the Chicago Fed, this phase of policymaking is a bit like cooking a holiday turkey. You clearly need heat to cook the turkey. But everyone in this room knows that one faces the risk of overcooking the turkey by leaving it in at full baking heat for too long, because the turkey continues to cook even after it is removed from the oven. You have to take the bird out before it is fully done or we get a dry holiday meal.\n\nLikewise, the effects of restrictive monetary policy could continue to impinge on economic activity and labor markets even after the Committee stops actively tightening. Therefore, we must seek a delicate balance, and the time to seriously ponder how we arrive at that balance will quite likely soon be at hand if it is not already.\n\nIf we wait too long to begin adjusting policy, we run the risk of overtightening the economy and serving up a labor market so weak that it unsettles the economic lives of more American families and businesses than necessary to get inflation back to our 2 percent target. So, our task now is to assess the economy's progress and decide when it is time to start easing our restrictive policy stance.\n\nWhat am I watching?\n\nLet me list a few metrics that will be of particular interest to me in assessing the appropriate path for policy in coming months.\n\nFirst, I will be looking at shorter-term inflation measures for clues to where the 12-month inflation readings are likely headed. As the chart shows, the six-month and three-month change in the PCE inflation gauge, respectively, were right at and a bit below the 2 percent target as of November (chart 2). I will look for continued good news there.\n\nNext, labor market indicators will offer important signals about whether we remain decisively on the path to 2 percent inflation without serious damage to employment.\n\nAfter surging in 2022 as labor demand dramatically outstripped supply, nominal wage growth is easing back toward the average annual rate of just over 3 percent that prevailed in the three years before the pandemic. Meanwhile, inflation has decelerated faster than nominal wage growth, so real inflation-adjusted wage increases nudged into positive territory in mid-2023 and are still climbing.\n\nHowever, real average hourly earnings remain below pre-COVID levels. So, a bit more acceleration in real wages should not necessarily spark a resurgence in inflation. In short, a normalization of real wage growth back to prepandemic levels would be conducive to reaching the inflation objective without tanking the economy, and by and large that's what we're seeing.\n\nFinally, I'm tracking job growth and job losses.\n\nFor now, the labor market remains broadly healthy—remarkably so during a forceful monetary policy tightening cycle. Even as employment growth has slowed over the past year, the economy is still adding enough jobs each month to hold the unemployment rate stable at historically low levels. And as my staff and I talk to business leaders, we hear very few say they expect layoffs.\n\nAt the same time, employment growth is slowing (chart 3). It would be slowing even more sharply but for one comparatively small employment sector: health care and social assistance.\n\nJobs in health care and social assistance, the bulk of which are in health care, account for only 14 percent of private-sector employment. Yet that single sector generated about 60 percent of private-sector job growth over the past seven months. In fact, without health care and social assistance, employment growth over the past several months would be below the level needed to keep the unemployment rate from rising.\n\nIf employment growth slows more rapidly, then that would complicate the task of continuing to promote disinflation alongside healthy economic activity. In that case, I would need to adjust my view of the appropriate path for policy.\n\nUncertainty abounds\n\nOf course, in the coming months none of this—continued disinflation, normalizing wage growth, a healthy labor market—is assured. We remain in a highly uncertain economic environment.\n\nRecall the continual shifts in the outlook for inflation and GDP growth I mentioned a moment ago. Those changes demonstrate just how difficult it remains to discern true signals from noise in this economy.\n\nThat's because uncertainty lurks in numerous corners. Conflicts around the world could again complicate global supply chains and rattle energy markets. Other geopolitical events including federal budget fights and elections at home and abroad could affect economic activity and financial markets. A weakening labor market could sap consumer spending that has buoyed GDP growth.\n\nIn light of these risks, it probably should not be surprising that our Survey of Business Uncertainty continues to find executives are more unsure of future sales and employment growth than they were before the pandemic.\n\nIn such an unpredictable environment, it would be unwise to lock in an emphatic approach to monetary policy. That is why I believe we should allow events to continue to unfold before beginning the process of normalizing policy.\n\nAs always, my views will be informed by incoming data, and I will remain steadfast in my commitment to achieving the 2 percent inflation objective. Should conditions evolve differently from my expectation, I am willing to adjust my view of policy based on what happens. Should underlying economic momentum prove stronger than expected and spark inflationary pressure, the Committee may need to maintain the restrictive policy stance longer than I foresee. Relatedly, premature rate cuts could unleash a surge in demand that could initiate upward pressure on prices.\n\nThis argues for caution to ensure that we don't undermine the great progress we have made to date in bringing inflation back to target. But it also calls for heeding the data and being responsive in our plan to normalize policy. Even after incorporating the recent softness in the underlying inflation data, my baseline forecast for full-year core PCE inflation is still 2.4 percent. That said, if we continue to see a further accumulation of downside surprises in the data, it's possible for me to get comfortable enough to advocate normalization sooner than the third quarter. But the evidence would need to be convincing.\n\nDuring the pandemic, I've tried to use a few terms to characterize my approach to policy in the moment. Summarizing all that I've said today, those words would be grateful and vigilant. I'm very grateful for the progress that has been made to date in the fight against inflation. But I'm staying vigilant because, though inflation has been on a path toward the 2 percent target for some time, there are risks that could throw it off course.\n\nTo be sure, striking the delicate balance of price stability without undue harm to labor markets will be exceedingly difficult. It's rarely been done following a serious bout of inflation. But that's the job, and we are going to continue to do everything we can to achieve it.",

            "content": "Thank you, Professor Ghilarducci, for the kind introduction. And thanks to everyone at the New School for inviting me to deliver the Schwartz Lecture. It's an honor and a privilege.\n\nExpanding economic opportunity is a defining issue of our time. Because of outright discrimination in some cases and unintended consequences in others, our nation has long squandered too much talent and creativity. We must change that to continue thriving as a people and an economy.\n\nThat's why we at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta several years ago embraced the pursuit of economic mobility and resilience, or EMAR for short, as a guiding strategy.\n\nI will detail some of our Bank's EMAR work today, after I discuss the role monetary policy plays—and, importantly, does not play—in confronting economic disparities such as wealth inequality. My remarks will focus on monetary policy's effects on the labor market, as for most of us a good job is a precondition to building wealth.\n\nI'll add that these are my thoughts and do not necessarily reflect those of colleagues in the Federal Reserve System or at the Atlanta Fed.\n\nI won't spend time describing the state of wealth inequality. Teresa outlined the situation well, and I think you all understand it's been a grave problem for decades and defies quick fixes.\n\nUp front, I need to be clear that the Fed operates within statutory constraints. That means we cannot pursue certain activities. We cannot award grants, nor deliver ongoing services to families and communities, nor directly lobby for particular policies.\n\nThat is our reality.\n\nThe Fed's mandate from the Congress is to pursue price stability and maximum employment. A superficial reading of the mandate might suggest we not concern ourselves at all with economic disparities. After all, our core duty, monetary policy, influences the economy in extremely broad ways and thus is not a direct remedy for economic inequalities.\n\nBut such a reading would miss a larger point that stems from the maximum employment side of the mandate, which I interpret as sustained maximum employment.\n\nLet me explain. A quick workable definition of maximum employment says we are charged with creating an environment in which everyone who wants a job can find one. In the shorter run, employment opportunities tend to be constrained by a person's education or training, experience, the availability of jobs where they live, and so on.\n\nBut over time, these circumstances can change. People may go to school, get training, and gain new skills. In the longer run, then, sustained maximum employment means everyone has the opportunity to get, not just any job, but gainful employment in a job that is consistent with their full potential.\n\nTo achieve sustainable maximum employment, we must foster an economy in which everyone can maximize their human capital and apply their talents to their highest and best use to earn family-supporting incomes. In short, sustainable maximum employment is a more inclusive objective.\n\nSo, while monetary policy cannot granularly address persistent ills like wealth inequality, it has a role, and that role is linked to the dual mandate and grounded in the reality that economic disparities limit opportunity for millions of Americans. Limitations for workers limit employment, which limits the economic prospects of businesses, which in turn constrains local, regional, and national economies. Therefore, economic disparities are a concern of the Federal Reserve.\n\nHow do we address that concern within our statutory framework? Or, since I've described what we can't do, what can the Fed do?\n\nMonetary policy can feed labor market momentum\n\nAs I noted, monetary policy by nature is not suited to target conditions for particular populations or locations. Rather, monetary policy can help create broad conditions conducive to sustaining economic expansions. That is where our policy can contribute to better labor market outcomes for those typically on the margins of the economy and the short end of wealth inequality.\n\nIn that vein, I'd like to focus on the late 2010s, the years immediately before the pandemic.\n\nAs some of you might recall, this period became part of the longest economic expansion in US history as the fruits of a strong labor market eventually began to spread across the population. The unemployment rates for Black and Hispanic workers reached all-time lows, and the gaps between those rates and the White unemployment rate narrowed to their lowest levels on record.\n\nThe decline in Black unemployment was especially strong. In late 2019, it hit its lowest average since the Bureau of Labor Statistics began gathering the relevant data in 1972. As Fed chair Jerome Powell has pointed out, before the pandemic, it appeared those gains would continue.\n\nDuring those prepandemic years, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) did not default to a policy approach that had proven quite effective over the previous two decades—a formulation that very low unemployment inevitably leads to inflation. Instead, as unemployment kept falling but inflation remained subdued, the Committee let the economy run.\n\nThe policy decisions were not obvious. The main policy rate, the federal funds rate, stood at effectively zero for seven years as the economy limped out of the Great Recession. Even before the FOMC began \"liftoff\" and nudged the rate up in late 2015, various rules-based formulas suggested the rate should be higher.\n\nThere were calls from outside the Committee to remove policy accommodation sooner. And Summaries of Economic Projections from that time suggest Committee members anticipated it would be appropriate to raise the federal funds rate sooner and more than it ended up doing.\n\nThe Committee moved the policy rate in December 2015 to a range of 0.25 to 0.5 percent. Just a year earlier, the median FOMC member projection had the appropriate rate at 1 percent for 2015. By the end of 2016, the funds rate target was still just 0.5 percent to 0.75 percent; the median Committee projection a year earlier had it at 1.4 percent.\n\nMy point: the Committee was willing to adapt to changing economic conditions and reacted to incoming data rather than hewing to projections or long-held conventions about the connection between low unemployment and inflation. And the beneficiaries of the labor market that resulted from the approach were disproportionately the people in the groups on the wrong side of the nation's wealth divide.\n\nI don't want to bog us down with too many numbers, but I think a few data points will clarify how the FOMC's thinking on the relationship between unemployment and the threat of inflation has evolved.\n\nLearning and adapting to changing conditions\n\nFirst, a little background. Inflation forecasts traditionally have been based on estimates of what economists call the natural rate of unemployment, or \"u-star\" (or \"u*\"), and how much upward pressure on prices results when the unemployment rate declines relative to u-star.\n\nBasically, u-star is the unemployment rate consistent in the longer run with the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective. Think of it as an unemployment rate that will neither kindle inflation nor cause widespread disruption for households. There is no observable measure of u-star; we estimate it as best we can.\n\nIn the late 2010s, as real unemployment dipped lower and lower and inflation hardly budged, the Committee reduced its estimates of the natural unemployment rate. The median estimate from last month's FOMC meeting is 4 percent, down from 5.5 percent in January 2012, when the Fed last updated its underlying monetary policy framework before 2020.\n\nA difference of 1.5 percentage points over a decade may not sound big. But based on the size of today's labor force, that gap would translate to about 2.5 million additional unemployed people. Had the Committee not been willing to adapt to the ever-changing real economy, we likely would have raised interest rates sooner in the 2010s and perhaps snuffed out employment opportunities for many of our neighbors.\n\nAs Powell said in his 2019 speech at Jackson Hole, \"Since 2012, declining unemployment has had surprisingly little effect on inflation.\"\n\nIndeed, the unemployment rate fell from 10 percent in 2012 to under 4 percent when Powell spoke. The longest expansion on record produced an unemployment rate that hovered near 50-year lows for roughly two years, well below most estimates of the sustainable level. Labor force participation also climbed.\n\nOne of the reasons those things happened was that from 2010 through 2020, the FOMC never pushed the target for the federal funds rate above a range of 2.25 to 2.5 percent, and inflation remained calm. Monetary policy helped sustain an economic expansion that over time disproportionately benefited people who traditionally are the last to enjoy the fruits of a growing economy.\n\nResearch shows Black workers, especially, benefit from long expansions\n\nHow do we know this? Research tells us that long expansions disproportionately help traditionally marginalized workers. The literature has established that the Black unemployment rate declines faster than the White rate during expansions, but also rises faster in downturns. That appears to be especially true in the latter stages of economic growth cycles.\n\nOne of our economists, Julie Hotchkiss, found that Black workers had just begun making material labor market gains in the late 2010s. In a 2021 paper, Hotchkiss showed that Black workers benefit disproportionately from the momentum of a recovery when the economy is unusually strong and the expansion lasts long enough to bring in those at the margins of the labor force. A 2019 paper by four Fed economists and published by the Brookings Institution found similar results.\n\nOn the other hand, research also shows that when the economy cools, disadvantaged workers on average suffer the sharpest setbacks. Hotchkiss, for instance, writes that the sudden onset of the COVID pandemic reversed much of the progress Black workers made in the late 2010s expansion.\n\nFinally, a new working paper from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors finds that, not surprisingly, inequality in labor market outcomes between White and Black workers translates to a meaningful difference in welfare for the two types of households.\n\nA more novel finding from that work concerns the monetary policy framework the Fed adopted in August 2020. I'm not going to do a deep dive on the framework today. But the key for our discussion is that the framework commits the FOMC to set policy based on shortfalls in employment, whereas previously we zeroed in on deviations, which of course would include periods when unsustainably low unemployment, so traditional theory held, threatened to spark inflation.\n\nThis new research from the Board of Governors suggests that the Shortfalls rule will bolster economic expansions by holding interest rates lower than they would have been under the previous approach. Specifically, under the new framework, the unemployment rate in a typical expansion will decline by about 0.7 of a percentage point more than it otherwise would.\n\nI'll quote directly from the paper here to avoid ambiguity: \"Even though the Shortfalls rule still targets the aggregate unemployment rate gap, it has disproportionately larger benefits for Blacks than for whites in terms of unemployment rates.\"\n\nLet me reiterate that these benefits accrue from lengthening economic expansions and not from any intervention aimed precisely at racial unemployment gaps. Monetary policy just doesn't work that way.\n\nEducational attainment has been important\n\nTo be sure, monetary policy is not solely or perhaps even mainly responsible for enhancing employment outcomes for disadvantaged workers. A notable factor of late is progress in educational attainment.\n\nConsider college degree attainment rates. You no doubt know that African Americans and Hispanic Americans have long lagged the general population in terms of earning college degrees. Well, between 2010 and 2020, gains in the share of African Americans and Hispanic Americans with college degrees far outpaced those for the general population.\n\nThis has direct implications for unemployment. As this slide illustrates, high school graduates who don't attend college experience substantially higher unemployment rates than do workers with degrees. In September, for example, the unemployment rates were 2.1 and 4.1 percent, respectively, for degree holders and workers with only a high school diploma among people 25 and older.\n\nOf course, caveats apply, but generally speaking, more workers with more education is good news on other fronts, too. A report from the New York Fed shows that the median wages of bachelor's degree holders exceeded those of high school graduates by more than 50 percent in 2022, a ratio that has changed little over at least the past three decades.\n\nI don't mean to suggest that every person should attend college. There are certainly other pathways to better labor market outcomes, such as training and apprenticeships. In fact, the Atlanta Fed's Opportunity Occupations Monitor highlights many good jobs that one can attain through those routes. But college is a proven pathway that frequently leads to economic self-sufficiency and wealth building.\n\nA word about the 2020 monetary policy framework\n\nI focused the policy portion of this speech on the prepandemic era because that was when we learned about a changed interaction of unemployment and inflation, and accordingly shifted our understanding of what I call maximum sustained employment in important ways.\n\nThe 2020 framework codifies that our maximum employment mandate is inclusive. I think it's fair to interpret the underlying policy strategy as making sure we did not preemptively curtail the creation of jobs, in particular jobs most likely to help low- to moderate-income and minority communities.\n\nLet me be clear on one other important point. The 2020 framework did not inform monetary policy during the economic crisis brought on by the COVID pandemic. The waves of sickness, snarled global supply chains, lockdowns, and other public health and fiscal measures associated with the pandemic triggered a surge of inflation that contrasted sharply with the low inflation environment contemplated by the \"shortfalls\" language of the framework. Like central banks around the world, the Fed had no choice but to decisively confront this heightened inflation to prevent an even longer and more debilitating period of intense price pressures; avoiding preemption of job creation was never a consideration.\n\nConcrete steps to identify labor market barriers\n\nI've talked at length about monetary policy. That's the well-known work of the Federal Reserve. You may not know that also in pursuit of sustained maximum employment, we spend considerable energy trying to identify barriers to full labor market participation and work with partners in the relevant fields to try to help reduce or eliminate them.\n\nI'd like to highlight one particular program at our Bank.\n\nSeveral years ago, a team of community development specialists and economists launched a research and advisory enterprise we call the Advancing Careers for Low-Income Families initiative. This program aims to provide information and data to workers, employers, and community and state leaders so workers can make better career decisions, employers can meet their talent needs, and leaders can help advance family economic mobility and resilience.\n\nThe initiative focuses on benefits cliffs that occur when a wage earner who receives multiple public benefits—SNAP, Medicaid, and so on—earns more income but comes out less well off because they exceed income eligibility thresholds for those benefits and thus lose access to them. Our team concluded that benefits cliffs constitute a punitive marginal tax on many of our fellow citizens who can least afford it. Basically, someone might earn an extra dollar, but lose $3 or $4 in public benefits.\n\nConsequently, benefits cliffs become a perverse incentive for lower-wage earners to not gain new skills or try to climb a career ladder because, as our research shows, it typically takes a decade or more for the additional income to exceed the lost benefits. The people who are potentially affected totally get this—they are not dumb—and therefore they often forego training and a better job.\n\nA key finding from our Advancing Careers team's work is that investing public resources to mitigate benefits cliffs—basically to tide people over by raising income thresholds, for instance—saves communities money in the long run. For one, over the long term, there is less outlay on public benefits as workers pursue career paths that allow them to stand on their own financially. The research also shows that tax collections rise. As more citizens earn family-supporting incomes, they pay income taxes and consume more goods and services.\n\nHelping low-income Florida families\n\nI'll share a quick story about the real-world value of this kind of objective research. And this story demonstrates that even in today's hyper-charged political environment, policies to mitigate benefits cliffs are achievable and, in some cases, uncontroversial.\n\nThis year, both chambers of the Florida legislature unanimously passed a law expanding eligibility standards for the state's publicly funded children's health insurance program, or CHIP. Starting January 1, 2024, families can earn up to 300 percent of federal poverty level income, up from the previous threshold of 200 percent, and qualify for the CHIP program.\n\nFlorida officials used analytical tools developed by our Advancing Careers team to clarify that the health insurance program was indeed creating benefits cliffs for many Florida workers. For some families, the 200 percent income cutoff meant that a modest wage increase could result in annual health insurance premiums soaring from around $240 to over $3,000.\n\nOur Advancing Careers team figures the impending eligibility expansion can increase families' net financial resources as their earnings rise, and in the long run better position those families to build self-sufficiency and wealth.\n\nLet me be explicit here and point out that we did not lobby for this policy shift—as I said earlier, the Fed does not do lobbying. Rather, our tool allowed policy makers to get objective information that informed their thinking about the issue and ultimately led them to pursue a policy change.\n\nPolicy moving forward\n\nLet me conclude back where I began, with monetary policy.\n\nIn important ways, the pandemic emergency and inflation outbreak blew up the policy formulation that served to lengthen the prepandemic economic expansion, just as it upended the entire macroeconomy. Yet the understanding we absorbed in the final years of the prepandemic expansion remains with us and will continue to inform my policy thinking.\n\nAs for inflation, that is job one for now. As part of the work that undergirds the 2020 framework, we conducted numerous public events to gather input from a broad range of researchers, citizens, representatives of low- and moderate-income communities, employers, and elected officials.\n\nA message that endures from those sessions was people want us to tackle inflation. Across the economy and demographic groups, inflation is the force that is most painful and drives more people to precariousness.\n\nWe heard clearly that two or three extra points of inflation, while it might save a tenth of a percentage point of unemployment, is a net loss for the populations on the wrong side of the wealth imbalance.\n\nLooking ahead, after the COVID emergency fully passes, the world will have changed in ways we can't yet fully grasp. So, I cannot say with certainty that I will resume precisely the same modes of thinking about monetary policy that informed my views during the long expansion. What I can say is that the experience of those prepandemic years will inform tomorrow's mindset, as the Committee continues working to create an economic foundation that serves all Americans.\n\nWith that, I hope you have a better sense of how the Atlanta Fed and Federal Reserve System approach issues of economic disparities.\n\nEven as these concerns rightly garner increased attention, in important respects a consensus around the best ways to address disparities remains elusive. That means researchers like you have a vital role to play in marshaling evidence so that policy is informed by sound information rather than stubborn misconceptions. I know my discussants today—all thought leaders on campus and beyond—have been active in this pursuit and have much to say.\n\nWealth inequality in our country has been well over a century in the making. It won't dissipate quickly. There is much to do, and much can go wrong. But I'm optimistic because we're having the right conversations, smart people are doing important research and practical work, and there is a real appetite for change.\n\nI look forward to tackling these critical problems together.",

            "content": "Thank you for having me. It's flattering to be invited. I look forward to learning from you all over the next couple of days and sharing a few thoughts on challenges my colleagues and I face in making monetary policy in the United States.\n\nThis conference also is an opportunity to further advance the relationship between the Atlanta Fed and the South African Reserve Bank. Many of you may not know that staff from our survey center are collaborating with colleagues here to construct a study of the payment habits of South African consumers. That project is modeled on a study our Bank leads for the Federal Reserve System, and I hope it can lay the groundwork for more partnerships.\n\nWhen I was asked to discuss challenges in US monetary policymaking, I figured it was an easy assignment—challenges truly abound. Today I will discuss what in my view are the most important challenges we face right now, which mostly come down to one word: inflation. I'll begin with a word about my current stance on US policy. Then I will detail the progress we have made in lowering the inflation rate, and the adjustments I still want to see to feel absolutely comfortable that the trajectory of inflation is conclusively on a path to 2 percent.\n\nBefore I do that, note that I said \"in my view,\" because these are my views alone and not necessarily those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.\n\nCurrent monetary policy\n\nYou no doubt saw that the Committee voted last month to raise the federal funds rate another 25 basis points, to a level of 5 1/4 to 5 1/2 percent. Based on current dynamics in the macroeconomy, I feel policy is appropriately restrictive. I think we should be cautious and patient and let the restrictive policy continue to influence the economy, lest we risk tightening too much and inflicting unnecessary economic pain.\n\nThat does not mean I am for easing policy any time soon. Inflation in the United States is still too high. The battle against inflation has seen significant progress. Inflation is well off the very elevated levels we saw in the last year, but it's essential that it be brought all the way back to our target.\n\nWe must remain resolute in the campaign for price stability until we see that inflation is conclusively on track toward 2 percent over a reasonable time frame. I believe policy is already restrictive enough to get us there. Should conditions not play out the way I anticipate, and inflation or inflation expectations abruptly reverse course and start climbing, then I would certainly support doing what would be necessary to put the US economy back on a path toward price stability.\n\nPandemic dynamics still important\n\nI just quickly summed up my policy stance. But formulating policy is hardly a straightforward exercise, particularly in today's environment. The challenges I'll detail still stem mostly from a pandemic the likes of which none of us had experienced.\n\nThe US lost 22 million jobs in two months. In the second quarter of 2020, the nation's gross domestic product contracted by 30 percent, similar in magnitude to the Great Depression. The enormous shock was especially vexing because it was utterly unlike a typical economic downturn. It did not result from excesses within the economy but from a worldwide health crisis and significant, necessary measures taken to protect the public.\n\nAmid lockdowns, many homebound Americans unleashed a shopping binge that overwhelmed production arrangements that were already taut due to decades-long efforts to design hyper-efficient, just-in-time supply chains. Limited factory operating hours, and short-staffed ports and transportation systems exacerbated the strain amid lockdowns and other public health constraints.\n\nAs COVID caused businesses to shutter and millions became unemployed, the American government responded with trillions in fiscal supports, including direct payments to consumers and businesses. Meanwhile, the FOMC slashed the federal funds rate to near zero and instituted lending facilities and other programs to support households, businesses, and financial markets. We aimed to nurse the economy through the worst of the pandemic downturn and come out the other side with minimal long-term damage.\n\nFor the most part, I think we did that.\n\nEmployment rebounded more rapidly than anticipated. In just over two years, employment returned to its level on the eve of the pandemic. By comparison, after the Great Recession of 2007–09, it took twice as long to regain far fewer lost jobs.\n\nAlong with other factors, the surge in goods spending I mentioned helped spark the biggest inflationary spike the United States had seen in 40 years beginning in the spring of 2021. We expected price pressures to settle once extraordinary pandemic-related supply and demand factors normalized. Turns out it has taken longer than we anticipated for supply-and-demand conditions to return to their longer-term trends.\n\nTo combat inflation, the Fed has aggressively tightened monetary policy. We've raised the federal funds rate by 525 basis points over a year-and-a-half. But it's important to put those moves in the proper perspective. Not all those moves represented actual tightening. I view the first 325 to 350 basis points as removing accommodation, and then the subsequent 175 to 200 points as moving policy into restrictive territory.\n\nInflation on a clear path downward\n\nI am gratified to say the policy tightening has proven effective in helping to lower inflation toward our 2 percent target, as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures, or PCE, price index. The decline in inflation has been slow, and I expect that pattern to continue.\n\nFor the sake of clarity and because we have it in hand for the month of July, I'm going to cite readings from the other major inflation gauge, the Consumer Price Index, rather than jump back and forth between the two measures. The latest CPI headline number came in at 3.2 percent in July, while core inflation, excluding food and energy, was 4.7 percent, compared to a year earlier. Those are down from a cyclical peak in the headline rate of nearly 9 percent in June of 2022 and the core of about 7 percent last fall.\n\nFocusing on July again, a closer look shows that core CPI for that month rose at just a 1.9 percent annualized rate, matching its increase from June and declining sharply from its annualized growth rate of 5 percent through the first five months of the year.\n\nThose numbers suggest a case could be made that if it were not for stubborn (and lagging) housing services prices, the core CPI would be running at 2.6 percent on a year-over-year basis, and just 1.1 percent over the past three months, a rate that is well below price stability. So, essentially, given the lagging nature of rental prices in the calculation of the CPI—and the PCE for that matter—underlying inflation may well be close to our target already.\n\nThe trend in one alternative measure of inflation, the Sticky-Price CPI developed by my staff, is giving me particular confidence that inflation is headed in the right direction. After excluding food, energy, and shelter prices, the Sticky-Price CPI was basically flat in both June and July and, as the slide shows, has risen just 0.8 percent annualized over the past three months. Note that the lines in the graphic are all diving toward or even below 2 percent.\n\nThe sticky prices in our index include categories like personal care services, trash collection, medical care services, shelter, and education. In total, our sticky-prices basket comprises roughly two-thirds of the entire CPI basket by expenditure weight. Because these prices are typically slow to respond to changing economic conditions, they may contain an embedded inflation-expectation component and thus tend to be good forecasters of inflation two to three years ahead.\n\nLet me describe a final data point that I have focused on for some time now because I think it, too, transmits a meaningful signal about the trajectory of prices. That is the breadth of inflation. The recent shift in the price change distribution has been striking. Over the past three months, on average, just 35 percent of the underlying CPI components, by expenditure weight, rose at rates of 5 percent or more. Granted, this is still higher than the prepandemic average of 15 to 20 percent, but in July of 2022 (just a year ago) the number was about 80 percent. I don't think it's a stretch to call this another marker of significant progress!\n\nThe promising evidence is expanding. Still, even a large handful of data points will not prompt us to pop champagne corks just yet, because the economy is still beset by uncertainty and we cannot be completely sanguine about any projections. However, in the remainder of my comments, I will make the case that our restrictive monetary policy stance is having a clear moderating effect on economic activity that should put further downward pressure on prices and thus promote a return to our 2 percent inflation target.\n\nIndeed, I believe Atlanta Fed surveys and numerous conversations with price setters offer convincing signals that the downward momentum of inflation is likely to continue. And I'll note that our surveys and grassroots information channels have a strong track record, so I feel confident in their predictive ability.\n\nI'll start with the outlook for prices.\n\nOur Business Inflation Expectations (BIE) survey is a monthly canvass of 200 US companies across industries and firm sizes. In the latest BIE, fewer firms say they plan to continue raising prices, and those that do plan to raise them say they'll do it by smaller amounts. Almost three-quarters (72 percent) of firms reported that they increased prices of their core products or services in the 12 months through May 2023. The average increase was 7 percent. By contrast, for the year ahead, 57 percent told us they intend to raise prices by an average of only 4 percent.\n\n\n\nOther surveys in a research collaboration with colleagues at the Cleveland and New York Feds show similar projections of less severe price increases to come. Finally, feedback from field staff in our Regional Economic Information Network, or REIN, offers still more confirmation that peak pricing power has most likely passed.\n\nThe anecdotes pointing to diminishing pricing power, and perhaps moderate slowing in economic activity, are supported by preliminary results from the most recent Atlanta Fed Survey of Business Uncertainty, or SBU. In the most recent survey, year-ahead nominal sales growth expectations slowed from 5 percent at the beginning of the year to 3 percent, which is well below the prepandemic average for expected sales growth in the SBU.\n\nLabor market cooling\n\nTurning to labor markets, there appears to be a measured cooling afoot there, as well. After the jobs report in May showed a one-month surge in hiring, the June and July reports showed employment growth continuing to moderate, albeit at a slower pace.\n\nI will also point out that for the first six months of this year, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics revised payroll employment growth downward by an average of more than 40,000 jobs a month relative to the initial release, so the labor market was not running quite as hot as we had originally believed. And based on the BLS's preliminary benchmark estimate it looks like employment growth in the first quarter of 2023 will be revised a bit lower still. Furthermore, the job market may be cooling even faster than the headline numbers suggest, as growth in total hours worked has slowed more than growth in employment because of recent increases in part-time work.\n\nNow, let me say a word on wages. Economists are concerned about how much wage pressures are influencing inflation, especially in services prices. To be sure, debate continues about whether wages are a lagging or leading indicator of inflation. I won't settle that question today.\n\nI will say, from the SBU, we detect signs of current and future wage growth moderating. For the 12 months starting in May 2023, the SBU says employers aim to raise wages an average of 3.6 percent, down from last year's 5.2 percent.\n\n\n\nLet me offer a little context. For much of the past couple of years, elevated inflation made real wage growth negative, after positive growth just above 1 percent before COVID. So, I would expect nominal wage growth to exceed inflation for a time as real wage levels revert to the prepandemic growth trend. In fact, over the past three months, average hourly earnings pretty comfortably outpaced inflation, as the slide makes clear.\n\nThe upshot is that wage growth is moving back toward normal, which over the long term typically means an equilibrium level roughly in line with productivity growth. As long as firms continue to signal a slowing trajectory on price growth—that is, they are willing to absorb some margin contraction—then real wage growth should not put upward pressure on prices. Our conversations with business leaders confirm that scenario—they are raising pay so their employees' wages catch up with past inflation, and do not anticipate having to raise prices in the future to keep pace with the higher wages. And as I noted, our surveys and conversations make clear that employers plan to taper down those wage hikes to normal prepandemic levels in the coming years. So, I'm not overly concerned that a period of moderate real wage growth will rekindle inflationary pressures.\n\nI've cited evidence that I believe represents a convincing case that the rate of inflation will continue declining toward our objective of 2 percent: reductions in planned price increases, cooling in the labor market, and, ultimately, a measured tempering of economic activity that will bring supply and demand into closer alignment.\n\nUncertainty is still prevalent\n\nHaving said all that, the economic journey ahead is far from assured. We continue to confront a great deal of uncertainty and risk. We emphasize this a lot, but it's worth restating: we don't have historical models to guide us through the shock of the pandemic. So, in important ways we continue to operate in uncharted territory as we aim to restore economy-wide supply and demand to a preCOVID equilibrium. The lingering effects of COVID, heavy corporate and government debt, the war in Ukraine, other possible geopolitical shocks abroad and at home, and extreme weather events are but a few of the risks facing the macroeconomy and, thus, the path to 2 percent inflation.\n\nThere are other, more immediate risks we're also watching closely. One lies in the commercial real estate business, particularly the office sector. The trend toward work from home has pinched some office building owners and lenders, especially those with older, less luxurious space. Higher interest rates make it difficult for commercial property owners to refinance debts that they may be having trouble servicing as occupancy rates are falling.\n\nHousing is another important component of the American economy, and there are concerns there, too, mainly involving low inventories of homes for sale. That pushes up prices and squeezes affordability. Rising interest rates play a role here, too, as homeowners are loathe to give up existing low-rate mortgages to sell a home and then buy a different house at today's higher rates.\n\nThe banking sector itself remains a source of risk as banks navigate a higher-interest-rate-environment, though by and large the US banking system is sound and well capitalized.\n\nCommercial real estate, housing, and banking are all directly affected by interest rates. As we administer medicine to the economy in the form of tighter monetary policy, the intent is to modulate demand to better align with supply and therefore ease upward pressure on prices. We need to be patient, let the medicine of restrictive monetary policy work its way through the economy, and not reverse course until it's clear that higher inflation is no longer a threat.\n\nTime to be patient, resolute, and cautious\n\nTo reiterate, I think the facts I've assembled here argue for a patient, resolute, and cautious approach to monetary policy:\n\nShould the data not come in as I expect—for example, if inflation or inflation expectations start climbing—and it becomes clear the Committee must tighten further to keep inflation falling, then I would support that. Given widespread economic uncertainty, I do not expect our path from here to the 2 percent inflation objective—the last mile, if you will—to be without curves and bumps.\n\nBut we will get there. Be assured I am committed to restoring price stability so that American households can enjoy maximum employment and an economy that works for all, which is a tagline for the Atlanta Fed. When we achieve this, the resultant stable, healthy US economy will be a clear positive for economies around the world. At that point, we can work together to ensure that these economies increasingly work for all people across the globe. I look forward to helping bring that reality closer to fruition.",

            "highlights": "Atlanta Fed president and CEO Raphael Bostic spoke in Dublin to the Irish Association of Investment Managers on the fight to bring down inflation.",
            "content": "Thank you, Alison, for the kind introduction. I also want to warmly thank the Irish Association of Investment Managers, and in particular Chair Paul Price, Vice Chair Ann Prendergast, and CEO Michael D'Arcy for having me. I'm honored. Your domestic economy is dynamic and shares important ties with the United States, so I hope you find my comments helpful.\n\nBe assured that since I'm speaking between you and dinner, I won't go on too long. But I am covering nuanced material, so I want to be clear and thorough.\n\nAs I'm sure most of you know, the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, voted a couple of weeks ago to maintain the federal funds rate, the Fed's primary monetary policy tool, in the range of 5 to 5 1/4 percent. That meeting was one of four each year when all Committee participants submit projections for the current and subsequent years for gross domestic product (GDP) growth, the inflation rate, the unemployment rate, and the end-of-year level of the federal funds rate.\n\nThe projections are collectively called the Summary of Economic Projections, or SEPs. They are not true forecasts in the statistical sense, nor are they commitments to follow a particular course of action. But they do offer a sense of how individual policymakers think conditions might evolve assuming appropriate monetary policy. Hence, they are scrutinized by Fed watchers and financial market participants. I'm guessing a number of you here in the room study them.\n\nRelative to the projections published in March, this month's SEPs showed a notable increase in median projections for GDP growth and core inflation for 2023, and a decline in the median view of the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter. I will not presume to speak for any other FOMC participant—the thoughts I'll share today are mine alone. But it is reasonable to interpret these changes in the SEPs as reflecting a view that the US economy is stronger, and inflation is likely to be more persistent than the median Committee expectation indicated in March, soon after the Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank failures.\n\nThe upshot is that the median committee participant believes the FOMC needs to do more to get inflation back to our target. I have to confess: I do not fully share this view.\n\nLet me be clear. I have consistently expected the US economy to be quite strong. I've also long expected inflation in the United States to be persistent and attenuate at a measured—some would say slow—pace.\n\nBut to be direct, I believe we are just now beginning to see signs that the cumulative effects of monetary policy adjustments that began last year are showing up in the real economy, including in labor markets. Furthermore, I believe that our latest readings on inflation indicate that we are making progress on reducing inflation toward the FOMC's goal of 2 percent, as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index.\n\nIn our time today I will explain why I've come to these conclusions based on the statistical data in hand, as well as on the information collected from the Atlanta Fed's surveys of businesses and conversations with contacts throughout the economy. I believe the economic effects and inflation progress I will describe are a consequence of monetary policy that only fairly recently moved into restrictive territory. And, although I don't want to take a specific position on the appropriate path of US monetary policy going forward, I do want to make a case that we can expect progress on inflation to continue, even absent additional changes in the level of the federal funds rate.\n\nMonetary policy just starting to affect the economy\n\nI think it is wise to take a period to assess how monetary policy tightening is affecting the economy because, in my view, policy has been truly restrictive only for eight or nine months. The Committee began raising rates 15 months ago, yes, and bond rates began to rise even before that when we indicated the federal funds rate would likely rise.\n\nStill, because the rate of inflation was very elevated, real interest rates remained accommodative even after the first few fed funds rate hikes. I like to organize my thinking on this by breaking up the moves: I view the first 325 to 350 basis points as removing accommodation, and then the subsequent 150 to 175 basis points as moving policy into restrictive territory.\n\nHow do we know monetary policy has only begun to bite into economic activity? For one, that's what our contacts are telling us. While demand generally remains solid, it seems that surprises have been to the downside. For example, a contact from a large consumer-facing business expected demand to soften by 1 to 2 percent in April and May, but it fell 5 percent. Even in the red-hot travel industry, a contact pointed out that hotel room demand fell by just over 1 percent in April compared to the same month last year, the first year-over-year decline in that measure since February 2021.\n\nLet me turn to the US labor market. Conditions appear to remain relatively hot based on headline employment growth. But a broader measure describes a more meaningful deceleration in activity this year. Though private nonfarm employment grew much faster than prepandemic rates, aggregate weekly hours worked on private payrolls, a more comprehensive gauge of labor conditions, rose more in line with pre-COVID conditions.\n\nThe difference in the two readings is that a disproportionate share of job growth over the past year was in part-time employment for noneconomic reasons, meaning workers chose to work part-time. That represents a rebalancing of employment after many workers who wanted to work part time were pressed into full-time duty amid the pandemic's labor shortages. The decline in hours worked indicates that the pace of labor growth has slowed far more than the headline job numbers suggest.\n\nInput from our business contacts offers further evidence of easing in labor market conditions. Consistent with data from the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, our contacts say it is easier to fill positions and that turnover is back to prepandemic levels. For the first time in a long time, we are hearing reports of workforce reductions through attrition and even the possibility of layoffs, especially for back-office employees.\n\nIn sum, contacts describe a labor market more like the one before the pandemic—still tight, but much less so than over the past few years. As one of our contacts said: \"Twenty-two to 32-year-olds are no longer in control of the labor market.\"\n\nIn that context, I believe it makes sense to give restrictive monetary policy time to work. In my view, it is less certain that we need to keep hiking the policy interest rate in the immediate term, lest we risk tightening too much and draining too much momentum from the economy.\n\nProgress on inflation\n\nWhen will restrictive monetary policy start restraining inflation more powerfully? Put simply, not as soon as I'd like. But I do believe underlying inflation is declining gradually, and in a way that may well be sustainable.\n\nMy staff and I find glimmers of hope in recent inflation reports. Notably, the distribution of price increases has narrowed considerably, a strong indicator that underlying inflation is in fact abating. Last month marked the first month since August 2021 when less than 40 percent of the expenditure-weighted share of prices in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) basket rose by 5 percent or more. For perspective, the share of prices jumping 5 percent or more peaked at 80 percent in early 2022. This narrowing of severe price increases deepens my conviction that we are on the path to reducing inflation.\n\nAlongside the narrowing of price increases, I'll sound a hopeful note on services prices. Even though it's been widely noted that core non-housing-services prices have not pulled back substantially, my staff and I see nascent signs that could be changing. The rate of price increases in that category has edged successively lower in each of the past three monthly inflation readings. I recognize this does not necessarily herald definitive, long-term disinflation in services. Still, I see an emergent and promising trend, a green shoot of hope, in a category that accounts for more than half of the consumer market basket.\n\nSurveys reveal promising signs on prices and wages\n\nThe data describe what's happened. To deepen our understanding of events and help chart what may be ahead, we lean into the findings of our in-house survey shop and intelligence from business contacts.\n\nOur latest surveys have produced promising results on prices and wages. Our Business Inflation Expectations (BIE) survey is a monthly canvass of 200 companies across industries and firm sizes. In the latest BIE, a dwindling number of firms say they plan to raise prices, and those that do plan to raise them say they'll do it by smaller amounts.\n\nAlmost three-quarters (72 percent) of firms in the BIE reported they increased prices of their core products or services in the 12 months through May 2023. The average increase was 7 percent. By contrast, for the year ahead the fraction telling us they intend to raise prices fell to 57 percent, and the average expected price increase was only 4 percent. Granted, that is a snapshot, but it shows a material reduction in planned price increases.\n\nWe are getting similar early results from a research collaboration with colleagues at the Cleveland and New York Feds on firms' price-setting practices amid high inflation. Surveys in this project reveal that firms expect their costs and prices to rise more slowly over the next year.\n\nFeedback from the field staff in what we call our Regional Economic Information Network confirms that pattern. Many contacts reported that pricing is normalizing, and it's harder to pass on increases in input costs. We were even told that big box retailers are pushing to \"claw back\" price increases imposed by their suppliers in 2021 and 2022, pointing to lower freight and commodity costs.\n\nNow to wages. Economists are concerned about how much wage pressures are influencing inflation, especially in services prices. But debate continues to swirl about whether wages are a lagging or leading indicator of inflation. I don't want to devote more time to that subject, but we can discuss it in the Q&A if you'd like.\n\nRight now, I will say we detect signs of current and future wage growth moderating in responses to the Survey of Business Uncertainty (SBU) our staff conducts with Stanford University and the University of Chicago. For the 12 months starting in May 2023, the SBU says employers aim to raise wages an average of 3.6 percent, down from last year's 5.2 percent. Here let me note that the SBU panelists accurately forecasted wage growth for the year through May 2023: firms projected 5 percent raises, and the number came in at 5.2 percent. This gives me confidence that we will see something close to the slowdown in wage growth that survey respondents suggest.\n\nSo, a bit of context concerning wages. Elevated inflation made real wage growth negative for much of the past two years, compared to positive growth just above 1 percent before COVID. So, I would expect nominal wage growth to exceed inflation for a time as real wage levels normalize, going back to the prepandemic growth trend. As long as firms continue to signal a slowing trajectory on price growth—that is, they are willing to absorb some margin contraction—then real wage growth probably won't put upward pressure on prices.\n\nGradual disinflation should continue\n\nThe data, survey results, and on-the-ground intelligence constitute a reasonable case that gradual disinflation will continue. I believe that will happen, even if the Committee does not increase the federal funds rate.\n\nAt this juncture, I'd like to make an important point. Pausing the policy rate increases, as we did this month, does not mean we are shrinking from the inflation fight. If inflation continues to fall in coming months—as I believe is likely—our current policy stance may effectively become tighter, as real short-term interest rates increase. I think of this dynamic as \"passive tightening,\" which should help us continue on the path to our target if recent inflation trends persist.\n\nNow, let me be clear what I mean by \"pause.\" My view is that we have reached a level of the nominal federal funds rate that should be sufficient to move inflation toward the 2 percent target over an acceptable timeframe. I realize this suggests a definition of \"pause\" that brings with it an expectation of no further hikes unless things fail to go according to plan. That's my baseline case.\n\nWhat would change that stance? Two things would tell me we should ratchet up rates soon: inflation moving away from our target, or inflation distorting long-term investment decisions by businesses and households. Today I see neither. Inflation is steadily, if slowly, declining, and long-term inflation expectations remain well-anchored, so inflation is not twisting Americans' economic planning.\n\nNow, I do not absolutely rule out the necessity of further rate hikes in coming months. The last three years have taught us that we absolutely do not enjoy the luxury of certainty.\n\nLet me be clear on another thing. While my base case does not anticipate further rate hikes, it also does not have the federal funds rate coming down in 2023 or 2024.\n\nRest assured, I do not want to see economic dislocation and suffering. And my baseline forecast remains that we can meet our inflation objective without a severe economic downturn.\n\nBut have no doubt that I will remain resolute in the battle to tame inflation, even in the face of some rise in unemployment. Why?\n\nStart with history. The Great Inflation of the 1970s and '80s taught us that indecisive monetary policy is a recipe for prolonged inflation and economic misery. Back then, it took 15 years and two bruising recessions to finally subdue inflation. That's a history we do not want to repeat.\n\nI'm also concerned that the \"last mile\" in pulling inflation all the way down to 2 percent could prove to be more difficult than the earlier progress we've made because of inertia in both the pricing behavior of firms and the wage demands of workers. So that's why I think it is extra important that we stay resolute in the campaign to reduce inflation.\n\nPolicymakers face extraordinary challenges\n\nIn closing, it is worth reiterating that policymakers in the United States and abroad continue to face an extraordinary array of challenges.\n\nPandemic-related effects on the economy have not fully unwound. US and global economic growth appear to be slowing. There is concern about financial stability in light of recent liquidity and credit issues in the banking system.\n\nWe are not living in a standard business cycle. We lack proven formulas to navigate the economic chaos of a global pandemic and its aftermath. Events have foreclosed any sense of certainty in forecasting economic conditions.\n\nBut I say this with certainty: the Federal Open Market Committee will not waver in the fight to bring down inflation.\n\nThank you.",

            "content": "Good morning. Welcome to the New Orleans Branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta for the Day Ahead conference. Thank you all for joining us for what promises to be a stimulating day.\n\nI would like to offer a special welcome to my colleagues from throughout the Federal Reserve System and from the Bank of England, the Riksbank, and the Banque de France, as well as other domestic and international guests. It's good to have you here, as I feel like we are kindred spirits fighting against the same economic headwinds.\n\nThe biggest headwind, of course, is inflation. It's way too high here in the United States, as it is in your countries, and I and the Federal Open Market Committee remain determined to use our policy tools to bring inflation back toward our objective of 2 percent as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index. I appreciate recent reports that include signs of moderating price pressures, but there is still much work to do. I'm sure my central bank colleagues from around the world agree with me on this.\n\nNow I realize that inflation is not the primary concern of today's event. That said, the interplay between financial markets and monetary policy—which is our focus today—helps determine the ultimate effectiveness of that policy. So, the research that will be discussed here is critical to our understanding of factors important in the efforts to bring down underlying inflation.\n\nI'm thrilled that we can resume in-person ASSA—or Allied Social Science Associations—meetings, and excited about the opportunity to host the Day Ahead conference. Before I go further, let me add the standard disclaimer. The thoughts I will share today are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of my colleagues at the Federal Open Market Committee or the Atlanta Fed.\n\nI will preview our agenda shortly. First, though, I wanted to offer a lagniappe, as they say here to refer to a little something extra. Some of you who follow Fed history may know that New Orleans was nearly chosen as a Federal Reserve headquarters city when the districts were drawn in the early 20th century. At that time, New Orleans was among the nation's leading seaports and financial centers and today remains an important commercial and cultural hub.\n\nWhen New Orleans was not chosen to host a Reserve Bank headquarters, locals were not pleased. An outcry issued from local media and civic leaders. In fact, don't be too surprised if you still hear a New Orleanian refer to this building as the \"New Orleans Fed.\"\n\nWhile they missed out initially, Crescent City advocates made a persuasive enough case that New Orleans was selected for the very first Reserve Bank branch office. It opened here in 1915, just a year after the Federal Reserve began operations.\n\nI figured you might find that bit of history interesting as you enjoy the city over the next few days. You might also take a moment to tour our Museum of Trade, Finance, and the Fed downstairs for more local economic history.\n\nNow, our focus today is on the more recent past, which provides valuable context for better understanding a very complex and uncertain present and future. The papers we'll hear presented necessarily examine historical data, particularly from the period between the global financial crisis of 2007 to 2009 and the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nClearly, the economic and financial environment has changed dramatically over the past couple of years—we've experienced a sharp economic downturn, a rapid rebound, supply chain disruptions, surging inflation, an imbalance of supply and demand in the labor market, monetary policy tightening, and a war in Europe. These developments create numerous new challenges for policymakers. Economic conditions are extraordinary, so we have to manage through a lot of uncertainty.\n\nWhile much has changed, we need to appreciate how we got here to best navigate the uncertainty ahead. I believe research focused on the period between the financial crisis and the pandemic can help us better understand how financial markets operate under stress and how policy affects markets as they emerge from severe financial pressure.\n\nOur agenda today includes discussions of 11 papers. I won't go into detail about all of them, but let me give you a flavor of the day to come before I highlight one particular paper. A sampling of what we will explore includes papers on:\n\nOne paper that particularly caught my attention, which we'll hear about later this morning, is work by Jamie Coen, Anil Kashyap, and May Rostom. Their paper, titled \"Price Discrimination and Mortgage Choice,\" is intriguing because it interrogates an underlying assumption of economic theory—that is, that full information leads to optimal outcomes and that departures from full information lead to bad outcomes.\n\nPreliminary results of this research show that mortgage borrowers can get confused by a plethora of mortgage contract terms on offer in the marketplace. That means in some instances a borrower's choice is more profitable to the lender but unambiguously more expensive to the borrower.\n\nAs a quick aside, I can sympathize. Even though my own research has focused on residential real estate finance, the last time I purchased a home, I still found it difficult to select the best mortgage loan from so many choices!\n\nThe authors also find that younger and first-time home buyers are most likely to be financially hurt by the bewildering array of mortgage choices. On a more positive note, the analysis concludes that most borrowers overall manage to find a mortgage that is close to optimal, though I would note that a not-insignificant share fail to find such a mortgage.\n\nThese findings concern me, as they suggest that confusion stemming from myriad mortgage options is likely to impose the largest costs on those least able to withstand the burden, including, disproportionately, minority borrowers. It will be interesting to hear what the discussant has to say, both from a theoretical and empirical perspective.\n\nA caveat here is that this work is based on data from the United Kingdom, so we lack solid evidence that it would apply directly to the US mortgage market and borrowers. Nevertheless, I strongly suspect we would find similar results here, especially given the even wider variety of mortgage contracts available in the United States compared to the United Kingdom. I think this would be a good topic for a follow-up paper.\n\nI hope that whets your appetite for the day ahead. Thank you for your attention. I think we all stand to learn a great deal from our distinguished presenters, discussants, and fellow attendees.\n\nAt the end of the conference sessions over the next three days, let the good times roll—or, as they say around here, laissez les bons temp rouler!",

            "content": "Thank you for inviting me to join you. It's always nice to go to the beach in November. And mingling with fellow econ nerds is a bonus.\n\nI want to congratulate Hoov, as he likes to be called, and the other organizers on an impressively broad and deep agenda. You are showcasing important, timely work here that can inform critical policy conversations happening at the Federal Reserve and elsewhere.\n\nThe presentations over the course of this three-day conference will include several by my colleagues at the Atlanta Fed and in the broader Fed System. So, if I may, here's a shout-out to all of them. There are honestly too many for me to list them individually, though I will be referring to some of their work in the context of the Atlanta Fed's policy agenda during my remarks this afternoon. That said, there is one person I would like to call out specifically, and that is our own Julie Hotchkiss—I guess she's yours, too. I know Julie has provided strong leadership to the Southern Economic Association over the years, including being a recent president, and we are all proud of her contributions, both those to the SEA and to our Bank. Thanks, Julie!\n\nMy subject matter today will be wide-ranging, like this conference. I will center my remarks on my background, particularly the experience of moving between academia and policymaking, something I figure many of you can relate, or even perhaps aspire, to. I will also share my views on the current, extremely challenging economic and monetary policy environment, and hopefully give you a sense for how I form my policy views.\n\nBefore I dive into all that, please understand that the thoughts I share are strictly my own. I do not speak for my colleagues at the Atlanta Fed nor for the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC.\n\nInflation battle has a way to go\n\nI'll start with the macroeconomy and monetary policy.\n\nRight up front, it is worth a reminder that the profound effects of the pandemic and attendant policy responses continue to shape macroeconomic conditions. In just two-and-a-half years, the US economy has taken a head-spinning ride: the sharpest drop in overall output since World War II, a rapid resurgence in demand, a dramatic imbalance between labor supply and demand, severe supply and shipping constraints, and an inflation rate that surged from about 1.5 percent to nearly 7 percent—that in over just 17 months—to name a few.\n\nThe recovery in employment from the short but severe downturn early in the pandemic has been much faster than the recoveries from the three previous recessions. Importantly, the labor market since the 2020 recession has been characterized by an excess of labor demand over labor supply, a stark contrast to previous so-called \"jobless recoveries\" when job seekers outnumbered job openings.\n\nThat imbalance in the labor market mirrors an imbalance between aggregate demand and supply across the macroeconomy. Our persistently elevated rate of inflation is a direct result of that imbalance.\n\nAs we close out 2022, the inflation situation is something of a mixed bag, though the inescapable bottom line is that it remains far too high, and it will probably take some time to bring it back to our 2 percent target, as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index.\n\nCore services prices excluding rent of shelter rose 6.5 percent over the past year, as of October's Consumer Price Index report, and inflationary pressures here remain broad-based. Rents and other housing-related prices are still rising briskly in many places. The latest data tell us many other categories of services prices continue to push upward, and with considerable momentum.\n\nIn particular, price pressure has been clear lately in categories including doctors' office visits and transportation services. These prices, along with food services prices, are tightly linked to the supply-demand imbalance in labor markets and the resulting wage pressures. Most measures indicate that the labor market is still very tight. Further, demand for goods remains uncharacteristically high for households at all income levels.\n\nTo be sure, some recent reports give glimmers of hope that supply throughout the macroeconomy will climb closer to being in alignment with demand. Supply disruptions are easing in some places, both for goods and labor. For example, operators at the Port of Savannah, which is the fourth busiest port in the nation, expect that congestion will likely clear by the end of this month. The number of job openings has declined, albeit slightly. Some contacts report they are eliminating openings rather than laying off workers, as the aggregate data on job openings and layoffs also suggest. A few contacts are postponing capital investments; some property developers are delaying projects; and some bankers say demand for financing is diminishing.\n\nInflation for goods has declined after surging because of a big shift toward goods spending in the thick of the pandemic. The impact of this last development has been muted somewhat because aggregate consumption has reverted toward the typical mix that is more heavily weighted toward services.\n\nOn balance, all of this tells me that our inflation battle likely still has some way to go.\n\nLet me offer a peek at how I'm forming my battle plan, if you will, from a policy perspective. In short, we must get inflation on a clear trajectory toward 2 percent. The first step toward that outcome is to raise interest rates to a restrictive level sufficient to drive inflation back to our objective. The challenge, of course, is to determine what constitutes sufficiently restrictive given the tremendous uncertainty in US and global economic dynamics.\n\nToday's economic conditions are quite extraordinary, so there is a good bit of uncertainty that we will have to manage through. You've undoubtedly heard Chair Powell talk about our need to be humble. I certainly agree with that.\n\nForming the battle plan\n\nBut there are some things that we do know, owing to conclusions drawn from history and a large body of research. One thing we know is that monetary policy works with a lag, with its transmission only fully realized in the economy after 12 to 24 months.\n\nWe are now more than eight months into the tightening cycle. How has our policy done so far? The answer to this question is informed by something else we know, namely that we must look to signals in addition to inflation readings to guide any assessment. Underlying inflation will be among the last economic indicators to materially shift in response to tighter policy. We need to see a sustained relaxation of excess demand conditions sufficient to lower the inflation rate over time.\n\nWe have yet to see underlying inflation move decisively downward in a way that looks sustainable. We have seen significant movement in interest-rate-sensitive sectors of the economy, as you might expect. For instance, the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate home loan began climbing even before the committee started increasing the federal funds rate, nearly doubling from December of last year to about 7 percent now. Residential investment declined by 26.4 percent at an annual rate in the third quarter. But, beyond this, there have been few signs of softening demand or increases in supply that auger rapid inflation drops in coming months. This suggests there is more work for monetary policy to do.\n\nAt the press conference after the last FOMC meeting, the chair pointed to two distinct decisions the Committee faces: what interest rate will be appropriate to return inflation to our target and the pace the Committee should pursue to get there.\n\nOn the first question, if the economy proceeds as I expect, I believe that 75 to 100 basis points of additional tightening will be warranted. As I've discussed, it's clear that more is needed, and I believe this level of the policy rate will be sufficient to rein in inflation over a reasonable time horizon. My baseline outlook is that the macroeconomy will be strong enough that we can tighten policy to that point without causing undue dislocation in output and employment. Indeed, with millions of unfilled job openings and a smaller number of unemployed workers, slowing need not mean that job growth dries up completely.\n\nI do not think we should continue raising rates until the inflation level has gotten down to 2 percent. Because of the lag dynamics I discussed earlier, this would guarantee an overshoot and a deep recession.\n\nIn terms of pacing, assuming the economy evolves as I expect in the coming weeks, I would be comfortable starting the move away from 75-basis-point increases at the next meeting.\n\nComments that I am hearing from business leaders in my District suggest that the fourth quarter of 2022 will carry unusually significant weight in shaping investment and hiring plans for 2023 and beyond. On this last point, many are feeling that the fourth-quarter performance will be a psychological focal point that is taken as more signal than noise in determining the pace of economic activity heading into 2023.\n\nIn the next several months, then, early signs of reducing supply-demand imbalances could intensify. This could happen either because policy actions earlier this year have a larger effect or because shifts in economic activity in the fourth quarter lead to a large change in behavior that does some of the work of bringing demand and supply into alignment.\n\nIn my view, slowing the pace of rate increases also acknowledges the great uncertainty in our economy. Being more cautious as policy moves deeper into restrictive territory seems prudent.\n\nThis uncertainty leads me to be flexible in my thinking about both the appropriate policy stance and the pacing. Inflation has been more persistent than most have forecast, and so we might find that a higher \"landing rate\" is necessary. I might similarly need to adjust my view of appropriate pacing. I will, of course, let the data guide that evolution.\n\nI will also note that the uncertainty is not one-sided. Some economic dynamics have shifted rapidly in positive ways during the pandemic. For example, GDP rebounded much faster than anyone anticipated. Financial markets have responded to our tightening faster than they historically do.\n\nStaying the policy course\n\nOnce we reach our landing rate, I think it will be appropriate for the Committee to allow some time to pass, during which the FOMC could assess the impact of policy tightening as it transmits through the economy. The challenge here is that policymakers have no way of knowing for certain if the peak rate selected is the optimal one. So, I think we must let the economic dynamics play out.\n\nIf it turns out that that policy is not sufficiently restrictive to rein in inflation, then additional policy tightening actions may be appropriate. On the other hand, if economic conditions weaken appreciably—for example, if unemployment rises uncomfortably—it will be important to resist the temptation to react by reversing our policy course until it is clear that inflation is well on track to return to our longer-run target of 2 percent.\n\nI think it would be unwise to quickly reverse our policy stance. While I do not speak for my colleagues on the FOMC, I think there is consensus that we do not want to stir even more questions into an already uncertain economy. Instead, we want the public and markets to clearly understand our aims, and the fact that we are going to be unwavering in the pursuit to bring underlying inflation back toward our 2 percent objective.\n\nIn the last several months, I've described this approach—getting to a moderately restrictive landing rate and then not reversing that policy stance for some time—as being \"purposeful and resolute.\" It is heavily informed by analysis my staff has done of past tightening cycles, which highlights what not to do.\n\nTwo of our economists, Federico Mandelman and Brent Meyer, examined monetary policy before and during \"the Great Inflation,\" which lasted from the late 1960s through the early 1980s. The main takeaway from their research is that we must be resolute if we are to completely uproot inflation. What economists have come to call stop-and-go monetary policy—tightening in the face of rising inflation only to reverse course abruptly when unemployment rises—likely helped fuel the Great Inflation. Between the late 1960s and '80s annual inflation rates exceeded 6 percent for the better part of a decade and peaked at nearly 14 percent.\n\nThat doesn't mean we charge ahead blindly with tightening. Moving too aggressively could introduce the temptation to abruptly shift course if economic indicators soften. Therein lies the risk of repeating the stop-and-go approach that arguably contributed to economic instability in the 1970s and early '80s.\n\nNow, let me be crystal clear about my policy approach. By advocating that the Committee reach a landing rate and then assess how monetary policy is flowing through the economy, I am in no way suggesting that we reverse course at that point and loosen policy. Along those lines, I warn against a stop-and-go approach, with abrupt shifts, before inflation is firmly on a trajectory back to the longer run target of 2 percent. Being purposeful, reading the economic signals, and carefully assessing how policy is affecting the real economy is not synonymous with reversing the policy stance. We need to look at other signals besides inflation—including wage growth, unemployment, labor market tightness, and sustained demand—but not overreact to them.\n\nIn hindsight, in the 1970s, the Fed reacted too quickly to changes in the real economy, such as rising unemployment. Policy reversals never allowed inflation to fully recede to the 1 to 3 percent range that was the norm after the Korean War. Hence, instead of fading from the American psyche, inflation remained an ever-present concern. Business leaders and workers anticipated higher future inflation rates as they set prices and bargained for wages. In other words, inflation expectations became unanchored. Consequently, elevated inflation itself took root, and the Volcker Fed ripped it out of the economy only after a pair of painful recessions in the early 1980s. Failure to promptly restore price stability led to worse suffering later.\n\nI take this lesson from the Great Inflation to heart. I am firmly committed to the fight against inflation and will remain purposeful and resolute until the job is done.\n\nMy path to the FOMC\n\nLet me turn now to how I came to be standing here as a central banker. A few years ago, if someone had told me I would be president of a regional Federal Reserve Bank, and thus a member of one of the most important economic policymaking groups in the world, I would have thought, \"Yeah, and maybe you think I'll be an NFL quarterback, too.\"\n\nWhen this job first came to my attention, I was teaching, doing my research, working hard, and having a fine time. Even after the first round of interviews for this job, I really didn't think I had much of a shot. But I've learned that things rarely play out according to tidy plans. My journey into economics in the first place was thanks, in part at least, to happenstance. I went off to college thinking I'd be an engineer, like my dad. Then a freshman chemistry lab experiment sparked a minor inferno—OK, that's a bit of an exaggeration—but I decided then and there to pursue something else.\n\nI studied psychology and economics, and both felt right to me. The economist's way of viewing the world of human motivations, incentives, and opportunity costs felt deeply sensible. And I believe that an understanding of psychology dovetails beautifully with trying to figure out why we humans behave as we do, particularly in the marketplace.\n\nMy academic research centered on cities, and how and why they develop, who benefits and how we might spread the benefits of economic growth. I always encouraged my planning and real estate students not just to be good at their job, but also to strive to make people's lives better, to use their influence in positive ways.\n\nI like to think I do that now. As a Fed president, people do listen to me, maybe at times more than I'd like. It seems they want to hear what I have to say, like you guys apparently do.\n\nThat required some adjustments, to be sure. I've had to learn to be more disciplined in how I communicate. Fed watchers and the press can interpret what I say very differently depending on nuanced phrasing. You all know that, as a professor, while this may have changed somewhat, you can still within bounds say pretty much whatever you want and not worry too much about making headlines.\n\nAnother difference between the academy and the Fed is that I can't just think and write and lecture. I must make judgments about the economy, and continually weigh incoming information and data against theories, and ultimately formulate policy actions. Honestly, that has been a privilege.\n\nI have been able to bring my research interests into policymaking, to some extent. Our Bank has made it a priority to promote economic mobility and resilience, or EMAR, as we call it. I was far from alone in bringing that forward at the Atlanta Fed. But I had some influence, and my grounding in arenas that are at the heart of mobility and resilience informed my thinking about how critical it is in advancing the macroeconomy and especially the maximum employment side of the Fed's dual mandate.\n\nI guess it's clear this job comes with stresses. In fact, I often say I get paid to worry, and it's not just a throwaway line. Believe it or not, when I started this gig in 2017, my hair wasn't completely gray. Then along came a global pandemic and the highest inflation we've seen since I was in high school.\n\nI used to tell my public policy students—the easy problems have all been solved. If you're going to be in this business, you'd better be ready to work on the hard stuff. Well, here we are.\n\nAnother difference between academia and this job is the heavy travel schedule. But here again, the positives far outweigh any inconvenience. I get to meet a fascinating and eclectic range of people—my FOMC colleagues, business leaders from across the economic spectrum, elected officials, educators, nonprofit and arts leaders, community advocates, and on and on.\n\nI have particularly enjoyed getting to know the Southeast. Before I joined the Atlanta Fed, I had spent little time in the region. It's been gratifying to travel around and see that people are engaged, people love their communities, and they want to make these places the best they can be. I have come to appreciate that while data and research are essential tools for a policymaker, the surest way to viscerally understand local communities and economies is to directly see and hear the people who live and work in them.\n\nOur six-state district is tremendously diverse. It encompasses thriving Sunbelt metropolises that nonetheless face profound challenges, resort areas like this one, and small towns and rural expanses coping with the tectonic shift from a goods-producing to a service-providing economy. We are making policy for all of them.\n\nThis role has given me a deeper appreciation of the great good that economic policy can do, and the tremendous value of having people understand those policies and basic economic principles that affect their lives in such profound ways.\n\nTaking solid research to people who can use it\n\nThis appreciation has only strengthened my conviction that we, as a profession, need to do a better job making our research and knowledge accessible and useful to real people. I'm sure my staff get tired of hearing me harp on this point. But we can spend months churning out papers for peer-reviewed journals that nobody outside rooms like this will ever see.\n\nAnd certainly, basic research is critical. But we also need to get this work out there so it can make a real difference. So, another part of my job I love is that I can take good, solid research and data out to people who can use it. We have plenty of examples of that in our building, including tools many of you probably know, such as the Wage Growth Tracker, GDPNow, and our Underlying Inflation Dashboard.\n\nBut let me give you a couple of recent examples of how our work can manifest in material ways, even in places you might not expect.\n\nAs I travel around, I hear a lot from executives about their difficulties attracting talent, dating back to before the pandemic. A common refrain runs along the lines of: \"People just don't want to work like they used to.\"\n\nThere may be some truth to that, and not in a pejorative sense. As a matter of fact, people are reevaluating how they want to participate in labor markets. Many workers have decided that the way they worked, when they worked, and where they worked before the pandemic no longer suits them. And many are in a position to be choosier.\n\nThat means employers have to rethink how to attract and retain workers. Demographics tell us a dramatic surge in labor force participation is not likely soon. But there are creative ways to think about solutions. Work by Julie Hotchkiss shows that higher pay alone is less likely to attract younger generations to the labor force compared to baby boomers. So, employers need to innovate, whether that means demonstrating more clearly that work has meaning beyond a paycheck, allowing greater flexibility, offering better benefits, or, in many cases, all the above. We hear many reports from contacts that employers are at least pondering moves in all those directions.\n\nTo be sure, Julie's research alone doesn't solve this puzzle. But it does offer a framework to shape worker attraction and retention strategies in ways that employers might not have considered before.\n\nAnother example: Just last month, I was in an impoverished part of rural west Alabama. Childcare is among the biggest challenges they face in fielding a capable labor force. As it happens, Melinda Pitts, another of our economists who is here, has done good work on young mothers' labor force participation, or lack thereof, in the thick of the pandemic. Melinda found that much of the problem stems from a lack of childcare.\n\nSo, during this visit, I was able to talk about Melinda's work in conversations that included local and state policymakers. I'm hopeful that the discussion captured the attention of those officials, and that maybe they will take that information and raise childcare as an issue that is important not only for the general welfare of lower-income mothers and their children, but also for the local economy and business community.\n\nAs I talk to business leaders, many of them tend to fixate on one or two reasons why workers aren't returning to the labor force in sufficient numbers. I try to tell them there are many reasons why people aren't coming back. I've actually started keeping a list, which is now up to 11 distinct factors. And if you're narrowly focused on one or two, then you probably won't find solutions to the labor force challenges so that we, as a nation, start to see the supply-demand tensions ease. So, the research we're producing can shape how people understand the economy and what they can do to make the economy better. That's incredibly important.\n\nFinally, we have an interdisciplinary team that conducts an initiative we call Advancing Careers for Low-Income Families. We have established partnerships with more than three dozen state and local agencies nationwide that use our tools and data to help lower-income workers upgrade their skills and earn more money without losing public benefits that help sustain their families. People on multiple forms of public benefits confront so-called benefits cliffs as they earn additional income—each additional dollar earned can mean a loss of $2 or $3 in benefits. In effect, some of the country's lowest earners face punishing marginal tax rates and thus a disincentive to acquire skills, seek better jobs, and ultimately become more self-sufficient.\n\nGoing to the grassroots\n\nMuch of the research I've just described is grounded in data. Data in many ways are the lifeblood of the study of economics. But the numbers are inherently backward-looking. Nowadays, technology, globalization, and other forces have accelerated the pace of economic change to the point that, if we rely solely on aggregate statistics to guide our policy thinking, we will always play catch-up.\n\nSo, in addition to our economic research enterprise, we have developed other mechanisms to supplement the aggregate data with nuanced, more real-time intelligence.\n\nOver several years, we have built a robust survey shop—we call it the Economic Survey Research Center—to generate forward-looking information about how business leaders are thinking. We produce the Business Inflation Expectations Survey, which has proven particularly helpful in today's environment, and the Survey of Business Uncertainty. The SBU has been invaluable in adding texture to our understanding of how firms are thinking about investment and hiring decisions, for instance. The CFO Survey we conduct along with the Richmond Fed and Duke University likewise has yielded rich information about large firms' cost pressures and timely concerns such as supply chain disruptions and hiring difficulties.\n\nWe augment these instruments with intelligence directly from hundreds of business contacts, community leaders, and nonprofit executives across the Southeast. Staff in our six offices who gather this input make up what we call our Regional Economic Information Network, or REIN.\n\nThe questions REIN personnel ask are informed by research and surveys. Importantly, our REIN information gathering and analysis constitute a longitudinal exercise, in that we can observe trends as they develop from seed to maturation.\n\nAll these data, survey findings, and grassroots intelligence inform my policymaking. Before every FOMC meeting, my staff and I hold a series of discussions that include formal briefings with economists and the REIN team to analyze the latest intelligence they've gleaned. REIN has produced a lot of insights. For example, early in the recovery from the pandemic recession our staff began hearing reports of firms having trouble filling job openings—well before shortages of available labor appeared in the data.\n\nThat is the sort of potential turning point in the economy that REIN can help us detect before it manifests in official statistics. In another such example, we have recently begun to hear scattered reports about higher interest rates beginning to constrain business activity.\n\nOf course, we treat anecdotal information with appropriate caveats. But we feel our contact base is representative enough and our synthesis and analysis of the findings rigorous enough that the information is a useful complement to the aggregate data. It's become more than useful, actually. It's an essential component.\n\nBefore I close, I want to add one more thought about the economics profession. Part of the quest to make sound economic research useful is grounding it in real, lived experience. We need diverse voices, perspectives, and backgrounds to make polices as effective as they can be. We need people in the important rooms and around the big tables who have lived the lives of those for whom the economy is not working, the lives of those whose opportunities to fully participate in the economy are constrained.\n\nTo that end, I am proud to be associated with the Fed System's Federal Reserve Education Fellows Program that is training a cohort of teachers at the fifth through eighth grade levels in economics and monetary policy. We have a long history of training teachers how to be better econ instructors to high school kids. What's different with the Education Fellows Program is that we are trying to reach kids much earlier in their lives, so that they get strong positive reinforcement that economics is important, interesting, and, critically, something they can be good at. Our hope is that these early encounters might cause more kids to have economics or finance on their list of possible careers as they grow up. And I'm especially hopeful that this happens for girls and kids from groups underrepresented in our field.\n\nPlease think about how you might reach out and encourage or mentor a promising student. When we leave potential behind, we shortchange all of us and the entire economy.\n\nMaking our work available and accessible\n\nI've discussed the Atlanta Fed's research and information-gathering apparatus in part because I think it's important to continually explain our work to the public. I also tell my research team that part of my job is to make them famous, hence the shout-outs today. If I'm going to make them famous, then our information must be available and accessible, and we need to make the work useful—on the ground, in our communities. I'm proud to say we are doing that.\n\nAnother reason I wanted to talk about our research is that I hope it sparks you to think about how our products can inform your work. By the same token, I encourage you to consider how your research might inform the work we're doing. There are countless interesting economic puzzles out there, and while our people are working on many of them, there are others where help is definitely needed. I'm looking for your help as we wrestle with profound changes—in labor markets, inflationary dynamics, and the changing ways monetary policy is transmitted through the financial system and the real economy. So go find a Fed person at this conference, and let's start making this happen. Check out the slide on the screen for ways to follow us.\n\nThank you for your attention and enjoy the rest of the conference.",

            "content": "Thank you for inviting me to deliver the Institute for Policy Research's Distinguished Public Policy Lecture. I wish we could be together in person, but I am honored to speak with you this afternoon from our studio here in Atlanta.\n\nIPR makes important contributions across a range of subjects, and I congratulate you for your engagement in such a broad set of issues. It is truly impressive. I hope my remarks today enrich all your continued learning and deepen your understanding of the current, quite complicated, macroeconomy and how I believe we should approach monetary policy in this environment.\n\nBefore I dive into the topic of the day, let me clarify that my remarks reflect my views only. I do not speak for my colleagues at the Atlanta Fed nor the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC.\n\nAs you might have guessed, I'm going to discuss inflation. More specifically, I will describe how I am thinking about the mechanics of crafting monetary policy and balancing risks to promote the return of inflation to the Fed's longer-run objective of 2 percent, as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index. I will explain why it is important that we as monetary policymakers remain purposeful and resolute, and do not waver in this mission. And I will show why history is my guide and foundation for my commitment to steadfastness, and not heedlessness, in calibrating monetary policy in these unsettled economic conditions.\n\nPutting today's inflation in context\n\nFirst, though, let me set forth the background for why inflation has been elevated. It is worth a reminder that the profound effects of the pandemic and attendant policy responses continue to shape macroeconomic conditions. Consider that in just two-and-a-half years, the US economy suffered its sharpest drop in overall output since World War II, followed by a rapid resurgence in demand, a dramatic imbalance between labor supply and demand, widespread supply and shipping constraints, and an inflation rate that surged from about 1.5 percent to nearly 7 percent over just 17 months.\n\nThe pace of regaining jobs from the brief but severe downturn early in the pandemic has been faster than the recoveries from the three previous recessions. More importantly, the labor market since the 2020 recession has been characterized by an excess of labor demand over labor supply. That is in stark contrast to the earlier, so-called \"jobless recoveries,\" when there were far more job seekers than jobs.\n\nThat imbalance in the labor market mirrors an imbalance between aggregate demand for and supply of goods and services throughout the economy. Our persistently elevated rate of inflation is a direct result of that imbalance. While the main drivers have been COVID-related, geopolitical, and global economic developments have also played a role in price spikes. Russia's invasion of Ukraine, for example, caused an energy price shock that led to gas prices spiking in the spring and into the summer, though prices have receded over the past few months. As another example, a severe drought in China has adversely impacted demand and aggregate output for a major trading partner.\n\nPrice pressures are still widespread, though, reflecting the economic truism that high demand and low supply result in rising prices—exactly what we have seen. Demand for goods and services has been high in part because (1) many American families have larger balances in their savings account than they historically would have, a result of slowed overall consumption, particularly of services, during the pandemic, and (2) the quick and large government response left many families, especially those with lower and moderate incomes, in a stronger financial position than they would have otherwise been in.\n\nEarly in the pandemic, homebound Americans pulled back from spending on services such as restaurant meals and entertainment. Instead, consumers as a group shifted their spending to goods such as furniture, electronics, and exercise gear. Intensified demand for those goods coincided with pandemic-driven supply constraints such as factory shutdowns and shortages of shipping containers and workers. Ergo, demand quickly outstripped supply, sending prices upward.\n\nAn easing of supply constraints could help bring supply and demand into better balance and thus chip away at elevated inflation. Unfortunately, supply chains are still not functioning nearly as well as they did before the pandemic. Our surveys of business leaders reflect this. The latest release of the CFO Survey that we conduct with the Richmond Fed and Duke University shows that the fraction of firms experiencing abnormally high pressure on most of their input costs rose to 53 percent in the third quarter of 2022, doubling from 26 percent in the second quarter of last year.\n\nAnecdotes from my contacts and other evidence indicate these price pressures result primarily from materials and goods scarcity—supply chain issues. But the same sources are increasingly citing labor supply constraints as a significant impediment, especially in the services sector.\n\nPrice pressures in the services sector bear close watching because consumers' expenditures have shifted to a more normal, service-dominated mix. Through the April–June period of 2022, data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis show that while services spending has climbed in eight straight quarters from the preceding quarter, goods spending has declined in three of the past four quarters from very elevated levels.\n\nAs a result, even as increases in the prices of goods slow, services prices are rising swiftly. The Personal Consumption Expenditures price index shows that services price increases have exceeded 4 percent on a year-over-year basis in five straight quarters, after lingering below 3 percent for over a decade before the pandemic (see the image below). I watch this very closely because services price increases tend to be more persistent than increases in the prices of goods. Our staff and others have noted this pattern, and it is why the Atlanta Fed's Sticky-Price CPI tool includes many service-based categories. Moreover, services account for roughly two-thirds of the consumption basket, so it carries a big weight when we consider the underlying determinants of overall inflation.\n\n\n\nImportantly, services prices may continue to rise at a fast clip. I continue to hear of very strong demand for in-person services like restaurant meals. Leaders of medical service providers are paying much higher wages for health care workers. Prices for housing services like rent are still climbing. On this last point, you've very likely heard that home price increases have moderated recently. Despite this, they are still climbing in most markets at relatively high rates.\n\nSo, we must remain vigilant because this inflation battle is likely still in early days if the projections of my FOMC colleagues are correct. At every other meeting, each FOMC member submits their projections for the federal funds rate—which is the Fed's main policy instrument—and various economic indicators for the end of the current year, next year, and beyond. The compilation of these projections is known as the Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP. At the September meeting, the median committee projection of PCE inflation for all of 2022 was 5.4 percent, and 2.8 percent in 2023, and finally 2.3 in 2024. To be clear, the Committee projections are not forecasts, per se, but rather projections of where we think inflation is likely to be under each member's assumption of appropriate monetary policy.\n\nWhat are we seeing ahead?\n\nThese are particularly uncertain times, and the view beyond the next few quarters is unusually murky. So I would encourage you to avoid anchoring to any specific number; precision isn't the point here. Rather, focus on the trajectory of these projections. Looking at those, the point is that it will likely take some time to bring inflation all the way back to 2 percent, which is the FOMC's target level for inflation in the economy.\n\nThough recent reports have brought glimmers of hope, the overarching message I'm drawing from them is that we are still decidedly in the inflationary woods, not out of them. The past couple of monthly inflation prints produced a mixed bag, with some evidence that the pace of month-to-month price increases has slowed. But the August inflation reports were a sobering reminder that price pressures remain broad and stubborn.\n\nOver the next several months, as monetary policy takes hold, we will see aggregate demand slacken as we seek to bring demand in alignment with supply. The strength of labor markets will wane, and economic activity will weaken, which is fundamentally necessary to reduce inflation.\n\nWe should not let the emergence of this weakness deter our push to lower inflation, though. We must reduce the existing demand-supply imbalance and thereby bring down inflation. We need to remain focused on the core mission of putting underlying inflation on a sustained path toward 2 percent.\n\nThe longer inflation remains top of mind for consumers and price setters, the likelier they are to make spending and investment decisions based on an assumption that prices will keep rising. That makes it more likely that inflation will take deep root in the economy, and in that case, it would become more difficult and painful to uproot it. We are determined to avoid that.\n\nWe must. Without price stability, the other half of our dual mandate—achieving sustained maximum employment—would become exceedingly difficult and American families would continue to suffer. Elevated inflation is already inflicting hardship and is affecting families and businesses in numerous ways. In these circumstances, monetary policy assumes enormous importance because it is our bulwark against inflation.\n\nDiffering inflation experiences\n\nWhen we discuss inflation, we generally cite numbers that reflect aggregates across tens of millions of consumers and hundreds of prices, from infants' apparel to funeral expenses. Yet no single individual or household represents the aggregate. We each experience our own reality, so in a real sense those realities combine to form different economies.\n\nWe have much to learn about the varying intensity of inflation among different groups. But those least able to weather price increases suffer the most for various reasons.\n\nFor starters, numerous studies have shown that the market baskets of lower-income consumers—the items they routinely purchase—have experienced higher-than-average inflation over time. Economists at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which publishes the Consumer Price Index (CPI), examined price data spanning 2003 through 2018. The economists found that a price index reflecting the consumption basket for households in the lowest-income quartile rose faster than the broad CPI did, while a price index for households in the highest-income quartile rose more slowly than did the overall CPI.\n\nOne reason inflation batters lower-wage earners is that they spend comparatively bigger portions of their income on necessities, whose prices have risen greatly. The Census Bureau's Consumer Expenditure Surveys show, according to my staff's calculations, that households earning $50,000 or less spend more than 70 percent of their after-tax income on food, housing, transportation, and health care. By contrast, households with annual incomes of $150,000 or more on average spend less than 45 percent of their take-home pay on those essentials. Even as some prices have climbed more slowly of late, those for necessities have kept rising briskly. Prices for food at home spiked 13.5 percent in August over August 2021, well above the overall inflation rate of 8.3 percent as measured by the CPI.\n\nRents have also continued rising swiftly. In the August CPI report, rent of primary residence rose at an annualized rate of 9.2 percent, near its all-time high. In other words, there is still upward momentum in rents. That is especially bad news for low- to moderate-income households because they are far more likely to rent than are higher-income households. Census Bureau data and calculations by our Bank's analysts show that as of August, 55 percent of households earning under $35,000 a year rent, compared to only 11 percent of households making more than $150,000 a year.\n\nRenters are inherently more vulnerable to rising costs, as homeowners with fixed-rate mortgages generally do not face increases in their monthly payments even in severe inflationary episodes. Renters, on the other hand, typically face higher monthly payments at least annually.\n\nAlong with wealth and income levels, inflation manifests differently along other dimensions, too, including geography. We see pronounced disparities in inflation across metropolitan areas. In June and July, New York, San Francisco, and Honolulu all experienced inflation rates under 7 percent, while Anchorage, Phoenix, Atlanta, and Tampa were above 11 percent. Three metro areas in the Atlanta Fed's six-state district—Atlanta, Miami, and Tampa—were among six with the highest local inflation readings, according to the CPI. (The BLS reports inflation for Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York monthly and every other month for 20 other metros.)\n\nHousing costs explain much of the geographic disparity. Net migration into areas such as Phoenix, Tampa, Atlanta, and Miami is forcing up housing demand and thus housing prices faster than in other markets. Those four metros posted the highest price rises for shelter in June and July.\n\nAll that said, some evidence suggests that the Committee's policy tightening may have already sapped momentum from soaring housing prices. This could help bring supply and demand more in alignment in an important sector of the economy.\n\nIn a broader sense, suffice it to say that bringing underlying inflation closer to our 2 percent objective will benefit Americans everywhere, of all incomes. The way I think about this is that achieving the Fed's long-run maximum employment mandate is necessary for an economy that works for everyone, a pursuit that is among my Bank's strategic priorities. Price stability—represented by low inflation—is necessary for us to achieve sustained maximum employment.\n\nWhere we stand in the monetary policy cycle\n\nIn that quest for price stability, the Committee launched a tightening cycle roughly seven months ago. We have increased the target range for the federal funds rate from 0 to 1/4 percent up to 3 to 3 1/4 percent, and we are reducing the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet.\n\nThese significant policy moves come against the backdrop of an unsettled economic environment. We've lived through a lot, and economic signals are still scrambled.\n\nOne set of indicators suggests the economy is slowing. Reports on inflation show that increases may have slowed somewhat. Economic activity as measured by gross domestic product (GDP) was soft in the first half of the year. As I've noted, the housing market has shown signs of cooling, as demand has ebbed. House prices have continued to rise, but the rate of increase has diminished.\n\nAnecdotally, our Bank's contacts in the retail industry tell us that low- and moderate-income consumers in particular are buying less expensive products and forgoing discretionary purchases in the face of higher prices. Meanwhile, trucking firms, an important bellwether, are reporting slackening demand.\n\nThen there is a flip side. Even as the GDP signals that the economy is slowing, an alternative measure of broad economic performance—gross domestic income—climbed through the first half of 2022. And the labor market is chugging along and remains tight. Employment growth this year averaged a robust 438,000 jobs a month through August. Total nonfarm employment returned to its prepandemic peak in July. The broad U-6 measure of unemployment—which includes people marginally attached to the labor force and those working part-time for economic reasons in addition to the unemployed—was at all-time lows in the summer. And the nation's job openings rate, a gauge of vacant positions compared to total employment, has dipped a smidge from its March peak but remains near record highs.\n\nAt the grassroots, even our business contacts who voice concern about the direction of the economy are, nearly to a person, quick to add that their own business is healthy. Business leaders tell me they are not worried so much about whether they can sell products in the short term. Their bigger concerns involve supply-side issues like labor availability and the sustainability of demand months out. Based on our surveys, data, and conversations with business leaders, I think those concerns are grounded more in uncertainty than in actual signs that the economy is taking a step back.\n\nSo, altogether, I think the economy still has reasonable momentum. Business leaders and consumers are experiencing a degree of gloom, to be sure. But I do not see that gloom inevitably leading to doom. Two significant reasons for my belief are that many households and businesses still are in a better financial position than they were before the pandemic, and the labor market remains robust.\n\nWhere I see appropriate monetary policy headed\n\nThat's where we are. Where might the economy be headed, and what are the implications for the path of monetary policy?\n\nThe Summary of Economic Projections I discussed earlier is known as the \"dot plot\" because the projections of the federal funds rate are depicted as, yes, dots on a plot, as you see in the image below. Trying to decipher which dot belongs to which committee member is something of a parlor game among Fed watchers.\n\n\n\nI will basically tell you where my dots are. My baseline outlook is for GDP to grow about 1 1/4 percent in the second half of 2022, and about 1 percent in 2023. I think we will end 2022 with an unemployment rate in the neighborhood of 3.7 percent, which is about where we are now and still low by historical standards.\n\nAs I noted earlier, the global economy is fraught with uncertainty on numerous fronts, so I suggest you view my projections as rough estimates rather than precise predictions. To that end, my Bank's models describe a band of possible scenarios, where unemployment remains mostly flat even as tighter policy takes hold, but also outcomes where it climbs a bit above 4 percent.\n\nBy some estimates, an unemployment rate of slightly above 4 percent represents about the level of full employment, so we may well be overshooting the maximum employment side of our dual mandate now, particularly given the current wide gap between labor demand and labor supply. If that's true, we may have a bit of maneuvering room so that we can continue to tighten policy—if we deem that appropriate—without inflicting undue damage on labor markets.\n\nOne of the main points I want to leave you with is that we must look to signals in addition to inflation readings to guide our policy. That's because inflation will be among the last economic indicators to materially shift. Simply waiting for inflation to decline all the way to 2 percent before backing off on tightening may not be the best approach.\n\nBe assured that I am not advocating a quick turn toward accommodation. On the contrary. You no doubt are aware of considerable speculation already that the Fed could begin lowering rates in 2023 if economic activity slows and the rate of inflation starts to fall.\n\nI would say: not so fast.\n\nI am going to remain purposeful and resolute in my approach to monetary policy. Over the past two-and-a-half years, the unexpected has happened repeatedly. Nothing should be carved in stone. And while I do not speak for my colleagues on the FOMC, I think we agree that we do not want to stir even more questions into an economy already roiled by uncertainty. We want the public and markets to clearly understand our reaction function—how policy will respond to economic events—our aims, and the fact that we are going to be unwavering in the pursuit to bring underlying inflation back toward our 2 percent objective.\n\nIn that spirit, then, let me detail what I mean by purposeful and resolute. My staff has analyzed past tightening cycles. This work is instructive, especially in highlighting what not to do. Two of our economists, Federico Mandelman and Brent Meyer, examined monetary policy before and during \"the Great Inflation,\" which lasted from the late 1960s through the early 1980s.\n\nThe main takeaway from their research is that history shows we must be resolute if we are to completely uproot inflation. What economists have come to call stop-and-go monetary policy—tightening in the face of rising inflation only to reverse course abruptly when unemployment rises—likely helped fuel inflation during the late 1960s and 1970s (see the following image).\n\n\n\nMoving too aggressively could introduce the temptation to abruptly shift course. Most notably, the risk there is that monetary policy could slam the brakes on economic activity, and then the Committee might conclude it should reverse course and ease policy. Therein lies the risk of repeating the stop-and-go approach that arguably contributed to economic instability in the late 1960s and '70s.\n\nIndeed, a recession during 1969 and 1970 was viewed by many economists at the time as caused at least partially by policy. To briefly recap, that downturn followed a period of fiscal tightening intended to make up for large government outlays to finance the Vietnam War, and a sizable slowing in money growth as the Fed attempted to quell rising inflation. Controlling the money supply was the key monetary policy tool in that day.\n\nIn the lead-up to the 1969–70 recession, the Fed tightened the money supply—by selling government securities through open market operations—and the federal funds rate climbed roughly 4 1/2 percentage points, to 9 percent. Growth in the money supply slowed from 8 percent on a year-over-year basis to just 2 percent. But as soon as inflation began falling, the Fed quickly reversed course with an aggressive expansion in the money supply that overshadowed the one originating the previous cycle, citing as justification spikes in unemployment along with a lagged decline in inflation. By late 1971, the money supply was again surging, up 13 percent on a year-over-year basis.\n\nTo sum up the policy reversals, as the FOMC repeatedly shrank and then grew the money supply, the federal funds rate climbed from about 4 to over 9 percent in two years then dropped back to less than 4 percent over about a year-and-a-half, and then scaled up again to above 10 percent three years later, in the middle of 1974. The funds rate declined yet again to around 4 percent in late 1976 before beginning a steady climb and holding at over 8 percent for most of the 1980s.\n\nIn hindsight, the Fed reacted too quickly to changes in the real economy, such as rising unemployment. Policy reversals never allowed inflation to fully recede to the 1 to 3 percent range that was the norm after the Korean War. Hence, instead of fading from the American psyche, inflation remained an ever-present danger to vigilantly guard against. That meant business leaders and workers anticipated higher future inflation rates as they set prices and bargained for wages. That is, inflation expectations became, in monetary policy parlance, unanchored.\n\nConsequently, elevated inflation itself took root, and policymakers successfully ripped it out of the economy only after a pair of painful recessions in the early 1980s. In fact, during the second downturn, in 1981–82, the unemployment rate peaked at 10.9 percent, which has, except for three months early in the pandemic, been the highest rate since World War II.\n\nI take those lessons from the Great Inflation to heart. I am firmly committed to the fight against inflation and will remain purposeful and resolute until the job is done. So what does all of this imply for the policy path in the coming months?\n\nHistory and a large body of research teach us that tighter policy materially moves inflation with a lag, and only after it affects other economic indicators.\n\nChanges in the stance of monetary policy typically affect economic growth first, particularly in interest-rate-sensitive sectors. For instance, the average rate on a 30-year fixed rate home loan began climbing even before the committee started increasing the federal funds rate, nearly doubling from December of last year to about 6 percent now. Our GDPNow prediction tool projects that residential investment will have declined by 20 percent in the third quarter of this year. And the GDPNow estimate of the current quarter's GDP growth and consumer spending have until recently steadily fallen. Meanwhile, rates on auto loans have climbed, and we anticipate some slowing in the trend rate of employment growth.\n\nThese are impacts on what economists call the \"real economy\" that typically occur well before any slowing in the underlying rate of inflation. How long does this take to play out? A large body of research has tried to answer this question. To cite a few prominent works, former Fed chair Ben Bernanke and coauthors (1999) as well as Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2005) point to a two-year lag between monetary policy actions and their main effect on inflation. Svensson and Gerlach (2001) report an approximately 18-month lag in the euro area, while Batini and Nelson (2003) estimate that changes in the money supply have their peak impact on inflation in the United Kingdom after a year.\n\nGiven unusual and swift changes brought about the by global pandemic, it is possible that the lag in policy affecting inflation may have shortened. Through the pandemic, we have seen companies change prices more rapidly and frequently than has historically been the case.\n\nThat noted, I do not think we've effectively overturned history, primarily because even as interest-rate-sensitive sectors and financial markets reacted quickly to tighter policy, financial markets are not the real economy where people live and where inflation does its worst. And the real economy has remained generally robust.\n\nPurposeful, resolute, and analytical\n\nIn my view, the Committee should not overreact if, as appears likely, inflation does not fairly quickly fall back into the 2 percent range, even if we see some slowing in economic activity.\n\nChair Powell said in his August Jackson Hole speech that reducing inflation will probably induce softening of labor market conditions and could well bring some pain to households and businesses. The labor market is still strong but out of balance, as the number of job openings far exceeds the supply of job seekers. We have already seen some reduction in monthly employment growth. But with millions of unfilled openings and a smaller number of unemployed workers, slowing need not mean that job growth dries up completely.\n\nIf supply throughout the macroeconomy climbs closer to alignment with demand, then we would require less slowing of demand to bring them into balance. That would mean inflation could more likely fall without severe economic disruption. That is my hope, and the hope of many of my FOMC colleagues.\n\nAs the chair noted, there could be short-term pain. That may be the unfortunate cost of reducing inflation. Yet failing to restore price stability now would only lead to worse suffering later, as the work of our staff on the Great Inflation makes clear.\n\nWe're seven months into the tightening cycle. We likely still have some ways to go. Ideally, I would like to reach a point where policy is moderately restrictive—between 4 and 4 1/2 percent by the end of this year—and then hold at that level and see how the economy and prices react. I do not think we should continue raising rates until the inflation level has gotten down to 2 percent. Because of the lag dynamics of our policy that I discussed earlier, this would guarantee an overshoot and a deep recession. My baseline outlook is that the macroeconomy will be strong enough that we can tighten policy to that point—4 to 4 1/2 percent—without causing undue dislocation in output and employment.\n\nOnce policy reaches what I judge an appropriately restrictive level, I'm going to analyze and assess how the Committee's policies are flowing through the economy. If economic conditions weaken appreciably—for example, if unemployment rises uncomfortably—it will be important to resist the temptation to react by reversing our policy course prematurely.\n\nI hope I've made it clear that I will be purposeful and resolute in the quest to bring down inflation. We cannot waver because price stability is necessary for us to achieve sustained maximum employment and to pursue an economy that works for everyone. Thank you.",

            "highlights": "Atlanta Fed president and CEO Raphael Bostic spoke at the Georgia Tech master's commencement ceremony, where he gave the graduates three pieces of advice.",
            "content": "Thank you for having me today. First, I want to thank President Ángel Cabrera for the invitation to speak at this graduation ceremony for master's students. I also want to thank Provost Steven McLaughlin and the rest of the Georgia Tech community for welcoming me today. I'm especially touched by the honorary doctorate of philosophy from such a distinguished institution as Georgia Tech.\n\nI was a professor for more than 15 years, and graduation day was always my favorite time on campus. Why, you ask? Because it's the only day of the year when everyone—students, parents, family members, professors and instructors—is happy. Homework and deadlines, tests and grades, office hours, rushing to class because traffic was awful, or the alarm didn't go off—none of that matters today because you are graduating!\n\nIn our short time together today, I want to share three pieces of advice to carry with you as you advance in your career. First, I will talk a bit about how I define success and how you might achieve that, then why you should enjoy the journey you are embarking on, and, finally, why it's important to share your knowledge and experience with others.\n\nSo for my first piece of advice, let me describe how I define success. Those of you who are familiar with the Federal Reserve know that we have a dual mandate. Congress has given us two clear objectives—to keep prices stable and promote sustained maximum employment.\n\nJust as the Fed has more than one objective, you, too, will have to strive to accomplish more than one thing at a time—often many different things at a time, in fact. But in your work life, my challenge to you is to focus on two mandates. One, be the best every day in the work that you choose to do. And two, make other people's lives better. This second mandate is how I measure whether someone is successful.\n\nAt the University of Southern California, I was director of the Price Dollinger Master of Real Estate Development degree program. I used to tell my students at orientation that, as master's students at a prestigious institution, they were poised to become leaders in their field. And this would very likely come with traditional measures of success—high salaries, titles, and more.\n\nBut I told them also that high salaries and big titles by themselves would not be enough for me to consider them successful in life. With the responsibility of that leadership and with the education they were undertaking, they needed to use their positions not just for transactional purposes, but also to actually do good in the world.\n\nAs I look out today, I see the same things I saw at USC: master's students at a prestigious university, poised to be leaders in their fields. So as you graduate, I pose the same challenge to you: what will you do with the opportunities that undoubtedly lay before you to improve the lives of others? No matter what field you have pursued here at Georgia Tech, find the opportunity to not just succeed individually, but to also look for ways you can make life better for those in your communities.\n\nAn example of this from my USC experience was in real estate development. Many of the students were planning to be general managers for large development projects. They could go out there and be very good developers and build cookie-cutter projects that, to be honest, were not very interesting, and people would still live and work in them.\n\nI challenged them to do more, to find ways to develop projects that help people have a higher quality of life. To the extent possible, go out and create inclusive, vibrant communities that people love and that help people reach their full potential.\n\nThe goal, then, is to be more than pedestrian or just adequate, and to create things that meaningfully change the paradigm for the better. That's my first piece of advice.\n\nMy second piece of advice is a reminder to fully embrace the journey you are embarking on. All of it. One thing I can promise you is that your career is not going to go exactly as you think it will as you sit here today. And that's OK.\n\nI've been president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta for almost five years now. But even 18 months before I became president, the idea of being in this position would have seemed farfetched to me. I have felt that way in most of my jobs.\n\nI wanted to share this with you because it's easy to assume that successful people travel a smooth path to where they are. Let me assure you they don't. I didn't. This uncertainty may sound daunting and even scary on a day when you are brimming with hope. I don't say it to dampen your spirits, though. Not at all. Instead, it is a reminder to be open to opportunities as they present themselves.\n\nOftentimes, these opportunities will feel awkward and unexpected. Some chances will be big, some small. But be open to all of them because one of them could turn out to be that next transcendent possibility.\n\nNow this may sound a little goofy, but early on, when it became clear my career may not proceed exactly how I envisioned it, I resolved never to go to bed without laughing at some point in the day. It was important to find the things that made me chuckle, that made me thankful to be doing what I was doing.\n\nSome days, this meant watching the Golden Girls before I went to bed. You all are probably not old enough to remember that show, but every episode made me laugh. Look it up. Usually, though, I found those moments of humor throughout the day—in the work I was doing and, more importantly, from those whom I was working alongside. My point here: enjoy every twist and turn of the journey, even the unexpected ones. There are going to be plenty of them.\n\nAnd now for my third nugget of advice: as new master's graduates, you will soon be viewed as leaders. It is important to realize you will now be considered mentors as much as you are mentees, if you weren't already before you started your program.\n\nBeing a mentor hardly means you stop learning from others. As you progress in your career, you're certainly going to seek out advice. But realize you now are positioned to give advice, too.\n\nTo underscore this point, I want to share a quick story, and I will tell it even though it makes me a little uncomfortable. I was at an industry conference years ago and someone came up and said, \"Hi.\" This was someone I didn't know well, but I knew who they were. They said, \"I'm so excited to be with you because you're famous.\" I was like: \"What are you talking about? I'm just a junior person here.\"\n\nLooking back, I realize now that there are times when your position in your industry evolves in ways you may not grasp in the moment. You can look up and all of a sudden, you are in a different position, and that comes with responsibility—responsibility to bring others along and share your knowledge and expertise, and a responsibility to think about how to advance your field. I didn't notice it at the time, until someone actually said it out loud. So now I'm telling you.\n\nWhen you get your master's degree and you settle into jobs as new graduates, you are going to be in positions where others won't have the same experiences as you. These may be people in your field, people in the Georgia Tech community. Some will just reach out because you are going to have a visibility you didn't have before. Wherever they come from, these people will want to engage with and learn from you. When they ask to do that, say yes. Sharing what you know will become part and parcel of your narrative and your success.\n\nAt the Atlanta Fed, we talk a lot about inclusion and what it means to build an inclusive economy here in Atlanta and across the country. By sharing your experiences and helping to lift up others in your field, you will help us in that endeavor. There are lots of smart, talented people who don't have the connections or an understanding of the career pathways available to them or how to best navigate those paths. You can be a voice to help broaden people's appreciation for what the world can be.\n\nThat brings me back to where I started. Do more than just get ahead in your career—improve people's lives. As you climb the ladder and navigate whatever journey yours turns out to be, bring others along. And as you do, make sure you find joy in that journey. Today is appropriately a time of pride, excitement, hope, and promise for you and your families. Class of 2022, congratulations, and good luck!",

Over the years, the Federal Reserve, and the Atlanta Fed in particular, have established a very strong relationship with NABE. This is perhaps most evidenced by the fact that my research director, Dave Altig, is the organization's president. Our connectedness has served the Fed well, as we have benefitted from the organization's good work to advance economic thinking. But it has also served the profession well, as it has allowed us to work together to strengthen the field. Here, I will applaud NABE's efforts to increase diversity among our ranks. Thanks for your commitment to this and other efforts to enhance the field.\n\nAs you probably know, speaking invitations like this are made months in advance. When my team and I received NABE's invitation, we thought I would talk about an emerging trend or dynamic that would shape the economy in 2022. As I will discuss shortly, we homed in on labor market dynamics, specifically how the labor market might regain a balance between supply and demand.\n\nThen Russia invaded Ukraine. The conflict, first and foremost, is a human tragedy, and my thoughts and prayers go out to the Ukrainian people and all victims of the fighting. In fact, the conflict is a stark reminder that there are many conflicts—and many victims—across the globe. I am keeping all those who are impacted by this in my prayers as well.\n\nBeyond its terrible human toll, this war on the European continent is reverberating through the global economy. The conflict, economic sanctions, and other disruptions to global trade and finance will influence virtually every factor the Federal Open Market Committee considers in formulating monetary policy. So I think it's only appropriate that I also say a few words on this.\n\nA common theme that connects labor market dynamics and the Russian invasion of Ukraine is uncertainty. Uncertainty enshrouds both, and this requires that we be extra observant and prepared to adapt our thinking about the economy and policy, perhaps even more so than we usually are.\n\nBefore I go any further, please keep in mind that the thoughts I express are strictly my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of my colleagues on the Committee or at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.\n\nLabor market dynamics: Tightness and uncertainty\n\nLet me start where I'd originally planned to by talking about the labor market. While the pandemic has introduced considerable uncertainty, one thing we know is that the labor market is tight. The headline unemployment rate quickly fell to 3.8 percent from a stunning high of almost 15 percent, as 90 percent of the jobs lost when the coronavirus hit US shores have been recovered. This is an extremely fast rebound.\n\nThe rapid rebound has translated into another labor market truth: there is currently a significant imbalance between labor supply and demand. The Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS's) Job Openings and Labor Turnover survey—you know this as the JOLTS—reported about 11 million job openings a month on average over the nine months through January. Employers filled only about 60 percent of those positions, so each month, roughly four million open jobs have gone unfilled.\n\nThese aggregate data are corroborated by respondents in the Atlanta Fed's Survey of Business Inflation Expectations, or BIE. In January, more than 60 percent of respondents cited labor availability as a problem, and more than half of those rated the problem as moderate or severe.\n\nResolving this imbalance is critical, because the labor shortage is keeping businesses from responding fully to the strong demand for products from US consumers, which is a key driver for the high levels of inflation that we currently see. As a result, we are very closely monitoring labor market developments.\n\nThere are many questions to track, and the answers are unfortunately quite uncertain at present. Here are just a few to ponder.\n\nWill some of the wave of excess retirees return to the labor force? What will be the labor market response of families with young children? In this regard, how will childcare rebound, which will be a vital question for mothers, who disproportionately left the labor force? How will families respond now that fiscal and monetary policy supports have expired?\n\nAnd, of course, there is COVID. We like to think we are mostly past the pandemic, but just this month China locked down some cities including certain manufacturing hubs in moves that could further foul global supply chains. We don't know if there will be another variant, or whether existing vaccines and boosters will be as effective against them as they have been for other strains. We don't know if vaccination rates will continue rising. A further question is whether we have learned enough that, should another variant emerge, we will continue on with minimal economic disruption.\n\nAn additional development will be the behavior of firms. We are already getting clues about this. As you know, classical economic theory suggests that an imbalance between weak labor supply and strong demand should translate into a higher price of labor. Well, firms are proving the theory to be correct. The Atlanta Fed's Wage Growth Tracker is showing its sharpest increases in nominal wages since 2001. February's reading showed a three-month moving average of 5.8 percent median hourly wage growth. Similarly, respondents to our BIE survey reported that they anticipated wage growth this year of about 6½ percent. As an aside, this expectation is consistent with what we are hearing from business leaders across the Southeast.\n\nInterestingly, business decision makers are telling my staff and me that they don't expect a quick cure to this challenge. Research by Atlanta Fed economist Julie Hotchkiss highlights one reason why this might be right. Julie found that higher wages alone may not be enough to draw generation Xers and millennials into the labor force. That is important because those two demographic groups constitute the bulk of the labor force—nearly all prime-age workers. As you're aware, these are workers 25 to 54 years old.\n\nExamining historical labor market behaviors, Julie shows that, compared to baby boomers, a given pay raise is only about half as likely to draw generation Xers to the worker pool and three-quarters as likely to attract millennials. What does this mean for the current labor market? Julie estimates that a 6 percent rise in nominal average hourly wages, as the BLS reported for January, would close just 17 percent of the gap between labor force participation for prime-aged individuals in January 2022 and the rate that prevailed immediately before the pandemic.\n\nThis suggests that the efficacy of the \"traditional\" enticement to draw labor—that is, wages—is lower than it used to be. That said, we are seeing signs that non-wage measures might act as an important supplement to wages. We are hearing growing anecdotal evidence of the appeal of measures such as firms allowing employees to fashion their own hybrid remote-slash-office work schedules; offering more generous dental and vision benefits; providing higher educational allowances and student loan repayment assistance; mandating a four-day workweek; and instilling a larger purpose into work beyond collecting a paycheck and boosting shareholder value.\n\nWe will closely track how employers embrace these innovations and the degree to which they help reduce the prevailing imbalance between labor supply and labor demand.\n\nWar will increase uncertainty, price pressures, accelerate production shifts\n\nLet me now turn to the tragic war in eastern Europe. While there is much that we will learn about the economic fallout over the coming weeks, there is much we can't foresee. That notwithstanding, I do see three high-level economic repercussions that will almost certainly play out:\n\nFirst, the conflict is an extraordinarily fluid situation. In an economic context, the war is supercharging what was already a great deal of uncertainty. Even as we have not completely shed the ambiguity created by the coronavirus pandemic, the events in Europe introduce new and multifaceted risk to the economy and the economic outlook, and thus the making of monetary policy. Uncertainty is inherently, well, uncertain. But we know that nobody likes it, and it will undoubtedly influence the behavior of business leaders and consumers.\n\nIf the past is a guide, increased uncertainty is likely to reduce engagement and economic activity by businesses and consumers, especially as it pertains to longer-run investments. I will emphasize that we are not hearing this from our contacts—and we have been explicitly asking this question. But it is still early, so this will bear watching.\n\nIn terms of direct effects, the fighting and attendant disruptions are generating upward pressure on the prices of products for which Ukraine and Russia are important global producers, including oil, natural gas, wheat, and fertilizer. These are all basic inputs into numerous consumer goods including gasoline, plastics, heating oil, electricity, and many food products. So the price implications could be broad.\n\nMoreover, the war is exacerbating already significant global supply chain challenges. Closed airspaces and a reluctance to use shipping lanes linked to the Black Sea will be disruptive in the short run, and even possibly into the medium term, and it remains to be seen how far that reach will extend. Let me turn to some specifics here.\n\nGasoline at the pump has already risen to an average of about $4.35 a gallon across the United States. That is a historic high in nominal terms, though in real terms is lower than pump prices were in 2012 and in the 1970s. The United States does not import much oil and gas from Russia. But as you know, the market for energy is global, and supply, demand, and price are determined accordingly.\n\nThe International Energy Agency says Russia is the world's second largest natural gas producer, providing some 40 percent of the European Union's total gas consumption. Russia is the third largest producer of oil behind the United States and Saudi Arabia, and the world's second largest crude oil exporter behind Saudi Arabia.\n\nIt appears very likely that sanctions and Russia's own export restrictions will limit Russian oil and gas exports. There are producers who can fill the gap. Yet all indications are that it will take time, and in some cases policy changes, to increase production in countries other than Russia.\n\nThe European Union is particularly dependent on Russian energy. Disruption in energy supplies and deeper general uncertainty, which figures to be even more acute on the European continent given its proximity to the conflict, could imperil economic growth in the EU. That is another risk we must monitor.\n\nAs for US energy production, we probably have room to grow. The United States is actually the world's leading producer of oil and natural gas. In a March 9 report, the US Energy Information Administration projects that US natural gas exports will keep rising through the early 2030s before leveling off.\n\nIncreased export activity probably won't happen without some complications, though. Energy industry contacts in our district say that while there are indeed excess supplies of oil and gas, for now we lack enough infrastructure to mine, store, process, and transport it, at least in sufficient quantities to make a difference in the short run. Regarding natural gas, for example, the country lacks sufficient capacity to refrigerate the gas molecules so they can be transported on ships.\n\nWe can build infrastructure. The catch is that it is very capital-intensive, it takes years to construct, and there are extensive regulations to navigate.\n\nAs for fertilizer, our district's farming contacts tell us their costs for this input had risen substantially before Russia invaded. The BLS's Producer Price Index shows that mixed fertilizer prices rose 33 percent for the 12 months through February. They could climb further because Russia is among the world's leading suppliers of fertilizer ingredients like ammonia, urea, and processed phosphates.\n\nWheat has a similar story. The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization ranks Russia the world's largest wheat exporter and Ukraine fifth. With much of Russian and Ukrainian wheat off the global market, prices are likely to climb for bread, pasta, and various packaged foods.\n\nThe United States could ramp up wheat production, but again, it's complicated. In recent years, about half of US wheat has been exported. But the USDA reports our share of world exports has declined from around 25 percent a year in the early 2000s to about 13 percent. Likewise, the amount of American farmland devoted to growing wheat has shrunk. US farmers harvested 50 million acres of wheat a year in the early 2000s, but that's down to 38 million acres the past five years.\n\nSo, there could be capacity to grow more wheat. But much like building energy industry infrastructure, major shifts in agricultural production do not happen quickly. For example, many crops have only one planting season a year.\n\nIn addition to increased uncertainty and rising commodity prices, the third implication I'll note is that the conflict in Ukraine likely will contribute to and accelerate a fundamental shift that is taking place regarding production strategies. Already we have heard an unmistakable message from direct contacts and surveys that global firms are moving away from a ruthless focus on cost minimization in configuring production networks.\n\nSupply chain disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic prompted business leaders to start diversifying supplier locations and firms, increasing inventories, and bringing production closer to final markets to maximize reliability. Think of it as a shift to just-in-case inventories from just-in-time. The common thread in these changes is that they increase production costs.\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine conflict will trigger similar considerations for producers, albeit for different reasons and in different geographies than was the primary focus of pandemic responses. In short, it's becoming increasingly risky for a company to rely on any part of the world as its sole source of an input to production. This will likely cause more firms to shift their production strategies to more certain, but higher cost, approaches.\n\nI realize the three consequences I've discussed are pretty sweeping. And I realize I've covered them at a high level. Many details remain to sort themselves, but the general direction these trends will take the macroeconomy seems clear. In sum, structural economic forces emanating from the Ukraine conflict appear to be adding upward pressure to costs.\n\nWhat it means for monetary policy\n\nThis all has serious implications for monetary policy. So let me close by saying a few words on this.\n\nAs you know, the FOMC releases its Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP, four times a year. One part of the release that receives considerable attention is the dot plot chart detailing how each member projects the appropriate path for the fed funds rate for the next several years. Late last year, I projected that the Committee would increase the federal funds rate three times in 2022.\n\nSince then, the challenging economic conditions we were confronting have only become more challenging and, as I've discussed today, more uncertain.\n\nThere is plenty we don't know, but let's look at what we do know. Obviously, the baseline for inflation has moved up significantly. My original outlook was that inflation would likely begin decelerating this spring. That almost certainly won't happen now. Let me say clearly that getting the high rates of inflation under control is the top concern for me for 2022. I could say a lot more about inflation here this morning, but I understand there is another speaker on the program with views on this whom you might be more interested in hearing from. I'll leave that space for him.\n\nIn the latest SEP, I penciled in six rate hikes for 2022 and two more for 2023. I recognize that I am toward the bottom of the distribution relative to my colleagues, but the elevated levels of uncertainty are front forward in my mind and have tempered my confidence that an extremely aggressive rate path is appropriate today. Events are shifting rapidly, and we could see marked changes along key dimensions, such as aggregate demand, that could warrant quickly adjusting the trajectory of policy.\n\nHere the risks go both ways. Should demand falter in the face of economic uncertainty or removal of monetary policy accommodation, then the appropriate path may be shallower than I currently project. But there are other developments, such as shifts in supply strategies, that could mean higher costs and thus motivate a steeper policy path than I expect.\n\nThis is one reason I and my team have adopted the phrase \"observe and adapt\" to characterize our approach to policymaking. We are observing closely and will adapt as appropriate. For instance, our research staff currently has surveys in the field—I would mention our Survey of Business Uncertainty as one notable example—to gauge how business leaders are thinking about pricing and production strategies and how they are managing amid compounding uncertainty. The real-time information we gather through these and other means will be critical in helping us position our policy to be maximally effective.\n\nLet me close with this. There is a lot of uncertainty in the economy and world today, but I want you to leave with one notion that is very certain. We at the Fed will do all in our power to meet our mandate and make sure that elevated inflation does not become entrenched in the economy for years to come. Thank you.",

            "content": "Good afternoon. I have long admired the important work the Peterson Institute does, so it's a pleasure and an honor to be with you.\n\nAnyone who doesn't want to live in interesting times showed up in the wrong century. The COVID pandemic is the second tectonic (major) economic shock in these first 20 years of the 21st century—I'm counting the Great Recession as the first—and it may ultimately prove to be the most profound economic shock in our lifetimes.\n\nOne critical economic element the pandemic has turned on its head is inflation. The elevated inflation dynamics we are experiencing today are very different from what they were in the months prior to the pandemic. Moreover, the durability of elevated inflation has become something of a contentious subject, and perhaps some of you have participated in some of these \"debates.\"\n\nToday, I will spend my time with you discussing this extraordinary inflationary environment of recent months and how I am thinking about policy amid that environment.\n\nBefore I go further, do keep in mind that these thoughts are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nTransitory is a dirty word\n\nYou'll notice I brought a prop to the lectern. It's a jar with the word \"transitory\" written on it. This has become a swear word to my staff and me over the past few months. Say \"transitory\" and you have to put a dollar in the jar.\n\nMy issue is not with the meaning of the word, but with using it to describe current inflation dynamics.\n\nThe first definition of that word in the online Merriam-Webster dictionary is \"of brief duration\" or \"temporary.\" Time is explicitly present in this definition, and I suspect most Americans think of \"transitory\" that way.\n\nHowever, the second definition, the one that many economists mean when they say that word, is \"tending to pass away\" or \"not persistent.\" This definition is more decoupled from the notion of time. And here is where the use of that word further confuses an already confounding time.\n\nThe phenomena economists and policymakers are trying to describe are wild price swings among a set of goods and services. These relative price changes resulted mainly from shifts in consumption—toward goods and away from services like travel and dining out—and supply chain disruptions that limited the availability of components such as semiconductors.\n\nInstead of that word, I think \"episodic\" better describes these pandemic-induced price swings. By episodic, I mean that these price changes are tied specifically to the presence of the pandemic and, once the pandemic is behind us, will eventually unwind, by themselves, without necessarily threatening longer-run price stability. In this sense, then, we might anticipate the prices of rental and used cars, lumber, and other demand-specific items to revert toward their prepandemic levels. Indeed, we have seen the beginnings of such reversions, which some could take as evidence that the use of that word is correct and fully appropriate.\n\nThat said, it is becoming increasingly clear that the feature of this episode that has animated price pressures—mainly the intense and widespread supply chain disruptions—will not be brief. Data from multiple sources point to these lasting longer than most initially thought. By this definition, then, the forces are not transitory.\n\nIn my view, we are better served by using a word that avoids this inherent conflict, especially when the more colloquial use of the word points to the wrong inference. So my team and I are not going to use that word anymore to describe these issues.\n\nThe great distortion and supply chain disruptions\n\nThe outsized influence of these episodic price swings creates at least two issues relevant to the inflation outlook.\n\nFirst, much like movements in gasoline prices, the dramatic price swings of the pandemic can cloud our reading of the current inflation trajectory.\n\nTake August's Consumer Price Index report (and we may get a similar report tomorrow). Core CPI inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, softened during the month, rising just 1.2 percent on an annualized basis. That was its smallest increase since February, and it has prompted some to conclude that inflation risks have begun to diminish.\n\nNot me. I believe evidence is mounting that price pressures have broadened beyond the handful of items most directly connected to supply chain issues or the reopening of the services sector. If we scrutinize that report, we see that three-quarters of the CPI consumer market basket rose at rates higher than 3 percent during August.\n\nThis growing inflationary pressure is echoed by the San Francisco Fed's personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price dispersion measures. One particularly striking statistic: in July, roughly half of the PCE market basket weighted by expenditure posted year-over-year growth rates that outpaced their trailing five-year averages by at least two standard deviations. For those who are not statisticians, that means we expect to see these types of growth rates rarely, in a stable inflation environment, that is.\n\nStill, one important takeaway is that a focus on aggregate core inflation misses the clear, and somewhat troubling, evidence of broadening price pressures. Further, this broad-based price pressure is seen in many alternative measures of underlying inflation, a topic I'll revisit in a moment.\n\nThe second issue and, in my view, the real danger, is that the longer the supply bottlenecks and attendant price pressures last, the more likely they will shape the expectations of consumers and businesspeople, shifting their views on pricing and wages in particular.\n\nInflation expectations among businesses and consumers, in fact, have risen this year. Short-run expectations are sharply higher; indeed, the Atlanta Fed's one-year ahead Business Inflation Expectations measure has hit the highest level in the survey's 10-year history.\n\nMore importantly, longer-run inflation expectations measures have climbed, with many reaching levels we haven't seen in about a decade.\n\nThese upside risks to the inflation outlook bear watching closely. Evidence from Atlanta Fed surveys and regional economic intelligence gathering programs suggests that many businesses anticipate supply chain challenges to linger into the middle of 2022.\n\nThe evidence further shows that many firms are already reacting to supply chain challenges in a more structural way. Rather than just waiting out the current supply and production problems, many executives are seeking new or redundant suppliers, changing their inventory systems from \"just in time\" to \"just in case,\" and taking other steps to insulate themselves from future disruptions of this magnitude. Undoubtedly, many of these efforts involve a tradeoff between efficient, lean production methods and costlier but less vulnerable configurations. But the key point is that we are seeing that some business leaders' expectations about the resilience of their business models have shifted, which introduces the risk that their expectations for other things could shift as well.\n\nThe tools for tracking inflation expectations have advanced\n\nWe have not seen this sort of broad-based and sudden surge in inflation readings since the Great Inflation of the 1970s. Now, before I go further, let me make it very clear that I think the conditions and risks today are quite different from that episode.\n\nBut this era is relevant for today's discussion because monetary policymakers learned a lot from it, and today we have better tools to understand inflation expectations.\n\nEconomists only began to appreciate the critical role of expectations in the late 1960s and early '70s. In those days, the best data came from a twice-a-year survey of economists, not actual price setters. The University of Michigan's survey of consumers' inflation expectations, as we know them today, didn't come along until the late 1970s.\n\nOn the business side, today we similarly have the Atlanta Fed's Business Inflation Expectations Survey. But I will emphasize that we're still learning. Indeed, our BIE survey is only 10 years old, and is just now beginning to yield enough data for us to identify meaningful historical patterns and wrestle with what they tell us.\n\nMy key takeaway for you here is that we at the Atlanta Fed and in the Federal Reserve System are intently monitoring data and anecdotal evidence to get an early sense of when trends along important dimensions are emerging. At my bank, we have a variety of surveys, metrics, tools, and intelligence gathered from price-setters across the Southeast to keep tabs on threats to underlying price stability.\n\nOne tool I'd like to highlight is our Underlying Inflation Dashboard. It is a collection of nine alternative price statistics that broaden our view—and hopefully the views of others—ensuring that we do not get too wedded to conclusions based on any one inflation metric. I encourage you to check it out on our website if you haven't already.\n\nI mention the dashboard because I'm going to use it here in a discussion of our monetary policy framework.\n\nWhat do we mean by \"average\" and \"some time\"?\n\nOne of the overarching themes in my time on the FOMC has been data dependence. This theme is top of mind, in part because the past decade taught us that preemptive, model-based actions may have prevented many potential workers from participating robustly in the economy.\n\nAnd it is through this lens that I view flexible average inflation targeting, whose acronym is FAIT and which I pronounce as \"fate.\"\n\nYou all know the FOMC's Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy commits us to achieving \"inflation that averages 2 percent over time.\" The statement continues that \"following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.\"\n\nThe Committee left \"average\" and \"some time\" loosely defined. In my opinion, it was appropriate to provide such a definition given that it would be unwise to lock the Committee into a rigid policy approach knowing that the economy will likely encounter volatile environments over time, such as the one we're living through.\n\nThat said, it is obviously important that we think hard and debate precisely how the Committee's metrics should be interpreted. One place to look to inform that debate would be the analytical work that preceded the policy framework discussions, particularly a working paper titled \"Alternative Strategies: How Do They Work? How Might They Help?\" by several Fed economists that explores several possible strategies for implementing a FAIT policy.\n\nThis paper and other work by economists within and outside the Fed indicate that windows ranging from four years to eight years can make sense. My staff ran the numbers for various scenarios through our Underlying Inflation Dashboard and got interesting results.\n\nLet's start on the long end. The table shows the eight-year annualized growth rate for the core PCE and CPI, trimmed-mean inflation statistics, the Atlanta Fed's Sticky Price CPI, and other measures tied to the cycle sensitivity of price changes. The two columns display the most recent data, August 2021, and averages calculated as of a year ago, August 2020. Each cell is color-coded to show how close it is to signaling price stability over that horizon. For each measure, green corresponds to being within a quarter percentage point of a reading consistent with core PCE inflation of 2 percent. Blue and yellow are 25 to 50 basis points below and above target, respectively, while red is more than 50 basis points above target and purple is 50 basis points below.\n\n\n\nAs of August 2021, all but one of the measures of underlying inflation we track were green (within 25 basis points of the 2 percent target) over an eight-year average. And core PCE inflation snuggled up to within 10 basis points of 2 percent over that horizon, up from 1.6 percent a year prior. Even by the eight-year standard, the longer of the relevant time windows, underlying inflation is close to averaging 2 percent.\n\nAt the shorter end of the proposed FAIT averaging window, four years, we see that indeed, we have met or exceeded the FAIT standards this year.\n\n\n\nIf you want to quibble with four- or eight-year windows, then let's split the difference. As you can see, we must draw the same conclusion whether we look at a four- or a six-year window.\n\n\n\nClosing in on the more recent time periods, two years, one year, six months, we can see more red. In essence, all these underlying inflation measures are pointing to growing, broad-based inflation essentially at or above our target.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe upshot, for me, is pretty obvious. If highly accommodative monetary policy is meant to correct past inflation shortfalls, then we have accomplished that mission.\n\nBut that conclusion then gives rise to another important question: what constitutes an overshoot of the 2 percent target? What is \"moderately above 2 percent\"?\n\nI'm not terribly worried if we are averaging 2.25 percent, even over a longer period, say a six-year window. As I've noted before, where I get concerned is if the trajectory of inflation is steep and appears likely to be persistent enough to risk unanchoring long-run inflation expectations.\n\nThe inflation outlook\n\nHowever we choose to analyze the data, I've seen enough to conclude that underlying inflation is indeed above the Committee's 2 percent objective. And upward price pressures are expanding beyond a handful of relative prices elevated by idiosyncratic forces.\n\nThe food services industry is illustrative of price and wage pressures. Inflation in the food away from home category shows signs of persistence, while employee compensation has climbed sharply as restaurant operators struggle to fill open positions. However, the category is representative of broader measures suggesting wages, while rising more briskly, are lagging prices.\n\nCertainly, it's too early to proclaim we are witnessing a wage-price spiral like the one that led to the Great Inflation. But conditions merit watching, and my staff and I are doing just that.\n\nTo wrap up, I continue to believe currently elevated inflation is episodic, driven by pandemic conditions such as disruptions in supply chains and labor markets. A major caveat, though, is that the severe and pervasive supply chain issues will probably last longer than most of us initially expected.\n\nUp to now, indicators do not suggest that long-run inflation expectations are dangerously untethered. But the episodic pressures could grind on long enough to unanchor expectations. We will be watching carefully.\n\nIn my view, then, the fate—not to be confused with FAIT—of price stability could be on the line in coming months. I think inflation is likely to remain above 2 percent going forward. How far forward I cannot say. But upside risks are salient. I believe the conditions I've described argue for a removal of the Committee's emergency monetary policy stance, starting with the reduction of monthly asset purchases, as we discussed in last month's meeting.\n\nThis is our first inflationary cycle under the FOMC's new policy framework. So it is clear to me there's value in communicating how we gauge progress toward our inflation goals and what we view as the appropriate inflation signal on which consumers, businesspeople and markets should focus.\n\nI hope I have shed light on my thinking along those dimensions today.",

            "content": "All three of these definitions make clear that setting a benchmark for successful attainment of maximum employment requires figuring out what that greatest quantity or largest number is.\n\nLet me share how I think about this.\n\nIn the short to medium term, the highest attainable quantity of employment is achieved when every American who wants a job can find one. This obviously can't be true at every moment in time. In a dynamic economy like ours in the United States, hundreds of thousands of jobs are created and lost every month.\n\nThe transition from one job to another can be due to the loss of employment, the shrinking or disappearing of businesses, or a voluntary move by a worker seeking a better opportunity. These transitions take time, so the unemployment rate will never be zero, even when the economy is running on all cylinders. But, in an economy that is performing optimally, spells of unemployment should be infrequent and short.\n\nThat is what you might call a day-to-day definition of maximum employment. There is also a longer-term definition. In the shorter run, opportunities tend to be constrained by a person's education or training, experience, the availability of jobs where they live, and so on. But over time, these things can change. In the longer run, maximum employment means everyone has the opportunity for gainful employment in work that is consistent with their full potential.\n\nNow, it is true that monetary policy has a limited set of tools for achieving the longer-term sense of maximum employment I just defined. \"Limited,\" though, does not mean zero. In pursuing our employment mandate in the shorter term, the FOMC has a crucial role to play in setting the conditions for maximum employment in the longer term.\n\nHowever, the Federal Reserve System has significant obligations beyond the work of the FOMC. That work includes supporting fair access to credit, for example. We also have responsibilities to monitor conditions in low- and moderate-income communities, to share information about how those conditions can be improved, and—within boundaries—to assist in community development. The notion that we should be striving to build an economy that works for everyone—in other words, one that fulfills that longer-term concept of maximum employment—is embedded in just about everything we do.\n\nThe Atlanta Fed's vision statement is \"To create a foundation upon which all individuals, communities, and businesses can thrive.\" In the context of this discussion, I'd like to focus you on the word \"all.\" In our work, from monetary policy to bank supervision to payments operations, we strive to support all individuals, all communities, and all businesses.\n\nI would note that our more colloquial tagline \"An economy that works for everyone\" expresses exactly the same sentiment. In short, this concept is part and parcel of who we at the Atlanta Fed are and what we do. It is our maximum employment north star.\n\nFor whom is the economy not working?\n\nDuring my time in Atlanta, we have worked hard to embed this principle in everything we do. This has required us to examine a basic question: for whom is the economy not working? Put another way, who is being held back from fully participating in the economy or being deprived of the opportunity to contribute to output and growth?\n\nIf we are truly going to make meaningful progress toward our maximum employment goal, the people and communities who are the answer to these questions need attention. Dismantling the barriers that prevent them from fully participating in our economy would be a giant step closer to an economy that works for everyone and closer to achieving maximum employment.\n\nGiven this, it is my view that identifying those barriers and highlighting solutions and approaches to overcoming them is very much in the Fed's interest. For me, this journey is more than just an academic exercise. As I'm sure is the case for you, a few moments stand out in my life that reoriented my sense of the world and how it works.\n\nLet me take you back about a quarter century and share a story that is seared in my memory. When I was a young economist at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., I served on a jury sitting in judgment of a young man charged with shooting three people. No one was killed, thankfully. There was little doubt the defendant was guilty. Yet something nagged at me as the trial proceeded. It became clear that the systems designed to create opportunity had failed this defendant from day one. During that trial, the jury learned the defendant could barely read or write. He had a poor employment history. He was living on the fringes.\n\nWhen he was found guilty and sentenced to 20 years in prison without parole, he apparently thought he had gotten off lightly. This young man obviously failed to understand the gravity of the situation.\n\nAs a research economist, I'm trained not to lean too heavily on anecdotes like this. But, for me, the case was emblematic of the way our entrenched structures have left too many of our fellow citizens behind.\n\nBe assured that my intention in sharing that story is not to gain sympathy for this individual. He committed a terrible offense. Rather, the point is you don't need to feel sorry for this man to grasp the greater reality that he was one more unfortunate case of someone who was not well-served by our society. He did not have the opportunities that many of us had to prepare ourselves for engaging in the economy, and that lack of opportunity likely contributed to the bad choices he made.\n\nAside from personal stories, we can also turn to economic statistics for clues as to who the economy is not working for. The job market is a sensible place to start.\n\nConsider the diverging employment experiences of Black and White men. U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data tell us that since 1972, the average monthly unemployment rate for Black men aged 20 years and older has been more than twice the rate among White men in the same age group. That's through strong labor markets and weak ones.\n\nThese gaps are simply too persistent and too wide to explain away as individual differences in motivation or innate skills or talent. No, these differences are the bitter fruit of flaws in the systems that underlie our employment market. The gaps reflect, in part, disparities in access to education, quality job training, jobs themselves, small business financing, and other engines of opportunity.\n\nThings were looking up a bit before the pandemic. Black workers had just begun making material headway in the labor market late in the recovery from the Great Recession. But the pandemic changed everything.\n\nOne of our Atlanta Fed economists, Julie Hotchkiss, has looked into this and found that the hit due to the pandemic significantly dented that progress. Her research also suggests that as a group, Black workers are unlikely to quickly make up that lost ground. Why is this? Julie and other researchers conclude that the lack of progress by Black workers over the several preceding decades is because racial disparities in employment have deep roots, particularly among men, indicating the disparities are more structural in nature than cyclical. In other words, they are not a knock-on effect of an economic cycle that lasts a few years but rather are entrenched in our economy.\n\nThese labor market disparities are more than data points and research fodder. They manifest in insidious ways that affect individuals and families.\n\nCensus Bureau data show the median Black household's income in 2019 was about 60 cents for every dollar of income for White non-Hispanic households. Hispanic households earned a median income of about 74 cents on the dollar for White non-Hispanic households. Especially troubling is that those ratios have changed little over the past 55 years.\n\nGiven those realities, it should not come as a surprise that the Federal Reserve Board of Governors 2019 Survey of Consumer Finances, the most recent one, found that the typical White family holds eight times the wealth of the typical Black family in America and five times the wealth of the typical Hispanic family.\n\nAs critical as those racial disparities are, I want to be clear that making the economy work for all is a mission that transcends race and ethnicity. Consider rural areas and smaller cities, whose prospects have been battered by structural economic shifts in recent decades.\n\nA colleague at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Jason Brown, lays out the case in a 2018 research paper. Over the past 50 years, the U.S. economy has transitioned away from producing goods to providing services. The share of gross domestic product from services has risen from 60 percent to 80 percent over roughly the past half century. This shift strongly favors more populated areas, because the service sector is increasingly fueled by knowledge, the exchange of ideas, and agglomeration—basically crowding together smart people and firms.\n\nThis is something we at the Atlanta Fed are quite familiar with. When I arrived at the Atlanta Fed in 2017, I was new to the Southeast. I made a point of visiting as many corners of our region as I could, especially places beyond the thriving Sunbelt metros like Nashville and Atlanta. What I discovered was a number of smaller cities and towns, such as Albany, Georgia, that had lost anchor employers, typically manufacturers, consistent with Brown's narrative. So when we talk about economic disparities and lack of opportunity, I now think not only of places \"out in the country,\" but also of such once-flourishing cities. As a sidebar, I would note that this reality also exists just a stone's throw from here. Jamestown, just down the road, is a classic example of this unfortunate dynamic.\n\nIt is perhaps not surprising that we find big disparities in economic outcomes between individuals living in metropolitan and rural areas.\n\nRural places have struggled with comparatively slower employment growth. In the decade before the pandemic, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service says rural counties added jobs at less than half the rate of metro counties in most years.\n\nParticipation in the labor force is essential for most people to achieve an adequate standard of living, whether they live in Manhattan or in Mayersville, Mississippi—population 665. Yet on average, fewer rural residents work or seek work compared to their metro counterparts. The causes for this discrepancy are not all fully understood. But lack of access to opportunity is at play, and our economists at the Atlanta Fed tell us that poor health is also a factor that inhibits working or looking for work.\n\nIt is especially troubling that labor force participation represents another area where the rural-metro disparity is worsening. Atlanta Fed researchers found that labor force participation among rural workers between 25 and 54 years old declined at two-and-a-half times the rate it fell among similar workers in metro areas between 2007 and 2021.\n\nMeanwhile, as our economy becomes increasingly dependent on online services, here, too, rural locales are at a disadvantage. Atlanta Fed staff hear countless stories of schoolkids gathering in restaurant parking lots to tap Wi-Fi networks.\n\nThe data support those anecdotes. While the rural-urban divide in broadband access has been narrowing in recent years, the Federal Communication Commission's most recent report shows that, by the end of 2019, approximately 17 percent of Americans in rural areas lacked broadband access, compared to only 1 percent of urban residents. And access is just one factor. Lack of broadband services is likely higher when we take affordability into account.\n\nGiven these conditions, it makes a certain sense that many rural areas have lost residents in recent years as an older population has fewer kids and younger people leave for better opportunity.\n\nOf course, another large group for whom the economy has not worked at full potential is women. To be sure, the labor market fortunes of women have improved over time. But even after controlling for the typical sources of wage differences, there is still a gender gap in earnings that persists.\n\nSome of this discrepancy is due to the disproportionate representation of women in lower-paying occupations such as childcare work, cleaning, and social services. Yet even within specific job categories, men still consistently get paid more.\n\nWhat's more, women appear to have fewer opportunities to climb career ladders. A guest speaker at a recent Fed webinar presented research from Opportunity@Work on labor market issues affecting workers with high school diplomas or GEDs. The research showed that within that population, women have less access to upwardly mobile pathways than men do, and as a result tend to make smaller advances in pay when they change careers.\n\nWe must keep working to narrow these gaps.\n\nI've described a range of disparities in economic outcomes. The COVID pandemic has exacerbated many of them, as the virus exploited existing weaknesses in our economy just as it exploited preexisting conditions in individual human bodies. Lower-skilled jobs and hence lower-wage workers, many of whom were in customer-facing jobs and working on site, were hit harder than those who could continue their work remotely as public health restrictions shut down parts of the economy that depend on people gathering. Those in precarious housing situations saw their housing instability worsen amid the abrupt economic disruption.\n\nWomen experienced much greater job loss than is normal during an economic downturn, in part because disproportionately more women have in-person service jobs. Other factors like school and childcare closures also forced more women to exit the workforce to care for children. As a result, this is the first time across the last four recessions when the decline in the employment-to-population ratio for women was as large as for men.\n\nThe pandemic also acted to widen preexisting racial gaps in employment, with a disproportionately larger decline in the employment-to-population ratio for Blacks relative to Whites.\n\nInterestingly, the pandemic had a relatively bigger impact on cities than rural communities because of a larger concentration of in-person service jobs in the cities. Nonetheless, the employment rate for rural areas has actually worsened in recent months while it has been steadily improving in urban areas.\n\nIt has become increasingly clear that disparities in income, wealth, employment, and access to opportunity constitute a structural limitation on the economic prospects of millions of Americans. That limitation in turn constrains maximum employment, which then limits the economic prospects of businesses, regional economies, and our national economy in terms of growth, innovation, and resilience.\n\nTherefore, we must engage more forcefully.\n\nWhat the Fed can do to battle economic disparities\n\nWe should be up front that concerns about bringing those on the economy's margins into its mainstream is not a diversion for Fed officials. Rather, a focus on broadening opportunity is mission-critical because it speaks directly to our mandate to pursue maximum employment.\n\nI'd now like to take some time to describe the work of the Atlanta Fed and the Federal Reserve more broadly that represents this kind of engagement. Let me start with monetary policy. Several years ago now, the Fed embarked on a review of its monetary policy framework and strategy.\n\nAs part of that review, we hosted a series of Fed Listens programs, where we heard from bankers, business leaders, and community leaders on their experiences with Fed policy and their perspectives on inflation and employment. What we heard loud and clear was that the Fed's long-standing approach of preemptively slowing growth to prevent the possibility that inflation might get out of control—even when there was no sign that this was imminent—was harming the employment prospects of precisely the groups for whom the economy hasn't worked as well.\n\nAt the same time, the past decade has seen perceived breaches of short-run maximum employment levels—which in theory should trigger runaway inflation—not actually lead to elevated levels of inflation. These two data points, coupled with work by our Julie Hotchkiss and others showing that workers and families on the margins benefit from a more vigorous labor market and longer economic expansions, led the FOMC to make a strategic shift in its approach to policy.\n\nThe short version of the story is that the Committee will no longer preemptively raise interest rates in response to a \"hot\" labor market because of fear that inflation will eventually be a result. Without actual data demonstrating that an inflationary problem has arrived and is likely to be sustained, we will allow labor markets to run their course, which I believe can contribute to making progress towards our long-run maximum employment goals.\n\nMonetary policy is not the Fed's only tool to help make the economy work for everyone. We are pursuing this objective on a variety of fronts: we advise, we do research, we convene, we promote and lift up what works, and we have a regulatory function that fits into this. I'm not going to give you a full laundry list of Atlanta Fed programs—we do quite a bit—but I will give you a sense of how we can make a difference in this area, on the ground in our communities.\n\nLet me start with a story about our role as adviser to organizations doing grassroots work to advance economic mobility. We do this advisory work because in many instances, the Federal Reserve is not legally structured nor practically set up to directly carry out programs that can help the economy work better for all. So, we advise those who are positioned to do the frontline work.\n\nA few years ago, we launched a project designed to cushion the blow of benefits cliffs that undercut millions of low-wage workers who try to gain new skills and thus earn more money. We call this initiative Advancing Careers for Low-Income Families.\n\nLet me provide a little background on benefits cliffs. A lot of public benefits programs like childcare assistance have an income-eligibility threshold, meaning increases in income above the threshold result in a loss of benefits on a dollar-for-dollar basis. This becomes a \"cliff\" when a person is on multiple sources of assistance because each new dollar earned can trigger a multiple-dollar loss in benefits. Earn an extra dollar an hour, lose $1 from each source of assistance. The $1 in extra earnings results in a loss of $2, $3, $4 in benefits.\n\nBenefits cliffs have long been recognized to create financial disincentives for low-income workers to earn more income. The Atlanta Fed's unique contribution is a new methodology to study benefits cliffs in the context of career advancement, so that policymakers can improve incentives and workers can better their lives.\n\nOur Advancing Careers team has forged partnerships with dozens of outside entities ranging from state workforce agencies to nonprofits to community colleges.\n\nFor example, last fall we initiated a partnership with the state of Alabama to create a user-friendly \"dashboard\" to map benefits cliffs and paths to self-sufficiency for in-demand occupations and industries in counties across the state. This dashboard allows users to determine a \"Self-Sufficiency Target,\" a level of take-home pay that will allow a person to cover basic expenses without relying on public assistance. This target can help Alabamians as they consider which work investments or options to pursue.\n\nNow let me quickly describe one example of research we conduct that advances the cause of making the economy work for everyone. An Atlanta Fed economist named Kris Gerardi and a group of coauthors found that when mortgage rates decline, White homeowners are far more likely to refinance than Black homeowners. That means Black homeowners with mortgages insured by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac as a group pay higher interest rates than non-Hispanic White borrowers, after controlling for standard underwriting factors.\n\nBy shedding light on this gap in refinancing, we hope to help lenders, financial education practitioners, Black mortgage borrowers, and groups such as churches work toward solutions that help Black home owners build equity and wealth as quickly as similarly positioned White home owners.\n\nAnother arrow in our quiver is the power to convene. We have long assembled people to discuss economic issues and solutions to pressing challenges.\n\nI want to highlight a recent \"convening\" that is particularly relevant to our subject today. Some of you may be familiar with the Racism and the Economy series of webinars the Atlanta Fed has sponsored alongside the 11 other regional Federal Reserve Banks. In these sessions, eminent scholars, business executives, and community leaders candidly discuss the ways structural racism has plagued our economy.\n\nIf you haven't seen any of those webinars, I encourage you to take a look on our website, and we have additional sessions coming up. I have learned a great deal and have a much better sense of the history of discrimination and how it is woven through our economic systems and institutions.\n\nFor instance, the U.S. residential real estate industry historically was infused with racist practices and policies. In the aftermath of World War II, for example, the GI Bill helped millions of returning veterans to buy affordable homes. These houses in places like the Levittown suburban housing developments escalated in value to become a cornerstone of a burgeoning middle class in America.\n\nBut while the bill guaranteed low-interest mortgages, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) did not administer these mortgages, so they were instead left to financial institutions, some of which engaged in redlining and other exclusionary practices. As an example, in 1947, only two of the more than 3,200 VA-guaranteed home loans in 13 Mississippi cities went to Black borrowers. The GI Bill's approach to implementation blocked African American veterans from this path to affordable home ownership and, in turn, from the seeds of intergenerational wealth.\n\n\n\nThe Racism and the Economy series brings attention to parts of our history that many do not know, shows how that history has implications today, and provides a venue for experts to propose remedies. Some solutions are as simple as changing hiring practices so that jobs that do not truly require a college degree don't ask that applicants have one.\n\nWe can't change the job application forms at every firm, but the Atlanta Fed can promote what works. For example, we know that an understanding of which skills are in demand now—and which ones will be in the future—helps workers find better-paying jobs, keep good jobs, and advance their careers even without a college degree.\n\nOne of our newer partnerships, the Rework America Alliance, aims to do just that. This partnership is establishing programs in select areas to help workers identify and connect with good jobs. This effort has the added benefit of helping employers find workers, which as you might have heard is particularly important right now.\n\nIn forming the alliance, the Atlanta Fed joined the Markle Foundation and a host of other organizations to identify ready pathways for workers to upgrade skills and stay employed as automation and other forces disrupt the labor market.\n\nOne of the keys to the local Rework programs is that they are grounded in up-to-date, localized information about the skills employers need. This local element is important. Training in skills that are in demand in New York City might not help workers in the Finger Lakes region, where the Alliance is partnering with local organizations to deploy tools and resources to job seekers.\n\nFinally, let me touch on our work in the regulatory arena. Right now, the Fed is collaborating with other financial regulatory agencies to update a critical tool to ensure financial institutions serve their entire communities, particularly low- to moderate-income and minority neighborhoods that have faced a history of disinvestment and discrimination in lending. This is the Community Reinvestment Act, and it has not been substantially reformed in about 25 years, while the way banking is done has obviously changed a great deal.\n\nThe CRA provides for critical access to mortgages, small business loans, and other funding to ensure that these neighborhoods can build economic sustainability. A few years ago, I wrote a paper with coauthors at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and Harvard University describing a study that finds new evidence that the CRA promotes small business lending by banks in lower-income neighborhoods. Other studies have found similar stimulative effects in lower-income neighborhoods associated with the CRA in other areas, like mortgage lending.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is working with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to strengthen and modernize regulations that implement the CRA. This may sound a little arcane, but I assure you that the CRA may well be the Fed's most important means of promoting equal access to credit.\n\nThat was a small sampling of the multipronged work that the Federal Reserve and specifically the Atlanta Fed are undertaking. I invite you to go to our website to learn more.\n\nWhat can you do?\n\nUp to now, I have been very inward looking, in the sense of talking about our work. For the last portion of my talk, I'd like to bring you into the story. And just so you know, I'll be putting on my professorial hat to give you some homework.\n\nI strongly believe that we will make more and faster progress toward an economy that works for everyone if more hands are involved in the effort. So, I'm going to challenge you to consider how you might help the Fed achieve its maximum employment mandate.\n\nFirst, know that what you do, what each of us does, matters. Too often, people figure these problems are so big that if they can't roll out a sprawling solution, they should give up. This is not right. Let me give you an example of a one-person, seemingly small-bore action at the Atlanta Fed that is making an impact.\n\nAn individual at our bank—not a high-level executive—took the initiative to set up an internship with a local school in an underserved community. Whitney, the employee, did the research, identified the school, and even figured out the funding. We implemented it, and it is making a real difference in the lives of young people who had little connection to the Atlanta Fed and its networks.\n\nSecond, reach out to someone who might need help. Sometimes just not knowing something can hold you back. Personal story: when I was in high school, I knew about the SAT and how important it was for getting into college. But I had no clue about the PSAT, and that it was particularly important for earning scholarships. My neighbor told my mother about it, I signed up, took the test, did well—and I got a scholarship.\n\nLearning about opportunities and knowing the general rules of the game can help someone immensely. Studies tell us that low-income high school students and rural students face these kinds of information gaps that often keep them from applying for scholarships and from admittance to more selective colleges.\n\nIn the same vein, seek out opportunities to share your professional knowledge. Mentors can be enormously influential, in any field. When I was starting out as an economist, I had a mentor who made sure I knew about upcoming conferences and other events that could be critical for my career. You don't need to be a PhD economist. Anyone can do this. The simple act of sharing what you know can help others.\n\nFinally, many of you in the audience today are leaders of institutions and organizations, and I urge you to examine your practices. Make sure they are not creating undue stress for certain groups in your organizations. At the Atlanta Fed, for example, we found that our old reimbursement policy of repaying expenses after the fact was financially burdensome for some of our workers. So now we provide advances or get billed directly instead.\n\nThese are just a few of my experiences, but I'm confident that each of you can create your own experiences with similar ends. Everyone has the opportunity to be a difference maker to others.\n\nIt will take a sustained effort\n\nI'd like to make a few points in closing. First, it took us many decades to reach this point in terms of economic inequality. It will take a sustained effort on the part of many players to achieve real progress.\n\nLet me also say straightaway that many of the ideas and solutions we at the Federal Reserve formulate and elevate through research and convenings are beyond our authority and mandate. Others will have to act if these solutions are to advance. Still, we can contribute knowledge and resources in important ways, and we will continue to do so.\n\nThird, if you think it is burdensome to provide better workforce development, craft policies to dismantle benefits cliffs, or the like, the social and financial costs of sitting still are substantial and in some cases much higher.\n\nWe can make this economy work for everybody. We must achieve an inclusive recovery from the COVID downturn, first, and broader prosperity going forward to keep on the path toward that more perfect union. Please join us in this effort.\n\nThank you. Now I'm happy to take questions.",

            "content": "\n\nJacksonville University Davis College of Business Commencement\n\n\n\nMay 8, 2021\n\nThank you for inviting me. It's refreshing to speak with you in person. This is my first face-to-face public appearance in more than a year, and I think it's appropriate that it's at a university. I was a professor for more than 15 years and I'm an academic at heart, so I feel very comfortable talking to students and faculty. I'm feeling very at home.\n\nI'm especially happy to be here for your graduation. Graduation days are my favorite times on campus. It's the only day of the year when everyone—students, parents, and family members, and professors and instructors—is happy. Homework and deadlines, tests and grades, office hours, rushing to class because traffic was awful/the alarm didn't go off—none of that matters today because you're graduating! Everyone should be pleased to have made it and hopeful about the future, even more so in a year like this.\n\nSo I was excited when President Cost invited me to speak because this is as friendly a crowd as I'll ever see, and I am excited to address a group with so much potential.\n\nIn addition to giving my thanks to President Cost for the invitation, and for chairing the board of directors of our branch here in Jacksonville, I'd like to recognize a few other special guests: our Jacksonville regional executive, Chris Oakley, Dean Barbara Ritter, Provost Christine Sapienza, and members of the board of trustees who are here.\n\nI also need to thank Tim for expanding the Jeopardy categories I never figured to claim: first African American regional Fed president, first openly gay Fed president and—as far as we know—the first speaker to address not one but two graduating classes at once at Jacksonville University.\n\nWithout question, you are graduating in interesting times, perhaps more interesting than any of us would prefer. I salute you for the perseverance and resilience you've shown. So, a hearty congratulations to the class of 2021, a belated congratulations to the class of 2020, and props to the university's leadership for reaching this point. You've all more than earned it!\n\nIn our time today, I want to share some advice on how best to use the determination and passion you've shown by graduating to take on the world beyond this campus—how enduring these extraordinary past 14 months has prepared you to handle whatever challenges come your way; how bringing the right attitude to everything you do will serve you well; and finally, how bringing your whole self to every endeavor will strengthen the people around you and the organizations and communities you are members of.\n\nFirst, I'll let you in on something that may not be a startling revelation, but your career and life probably won't turn out how you envision it sitting here today. That's OK. You can handle the unexpected. You've already had to demonstrate remarkable adaptability and resilience simply to get here.\n\nFor me, I learned to adapt early in college. I started as a chemical engineering major. But that interest didn't survive one of my first chemistry classes, where we were studying chemical reactions. Here's a thumbnail sketch of what happened: extra credit offer if you can identify the unknown substance, classmate puts a few drops of said substance in a sink, match is added, flames burst from the sink... right next to me.\n\nIt was right about then that I decided chemical engineering was not in my future. And so my career plans shifted dramatically. I ended up studying psychology and economics, so I didn't even follow a straight line academically.\n\nThis story reveals a basic truth: there will be times when you think you're moving forward, then something blows up in your face and stops you in your tracks—sometimes it's a small explosion and you keep going, sometimes it's a big one and you're blown onto a different course.\n\nBut as members of the classes of 2020 and 2021, you have already shown that this truth is not determinative. You can change course in extraordinary times. I suspect none of you graduates planned on living through a global pandemic and the most abrupt economic downturn of our lifetime. None of us did. Yet you've made it.\n\nYou should be incredibly proud of that and never forget that you have already marshaled the fortitude to tackle ridiculous adversity head on, and not only survive but thrive.\n\nWe've all had to reset our lives and expectations over the past year. At the Atlanta Fed, most of our 1,700 employees shifted to working from home, while our essential staff continued their in-person work with new procedures and, of course, face masks, temperature checks, and lots of hand sanitizer.\n\nThe case of our staff members brings home the important reality that we have all experienced the same pandemic but in different ways. Some of you, I'm sure, have lost loved ones and friends to COVID. No doubt many of you have lost jobs and adapted to home lives that were upended in early 2020.\n\nPersonally, I have been home a lot more, and my sister and her young kids came from overseas to stay with my husband and me for most of the pandemic. There have been real blessings, to be sure. My niece and nephew, who turn 6 in July, taught me a lot—how to navigate new games (I now know a lot about the pig game), how to approach new circumstances with curiosity, and how to make the best of any situation. I think it helps to have some little kid in us, no matter how old or serious we think we are.\n\nThat attitude of making the most of every situation is the second thing I hope you'll remember from my talk.\n\nIf you would have told my 18-year old self, fleeing chemical fires in a lab, that I would be president of a Federal Reserve Bank one day, I would have assumed you had ingested too many chemicals. The idea seemed farfetched even 18 months before I got the job.\n\nI want to share this with you, though, because often times we assume successful people travel a smooth path. But I know for a fact I was not the first choice for at least two jobs in my career—at HUD and at USC. In fact, I wasn't even the second choice for those jobs.\n\nBut once I was in the position, that didn't matter. What mattered was that I gave it my all. I could have gone in with a chip on my shoulder and a bad attitude knowing I wasn't the first choice, but instead I set out to be so good that they couldn't imagine anyone else there. Actually, maybe I did have a chip on my shoulder, but one that was constructive and pushed me to excel.\n\nThere is no doubt that some opportunities will feel scary. They will be different and unexpected. Some chances will be big, some small, but as you move through your career, be open to all of them. If something makes you nervous, that means you are challenging yourself to be better. And you all have already proved you are up for any challenge.\n\nEmbrace that nervousness and find ways to succeed in spite of it. In some cases, like job interviews and public speaking, it never goes away. I still get nervous every time I speak publicly like this. The key is to recognize those fears and view each situation as an opportunity to learn and nurture new skills.\n\nJust as Jacksonville University has provided you the tools to succeed, the experiences ahead will present opportunities to continue learning. Stay curious and interested in everything around you.\n\nAnd that brings me to the third message I wanted to share: Be yourself. Bring your WHOLE self to everything you do.\n\nOne of the reasons I am president of a Federal Reserve Bank today is because I did just that. When I interviewed for this job, I thought I had no shot. They were looking for someone with CEO experience, and I had none. So, when I got a second interview, I felt like I had nothing to lose. And that interview was freewheeling, engaging, and honest. It was probably the best interview I've ever given.\n\nBe true to yourself and your beliefs. Authenticity is essential not only to ensure you are fulfilled in your work, but also to improve the lives of people around you. I've seen many times over that a diversity of views enriches our organizations and communities. And you add to this diversity. Never forget that the sum of your life experience is yours alone. Yours is the only perspective informed by this. Diversity includes everyone; it excludes no one.\n\nBesides the pandemic, in the past year, we as a nation have had a very real dialogue about race and the roles institutions play in perpetuating racist policies. Amid the turmoil of last summer, I published an essay with my thoughts about what we were witnessing, which brought new attention to the issue and to the Federal Reserve.\n\nAs the first Black president of a regional Federal Reserve Bank, my experiences were and are different from my colleagues. And it's not just race. Each and every encounter and interaction we have shapes who we are as people and the perspective we can bring to the table.\n\nSo, bring your unique point of view to everything you do. Ask why things have always been done a certain way. Suggest ideas, and speak up for yourself and others.\n\nThe past year-plus has clarified that on the flip side of every challenge is opportunity. Make the most of it.",

            "content": "Thank you for inviting me to keynote this important conference. The agenda is packed with timely, stimulating material that reminds me of the numerous parallel interests of our agencies.\n\nThe CFPB is housed in the Federal Reserve structure but, of course, operates independently. More importantly, we share a core mission: to expand opportunity, to make this \"Everyone's Economy,\" in our parlance, and to achieve better outcomes for all in the financial marketplace in yours. Indeed, we used to do some of the consumer affairs supervision that is now within the purview of the CFPB.\n\nOn a personal note, I was a charter member of the CFPB's Academic Research Council, so I've considered the congruencies in our agencies' objectives before now.\n\nObviously, our organizations are fundamentally different in important respects. The Fed pursues monetary policy and supervises financial institutions, while the bureau focuses on safeguarding financial products and services for consumers.\n\nNonetheless, our shared pursuit of economic inclusion and our mutual efforts to empower consumers offer myriad opportunities for collaboration. So, today I will detail why researchers studying issues that fall under the aegis of the CFPB, like financial and economic inclusion, should view the Federal Reserve broadly and the Atlanta Fed in particular as potential partners. Our combined perspectives can yield rich results that neither would be likely to produce separately.\n\nI will recap our experience with existing research partnerships and describe a sampling of our work that I hope illuminates issues and topics our organizations can explore together. You will see that much of that work fits squarely within the framework of the challenges this conference will address. I'll close my remarks with some words on why we are focused on economic inclusion.\n\nBefore I get to that, though, let me be clear that I am speaking only for myself. My colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee and at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta may not share my views.\n\nThe Atlanta Fed forms partnerships\n\nSo let me start with the subject of partnerships. We at the Atlanta Fed have a long history of engaging in partnerships, and have forged relationships with nonprofits, universities, our sister Reserve Banks, private firms, and research centers of various stripes.\n\nSome are about collecting information that informs our understanding of how markets work. These include the Survey of Business Uncertainty, a monthly survey of a nationally representative panel of businesses done with professors at the University of Chicago and Stanford, and the quarterly CFO Survey, which asks business leaders to offer their economic and financial outlooks. We partner with the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond and Duke's Fuqua School of Business to deliver the CFO Survey.\n\nAnother set of partnerships we engage in involves community-based work that seeks to translate knowledge gained through research and experience into actual on-the-ground policies and practices that improve outcomes. I'm particularly excited about one of our newest of this type of partnership, which is focused on workforce development.\n\nIt's called the Rework America Alliance. Along with the Markle Foundation and a host of corporations, nonprofits, and other organizations, we have set out to harmonize the nation's sprawling but disjointed workforce development system. The alliance's purpose reflects the fundamental aim of our economic mobility and resilience agenda more broadly: to minimize the number of people left behind as the economy evolves.\n\nRework America aims to unite nonprofits, government, and private-sector firms in creating ready pathways for workers to upgrade skills and stay employed as automation and other forces disrupt the labor market\n\nWe have deliberately chosen to not go it alone in these efforts. Rather, we sought partnerships because we recognized that working closely with others allows us to leverage our collective expertise and produce richer, more nuanced, and, ultimately, higher quality results, which in turn leads to higher quality policy.\n\nA call to collaborate\n\nSo in that spirit, I invite you to join us in the research enterprise. Looking over the agenda for the conference, I see many opportunities for us to find common ground across almost every panel.\n\nTake the panel on responses to COVID-19 that just finished. Very early in the pandemic, staff across the Federal Reserve System quickly developed a survey to document the pandemic's impact on low- to middle-income, or LMI, communities. The results of this survey revealed a stark difference in how the public health crisis affected these communities as compared with other, more affluent areas. While our survey focused on institutions rather than consumers, the results provided insights as to how consumers are responding. For example, in our October survey, 64 percent of nonprofit organizations reported that the demand for their services had increased since August. Even more worrisome, 37 percent reported a corresponding decrease in their ability to provide those services.\n\nBesides this survey, the researchers in our Community and Economic Development team (CED) that led that work pursued an array of other pandemic projects, including briefings on childcare policy and its impact on the workforce, and a series of webinars, reports, and resource guides for small businesses with an emphasis on owners of color.\n\nWe also joined the Boston Fed and the Stanford Center on Poverty and Inequality in the American Voices Project to track trends during several concurrent crises: the COVID-19 pandemic, the ensuing economic downturn, and the protest movement that has intensified in response to systemic racism. One product of the Voices Project is a report about how a split between in-person and remote workers created unequal risk and therefore could have exacerbated inequality and created tension between frontline and remote workers. Instead, the interviews with frontline workers generally revealed stoicism, fortitude, and even acceptance of class inequalities and disproportionate risks.\n\nIn more COVID-related research, another of our economists, Brent Meyer, and his coauthors employed the Survey of Business Uncertainty I mentioned earlier to track and quantitatively assess a reallocation of sales and labor across economic sectors brought about by the pandemic.\n\nFinally, some of our bank's COVID-related work touches on mortgage refinance, forbearance, and household consumption responses. On this front, I will call out work by our own Kris Gerardi. You will hear from one of his coauthors later today about their paper on racial differences in refinancing behavior. Kris and his coauthors have other work focusing on refinancing, defaults, and forbearance during the pandemic period. A bit of good news here is they find there are reasons to believe we probably will not suffer another foreclosure crisis even after forbearance policies and foreclosure moratoriums are lifted.\n\nThe first session tomorrow focuses on borrowing and spending among the economically vulnerable, and we have numerous initiatives focused on attacking the stressors that confront people in precarious financial straits.\n\nNotably, our Advancing Careers for Low-Income Families project tackles benefits cliffs. Benefits cliffs have long been recognized to create financial disincentives for low-income workers to earn more income. But we think we are making a unique contribution using a new methodology to study benefits cliffs in the context of career advancement.\n\nAs you know, many public assistance programs have an incentive structure that involves an income-eligibility threshold, such that increases in income above the threshold result in a loss of benefits on a dollar-for-dollar basis. This becomes a cliff when a person is on multiple sources of assistance because each dollar gained can be associated with a multiple-dollar loss in benefits.\n\nThis is clearly a disincentive for people participating in assistance programs. As our research director, Dave Altig, puts it, the incentive to earn an additional dollar is worse for those in the lowest wealth quintile than for everyone else. Consequently, high effective marginal tax rates, which can exceed 70 percent for low-wealth households, discourage some workers from investing in their own human capital and thus advancing from lower-wage work to jobs that lead to economic self-sufficiency.\n\nThis happens all too frequently to the millions of families receiving public benefits. And the cliffs disproportionately burden Black and Hispanic families. So, we're developing tools forged from evidence-based research to support community and state efforts to dismantle benefits cliffs, strengthen families' economic security, and meet the talent needs of employers.\n\nI also thought of our work when I saw this conference included a liquidity, wealth, and housing panel. Here we have a number of tools created by staff from various departments that offer insights on trends in housing and other markets. As one example, we maintain a gauge to monitor affordability trends in rental housing across our southeastern district. We also developed an eviction tracker that for now covers the Atlanta region. We hope to expand its geographic scope.\n\nOn the wealth side, Ann Carpenter, one of the leaders of our CED team, has collaborated over several years with academics and nonprofits to study how unequal access to legal and financial services can produce negative outcomes, including contract-for-deed arrangements and heirs' property resolution. Those predicaments have stripped real estate wealth from generations of families, particularly African American families.\n\nAnd, of course, there is access to credit, which is the subject of the conference's final panel. This is the area where I cut my teeth as a young economist, and substantial issues remain. Perhaps the Fed's most significant tool for promoting equal access to credit is the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), which charges us with ensuring that banking institutions serve their entire service area, including LMI communities.\n\nThe Federal Reserve recently solicited comments on a proposed update of the CRA and is reviewing the ample feedback to determine how best to modernize the CRA's regulatory framework to reflect today's banking and lending practices. Much research has found the \"old\" CRA to be effective, and I'm hopeful the new CRA will even surpass that. If you have thoughts on ways the CRA can be more helpful, please do not hesitate to pass them on to someone in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nMuch of the work focused on access to credit looks at differences in the experiences of people of different races. On this point, I would like to make sure you are aware of a series of webinars the Federal Reserve System launched in 2020 called Racism and the Economy. Each session focuses on one area where structural racism is limiting economic outcomes and economic potential and facilitates dialogue about potential solutions to overcome these barriers. We bring together academics, advocates, practitioners, elected officials, and private-sector leaders for new conversations about these old issues. To date, we've held sessions on housing, education, the labor market, and the economics profession itself. I think the sessions have been fantastic.\n\nIt's been particularly gratifying, and I think productive, that the external speakers have not held back because we are the Fed. Rather, they've been quite blunt in their views about the root causes and effects of racism that in some cases is not overt or intentional but nonetheless has calcified over decades in our institutional structures. Bond markets and housing are but a couple of examples.\n\nAll of the sessions are available on YouTube, so please take a look. I think you'll find the one on the economics profession particularly interesting. I would also encourage you to subscribe to our mailing list and attend future sessions. The series will extend at least through the end of this year.\n\nWhen I think about access to credit, because of my background, my mind quickly gravitates toward issues facing the economically vulnerable. And this brings me to the last opportunity for collaboration that I will talk about.\n\nPromoting safer payments innovation and financial inclusion\n\nAs many of you know, the Federal Reserve System has significant responsibilities in payments. The Atlanta Fed houses the Fed's Retail Payments Office, one of the nation's core payments operations. In addition to operating payments processing infrastructure, the Fed is charged with keeping the nation's payment systems secure, reliable, and efficient.\n\nTo that end, a couple years ago, the Atlanta Fed made ensuring safer payments innovation a strategic priority. From there, we began exploring the financial inclusion implications of advances in payments technology.\n\nThey cut different ways. They clearly can democratize access to services. But, when stores or entertainment venues go cashless, they effectively exclude the 5 million American households with limited access to banking services, who are among the least economically mobile and resilient households.\n\nOur work on safer payments innovation organically led to a related initiative to encourage inclusive innovation—that is, working to ensure equitable access to new, more convenient payments services without discouraging that very innovation.\n\nTo advance this cause, our Atlanta Fed team formed what we are calling the Special Committee on Payments Inclusion. This is yet another collaboration involving payments industry participants and researchers. The committee will work over the next two years to formulate policy recommendations to help chart a path toward inclusive innovation.\n\nWe had our first meeting this week, and what emerged was a clear recognition that there are important unanswered questions. For example, what are the features of credit, debit, and electronic payment methods that lead some people to turn almost exclusively to cash? Is it transaction costs, privacy concerns, the complexity of products, lack of awareness, all of the above? Without knowing this, it will be impossible to design strategies that move the dial. This is where you might come in, as we will need research that can help us understand which frictions are most important.\n\nOne reason I'm excited about this is that we've done it before. A similar work group in the early 1970s led to the creation of the Automated Clearing House, which became and remains a linchpin of the nation's payments system. The Federal Reserve was part of those early discussions and offered to provide the computer systems to process and settle the ACH items between banks. (In 2020, the Fed processed $123 billion in ACH payments a day, on average.)\n\nAn inclusive economy is a strong economy\n\nNow that I've talked your ear off about the broad range of research at the Atlanta Fed, I thought I'd close by telling you why we are active in so many fields. As you well know, the forces shaping the macroeconomy encompass far more than just financial markets. If we are to make good policy, we must recognize and understand those other forces. Our concept of the Fed's dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability must include everyone who participates in the macroeconomy. Broad opportunity fosters a more stable economy and more effective monetary policy in achieving our dual mandate.\n\nI want to stress that this emphasis, which I sometimes refer to as an economic inclusion agenda, is not some vanity project. In addition to its inherent worth in lifting up our fellow citizens, what we learn there animates my thinking about monetary policy. Bringing people off the economy's sidelines and into the labor market could allow us to reconceive the maximum employment half of our dual mandate, for the betterment of those precariously attached to the labor market, and for us all.\n\nYou all follow the literature, so you understand researchers from the Fed, academia, and the private sector are building a persuasive and practical case that a more inclusive economy is indeed a more prosperous economy.\n\nCouple of quick examples: According to a study funded by JPMorgan Chase & Co., eliminating longstanding racial inequities in income could boost U.S. economic output by $2.3 trillion a year. Our colleagues at the San Francisco Fed produced a paper for the Racism and the Economy webinar series suggesting that racial and gender disparities in opportunity robbed the nation's economy of $2.9 trillion in potential output in 2019 alone, in 2019 dollars.\n\nEconomic inclusion, I firmly believe, is among the defining economic issues of our time. We have a chance to make fundamental change and progress, but progress will be hard won.\n\nYour research can help speed the pace of this change and progress. I strongly encourage you to look to us in the Federal Reserve System as potential partners as you advance your research agendas. Visit our website and other Fed sites and scrutinize the research. Explore the many data sets that we produce and maintain. As an aside, the Fed's 2020 Survey of Consumer Payment Choice and 2020 Diary of Consumer Payment Choice, both helmed by the Atlanta Fed, will be published this month, adding to the data you'll find. Read about our people and reach out to those you might be interested in building relationships with. They will be glad to hear from you.\n\nThank you for your time and attention. I look forward to the conversation to come and to future partnerships.",

            "highlights": "Atlanta Fed president Raphael Bostic speaks to the Economic Club of New York on the need to take a broader view of inflation and employment and how racial equity in the economy works for everyone.",
            "content": "Thank you for inviting me. It's a pleasure to be here, and a bit daunting, too. I took a look at your program roster, and you've hosted many luminaries. I'm flattered to be among them. I hope I don't disappoint you.\n\nToday I'll explore a couple of ideas I trust you'll find timely. First, I'll explain why I believe we should broaden our gauges of inflation and full employment, the components of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate.\n\nThen I will discuss racial equity in the economy. Specifically, I want to say a bit about the essential task of convincing the public and policymakers that inclusive economic growth is not a zero-sum proposition. Greater opportunity for historically disadvantaged Americans produces not less opportunity and prosperity for everyone else, but more.\n\nBefore I get to the substance of my remarks, though, let me remind you that these thoughts are mine alone. They do not necessarily reflect the views of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee or at the Atlanta Fed.\n\nTaking a broader view of inflation\n\nSo let's start with inflation.\n\nI know you're all familiar with the prepandemic narrative: inflation was stuck below our 2 percent objective as measured by the committee's preferred metric, the personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, price index.\n\nThat narrative is correct as far as it goes. But in my view, it reflects an overly narrow view of inflation by relying largely on a single reading as fully representing the de facto underlying inflation trend.\n\nDivining the real inflation signal is difficult enough in any circumstance, and more so since the pandemic upended consumer behavior and sent relative prices careening every which way. So, we should take note of a range of measures to gain the broadest possible understanding of underlying inflation.\n\nTraditionally, the core PCE price index has been used to cut through some of the noise in the headline index to clarify the underlying inflation trend. But I think one of the central flaws of the core concept is that dramatic price swings outside of food and energy—the items excluded from the core measure—often lead to large and sometimes lasting changes in core PCE inflation that are unconnected to our price stability mandate.\n\nIn recent years, we've seen several relative price declines that did not provide meaningful signals regarding inflation that could be used to guide thinking about the stance of policy. Instead, these declines flowed from technicalities like changes in the methodology used to calculate inflation.\n\nRecall the cell phone carriers offering unlimited data packages in 2017. That torpedoed year-over-year core PCE inflation, though it revealed little about where monetary policy should be.\n\nI'm a housing guy, so let me dive into that topic for a moment as a way to further illustrate why measuring broad inflation is so complicated and, particularly to laypeople, serves up often unsatisfying conclusions.\n\nConsider the Consumer Price Index (CPI), one of the familiar measures I follow to help identify inflation trends. One of the most important components of the Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS) inflation basket is owners' equivalent rent (OER) of primary residence. OER accounts for nearly a quarter of the overall CPI index. And as you can see in this slide, housing prices have soared, while OER has stayed pretty flat or even declined.\n\nThe rub here is that the BLS treats home purchases as investments not consumption. To measure prices of goods and services intended for consumption, OER attempts to abstract from the asset value of a house and focus on the value of living in a house by approximating what homeowners would pay were they renting. That value, or service flow, of living in a house changes only gradually from year to year.\n\nFurther contributing to the disconnect between house price inflation and OER inflation during the pandemic are the extraordinary housing policy actions that have been taken. While they protect households that have disproportionately lost jobs and income, eviction moratoriums and rent freezes are weighing on prevailing rental prices. This in turns puts downward pressure on OER because it is imputed from observed rental rates.\n\nIn both of these cases, an exclusive focus on a single measure of inflation could lead one to miss important context and potentially draw inaccurate inferences. Though less dramatic because the housing share in the consumer expenditure bundle is lower, these problems carry over to the PCE price index measure of inflation as well.\n\nTo try and drill through the muck to the true inflation signal, then, we at the Atlanta Fed have increasingly turned to an underlying inflation dashboard that incorporates multiple measurements. (Permit me a shout-out to economists across the Fed system who built these alternative gauges.)\n\nBy helping my staff and me better identify the underlying inflation signal, the dashboard in turn helps us determine whether monetary policy is properly calibrated to economic fundamentals.\n\nIf you'll notice in the slide, the green shading indicates readings within range of the committee's 2 percent target—that is, 0.25 percentage points above or below. As you see, entering the pandemic, six of the nine measures had inflation within the target range. So maybe we were not undershooting quite as badly as conventional wisdom suggested.\n\nOf course, in recent weeks, the specter of troublesome inflation has garnered profuse commentary. Certainly, there are forces in play that merit watching. Some commodity prices and 10-year Treasury yields have climbed, and our surveys tell us firms' short- and longer-run inflation expectations have likewise ticked up in recent weeks. Moreover, many hold a view that a large infusion of fiscal relief could overheat an already recovering economy.\n\nI'd like to make a couple of points on why I'm not sure we are staring down a fearsome inflation outbreak. First, it's unlikely that we'll get a clear reading on underlying inflation for a few months yet. As I noted, the pandemic-induced swings in spending, generally toward goods and away from services, have played havoc with prices. For instance, as travel nearly ceased last year, so few people leased cars that the Bureau of Labor Statistics lacked sufficient data to even publish a price index for that service for several months as part of the Consumer Price Index.\n\nMeanwhile, prices soared for goods like used cars, appliances, and home furnishings. In short, price volatility exploded in the underlying market basket from which inflation is calculated.\n\nComing off very low measures a year ago, this is likely to produce a big, but not especially meaningful, spike in inflation readings over the next few months.\n\nOn balance, I don't think it is clear that a surge in underlying inflation is imminent. The latest official readings substantiate that. For February, only one of the nine readings in our dashboard came in above the Fed's target range. I watch for the trajectory of inflation, and I'm not sure the path bothers me.\n\nI would also note that given the shortfall in inflation during the pandemic, appropriate monetary policy will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time, per the policy framework the Committee adopted last year. Furthermore, we also must reach maximum employment, and that goal is at least many months away.\n\nSo, let me say unambiguously that I am not at the moment thinking we will need to remove policy accommodation soon.\n\nOf course, the Committee and I are data dependent, so my view can change if conditions warrant. But I don't think that'll happen in the next few months.\n\nTaking a similarly holistic view of the labor market\n\nJust as I believe the committee is best served by a holistic view of inflation measures, I believe the same holds true for employment.\n\nAfter several months of weak job growth on the heels of a spike in virus cases last fall, aggregate readings of the labor market have in some respects been better than many expected. The unemployment rate is down from nearly 15 percent to 6.2 percent. February's employment report was solid, with nearly 400,000 new jobs even as much of the country remained under social distancing measures.\n\nBut these positive aggregates do not tell the whole story. I like to say that almost nobody lives the story implied by the aggregate, and this is certainly the case today.\n\nWhen one looks at a broader set of employment measures, what emerges is the contour of an uneven economic recovery. I would argue that the unevenness of the COVID-19 impact is THE signature characteristic of our pandemic-driven economic crisis. The disparities manifest along multiple dimensions but let me home in on four: industry sector, wage levels, gender, and race and ethnicity foremost.\n\nIt is widely recognized that people who work in restaurants, museums, theaters, hotels, and other places that depend on large gatherings have suffered the brunt of job losses. There are at least three reasons for this. First, for the most part, people working in these sectors can't work at home. Second, many of their workplaces closed or all but closed because of restrictions. And third, many people have been understandably uncomfortable going out even when establishments have reopened.\n\nIndeed, employment in leisure and hospitality is still 3.5 million jobs below where it was in February 2020. Given that this represents 35 percent of the nation's current job shortfall relative to our pre-COVID employment level, recovery for this industry will be central for the overall economic recovery.\n\nThe second dimension of uneven impact is wage level. The impacts of the COVID-driven economic contraction have hit low-wage workers much harder than high-wage workers. Among the top quarter of wage earners, employment declined about 4 percent since February 2020. For the bottom quarter of earners, the decline is more than quadruple that, at 17 percent. This is due in part to a correlation between sector and wage level, but only in part. We see this more broadly, in sectors beyond leisure and hospitality.\n\nThirdly, women have absorbed a sharper labor market hit. One reason for this is that women disproportionately work in low-wage jobs. But it is also true that women have quit the labor force at much higher rates than men. Looking strictly at unemployment, it appears men have fared worse in the pandemic recession. However, notice the taller orange bar on the left. That describes the disproportionate rate at which women have left the labor force.\n\nSociology has undoubtedly played a role here. The crisis led to school and day care center closures and also made home healthcare services less viable given the risks of infection, meaning that a family member would need to devote time to tend to children and elders. In many families, women have made the choice to do this, in an echo of their historical caretaking role.\n\nThe fourth and final dimension of labor market unevenness that I'd like to comment on is race and ethnicity. Employment among non-Hispanic whites is down about 4.5 percent since the onset of the pandemic, substantially less than among African Americans and Hispanics. Some of that disparity is because Blacks and Hispanics are overrepresented in the occupations where the most jobs disappeared.\n\nOne of our economists, Julie Hotchkiss, has published research that suggests the COVID recession will significantly dent the labor market progress Black Americans finally began enjoying late in the recovery from the Great Recession. So, the pandemic recession has been especially painful for the African American workforce, and that's something policymakers must keep front-of-mind.\n\nEconomic inclusion is not a zero-sum proposition\n\nThis provides a nice segue for me to talk about racial equity. Racial equity in our economy is not some nicety. Rebuilding an economy that works for everyone is critical for, yes, everyone. The status quo is simply leaving too many people behind and too much of our nation's economic potential untapped.\n\nOne way to think of it might be the difference between \"full employment\" and \"maximum employment.\" We can have full employment, as defined by a low unemployment rate, and still leave millions unattached or tenuously attached to the labor force, if we assume institutions and systems are unchangeable. On the other hand, maximum employment contemplates drawing those unattached or tenuously attached back into the labor force.\n\nUltimately, for all our sake, the nation must reach a place where opportunity is not so tightly linked to race, a place where kids are not consigned to a life of struggle mainly because of the color of their skin.\n\nClearly this quest is daunting. To get there, we must cement the notion that an inclusive economy is not a zero-sum proposition. If traditionally disadvantaged people get a better shot at a decent job or a small-business loan, that does not rob someone else of opportunity. An expanding body of research is building a powerful, pragmatic argument for economic inclusion.\n\nEliminating racial inequities in income could boost the U.S. economy by $2.3 trillion a year, according to a study funded by JPMorgan Chase & Co. Our colleagues at the San Francisco Fed produced a paper for the Fed System's Racism and the Economy webinar series. They found that racial and gender disparities in economic opportunity have ripped enormous chunks out of potential GDP: $2.9 trillion in 2019 alone, and roughly $71 trillion over the past 30 years. (Both those figures are in 2019 dollars.) Numerous other studies have reached similar conclusions.\n\nResearch from Raj Chetty and coauthors also suggests the country is missing out on potential innovations. We could produce many more inventors if women, people of color, and children from low-income families were exposed to innovation at a young age.\n\nTo take a different angle, we can ponder an example in our own country of public policy organized around restricting opportunity to a large group of citizens. Historians including C. Vann Woodward have concluded that the Jim Crow system of segregation was underpinned largely by cynical machinations using the zero-sum proposition to pit working-class whites against Blacks.\n\nNo clear-eyed observer could call the Jim Crow-era South a paradise for working-class and low-income white Americans. Poverty and disease were rampant. So, if barring African Americans from economic opportunity was supposed to preserve more opportunity for the masses of white workers, it was woefully unsuccessful.\n\nThankfully, there are few contemporary structures designed to disadvantage certain groups. Yet institutions and systems have been in place for decades. They are not inherently benign; they need attention and refinement to prevent harmful, if unintended, consequences.\n\nThe time to act is now. Our current moment in history shines a bright light on these issues. The disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on the labor market outcomes of people of color and women, as well as the increasing racial diversity of the U.S. population, will only increase these costs.\n\nTherefore, eliminating disparities in access to labor market opportunities and how labor markets treat workers is essential if we are to generate stronger economic growth and maintain global competitiveness.\n\nThere are reasons for optimism. Pandemic stresses clarified inequality in our society in ways that opened conversations about historical barriers to opportunity, certainly within the Federal Reserve System. Our Racism and the Economy webinar series is exploring the roots of disparities in housing, the labor market, education, and more. I encourage you to check out those sessions.\n\nAt the Atlanta Fed, we've made boosting economic mobility and resilience an animating theme in our work. Through our Advancing Careers for Low-Income Families initiative, we conduct research on benefits cliffs and develop tools to support community and state efforts to improve economic security for families while also meeting the talent needs of businesses. We've also joined with the Markle Foundation to form the Rework America Alliance to help workers emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic crisis stronger and better positioned to move into well-paying jobs regardless of formal education.\n\nIn closing, let me say that pursuing economic inclusion in no way conflicts with the Federal Reserve's dual mandate. On the contrary, it enhances and enriches our conception of full employment, as we employ a similarly nuanced approach to better understand inflation. I hope I have helped to make that case today.",

In my remarks today I will talk a bit about what I am seeing in the economy, and I hope this can demystify some unknowns, or at least help us to consider them in more productive ways.\n\nBefore I delve into the substance of my talk, please keep in mind that these thoughts are strictly my own. They do not necessarily reflect the views of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee or at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.\n\nOver the past few months, you've heard economists and analysts use a multitude of letters: V, U, L, W, and so on. Well today, I'm not going to do that. Instead, being economists, my macro team and I turned to a mathematical symbol—the less-than sign, and I've come to describe the present conditions as characterizing a \"less-than recovery.\"\n\nIn my remarks this afternoon, I'll explain what I mean by this and explore some of the implications of an economic recovery that benefits some parts of the economy much less than other parts. In short, these circumstances are laying bare—and exacerbating—disparities that have long plagued our economy, along ethnic, racial, gender, geographic, and occupational lines.\n\nI will also discuss what the Federal Reserve and particularly the Atlanta Fed can do and are doing to confront these disparities, before closing with thoughts on how the finance and economics field might grapple with these challenges in a more meaningful way.\n\nWhile the aggregate numbers can be interpreted as promising, I believe they mask the fact that the recovery is progressing in a pattern that, when graphed, looks to me like a less-than sign.\n\nLet me explain. There are parts of the economy and the population that are prospering, moving on an incline. Most college-educated people and professionals who can work remotely along with sectors like home improvement chains, grocery stores, online retailers, and others are doing well.\n\nSome commentators have even gone so far as to proclaim the COVID recession effectively over for many of those who didn't lose their jobs or could easily shift to working from home.\n\nUnfortunately, that's not the whole story. A considerable portion of the economy and population is moving in the opposite direction, as represented by the descending leg of the less-than sign.\n\nThis group includes industries that depend on people crowding together, such as restaurants, hotels, recreation, household care services, transportation, tourist attractions, many small retailers, and the people who work in those sectors.\n\nThese industries saw economic activity decline as much as 80 percent in the first two months following the pandemic. Through August, their business output remained 50 percent below pre-COVID levels. Employees in those industries are primarily lower-wage workers and disproportionately people of color, younger people, and women. In other words, the people who are often least equipped to weather a prolonged bout of unemployment are bearing the brunt of this health crisis and economic downturn.\n\nIn this context, it is useful to look at what has happened to jobs with similar skill requirements. For this, I will use a classification scheme for low-, middle-, and high-skill jobs made popular by MIT economist David Autor and his coauthors.\n\nWorkers in low-skill occupations, many of which are in service-oriented industries such as food preparation, cleaning, and hospitality, accounted for 17 percent of total employment in February. But they suffered double that percentage (33 percent) of the share of jobs lost between February and April.\n\nThis is notably different from the typical recession triggered by an economic shock. The typical downturn has generally affected sectors such as construction and manufacturing, which employ mostly middle-skill workers. For example, in the Great Recession, nearly all of the job loss was concentrated among middle-skill workers, while employment for low-skill jobs (in service-oriented industries) actually kept growing.\n\nEqually troubling, many of the jobs lost in the sectors that comprise the declining portion of the less-than sign may not come back. Segments like business travel and food service might not recover for years. This assumes, of course, that they will at some point return to their pre-COVID state. But this is not assured. Take restaurants. Some contacts in the food service industry are expecting a permanent contraction of up to 20 percent of restaurant capacity. Moreover, the restaurants that do survive could more intensively deploy labor-eliminating technology, such as electronic tablets customers can use to place orders, and take other measures to minimize close human contact.\n\nAs another example, a hospital director told me they are seeing nearly a third of patients via telemedicine, compared to just 3 percent before the pandemic.\n\nThose kind of developments could have profound labor market implications for the numbers of jobs and the types of skills employers will require. For instance, the hospital may require fewer orderlies but more nurses trained in using telemedicine technologies. Further implications? Consider that the hospital hosting fewer in-person visits might scrap plans for a new parking deck. That's a number of potential construction jobs that would not be realized.\n\nOverall, only half the roughly 22 million jobs lost in the first couple months of the pandemic have reappeared.\n\nAlready, the data are warning of these kinds of structural shifts in the labor market that, absent the pandemic, may have taken several years or a decade to unfold. Job losses listed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics as permanent, according to its household survey, rose from 2.3 million in May to 3.8 million in September, on a seasonally adjusted basis. This increase in long-term unemployed individuals has happened in about six months. It took over two years for a comparable shift to occur following the Great Recession. The pandemic has been a big accelerant.\n\nMore sobering still is that, if we assume that jobs continue to be added at the pace seen in the September labor report, it will take an additional 16 months to return to February employment levels. And that does not account for the additional employment growth needed to keep pace with population growth. The upshot: if September is our new jobs baseline, we will not return to pre-COVID total employment levels until December 2021.\n\nWidespread permanent job loss could become a material risk to the recovery. The data on this are clear: permanently laid off workers find it far more difficult to rejoin the labor force. This would make recovery more difficult to sustain.\n\nWe saw that dynamic in play not long ago. It took years for masses of displaced workers to learn new skills necessary to find work in entirely new fields after the Great Recession.\n\nThat said, the prolonged economic expansion eventually created job opportunities for marginalized groups and generally strengthened families, businesses, and communities. Unfortunately, many of the people who were last to benefit from the gradual recovery from the Great Recession were the first to suffer at the onset of the COVID recession.\n\nWhat the Fed can do\n\nAs policymakers, our goal should be to ensure that their suffering does not become permanent lest the recovery take far longer. Indeed, an unnecessarily slow labor market rebound could just drive historic wedges deeper, continuing to exacerbate the geographic, racial, gender, and income disparities in our economy.\n\nBy traditional lights, it might appear the Fed is ill-placed to address long-standing economic inequities like income and wealth gaps. After all, these disparities are similar to gaps in access to quality health care, housing, education, and job training. In this context, I'm of a mind with my Boston Fed counterpart, Eric Rosengren, who recently pointed out that we must think about these inequities holistically.\n\nAdmittedly, the Fed cannot make grants and put money directly into the pockets of those families and small businesses that need it most. We are not directly involved in health care and education. Fiscal policymakers clearly have a significant role to play in ensuring that the economic disruptions don't become deeply rooted, that the wedge does not continue to widen these disparities.\n\nStill, the Fed has an important role to play. We must be central to this conversation. And increasingly, I think we are.\n\nLet me mention a few ways our bank is attacking these problems. First, we're going micro, because conditions vary greatly across places and populations.\n\nAt the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, we, along with our Federal Reserve System colleagues, stepped up efforts to survey localities about how they were doing amid the slowdown—the intensity of the problems and how long leaders in the government, business and nonprofit sectors anticipated full recovery would take.\n\nThose findings paint a picture of low-income, minority, and rural communities suffering disproportionately and anticipating longer recoveries. In April, just about half of the people we surveyed said the economic downturn would be over in September. That consensus has steadily extended into 2021 and, for many contacts, into 2022.\n\nWe are using those findings to inform a more muscular outreach program. We are going micro in our outreach by advising local government officials on ways they might help businesses in their communities. In this vein, we've been talking about how you maintain business activities in the time of COVID.\n\nWe're trying to help the philanthropic sector understand the stresses on their constituencies, and suggest ways they can make a meaningful difference in the communities they serve.\n\nOur bank also is researching and working to dismantle barriers to career advancement for low-wage workers. One effort we're making is helping workers better understand benefits cliffs. These happen when someone acquires new skills and earns, say, an extra dollar an hour, but because public benefits are automatically reduced as wages rise, this person actually loses the equivalent of $3 or $4 an hour in supports and ends up worse off, for years in many cases, by trying to better their circumstances.\n\nTaking research from the lab to the real world\n\nWe are taking our benefits cliffs work from the laboratory to the real world, where it can improve the lived experience of real people. Our researchers and outreach folks have established more than a dozen partnerships across the country to build practical tools for state agencies and other groups to help these workers address what amount to exceedingly high marginal tax rates for some of the lowest paid workers. We are working with the state and other nonprofit organizations in Alabama, Louisiana, Florida, and Georgia in our district, as well as in Connecticut and Oklahoma, among other places.\n\nAt the Atlanta Fed, we have also established a research and outreach team focused on workforce development. The aim is to equip workers with the skills they need for not only the jobs of today, but also the jobs of tomorrow. As I noted, the pandemic crisis is accelerating a tectonic shift in the labor market, and, simply put, too many workers are not ready. In response, we recently worked with the Markle Foundation and others to stand up the Rework America Alliance, which is aggressively moving forward with partners across the nation to reorient the existing job training infrastructure so it can help more workers be prepared for these changes.\n\nAcross the Fed System, we are also using our convening power to confront the immediate effects of the COVID downturn and the ongoing effects of historic economic disparities.\n\nWe have joined the Boston and Minneapolis Feds to present a seven-part webinar series on racism and the economy. If you didn't catch the first installment this month, I recommend that you look it up, and I encourage you to watch for upcoming segments on topics including education, housing, and wealth and financial services. You will hear views expressed that you are not accustomed to hearing in a forum affiliated with the Federal Reserve, I assure you.\n\nUltimately, that's the point. We need to participate in a deeper, more creative reckoning with a history of racial injustice that continues to weaken the economy for all of us.\n\nNow let me turn to what you probably expected to hear from me—monetary policy. Our monetary policy stance today is a far cry from where we were just eight months ago, when we were enjoying the fruits of a historic expansion, with inflation approaching our 2 percent target and record low levels of unemployment spurred by many people less attached to the labor force finding jobs. The pandemic changed all of that, triggering bold and decisive action on the part of the Federal Open Market Committee to provide support to the economy and ensure that financial markets continued their smooth functioning.\n\nWe quickly reduced the fed funds rate to effectively zero and, with unprecedented swiftness, stood up a series of facilities designed to provide support for targeted financial markets that were showing signs of extreme distress.\n\nThese proactive actions, I am pleased to say, were quite effective. Spreads in many financial markets backed off their extreme levels soon after the facilities were deployed. In some cases, like the corporate bond market, the easing occurred without a significant draw on the facilities, indicating that simply the presence of a backstop vehicle was enough to reduce fears.\n\nI would like to say a few words about a number of these facilities. Some, like the Municipal Loan Facility and the Main Street Lending Program, represent totally new ventures for the Fed and have required a great deal of learning on the fly. As we gain a deeper understanding of the needs and nuanced circumstances of the targeted sectors, we will continue to reshape these facilities to maximize their effectiveness.\n\nOn balance, I am comfortable with our current policy stance. As I have detailed today, though the U.S. economy continues to show clear signs of recovery, there remain significant portions where the recovery has been weak or nonexistent. That reality tells me that it will be some time before we tighten our interest rate stance or pull back strongly from our actions supporting financial functioning.\n\nThat said, I want to be clear that once we are past the current crisis, I will heartily support the removal of these emergency vehicles. There should be no expectation that these will persist in a new steady state.\n\nThough there has been considerable focus on emergency measures through much of 2020, the Committee was also able to complete its multiyear review of its longer-term policy framework. Most of you likely are well aware of our August announcement of a fundamental shift in the Fed's monetary policy framework.\n\nThere are two parts to this that I would call out as particularly noteworthy. First, the new framework makes explicit my long-held view that levels of inflation above the 2 percent target can persist for a time without being a cause for concern. What concerns me more are trends relative to the 2 percent target. If we are somewhat above 2 percent, but the level is stable, I will likely not be concerned. By contrast, if we are somewhat above 2 percent and the distance between actual inflation and our target is increasing steadily, that would be a reason for concern and merit a policy response. I think this is a commonsense approach to managing our inflation target.\n\nThe second important aspect has been summarized in the press as a \"lower, longer\" approach. Boiled down to its essentials, this codifies that the FOMC will no longer seek to preemptively blunt runaway inflation by tightening monetary policy when unemployment reaches certain low levels. The disparities we're discussing today played a large part in this strategic shift.\n\nWe are committing to let the economy grow a little more robustly than we might have otherwise because we have learned over the past decade that even historically low unemployment is less likely to spark troublesome inflation. Importantly, then, the new framework calls for policy to support \"broad-based and inclusive\" job gains. And it states that policy decisions will be based on estimates of \"shortfalls of employment from its maximum level\"—not \"deviations.\"\n\nThis is no small matter.\n\nA significant cost of tightening monetary policy prematurely during an economic expansion is that it can block job opportunities from reaching all communities. Our new approach should help minorities, women, and lower-income earners to be more fully connected to the labor market. That will give those traditionally marginalized groups a better opportunity to secure jobs and economic resilience, which for too many of our citizens has been severely tested by the COVID economic downturn.\n\nOf course, the Fed carefully weighed numerous factors in crafting the new long-run policy strategy. We have been criticized at times for not listening enough, particularly to Main Street. Therefore, we conducted events across the country to seek public input as we refined our policy approach. One clear message we heard before the pandemic from community, labor, workforce development, and business leaders across the country was that the strong job market was particularly beneficial to low- and moderate-income communities.\n\nWe are going to keep listening because we have far to go to dismantle entrenched disparities that act as a yoke on the nation's economy. One more snapshot of current conditions makes this abundantly clear.\n\nAcross the jobs spectrum, minorities, particularly African Americans, are bearing an outsize burden of employment losses. A much larger share of Blacks and Hispanics (22 and 23 percent, respectively) than whites (13 percent) worked in low-skill occupations before the pandemic.\n\nSo not only are those individuals and families absorbing the sharpest blows from job losses, but they have also experienced a much slower employment recovery than whites in similar low-skill occupations. What's more, this disparate impact is not confined to low-skill occupations. There is also a notable difference in employment outcomes for Blacks in high-skill occupations in industries less damaged by the pandemic.\n\nMaking a commitment to an inclusive society\n\nIn sum, the speed and the magnitude of this punishing economic crisis is falling disproportionally on those least equipped to handle it. And for many of these individuals and families, government support has evaporated. That could leave millions of our fellow citizens in dire straits. We are seeing some unfortunate evidence that this may be happening already. Evictions in the metropolitan Atlanta area began to rise significantly soon after moratoriums on them expired in July.\n\nAs a nation, we cannot afford to continue leaving talent, productivity, and creativity on the table. So we as a society, and I'll aim this call to the economic and financial fields in particular, must make a commitment to an inclusive economy.\n\nThe fields of economics and finance must acknowledge that the influence of race is multidimensional and lasting. If we are to build a more equitable economy and financial system, the people who build it need to know and appreciate the history of our system. Too many people, in finance and among the general public, are unaware of the role financial institutions, policies, and structures have played in calcifying inequities in our economy.\n\nIndeed, much financial research has ignored race and other demographic differences in the population. Partly as a result, this is an area ripe for research, product innovation, and policy proposals to help eliminate barriers, reduce frictions, and create structures and institutions that support the success of all Americans.\n\nOnly by investigating differences in behaviors and the practical effects of policy can we recalibrate our approaches or devise wholly new strategies to help everyone engage and thrive in the economy. For instance, in a new paper, one of our research economists, Kris Gerardi, and two coauthors suggest that Black and Hispanic Americans basically overpay for mortgages compared to non-Hispanic white borrowers. This appears to happen mainly because Black and Hispanic mortgage holders do not refinance as often as non-Hispanic whites do when mortgage interest rates decline. Thus, they end up continuing to pay higher rates than they would otherwise. Precisely why those mortgage holders refinance less often is unclear. It may well not be exclusively rooted in raw discrimination, to the extent that this plays a role at all.\n\nThe point, though, is that this type of work highlights differences in behavior that are salient for pricing securities and providing financial advice. Just as important, the work offers ideas about structural changes to mortgages that might mitigate the disparities, which could help millions of our fellow citizens pay less for mortgage loans, and therefore have more disposable income.\n\nClearly, the challenges here are considerable. Still, I'm optimistic. Why? For one, we are having these conversations. I don't think that would have happened even six months ago. By itself, the willingness to discuss these matters shows me there is an appetite for change and, maybe more important, a willingness to work to make change.\n\nMy colleagues and I are going to work to make sure the Federal Reserve is a place that people look to for thoughtful solutions to issues around racial equity and historic disparities. I hope you see the value of this virtuous pursuit and join in the effort.\n\nIf we succeed, we can create a more perfect union that in fact, and not just in words, allows for unburdened life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for all citizens.",

The virtual conference was organized by the Atlanta Fed and Princeton University's Bendheim Center for Finance.",
            "content": "Thank you for the kind introduction and for inviting me to speak at this important conference. I'm really happy to be here and excited to be partnering with Princeton and the Bendheim Center for Finance.\n\nBut the impetus for this conference emerged from events that were not so happy. Professor Brunnermeier sent me an email soon after George Floyd's death and the start of a period of intense social unrest. It was a particularly tough time. I had just written my essay on the moral and economic imperative of ending racism, which he had read, and he said he liked the message. He told me he felt that \"thoughtful actions are needed to remove racial injustice in our society\" and wanted the Bendheim Center to more actively contribute to a better society. I was pleased that he was persuaded from my essay that the Atlanta Fed represented a good opportunity for partnership in advancing that goal, and enthusiastically accepted his invitation for us to work together and to give a keynote address for the conference.\n\nAs an aside, staying on the theme of persuasion, during the early planning for this, I also tried to sell him on the benefits of RV vacationing. I don't think he's moved very much on that, which tells me that my writing may be a more effective vehicle than my spoken word.\n\nBefore I get too deep into things, please keep in mind that these thoughts I'm about to express are mine and do not necessarily reflect the views of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee or at the Atlanta Fed.\n\nIn preparing my remarks for today, a particular passage in my essay hung in my consciousness. I wrote that a commitment to an inclusive society also means a commitment to an inclusive economy, and then followed with this:\n\nIn that passage, one word stands out to me: unburdened. Unfortunately, today we will be hearing a lot about burdens, specifically about the ways that policies and practices in finance and economic markets create outcomes that put burdens on minorities. These are important to document and understand. I am hopeful that with understanding will come efforts to develop an alternative set of policies and practices that eliminates such race-based disparities.\n\nIn my remarks today, I'd like to push this thinking a bit further, in a way that has implications for what we research and how we do this research. I would offer that it is critical to not only recognize the role of individual practices and policies in creating racial inequity but also confront the ways in which institutions and systems perpetuate and entrench racial inequalities in the economy and in our broader society. In our country, we too often assume institutions are benign. But people shape institutions, which can, unintentionally and otherwise, contribute to outcomes that are far from harmless.\n\nEvidence of structural financial inequity\nProfessor Jenkins's presentation on the municipal bond market in the preceding session makes this point very clearly. This bond market is hardly on the frontier of innovation, and few would characterize it as one where active predatory activity resides. However, it is an institution that has exercised enormous influence in shaping access to opportunity. As Professor Jenkins illustrates, perceptions of race and conventions of how to consider race have long been embedded in its rules and guidelines, with implications for the allocation of access to housing, employment, schools, and other services. While it seems incongruous that a $4 trillion market could do anything subtly, Professor Jenkins's work introduces this possibility and the negative consequences for Black families and communities.\n\nI'd like to continue this line of exploration, focusing on one of the most important vehicles for building wealth and economic security: housing.\n\nOfficial policy that racialized access to mortgage financing and thus decent, affordable housing in the post-World War II years is perhaps the most important—though hardly the sole—source of a racial wealth disparity that has not appreciably narrowed over the past half century.\n\nRichard Rothstein and others have exhaustively detailed explicit federal, state, and local public policies that effectively segregated cities and suburbs. In a groundbreaking book published in the mid-1990s, sociologists Melvin Oliver and Thomas Shapiro detailed the systematic methods by which African Americans were, in the authors' words, \"locked out of the greatest mass-based opportunity for wealth accumulation in American history.\" This deliberate exclusion occurred largely through official redlining instituted by federal agencies established as part of the New Deal: the Home Owners' Loan Corporation and the Federal Housing Administration.\n\nRedlining was the explicit practice of drawing maps identifying largely Black neighborhoods as unfit places to make federally backed home mortgage loans. A 1938 Federal Housing Authority (FHA) Underwriting Manual clearly states the overarching philosophy of redlining: \"If a neighborhood is to retain stability, it is necessary that properties shall continue to be occupied by the same social and racial classes. A change in social or racial occupancy generally contributes to instability and a decline in values.\"\n\nThis was official policy, not the machinations of a few rogue actors. Public policy of the day reflected conventional thinking in the residential real estate community. As Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor, an assistant professor of African American studies here at Princeton pointed out in her 2019 book, Race for Profit: How Banks and the Real Estate Industry Undermined Black Homeownership, the National Association of Real Estate Boards in the 1920s threatened punishment and revocation of membership to any broker who disrupted racial patterns on a given block or in a particular neighborhood. Similar language appeared in the organization's code of ethics until the 1950s. Appraisers from the very start, Taylor wrote, established as a given that racial diversity hurt property values.\n\nRedlining was not officially outlawed until the 1968 Fair Housing Act. By then, the damage was done. A Chicago Fed working paper (written in 2017 and revised in 2019) noted that redlining curtailed access to credit, allowed higher borrowing costs, and led to \"disinvestment in poor urban American neighborhoods with long-run repercussions.\"\n\nHarmful as it was, redlining was not the sole culprit in denying Black Americans fair access to home ownership. Mortgage lenders, realtors, and investors used various methods that drained credit and wealth from urban neighborhoods.\n\nTake contract-for-deed purchases. Contract-for-deed purchases can be attractive to someone who doesn't have a high, or any, credit score and may not be able to afford the larger down payment that usually comes with a traditional mortgage. But in a contract-for-deed purchase, the buyer accrues no interest in the property until the final payment has been made. Essentially, these home purchasers accumulate no equity as they pay off their notes and face repossession for missing a single payment—even years into the life of a contract. Contract sales force buyers to pay more and get less for their money.\n\nA new paper by Duke University's Samuel DuBois Cook Center on Social Equity paints a grim picture of how contract-for-deed sales exploited thousands of Black Chicagoans seeking to purchase homes in the 1950s and '60s—this practice was \"a systematic, legally sanctioned plunder of black wealth,\" the authors wrote. The Duke researchers combed through 50,000 land titles, deeds, and court records. The resulting work convincingly demonstrates how public policy and accepted practices in the residential real estate and mortgage finance industries encouraged the plunder of the mostly Black inner city and the development of nearly all-white suburbs.\n\nThe research found that more than three-fourths of homes purchased by African American Chicagoans in the 1950s and '60s were sold on contract. According to the researchers, contract selling was backed by the same banks that denied loans to Black home buyers as well as by investment syndicates of white business leaders and city government officials. All those players profited by exploiting what the authors call \"a separate and unequal housing market\" to the disadvantage of Black families.\n\nAfrican Americans purchasing on contract paid an average $587 more a month (in 2019 dollars) than they would have had they paid the fair price for their home through a conventional or FHA-backed mortgage, the Duke researchers calculated. All told, this research estimated that over those two decades, during the postwar home ownership boom that fueled sufficient wealth to lay the foundation for the nation's vaunted middle class, contract-for-deed sales expropriated $3.2 to $4 billion from Chicago's Black community. And that is a conservative estimate, the authors noted, because of large gaps in the surviving data.\n\nLest you think this is a relic of a bygone era, the Atlanta Fed's own Ann Carpenter, who is an assistant vice president on our community and economic development team, recently coauthored a study looking at contract-for-deed sales in the Midwest between 2004 and 2017. That research finds similar patterns to the DuBois Cook Center work, and makes a compelling case that we need stronger regulations and enforcement at the local and state levels to prevent the further destabilization of communities that were hit hardest by the foreclosure crisis prompted by the financial crisis and Great Recession.\n\nOne aspect that emerges repeatedly in much of this work is that racism and racial injustice were individually profitable. Investors in bond markets received higher returns for financing infrastructure in Black neighborhoods. White investors in Chicago's contract-for-deed schemes received higher returns than they could have through other investments. Importantly, in these cases, investors may not have had any taste for discrimination; they just accepted the prevailing rules as established and participated. The bias was embedded in the institutions. Without active scrutiny of the rules and a concern for equity, the costs of these biases were able to continue unchecked.\n\nBias extends beyond housing\nThough I have focused the bulk of my remarks in this regard on housing and home ownership, it is important to emphasize that systemic structures that made it extremely difficult for Black Americans to accrue savings and wealth have extended far beyond housing. Professor Jenkins's work offers one example of this. But there are others. Writers such as Rothstein and others have pointed out that many New Deal programs—which have long been credited with rescuing the nation from the Great Depression and laying the groundwork for future prosperity—withheld important benefits from most Black Americans.\n\nFor example, the Social Security Act of 1935 excluded farmworkers and domestic workers from the public pension program and unemployment insurance. Those were occupations disproportionately held by Blacks. As a result of the design of these programs, according to the writer Ta-Nehisi Coates, when President Franklin Roosevelt signed Social Security into law, 65 percent of African Americans nationally and between 70 and 80 percent in the South were ineligible. Thus, for many years, Blacks were effectively prevented from tapping into the primary program designed to preserve savings and wealth in one's later years. This clearly adversely affected the economic resilience of Black families. Moreover, and particularly important, given the importance that many scholars have attached to intergenerational transfers of wealth for entrepreneurship and economic mobility, this has also contributed to lower rates of small business creation and a weaker financial standing for Black businesses.\n\nWhat can you do?\nLet me close by saying a bit about today and a path forward. Today's program is pretty much what I expected when we put out the call for papers. The fields of finance and economics have been documenting racial disparities for decades, and the excellent papers today continue in that tradition. They are good contributions that are helping to illuminate maladies that include intergenerational poverty, restricted access to capital, residential segregation, and the persistent racial wealth gap.\n\nYet progress has been incremental. The median white household in America today holds 10 times the assets of the typical Black household. This ratio is not much improved from what it was more than 100 years ago.\n\nThis argues that something more fundamental must happen. The fields of economics and finance must acknowledge that the influence of race is multidimensional and persists over time. We must look \"under the hood\" at our institutions to see and truly understand their design and its implications. With such an understanding, we can then find more creative and accurate ways to incorporate race into our models, estimation approaches, and narratives. This, I hope, will yield better insights and result in a set of policy prescriptions that can truly create meaningful and lasting change.\n\nI could stop there, but being that I was a professor for many years and am talking in an academic setting, I can't resist the impulse of closing by offering something that may sound like homework. I've already put forth one \"assignment\":\n\nBut there are other things you might have on your \"to-do\" list. I will mention two:\n\nWe all have a vital role to play if we are to confront historical and institutional inequities in the financial systems that are supposed to serve our economy and all of our citizens.\n\nThe most egregious of the programs that spawned and even codified segregation and exclusion into our institutions are long gone, yet their effects are pernicious and persistent. In addition, work by varied scholars—some of them here with us today—makes a compelling case that there are institutions and programs still operating today that have similarly troubling effects.\n\nAll that notwithstanding, I am here before you optimistic for the future. Why? Because we are having these conversations, which I wouldn't have imagined was possible several months ago. This tells me there is an appetite for change and a willingness to work to effect it. Progress, and ultimately success, in this work will help ensure that we move ever closer to achieving a more perfect union that in fact, and not just in words, allows for unburdened life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness for all its citizens.",

            "content": "Good evening. Thank you for the kind introduction and for inviting me to speak at this prestigious venue. It's humbling to join the list of luminaries that the Money Marketeers have hosted. I will do my best to not disappoint.\n\nBefore I go further, I'd like to recognize my friends from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Thank you all for coming.\n\nNow the usual disclaimer: the views I will express are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or at the Atlanta Fed.\n\nGrassroots information explains the why\n\nI'm pretty sure that everyone here has heard the phrase \"The devil is in the details.\" As you know, this refers to something that, at first glance, seems utterly simple, but upon further inspection is actually incredibly complex, with crucial elements embedded in details not expressly articulated. We all face these situations regularly but don't always give close attention to the details. How many of you have accepted an app's user agreement without reading the details? Heaven knows whom you have agreed to share your data with. But just so you know I'm not throwing stones, I don't scrutinize them either.\n\nWhen it comes to monitoring the macroeconomy and thinking about monetary policy, though, it is dangerous to not dive sufficiently deeply into the details. We learned this the hard way via the Great Recession, and this caused the Atlanta Fed to overhaul its approach to gathering data to gain insights about how businesses and the economy are doing in real time.\n\nToday, I'd like to give you a sense of these efforts and provide a window into how this relatively new way that we gather on-the-ground intelligence informs my view of the economy and of the appropriate stance of policy. In short, it gives me a richer, more nuanced view of what is happening and what may happen than I could gain through macromodels and data alone.\n\nTo start, I'd like to take you back to late 2006 and into 2007. (I recognize that many of you might prefer not to go there.) The macroeconomic data were showing robust growth and there were few signs in macromodels that any downturn was imminent—let alone a downturn of the magnitude of the Great Recession.\n\nComing out of this, we at the Atlanta Fed decided to rethink our approach to gathering the grassroots intelligence that always has served as a supplement to the macrodata. We formalized this process by establishing the Regional Economic Information Network, or REIN.\n\nThrough REIN, we continually harvest insights from an extensive network of business decision-makers, along with community and nonprofit organizations, and blend that information with macroeconomic models and data. Regional executives and analysts in our six offices keep me plugged in to conditions on the ground by systematically connecting with a broad cross-section of firms, with the goal of getting input from businesses that vary by size, sector, and geography, among other dimensions. Importantly, this outreach helps my staff and me understand why firms are behaving as they are.\n\nLet me give an example of how this has helped us. During the middle to later stages of the recovery, wages climbed less sharply than economic theory suggests they might in a tightening labor market, and many were wondering why wage growth was so lackluster. Because the aggregate data offered only partial clues, we turned to our REIN team, who asked employers why they were not substantially increasing pay even as they complained of labor shortages.\n\nWe learned that many employers were still smarting from disruptive layoffs they had made in the Great Recession. During the recovery, they avoided significant boosts in payroll costs, lest they put their business in peril should demand decline as it did a decade ago.\n\nTherefore, instead of long-term wage commitments, employers told us they were taking other steps to attract and retain talent: selective pay increases for particular jobs or locations; incentive pay and bonuses; flexible work hours; more freedom to work remotely; and other \"culture investments.\"\n\nOur contacts helped me learn what employers were doing and why they were doing it. This information enriched our policy discussion and helped sharpen the questions we explore through the data and that we ask our contacts.\n\nEmployers still struggle with finding quality labor\n\nFast forward to today. Currently, the information gathered from my REIN network suggests that labor market conditions are tight. In contrast to earlier in the recovery, wage growth has moved up moderately, though perhaps not as much as some would expect given a very low unemployment rate. That said, availability of quality labor is the top concern for most firms, and many contacts report vacancies that go unfilled for long periods of time—a factor that is constraining growth.\n\nAlmost to a firm, our contacts tell us they continue to struggle with recruitment and retention. Some of the stories I hear have me wondering whether we've gone a bit beyond full employment. For example, staffing agencies report that new employees often never show up at placements because they find better positions so quickly. A large firm in the food service industry reports that it eliminated background checks, drug tests, and even traditional job interviews for some positions. The company has adopted an \"apply-and-start-the-same-day\" approach to hiring.\n\nTax cuts not substantially changing firms' investing, hiring\nOverall, the information REIN collects is valuable for numerous reasons, but let me highlight a couple.\n\nFirst, the economy of the Sixth Federal Reserve District is big. If our six states were a stand-alone economy, it would be the world's eighth largest—just smaller than India's and larger than Italy's. Second, the composition of our regional economy nicely simulates the makeup of the national economy. These two facts mean that, by systematically targeting a representative basket of contacts in terms of industry sectors, firm size, and urban and rural geography, we can gain a mini-snapshot of economic conditions nationally. And it gives us a better opportunity to discover burgeoning risks—remember the Great Recession experience—by pulling together disparate perspectives to identify emerging macrotrends much earlier than we could before.\n\nREIN wasn't the Atlanta Fed's only response to potential gaps regarding information gathering. We also bolstered our insight into firm behavior through surveys. We currently field a number of surveys, including the Survey of Business Uncertainty and the Business Inflation Expectations surveys. These surveys, which vary in scale and scope, allow us to probe particular real-time issues in detail to give us another view on how businesses are responding to economic conditions and why. Like the REIN information, our survey data have been quite helpful for our understanding of contemporaneous issues.\n\nToward the end of 2017, as the ink was still drying on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the economics and policy community was trying to gauge its likely impact on the overall economy.\n\nMany private forecasters, using more or less standard macroforecasting models, were predicting a sizeable boost to business investment and labor supply. To be sure, there was ample disagreement among private forecasters regarding the initial impact of the tax reform. However, the Tax Policy Center, the Tax Foundation, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) all initially estimated the impact of tax reform to be equivalent to around three-quarters of a percentage point on near-term gross domestic product (GDP) growth.\n\nI, too, rely on the input from many of these same models and would have had a similar view on the impact of tax reform—except that input we were gathering from firms told a different story.\n\nAs Congress was finalizing the tax reform package, the Atlanta Fed had two surveys in the field: (1) our Business Inflation Expectations survey of firms in the Sixth District and (2) the Survey of Business Uncertainty, a national survey we conduct with Stanford University and the University of Chicago. In both of these surveys, we asked firms how tax reform would affect their capital expenditure plans for 2018. And in the Business Inflation Expectations survey, we also asked how tax reform would affect hiring plans.\n\nAn overwhelming majority (two-thirds) of respondents to our national survey indicated that the reform would not affect their capital expenditures at all. Further, just 15 percent said they would increase their capital spending by 10 percent or more.\n\nOn hiring, the story was similar. About 70 percent of respondents indicated they would make no changes in their hiring plans because of tax reform.\n\nAt first, I was skeptical, given the apparent disconnect between these findings and aggregate forecasting models. However, input from the Southeast business community echoed our survey results. These firms expressed considerable optimism following the passage of the tax reform, but that exuberance had yet to affect capital investment or hiring plans.\n\nThrough these conversations with business decision-makers, I gathered an overwhelming sense that the legislation was complex and that firms were still untangling the implications for their businesses. So, my first thought was that our surveys had been in the field a bit too early.\n\nYet as we got clarity about the tax structure, another round of surveys suggested businesses held firm in their responses. In February of 2018, three months after the reform was passed, nearly 75 percent of our survey respondents still indicated that tax reform was not materially changing their capital spending plans for the remainder of 2018 and 2019.\n\nAnd, again, my REIN team probed more deeply for any nuances that our survey did not cover. The answers confirmed the survey results: The majority of our contacts said they were not substantially shifting investment expenditures based on the tax cut. Instead, the majority indicated they were using tax savings on stock buybacks, debt reduction, and compensation to employees. Only a handful said they would make expansionary or productivity-enhancing investments.\n\nLooking back on the performance of the economy in 2018, my tentative conclusion is that information we gathered directly from firms early in the year looked prescient. (I say \"tentative\" because the aggregate economic data are always subject to further revision.) Real GDP increased by 2.5 percent in 2018, only modestly outpacing its average growth rate over the previous 7½ years, and coming in about half of a percentage point shy of the IMF's April 2018 forecast for growth.\n\nBusiness fixed investment grew by a little less than 6 percent, a healthy number to be sure, but far from a transformative year.\n\nMoreover, the details suggest that investment growth in 2018 was largely driven by spending on software and research and development, which may reflect attempts to incorporate labor-saving technology in a tight labor market rather than a surge in expansionary equipment and structures investment, which the tax changes were designed to encourage.\n\nAnd, as suggested by firms in my district early in the year, 2018 was a record year for stock buybacks and dividend payments.\n\nTrade situation remains murky\n\nMove ahead to the current economic environment, one marked by heightened uncertainty surrounding trade tensions and tariffs. Many macromodels suggest that in the face of high uncertainty, businesses will delay capital expenditures and hiring, leading to a material slowdown in growth.\n\nYet the details we glean from Main Street suggest that not all firms are impacted by the current uncertainties, nor do they all respond in the same way. And this has implications for attempting to measure how much of an impact uncertainty is having on the aggregate economy.\n\nRegarding trade policy uncertainty, the feedback I receive and the survey evidence my staff analyzes suggest that it is largely a nonissue for most firms.\n\nWe fielded a set of special questions regarding the impact of tariffs and trade policy tensions to panelists in our Survey of Business Uncertainty over the third quarter, as U.S.-China trade tensions were escalating.\n\nOverall, our results say the negative effects of trade policy on U.S. business activity have grown over time, particularly for firms with an international reach. However, trade policy's impact on the business sector as a whole remains modest, slowing capital expenditures by a few percentage points and leading to a small change in overall employment.\n\nImportantly, as the trade situation has remained murky, firms affected by tariff increases have also indicated they have adjusted supply chains and taken other steps to mitigate tariffs. The effects of these measures are unlikely to be captured by model-based estimates.\n\nMy experience using the information we've gathered from the business community gives me some confidence to, again, view firm-level information as an important supplement to the forecasts of macroeconomic models.\n\nWeighing incoming data before making further adjustments is important\n\nLet me close by talking a bit about the current economic picture. The unemployment rate is near historic lows and inflation is more or less at target. Given this, a casual observer might conclude that the job of a central banker is done. Yet even a cursory scan of the horizon will detect a few gathering storm clouds that threaten to disrupt the current sunny picture.\n\nIn the face of these gathering clouds—namely risks surrounding trade policy and global growth—the job of a central banker becomes one of weighing the likelihood of these risks occurring and the magnitude of the hit to the economy should they indeed occur.\n\nOn this front, there has been a diversity of views among the FOMC over the past three meetings (as evidenced by dissents to policy choice), with some seeing the need to take out some insurance against the apparent downside risks and others arguing that these uncertainties have yet to rise to a level significant enough to derail the current expansion.\n\nFor myself, I do think that the economy today is on solid footing and is likely to remain so. But I've gotten to this view only after a thorough and careful examination of the details through our various channels. The combination of the current economic data, survey results, and the information gleaned from our myriad face-to-face interactions with firms via REIN suggest, to me, that the Fed's current stance is, if anything, a bit accommodative. I am fairly comfortable standing pat with policy and strongly favor weighing the incoming data, both macro and micro, over the coming months before deciding on any further adjustments.\n\n\n\nI started this evening appealing to the colloquial saying \"The devil is in the details.\" However, further digging and a handy copy of Bartlett's Familiar Quotations reveal that the phrase originally had a slightly different meaning: \"God is in the details,\" which suggests, to me at least, that whatever you do, you should do completely and thoroughly. But whichever phrase speaks to you, both convey that the details are important. And, in essence, it's how I approach monetary policy down in Atlanta.\n\nThank you. I'll be happy to take a few questions.",

            "content": "\n\nThank you, Mary, for the kind introduction. It's always good to be back in the Bay Area. I went to graduate school just down the road, as Mary noted. I spent a lot of time immersed in my studies and a little bit of time enjoying myself. But we'll leave that discussion for another day.\n\nThank you all for being here and for the important work you're doing. This research is especially timely, as we at the Federal Reserve are undertaking a review of our strategic framework for monetary policy. We are examining our policy strategy, tools, and communications practices. As part of the strategic review, the Federal Reserve System is sponsoring a research conference in Chicago in June. I suspect some of you may be there.\n\nAs I'll discuss in some detail, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC, or the Committee) is entering the later stages of normalizing the extraordinary tools it deployed in the wake of the financial crisis. So this seems an important moment to take stock of issues raised by the remarkable experiences of the past decade.\n\nJust over 10 years ago, the Committee lowered the federal funds rate to near zero, the effective lower bound. As the Committee could move rates no lower, it turned to two novel tools to promote the recovery from the Great Recession. One was large-scale purchases of longer-term securities, which became known as quantitative easing, or QE.\n\nThis policy substantially expanded the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, from about 6 percent of gross domestic product in 2006 to nearly 25 percent of GDP in 2014. The other novel tool was forward guidance, or communicating about the future path of interest rates.\n\nTo be specific, in January the Committee announced that it had decided to continue with an operating framework in which bank reserves are \"ample.\" That decision was followed this week by the decision to stabilize the size of the balance sheet, at least for a while, starting in October. In short, monetary policy from here on will be conducted using what is commonly known as a \"floor system,\" in which the Committee controls rates by way of administered interest rates rather than by manipulating the supply of scarce reserves.\n\nPut directly, the FOMC will not be returning to the pre-crisis operating framework. Because of that, I think it's important to be crystal clear about the rationale for this decision, at least as I see it. To that end, I want to make three basic points in my remarks today.\n\nFirst, the balance sheet is destined to be large relative to the pre-crisis norm, independent of the decision to implement monetary policy in a framework with ample reserves. In fact, I will argue that the ultimate driver of the size of the Fed's balance sheet will be factors other than the FOMC's operating framework.\n\nMy second point is that, regarding the transmission of policy actions to short-term interest rates, there has so far been no discernible distinction between the old operating framework and the new operating framework. As a practical matter, all evidence points to little difference in the effectiveness of monetary policy when the central bank operates in a system with ample reserves.\n\nFinally, I want to lay out the reasons that I supported the decision to maintain an ample-reserve framework going forward.\n\nAs always, I'm speaking strictly for myself, and not for my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee or at the Atlanta Fed.\n\nBig ain't what it used to be\nOn to my first point, then, which is to caution that the discussion about the FOMC's operating framework should not be conflated with a debate about the size of the Fed's balance sheet.\n\nWhen it comes to the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, an often overlooked factor is the organic growth that results from increases in the public's demand for currency. In fact, the Fed's balance sheet was steadily growing over time before the crisis as a passive response to the public demand for cash.\n\nDuring the crisis and post-crisis recovery, currency demand accelerated. From the end of July 2008 to the end of 2018, the amount of currency nearly doubled in nominal terms. Thus, even in the unrealistic event that currency demand stabilizes and the FOMC shrinks reserves to a minimal amount, the balance sheet would still be about twice as big today as it was at the end of 2007 when the Great Recession was beginning. I say this scenario is unrealistic because currency demand does grow over time. But it is also unrealistic because it is highly unlikely that reserves can be maintained at pre-crisis levels. This is so even if the FOMC were to return to its pre-crisis framework.\n\nLet me explore that thought in a little more detail. The pre-crisis framework worked by engineering enough scarcity in the supply of reserves to ensure that small changes in quantity would impact the price—the federal funds rate. But as we all know, scarcity is not an absolute concept. It depends on the level of demand. In the pre-crisis era, the demand for reserves by the banking system was relatively small. That meant that federal funds rate control could be accomplished with changes in the supply of reserves that were correspondingly small.\n\nThings have changed. Lorie Logan, the deputy manager of the System Open Market Account, gave a nice discussion of the central issues during a panel discussion sponsored by the Hoover Institution last May. The short version is this: changes in banking regulations, the business models of financial institutions, and Treasury management of their accounts held with the Federal Reserve imply that the demand for reserves today is likely to be much larger (and perhaps more volatile) than it was in the pre-crisis world.\n\nOne key implication of an increase in the structural demand for reserves is that reserve scarcity will likely be associated with a balance sheet that is relatively large. Estimates of average reserve demand vary, but something around $1 trillion does not seem unreasonable to me. And it likely will be appropriate to maintain a buffer on top of estimated average demand to accommodate temporary fluctuations in demand. That's a couple of orders of magnitude larger than the pre-crisis, pre-Dodd-Frank norm. When it comes to reserves in the banking system, a trillion is the new 45 billion.\n\nWhat is more, the FOMC has made clear its intentions to \"in the longer run, hold no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively.\" The precise implication of this, quantitatively, is yet to be determined. But as a practical matter, it is not clear that the choice of an ample- versus scarce-reserve framework will have a material impact on the size of the balance sheet.\n\nRecent history under a floor system \nThus far, I have argued that the desire for a smaller Fed balance sheet does not provide a very convincing case for returning to the pre-crisis operating framework. What would be a convincing case? I know I would be very skeptical about adopting a floor system if it appeared that central bank control over bank borrowing and lending rates had deteriorated in the period since 2009, when we have actually had a floor system in place. Fortunately, I do not believe that to be the case.\n\nThe charts I am showing here illustrate the relationship between the federal funds rate target and the actual market value of the funds rate for the pre-crisis period from 1995 through December 2007, and then the upper end of the federal funds rate target range juxtaposed with the Interest-Rate-on-Excess-Reserves for the abundant-reserve period from December 2008 through November 2018.\n\nIt is apparent that the relationship between the rate chosen to implement policy and the actual value of the federal funds rate has not proven dependent on the reserve regime in place. But a more important question may be whether the transmission of the federal funds rate to other short-term market rates changed as Fed policy shifted from the pre-crisis, limited-reserve regime to the post-crisis, ample-reserve regime. The good news is in this chart: the relationship between the federal funds rate and Treasury bill rates does not appear to differ materially across the period when reserves were limited and the recent period when reserves have been abundant. The same holds true for a variety of short-term rates.\n\nWhy I support a floor system\nI've now made the first two points I noted at the outset. One, the issue of a big or small balance sheet going forward is largely moot. Two, there has been little discernible difference in the effectiveness of monetary policy over the years the FOMC has operated in a system with ample reserves, relative to the pre-crisis, scarce-reserves regime.\n\nWhat, then, are the attractive features that would tip the scales in favor of continuing on with a floor system? There are likely others, but I find the following three most convincing: (1) efficiencies in the payments system, (2) robustness during economic stress, and (3) considerations of financial stability.\n\nFormer New York Fed president Bill Dudley made the efficiency argument in a 2017 speech. In that speech, Bill noted that a \"floor-type system\" eliminates the need for banks to trade large volumes of reserves in the process of channeling them to institutions that would otherwise find themselves short on a given day. He concluded that this brand of intermediation has little \"social value.\"\n\nThis is, in essence, Friedman rule logic. From a social point of view, reserves are essentially costless to create. Efficiency dictates that the private costs of using reserves should likewise be zero. Eliminating scarcity through abundant reserves is an essential part of meeting this efficiency criterion.\n\nNow let me touch on the robustness case for abundant reserves. As Mary's predecessor and now New York Fed president John Williams has emphasized, the substantial decline in the natural rate of interest over the past quarter-century has introduced the possibility that the effective lower bound on policy rates will become a frequent feature of economic contractions. Even if the central bank maintains a scarce-reserve system during normal times, it is highly likely that ample reserves will have to be engineered amid economic distress, such as during a recession. In other words, if the economy goes south, we'll need a floor system anyway.\n\nThere is no logical reason to preclude a framework that switches from scarce reserves in normal times to ample reserves during lower-bound episodes, and back again as a recovery proceeds. But a scheme that, over time, involves multiple transitions from one operating approach to another seems an unnecessary complication, and one that could be difficult and costly for banks and other private-market participants to manage. Given other arguments that favor the floor system, I don't see the return in bearing these complications.\n\nFinally, let me turn to my last point, the potential financial stability benefits of an ample-reserves approach. The case was laid out by Robin Greenwood, Samuel Hanson, and (former Federal Reserve governor) Jeremy Stein at the Kansas City Fed's 2016 Jackson Hole symposium. In that discussion, they focused on a particular threat to financial stability: the tendency for private-sector financial intermediaries to finance risky assets using, in their words, \"dangerously large volumes of runnable short-term liabilities.\"\n\nA larger Fed balance sheet can help ensure an ample supply of government-issued safe short-term instruments, such as interest-bearing reserves. Greenwood and his coauthors argued that expanding the pool of safe short-term claims would undercut the market-based incentives for private intermediaries to issue too many of their own short-term liabilities. In this way, the Fed can crowd out private-sector maturity transformation without compromising the ability of conventional monetary policy to focus on the dual mandate: maximum employment and stable prices.\n\nI will note that the Greenwood-Hanson-Stein proposal is not without controversy. Many of the potential objections were discussed in comments by former Fed governor Randy Kroszner at the Kansas City conference. For example, an uncapped Fed supply of safe short-term assets may actually exacerbate flights to quality—and runs away from private markets—in times of financial stress, adding to rather than limiting the vulnerability of the financial system.\n\nI have myself put the Greenwood-Hanson-Stein financial stability argument in the supporting column of the case for a floor system. But I take the caveats seriously. As we proceed with the existing floor framework, we will need to monitor the performance of the system, and be alert to issues that are not yet apparent.\n\nConclusion\nThere remain many open questions as policy normalization proceeds. But this much is certain: the Committee continues to view the federal funds rate target as the primary tool to adjust the stance of monetary policy. The effects of the Committee's interest-rate tools are much more familiar to policymakers and markets than balance-sheet tools are. To my mind, that makes them the superior instrument for reaching and maintaining our dual goals of stable inflation and maximum employment.\n\nRegarding the funds rate, you all no doubt noticed an announcement on Wednesday in addition to the one concerning balance sheet policy. I'd like to guard against misinterpretation of what the FOMC means by patience. There has been some commentary suggesting that the Committee's intention to be patient in adjusting the target range is a definitive signal that there are no circumstances under which we would increase the policy rate for the remainder of the year.\n\nTo my way of thinking, that is not an accurate conclusion. I do not view this patient approach as constraining the Committee's options. We may move up; we may move down. I am open to all possibilities as we aim to support sustained economic expansion, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective. Markets should understand that, so I hope I have made my position clear.\n\nThank you for your attention and for the important work you do.",

            "content": "\n\nGood morning. Thanks, Nancy, for the kind introduction. Thank you, PARCA, for inviting me, and thanks for the important work you do. I'm flattered to be asked to speak alongside Governor Kay Ivey and Chauncy Lennon of the Lumina Foundation.\n\nAnd kudos to you all for braving the road work to get here. Living in Atlanta, I don't know anything about traffic problems.\n\nBefore I get to the meat of the topic, let me recognize a few other folks. If you don't already know our Birmingham regional executive, Anoop Mishra, then you should. Anoop keeps me plugged in to conditions on the ground throughout Alabama. That is key to the Fed's vital connection with Main Street. Welcome also to former Atlanta Fed board chair Larkin Martin, Birmingham Branch board members Brian Hamilton and David Benck, and former Birmingham board member Macke Mauldin. Larkin and Macke serve on the executive committee of PARCA's board.\n\nI've visited Birmingham several times in nearly two years at the Atlanta Fed, and it's always a pleasure. You exemplify what I find most hopeful across the Southeast: a passionate commitment to your community.\n\nNow, the theme of the day is workforce development. I'd like to talk about why we view effective workforce development as essential to economic mobility and resilience in Alabama and the Southeast. Within that framework, I'll explore two fundamental features of a successful workforce development system. First is the capacity and commitment to ensure that people who face barriers to employment have access to effective training, employment, and support for job retention and career advancement. Second, I'll discuss why it is crucial to align education and training programs with real business needs. I will conclude with broader thoughts on why investment in workforce development is so important—for employers, for workers, and for the broader community.\n\nPlease keep in mind that these thoughts are strictly my own. I do not speak for my colleagues at the Atlanta Fed or for the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC.\n\nSoutheast a mosaic of many economies\nLet me begin with a few observations on the regional economy. The Sixth Federal Reserve District is in many ways a microcosm of the country. For those who may not know, the district includes Alabama, Florida, Georgia, the southern halves of Louisiana and Mississippi, and the eastern two-thirds of Tennessee.\n\nOn the whole, the district is doing well, with some standout markets. The unemployment rate here in Birmingham, for example, is below the national rate. Employment in Nashville and Atlanta has grown faster than in the nation as a whole through much of the recovery.\n\nBut look closer, and you'll see a great diversity of economies. Even in places with strong growth and numerous job openings, individuals struggle with unemployment and then face barriers when they try to return to work. While many of our metropolitan areas are magnets for newcomers, places such as Atlanta, Orlando, and Nashville rank among the worst in terms of economic mobility for locals and natives. By economic mobility, I mean, essentially, the ability of someone born on the lower rungs of the socioeconomic ladder to move up.\n\nI've traveled extensively across the Southeast in the past two years, and I can tell you virtually no one is living the national averages. Each distinct economy has its own opportunities and challenges, which should shape the strategy of a workforce development system. Broadly improving economic mobility is a daunting task. But we at the Atlanta Fed believe workforce development can play a central role by helping individuals build their human capital—their knowledge and skills—and make a decent living for themselves and their families. The more people who can do that, the better for all of us. The results are higher tax receipts and lower spending on public assistance, incarceration, and other programs focused mainly on the unemployed or underemployed.\n\nTailoring workforce development strategies to local conditions\nSo what can workforce development do to help achieve these results? Well, the first step is to tailor successful strategies to a regional and even local context. After all, a job training program that works in New York City during a booming economy may not work in a small, less vibrant southern city.\n\nLet me say a bit about the regional labor market. The labor force participation rate—particularly for individuals between their mid-20s and mid-50s—is lower in the Southeast than in the rest of the country.  Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi have especially low rates. In these three states, an unusually large share of people report that they don't participate in the job market because they are too sick or disabled to work, according to Atlanta Fed research. Interestingly, the prevalence of disability and illness in Alabama is higher than in most states across all ages, non-Hispanic ethnicities, and education levels, and in both urban and rural areas. If Alabama's labor force participation rate were closer to the national level, then another 200,000 people would become part of the state's workforce, which could help resolve what are projected to be fairly serious labor shortages in the coming years.\n\nWhile relatively fewer working-age adults are participating in the labor force, businesses are having trouble hiring. According to our research, about two-thirds of firms have difficulty hiring for jobs that don't require a bachelor's degree. The number is slightly higher for jobs requiring a four-year degree. Regardless of the education level businesses need, companies in rural areas are more likely than those in urban areas to have trouble hiring. The two most frequently reported reasons for hiring difficulty are (1) too few applicants and (2), for those who do apply, a lack of job-specific skills, education, or experience.\n\nWe're hearing the same feedback from business leaders. Workers are quitting to take better-paying jobs at an increasing rate, yet companies say it is taking longer to fill vacancies.\n\nWhy are these facts about the labor force relevant? Well, growth in the labor force is one of two fundamental ingredients in GDP growth, alongside labor productivity. It follows, then, that one approach to boosting economic growth is increasing the number of individuals in the labor force and equipping those individuals with the skills they need for their occupation or industry.\n\nWorkforce development must reach those who most need it\nRelatively low labor force participation and hiring difficulties also point to the central role of the 21st century workforce development system: improving economic opportunity, especially for those who face the greatest difficulties in the labor market, and meeting the needs of businesses and society for a highly skilled and competitive workforce.\n\nA work-based learning program in Augusta, Georgia, achieves both of those standards. Reaching Potential through Manufacturing, or RPM, is a partnership between the Richmond County School System and Textron Specialized Vehicles, which makes golf carts and other vehicles. Textron wanted to recruit a skilled workforce, and the school system wanted to improve academic and employment outcomes for at-risk and low-income students. The result was a program that combines traditional high school courses, on-the-job training, soft skills development, mentoring, and employment opportunities.\n\nStudents become part-time Textron employees. They work four-hour shifts while they take classes either at school or on site. Textron actually built classrooms and teachers' offices at its manufacturing facility. Textron pays the students and provides meals, transportation, and tutoring. The average attendance rate for the program's first year was 93 percent. The company hired nine of 24 students from the program's first class and helped additional graduates find jobs with other local businesses. That may sound like a small number, but keep in mind these are students who otherwise stood a good chance of not even graduating from high school.\n\nRPM is a great example of a business and a school system collaborating to improve outcomes for young people facing significant barriers to employment.\n\nMore cases like this, as well as insights from more than 100 workforce development experts, represent the bulk of a three-volume compendium titled Investing in America's Workforce. A collaboration of—bear with me here—the Federal Reserve, the John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers University, the Ray Marshall Center of the Lyndon B. Johnson School at the University of Texas, and the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research, the series highlights approaches to improve programs and systems to create an effective 21st century workforce development system.\n\n\n\nYou can download the book for free at investinwork.org.\n\nThe book covers many workforce development topics, but I want to stick to highlighting strategies that can help those who face barriers to employment.\n\n\n\nFor instance, a section of the book focuses on labor market challenges and opportunities for people with physical and intellectual disabilities and chronic health conditions. Every year, medical conditions cause many Americans to lose their jobs or drop out of the workforce. We've discussed what a sizable concern this is in Alabama. With the right set of early interventions, at least some of these workers could remain on the job. The book also includes targeted workforce development strategies for veterans, formerly incarcerated individuals, and other groups who face barriers to employment.\n\nThe importance of alignment\nLet me now turn to the second feature of a successful workforce development program: alignment. Ensuring that educators and trainers teach the skills that businesses say they need may sound simple, but doing it well remains a challenge. The good news is that rigorous evidence and experience are building a case for several work-based learning approaches.\n\nTake apprenticeships, which link paid on-the-job training and instruction focused on a particular job. This training and instruction lead to an industry-recognized credential that improves the apprentice's employability. Evidence suggests that apprenticeships increase earnings for workers and help businesses efficiently recruit and develop talent. It's a successful and popular model, but how do we ensure more students and businesses participate? South Carolina's Apprenticeship Carolina program shows one way to do it.\n\nThe program offers eligible businesses a $1,000 tax credit for each registered apprentice, which creates an incentive for businesses to participate. But its design is also based on the recognition that starting and running an apprenticeship is not always easy. To help, Apprenticeship Carolina uses regional apprenticeship consultants, who help businesses design and manage their individual apprenticeship programs.\n\nApprenticeship Carolina is working. Since 2007, the number of programs run by individual businesses has grown from 90 to more than 900, while the number of active apprentices has soared from 800 to more than 30,000.\n\nWhy investment in workforce development matters\nAccess and alignment are two important features that promote a successful workforce development system, and we are constantly on the lookout for more. I'd like to conclude by telling you why this is so important to me and to the Federal Reserve. This matters to us at the Fed because achieving our mandated goal of maximizing employment depends on broad access to economic opportunity.\n\nCertainly, labor market success will vary depending on individuals' actions and abilities. But these outcomes should not be predetermined by a person's socioeconomic background, gender, or race. Without equal access to opportunity, the country squanders economic potential and limits the possibilities of its people.\n\nAmericans have long extolled the relationship between hard work and economic mobility and resilience: work hard, and you can get ahead. We believe children should have a chance to do better than their parents. We believe if you experience an economic hardship like losing a job, that hardship should not become permanent. Few Americans would dispute these values. But when we examine whether we are living up to them, the evidence is sobering. Harvard's Raj Chetty and his colleagues found that just half of Americans born in 1984 earn more than their parents. That is down dramatically from 92 percent of Americans born in 1940.\n\n\n\nYou can see from this map that our region fares poorly in economic mobility. It shows the average household income for adult children of low-income parents. The red color so prevalent in the South means that children born to low-income parents here have lower incomes as adults relative to children born in other areas of the country into similar economic conditions.\n\nThese stark differences compel us to reflect on the forces that drive economic mobility and resilience, and to ask whether all Americans have equitable access to these drivers. Workforce development is a critical driver. Clearly, the challenges in building a workforce for the 21st century economy are formidable. But I see plenty of promise.\n\nPrograms like Apprenticeship Carolina and RPM are being replicated across the region. Alabama is among several southern states that have created multi-agency leadership groups to guide workforce development policies. I believe a critical mass of knowledge and will is solidifying around the need to build effective workforce development systems across the Southeast. Some of this will not happen without significant investment. Yet the cost of not doing it is far steeper.\n\nAs we go forward with workforce programs and systems, please know that one person can make a difference in helping someone find doorways to opportunity that are not always apparent. We at the Atlanta Fed look forward to working with you as you help others find these doorways.\n\n",

            "content": "\n\nGood morning. I'm pleased to be here in Chattanooga. I'd like to recognize Ben Brock, one of our Bank's Nashville Branch directors, and Craig Holley, a former Nashville Branch director, as well as to thank Chattanooga mayor Andy Berke and Hamilton County mayor Jim Coppinger.\n\nWe at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta see Chattanooga as an important city in the Sixth District. Three years ago, the Atlanta Fed's community and economic development staff highlighted your city's well-documented resurgence as part of its Small Cities Study Tour. They went so far as to describe Chattanooga as \"the poster child for the modern American small city renaissance.\" What made the difference? A unique network of committed funders, leaders, and volunteers drove development and innovation. This network has been complemented by an engaged and active local government that sustained these efforts.\n\nOver time, progress has become an expectation here. You are driven by moving toward the next great thing for your city and then by telling your story well. Many of you are responsible for this inspiring story. I applaud your vision and energy.\n\nAt a national level, we begin the new year with some of that hopefulness for the economy. Yet there seems to be a dichotomy between the strength of the economic data we have in hand and the many expressions of uncertainty we've been hearing about the economy's forward path. Today, I'd like to explain how I am analyzing these crosscurrents as I form my views on monetary policy.\n\nI'll begin with current conditions and talk about some of the tools we have and outreach we conduct at the Atlanta Fed that go well beyond the official statistics to help inform us of emerging trends. I'll explain how the Fed's connection with Main Street is a key element of what I mean by data dependence. Then I'll offer my economic outlook and some of the risks I am seeing around that outlook.\n\nAs always, the views I will express are my personal views. My colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, and in the Federal Reserve System may not agree.\n\nCurrent economic conditions\nLooking back, it is clear that 2018 was a stellar year. Real gross domestic product (GDP) likely expanded by more than 3 percent on a year-over-year basis in 2018, making it the strongest full year for growth during the current expansion, now more than nine years long.\n\nPerhaps equally as impressive, the unemployment rate was at or below 4 percent for much of 2018, and payrolls increased by more than 2.5 million workers. Inflation—as measured by the personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, price index—on a year-over-year basis trended toward the Federal Open Market Committee's 2 percent inflation objective.\n\nIn short, the official aggregate statistics for 2018 looked quite good. This is an economy that, by all appearances, ought to be able to stand on its own, without much support, or accommodation, from monetary policy.\n\nAnd it is largely from this standpoint that I supported the 25-basis-point increase in the federal funds rate at the December FOMC meeting. With this move, I think the Committee has likely come close to achieving a neutral policy stance—one that is neither providing accommodation nor is being restrictive and attempting to actively slow the economy.\n\nI say \"likely\" because the neutral interest rate is not something we directly observe, but is something that we infer from mounds of data, economic and statistical models, and a healthy dose of judgment. There's a fair amount of uncertainty regarding these estimates of the neutral rate, so we need a data-dependent approach to monetary policy going forward.\n\nWhat is data dependence?\nAny avid Fed watcher has, without a doubt, heard the phrase \"data dependence\" myriad times. If you'll indulge me for a moment, I'd like to explain what it means to me. Yes, data dependence means paying close attention to official data releases that help inform us about the aggregate economy from three-lettered organizations headquartered in the Washington, DC, area—places like the BEA (the Bureau of Economic Analysis) and the BLS (the Bureau of Labor Statistics), for example. But it also includes monitoring data regarding financial market conditions, data that inform me about global economic conditions, and data from a variety of surveys to keep me abreast of changes in sentiment that may affect business and consumer decision-making.\n\nI look to these other sources because, more often than not, available data aren't sufficient to get a full view of developing economic conditions. This is the reason that my execution of data dependence employs multiple efforts at the Atlanta Fed that go well beyond just tracking the official statistics.\n\nIn some cases, we have taken publicly available data and created new tools that are more closely tailored to the needs of a central banker. One of these tools is the Wage Growth Tracker, which gives us a read on wage growth that's less likely to be influenced by changes in the flow of people into and out of employment. Another is GDPNow, a tracking estimate of current-quarter real GDP growth designed to mimic the BEA's procedures and give us an early heads-up on the next official GDP estimate. Both of these are available on our website, and I encourage you to sign up and follow them.\n\nIn addition, my views are substantially informed by several efforts at the Atlanta Fed that leverage the knowledge of people like those of you in this room. Two important initiatives are our Business Inflation Expectations Survey and the Survey of Business Uncertainty, which we developed with partners at the Chicago Booth School and Stanford University. These surveys fill gaps in the data regarding the inflation expectations of firms and how today's environment is affecting their decision-making and uncertainty about hiring and capital investment plans.\n\nBut I also lean heavily on an extensive network of business contacts, community groups, and nonprofit organizations. Some of you are familiar with the Atlanta Fed's Regional Economic Information Network (or REIN). Many of you know Laurel Graefe and her colleagues at our Nashville Branch, who are with us here this morning. Laurel's full-time job is to keep me plugged in to the economic conditions on the ground. And she's not alone. REIN executives and their staffs in our four other branches and the Atlanta office help me glean a broader, more in-depth picture of the health of the economy than I could capture with my own outreach efforts or from economic models and official data alone. REIN is my critical connection to Main Street. This Main Street connection is a key element of what I mean by data dependence.\n\nEconomic outlook and risks\nUltimately, I have to turn all of these various data-collection efforts into an outlook for the overall economy. By its very nature, monetary policy has to be forward looking. The various sources of hard and soft data are useful in guiding my assessment of what the future is likely to bring and what important risks there are to that outlook.\n\nMy current baseline outlook for the U.S. economy in 2019 is for another year of solid growth, although I do expect growth to be a bit slower than in 2018 as the temporary effects from fiscal stimulus and tax reform begin to fade. From there, my projection is that growth will ease further to a bit below 2 percent by the end of 2020. It is important to stress that this lower pace of growth does not show fundamental pessimism about the economy. Rather, it mostly reflects the reality that the size of the working-age population—the key input into producing goods and services—is expected to grow much more slowly over the next decade or so than it has in the past.\n\nInflation, in my baseline projection, remains relatively close to the FOMC's 2 percent target, reflecting my confidence that monetary policy will be able to foster price stability amid robust labor markets and alongside the solid trajectory for growth that I just mentioned.\n\nCould the economy grow faster than I expect without causing a breakout of much higher inflation? Yes. It is possible that labor productivity—the ability to produce extra value for every hour worked—will grow more rapidly than it has over the last decade. Over the past 10 years, productivity growth has averaged around 1.3 percent a year, a stark contrast to the nearly 3 percent pace experienced during the early 2000s.\n\nSo, why don't I have a significant pickup in productivity growth baked into my outlook? Primarily because a key driver of productivity growth is capital spending, and readings on capital spending since mid-2018 have been relatively subdued. They are not consistent with the business sector ramping up for significantly expanding capacity. For example, overall investment in equipment and software appears to have slowed, while investment in nonresidential structures has declined. Moreover, recent business survey readings on the outlook for capital expenditures in 2019 have softened considerably.\n\nI'll admit that changes in productivity are difficult to anticipate, and perhaps we are on the cusp of a new era of higher productivity growth. Absent a sustained uptick in productivity growth, better-than-expected GDP growth will require a continued strong pace of hiring. But the prospect of continuing to add roughly 200,000 new jobs to the economy each month will become increasingly doubtful without risking a significant rise in labor costs and potentially higher inflation.\n\nBy most measures, labor markets are already tight. The national unemployment rate is at a roughly 50-year low, and here in the Chattanooga area, it is as low as it was during the late 1990s. Business leaders I speak with have been increasingly frustrated by the difficulty in filling vacancies and retaining staff. Workers are leaving their current jobs for new ones at a high rate, yet firms are reporting that it is taking longer and longer to fill vacancies. That said, we haven't yet seen any evidence that growth in labor costs has become significantly disentangled from average productivity growth and stable inflation. But it's definitely something I'm watching as 2019 unfolds.\n\nAs you might expect given the recent upheaval in financial markets, there are many additional risks to my baseline outlook. I view recent market turmoil as not the cause, but a symptom of the various concerns and uncertainties surrounding the outlook. These include slowing global growth, uncertain trade policy, worries over the trajectory of growth domestically, and concern regarding the expected stance of monetary policy.\n\nIn face-to-face interviews with contacts and through the efforts of REIN, businesses in the Sixth Federal Reserve District appear to be growing more concerned about future business conditions, creating a \"risk-off\" environment with regard to business plans. To this end, I heard a few reports that companies are starting to examine their own business strategies and initiatives in anticipation of slowing economic conditions—either through deleveraging or holding off on expansionary projects.\n\nWorries over tariffs and trade have dominated the conversations about the outlook and are present in the survey evidence we collect. Every December for the past few years, we have asked Sixth District firms in our Business Inflation Expectations Survey to provide their biggest concerns for the year ahead. We then categorize their responses into a broad set of topics. Over the past three years, \"costs\" has topped the list. The interesting part is that inside this broad category, the main driver of cost concerns has changed each year. This year, tariffs emerged as the dominant source of concern regarding business costs in the year ahead, even outstripping concerns over labor costs.\n\nWhile these businesses appear to have absorbed the initial rounds of tariffs, should tariff rates increase from here or encompass a broader set of goods, my contacts have said this would likely create significant challenges. Many appear to have reached their limit on cost-absorbing measures, making a possible next round of tariffs a more direct hit to the consumer. Concerns over what that would do to sales growth are top of mind among these business contacts at the moment.\n\nData-dependent approach to monetary policy\nSo grassroots intelligence from Main Street and messages from Wall Street indicate heightened uncertainty and concern about the economy. But the aggregate economic data continue to paint a robust picture. What is a policymaker to conclude from these mixed signals?\n\nTo me, the appropriate response is to be patient in adjusting the stance of policy and to wait for greater clarity about the direction of the economy and the risks to the outlook.\n\nShould conditions play out along my baseline outlook, I see little need to engage in restrictive monetary policy and push the federal funds rate above a neutral stance. All the available evidence at the moment points to caution regarding firms' approach to expansion. As long as that caution exists, I suspect it will act as a natural governor, limiting inflationary forces without the need for a muscular stance of policy. But I am not taking this outcome for granted. My staff and I will continue to closely monitor the path of our progress in meeting the Federal Reserve's objectives for both maximum employment and price stability.\n\nTo sum up, my view is that a patient approach to monetary policy adjustments in the coming year is fully warranted in light of the uncertainties about the state of the economy and about what level of policy rates is consistent with a neutral stance. That is what I mean by data dependence.",

            "content": "Good afternoon, and thank you for that kind introduction. It's a pleasure to be here today.\n\nWe are less than two weeks away from the December meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (or FOMC). I won't predict the outcome—I'll leave that to you. Between now and the meeting, I will continue to process the incoming data to inform my assessment of the health and momentum of the economy and balance the risks to the outlook.\n\nToday, I will offer a few thoughts on how I see the current position of the economy, the national economic outlook, and some particulars on the labor market, inflation, and risk management as I consider the monetary policy path.\n\nAs always, these will be my personal views and may not reflect those of my colleagues here or other colleagues on the FOMC or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nCurrent economic conditions\nThere is a lot to like about the current snapshot of the U.S. economy. Output has continued to grow at an above-trend clip, the unemployment rate is very low on a historical basis, and inflation has held near the FOMC's 2 percent target recently.\n\nReal, inflation-adjusted gross domestic product (GDP) has been on something of a tear recently. Over the first three quarters of 2018, real GDP has increased by 3.3 percent. And according to GDPNow, the Atlanta Fed's in-house tracking model, GDP is expected to increase by a little more than 2 1/2 percent in the fourth quarter.\n\nTo be sure, this early in the fourth quarter, there is a lot of uncertainty about the estimate. But if it holds, growth for the year will have topped 3 percent for the first time since 2005. And it will have come in about a half-percentage point higher than I expected even just six months ago.\n\nAlongside the robust pace of economic growth we have enjoyed this year, job gains have averaged roughly 200,000 a month and the unemployment rate has fallen to 3.7 percent, a level that has not been sustained for at least a half-century.\n\nWe will, of course, get an important update on labor market conditions in tomorrow's labor report. I think we are very close to meeting the first half of the FOMC's dual mandate—promoting maximum sustainable employment growth. And it's possible that we have gone some measure beyond. I will say a bit more on this later.\n\nThe other half of the FOMC's mandate is to deliver price stability, which has been defined as 2 percent inflation over the longer run. As of October, the year-over-year percent change in the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index was at 2 percent. Excluding food and energy prices, the core PCE price index was just a notch below that on a year-over-year basis. Transparency requires that I note that its performance over the past three months has been modestly weaker. Still, if you paint with a broad enough brush, inflation is either at or very close to our target.\n\nIt's possible that some of the unexpectedly strong growth we've seen this year can be tied to a more robust response by households to income tax cuts along with a faster ramp-up in federal spending than I anticipated.\n\nConsumer spending has accelerated this year, and especially over the past two quarters. Interestingly, the acceleration seems to be concentrated in two arguably discretionary spending categories—apparel and food services. In fact, the pickup in household spending at restaurants has led to its highest two-quarter growth rate since the early 1990s, more than tripling its typical contribution to overall output growth.\n\nGoing forward, my baseline view is that consumer spending will revert to a less torrid but still solid pace. I hold this view, in part, because the latest monthly data on apparel and food services have softened. This may also suggest that some of the impacts from tax reform on household spending growth are waning.\n\nThe pace of federal government spending has also quickened over the second half of the year, turning from a headwind to a tailwind for growth, and is now adding about a fourth of a percentage point to growth, on average, over the past four quarters.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, business investment has remained relatively tepid. Nonresidential fixed investment has slowed in each of the first three quarters of 2018. After factoring in a small rebound we expect to see in the fourth quarter, the year-over-year growth rate in business fixed investment will likely still be slightly below its average growth rate during the past two expansions.\n\nEconomic outlook\nNow to my outlook. Like many other forecasters, I see real GDP growth slowing over the next few years as the effects of tax reform and fiscal stimulus begin to wane. By the end of 2020, my projection has real GDP keeping pace with the underlying potential growth rate of the economy, which I estimate to be modestly below 2 percent.\n\nOne reason I'm a bit skeptical that the current pace of growth can be sustained into the next year is the trajectory of capital expenditures. That view is primarily informed by two unique research initiatives undertaken by my bank's research department.\n\nThe first is an extensive network of business contacts, community groups, and nonprofit organizations that we affectionately call REIN—or the Regional Economic Information Network. Insights from this REIN network help me paint a broader picture of the health of the economy than I could capture with economic models alone.\n\nThe other initiative is an exciting new national survey of firms. In partnership with Steven Davis of the University of Chicago Booth School of Business and Nicholas Bloom of Stanford University, the Atlanta Fed has created the Survey of Business Uncertainty (or SBU). This innovative panel survey measures the one-year-ahead expectations and uncertainties that firms have about their own costs, employment, capital investment, and sales. The sample covers a broad range of firm sizes and all regions of the U.S. economy, and every industry sector except agriculture and government.\n\nLast November, after the original House bill on tax reform had passed, the SBU had a survey in the field asking firms how tax reform would affect their capital expenditure plans for 2018. Roughly two-thirds of respondents said the reform wouldn't affect their capital expenditures at all. Just 15 percent said they would increase capital spending by 10 percent or more, and those responses came mostly from smaller firms.\n\nThese results held in a follow-up survey in February. The survey asked the same question on capital expenditures for 2018 and extended it to include plans for 2019 as well. The results were not meaningfully different than before for 2018. Roughly three-quarters of firms did not plan to change their capital expenditure plans in 2019 as a result of the tax reform.\n\nAnd, arguably, this has been borne out in the middling trajectory for business investment we have seen so far.\n\n\n\nNow, before you think I'm keeping these great insights from the Survey of Business Uncertainty to myself, I'll invite you to visit our website. Last Wednesday, the Atlanta Fed began publishing some of these data. The hope is that policymakers and researchers can use the SBU to help forecast economic activity and better understand how business expectations and uncertainty affect economic outcomes.\n\nI see both upside and downside risks to my growth projection. On the upside, businesses may interpret the recent strength of consumer spending as a signal of stronger future demand and may ramp up expansionary capital investment to meet it.\n\nOn the other hand, the U.S. economy has been beset by increasing uncertainties that may slow its growth, such as international trade tensions, the potential slowing of the global economy, and a recent bout of financial volatility. Indeed, our SBU survey data suggest that business uncertainty has increased since the beginning of the year.\n\nTo be clear, while uncertainty regarding tariffs and changes in trade policy remains a feature of the economic backdrop, most firms appear to have taken this in stride. According to our survey data, businesses are still generally quite optimistic about their outlook over the year ahead.\n\nThoughts on the policy path\nGiven the current constellation of strong growth, very low unemployment rates, and inflation close to 2 percent, I think that monetary policy ought to be taking a more neutral position—one that neither provides policy accommodation nor hinders growth.\n\nWhile that sounds easy enough, this neutral rate is not something we observe directly, and as such, we can only infer its position. So in attempting to achieve a neutral stance of policy, I have adopted a risk management approach, attempting to balance both the upside and downside risks to a further removal of accommodation.\n\nThose risks are, one, staying too accommodative on rates and risking an overheated and unstable economic and financial environment. And, two, pushing rates up too far, too fast and potentially short-circuiting an otherwise sustainable expansion. And it just so happens I have a picture that helps highlight those risks.\n\n\n\nThis slide shows periods of time when the actual unemployment rate fell below what the U.S. Congressional Budget Office now estimates as the so-called natural rate of unemployment. I refer to these episodes as \"high-pressure\" periods.\n\nHere is the punchline. Dating back to 1960, every high-pressure period ended in a recession. And all but one recession was preceded by a high-pressure period.\n\nThere are many possible interpretations for the leading relationship between high-pressure periods and economic downturns. One is that the relationship is entirely spurious. But I'm not convinced that such a benign interpretation is consistent with good risk management practice.\n\nI think a risk management approach requires that we at least consider the possibility that unemployment rates that are lower than normal for an extended period are symptoms of an overheated economy.\n\nOne potential consequence of overheating is that inflationary pressures inevitably build up, leading the central bank to take a much more \"muscular\" stance of policy at the end of these high-pressure periods to combat rising nominal pressures. Economic weakness follows.\n\nYou might argue that the simple answer is to not respond so aggressively to building signs of inflation, but that would entail risks that few responsible central bankers would accept.\n\nIt is true that the Fed and most other advanced-economy central banks have the luxury of solid credibility for achieving and maintaining their price stability goals. But we shouldn't forget that such credibility was hard won.\n\nInflation expectations are reasonably stable for now, but we know little about how far the scales can tip before it is no longer so.\n\nOn the other hand, there are decided risks to raising rates too soon and too aggressively.\n\nThe crux of the issue, as I see it, is that it is very difficult in real time to determine when the economy is actually overheating. That is especially true at the moment, when the signaling from the nominal side of the economy is, if anything, still a bit subdued.\n\nWhile nominal wage growth has picked up since the beginning of the year, it is still trending in line with productivity growth and inflation. Inflation itself has, if anything, softened slightly over the past three months.\n\nI know that on this picture the \"normal\" or natural rate of unemployment is drawn with a sharp black line, but in reality it's best to think about that line as more of a blurred zone or range. My definition of normal is a sustainable level that avoids overheating the economy. I would have pegged an unemployment rate around 5 percent as normal when the Committee started down the path of normalization in 2015. Fast forward to September of this year, and the Committee's longer-run consensus projection for the unemployment rate had fallen by almost half a percentage point, to 4.5 percent. And, I'm on record suggesting it may even be lower than that. So the red zone could be smaller than what you see here.\n\nEstimating the capacity of the economy—of which the unemployment rate is just one measure—is extremely difficult, not least because it can be a moving target. One example is the behavior of the U.S. labor force participation rate.\n\nThe labor force participation rate of prime-age U.S. workers, especially women, has actually been rising. We have no solid explanation for this trend. But it is reasonable to suspect that larger flows of workers into the labor market, smaller flows of unemployed workers out of the labor market, and still relatively modest wage pressures are signs that there may be more slack in labor markets than implied if we just focused on the unemployment rate. Some might argue that this is further evidence that we are right at or close to full employment rather than measurably beyond it.\n\nConclusion\nSo, in an environment where even defining the concept of overheating is a challenge, how can we balance the risks of being too timid with the risk of being too muscular? For me, the answer is to proceed cautiously, with a keen eye on the data. This will particularly be the case over the next six to 12 months, as I look for signals in the data that might confirm or refute my current position.\n\nI currently think we're within shouting distance of neutral, and I do think neutral is where we want to be. I'm not seeing clear signs of overheating, nor am I seeing any indications of a material weakening in the macroeconomic data at the moment.\n\nThat said, should the data deliver clearer signals of either, I would be fully prepared to support policy actions to mitigate the risks in either direction.",

            "content": "Thank you for inviting me to speak tonight. It's an honor to be among so many distinguished colleagues from across the globe.\n\nWe are just about a week past the latest Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, meeting. Understandably, a lot of attention focused on what signal the Committee might send about the near-term path of the federal funds rate.\n\nIn my remarks this evening, I would like to shift the focus away from the \"how many more rate moves\" question. Instead, I'm going to talk about the framework that informs my thinking about U.S. monetary policy—in terms of both where we've been and the risks we might consider in defining the next phase. In particular, I'm going to address what, if any, further adjustments might be needed to get to a neutral policy.\n\nAs you may know, these comments reflect only my own opinions. Nothing I say tonight necessarily reflects the thinking of my FOMC colleagues or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nReview of the path to the present\nLet's begin the story in late 2015. Just about three years ago, the FOMC began the process of normalizing its monetary policy stance. The Committee moved the target range for the federal funds rate up from the near-zero floor that had been in place since December 2008. At the time, the unemployment rate stood at 5 percent. That's half the level it reached following the crisis.\n\nThe initial increase in the policy target was modest—a 25-basis-point rise—and that gradual pace has become characteristic of the policy path since then. So even with the first upward adjustment in the funds rate target, policy remained extremely accommodative.\n\nGiven the facts on the ground, continued accommodation was fully justified. In its statement and published projections, the Committee noted that there was still room for improvement in labor markets.\n\nPerhaps more important, inflation remained a distance from the FOMC's longer-run price stability objective. At the time, core inflation was expected to come in well below 2 percent for 2015, and to not recover fully until this year. Given that the road of an economic forecaster is usually a rocky one, it is worth noting that the FOMC's outlook was amazingly prescient. On a year-over-year basis, overall inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, price index was a mere 0.3 percent by the end of 2015. The inflation rate did not consistently reach the neighborhood of 2 percent until this year.\n\nBy June 2017, the FOMC had moved its target range for the federal funds rate up by a full percentage point. The unemployment rate had fallen to 4.3 percent, far surpassing expectations. The inflation outlook had progressed roughly as anticipated. So the Committee decided to take the next step in the normalization process by announcing that it would slowly shrink the size of the Fed's balance sheet, which had more than quadrupled in the wake of the crisis.\n\nThe balance sheet normalization strategy was formulated under two guiding principles. The first was to implement the wind-down in a manner that would not disrupt financial markets. The second was to put the balance-sheet rundown in the background, if you will, focusing ongoing policy adjustments via the traditional interest rate channel. For these reasons, the Committee chose a process that was phased in, gradual, and based on a relatively fixed schedule. By most accounts, mine included, this strategy has been successful.\n\nWhich brings us to today. As I have noted, inflation is effectively at the FOMC's longer-run 2 percent objective. The unemployment rate has fallen to 3.7 percent, a level that has not been sustained for at least a half-century. So we are very close to the FOMC's other key goal—promoting maximum sustainable employment growth. Possibly, we have gone some measure beyond.\n\nThis is a record of great progress, and I believe that it is at least in part a result of the FOMC's deliberate, but patient, removal of monetary accommodation. In my view, conditions warrant the final steps in removing any remaining accommodation and adopting a neutral stance of monetary policy. The question now is as complicated as it is straightforward: What, if any, further adjustments are necessary to get to neutral?\n\nA balance of risks\nIn a recent speech, Fed Chairman Jay Powell emphasized the role that risk management plays in the FOMC's decision-making. He explained how an important element of good policy is calibrating it to manage both upside and downside risk.\n\nI couldn't agree more. As I noted in a speech I delivered last month in Baton Rouge, Louisiana: with the economy performing well and monetary policy seemingly within shouting distance of neutral, the FOMC faces both upside and downside risks with its next set of policy adjustments. As I see it, the Committee now must balance the risks of stopping short of full normalization and risking an overheated and unstable economic environment, versus going too far and short-circuiting an otherwise sustainable expansion.\n\nI will speak to each of these risks in turn.\n\nToo timid, too long\nIs there is a risk of being too timid, for too long? Yes, and that risk would start with my earlier observation that the current level of the unemployment rate is historically quite low. Not only is the current rate at 3.7 percent but, as reflected in the Summary of Economic Projections published in September, the consensus of FOMC participants is that this level will be maintained for at least the next three years. A sustained unemployment rate of 3.7 percent or below has been seen only twice in the post-World War II era—and not at all since the late 1960s.\n\nPerhaps more to the point, the current level of the unemployment rate is below that which the consensus of the Committee views as sustainable in the long run. The central tendency in FOMC participants' latest projections ranges from 4.3 to 4.6 percent.\n\nNow I'll show what many would consider a disturbing picture. It highlights periods of time when the actual unemployment rate fell below what the U.S. Congressional Budget Office now estimates as the so-called natural rate of unemployment. I refer to these episodes as \"high-pressure\" periods.\n\n\n\nHere is the punchline. Dating back to 1960, every high-pressure period ended in a recession. And, all but one recession was preceded by a high-pressure period.\n\nThere are many possible interpretations for the leading relationship between high-pressure periods and downturns in the economy. One is that the relationship is entirely spurious. That would be a pretty benign interpretation. I'm not convinced that such a benign interpretation is consistent with good risk management practice.\n\nI think a risk management approach requires that we at least consider the possibility that unemployment rates that are lower than normal for an extended period are symptoms of an overheated economy.\n\nOne possible consequence of overheating is that decision-making in the private sector becomes increasingly risky, and imbalances, especially in financial markets, build up. As of yet, there does not appear to be evidence of widespread imbalances in the United States.\n\nBut I am not taking the current situation for granted. As an example, I have my eye on some recent evidence in the consumer credit market that I think bears watching. We have seen rising delinquencies on consumer credit cards at small banks. While they are not currently driving the core of the market, rising delinquencies that manifest in the small bank sector may spill out and become a broader issue. So while the aggregate picture is still a healthy one, these pockets of concern call for a more careful scrutiny of risks.\n\nAnother consequence of overheating is that inflationary pressures inevitably build up, leading the central bank, in turn, to respond aggressively, and economic weakness follows.\n\nYou might argue that the simple answer is to not respond so aggressively to building signs of inflation, but that would entail risks that few responsible central bankers would accept.\n\nIt is true that the Fed and most other advanced-economy central banks have the luxury of solid credibility for achieving and maintaining their price stability goals. But we shouldn't forget that such credibility was hard won.\n\nInflation expectations are stable for now, but we know little about how far the scales can tip before it is no longer so. With apologies to Joni Mitchell, when it comes to inflation expectations, \"you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone.\" I don't think it would be a good idea to find out.\n\nRisks of going too fast\nBut just as there are risks to too-timid policy adjustments, there are decidedly risks to policy adjustments that are too aggressive.\n\nThe main uncertainty, as I see it, is that it is very difficult to determine when the economy is actually overheating—especially when inflationary signals across the board remain subdued.\n\nConsider, for example, the task of determining the \"normal\" rate of unemployment. My definition of normal is a sustainable level that avoids overheating in the economy. I would have pegged an unemployment rate around 5 percent as normal when the Committee started down the path of normalization in 2015. My view now is that the longer-run \"normal\" rate of unemployment is a good deal closer to 4 percent than 5 percent.\n\nEstimating the capacity of the economy—about which the unemployment rate is just one measure—is extremely difficult, not least because it can be a moving target. One example is the behavior of the U.S. labor force participation rate.\n\nMost economists accept that the secular trend of the participation rate is negative, due to the aging of the population. But the overall rate ticked up in the latest report, and has been basically flat for the past several years.\n\nThe labor force participation rate of prime-age U.S. workers, especially women, has actually been on the rise. We have no solid interpretation for this trend. But it is reasonable to suspect that larger flows of workers into the labor market, smaller flows of unemployed workers out of the labor market, and still relatively modest wage pressures are signs that there may be more slack in labor markets than typically assumed.\n\nI found another example that capacity may be more flexible than we might think in a recent report from my staff. The Atlanta Fed collects anecdotal information from businesses throughout our district. These field reports—collected as part of what we call the Regional Economic Information Network, or REIN—have for some time included reports of acute shortages in the trucking industry.\n\nIn the most recent reports, we heard some interesting news. The recent implementation of technologies that monitor and help to enforce restrictions on how long truck drivers can be on the clock has leveled the playing field in the industry. The competitive pressures have resulted in trucking companies urging their customers to adopt processes that have resulted in less downtime as drivers wait for their cargo to be unloaded. The faster turnaround time has actually increased capacity in the industry—a result of greater efficiency rather than a greater number of trucks or truck drivers.\n\nI don't know if this sort of development is a game changer. But it was notable to me that this anecdote came from one of the sectors that has persistently cited capacity strains. It was notable at least as a reminder that capacity is always a slippery concept.\n\nIn addition to the hazards of defining a concept like overheating, there are some rather straightforward downside macroeconomic risks. At least some of the strength in GDP growth this year can be traced to fiscal stimulus. I expect this effect to fade over the next several years. Although fiscal stimulus has clearly boosted growth in the present, I don't think we have a firm grasp on whether it is masking any building weakness for the longer run.\n\nAdd to these potential risks the uncertain outcome of global tariff and trade developments. In general, global growth seems to be slowing. Although the United States could have safely ignored these developments in the past, assuming that this is true today seems like a recipe for a policy mistake.\n\nConclusion\nHow, then, to manage the balance between the risks of being too timid and being too aggressive in the Fed's monetary policy course? I can think of no superior approach than to proceed cautiously and keep a keen eye on the data.\n\nI don't think we are too far from a neutral policy, and neutral is where we want to be. We may not be there quite yet, but I am inclined to think that a tentative approach as we proceed would be appropriate.\n\nBut I am also prepared to support a more aggressive approach than my baseline view should the data deliver clearer signals of overheating. We are, for example, finally seeing some movement on wage growth. In and of itself, this is a good thing. But accelerating wage pressures would be of concern if coupled with other signs of building inflationary pressures.\n\nI don't think I am relaying to you anything other than common sense. But what is good risk management, after all, if not the application of common sense?\n\nThanks for your attention. I look forward to our moderated session.",

            "content": "I'm delighted to be in Baton Rouge and to join you at this business roundtable today. I know the Louisiana Committee of 100 shares the Atlanta Fed's goal of fostering economic prosperity for everyone in our communities.\n\nThe work you have championed to improve regional workforce development at the Cyber Innovation Center and early childhood care and education through the Louisiana Early Childhood Business Roundtable are just two examples of where your efforts dovetail with ours.\n\nI'd like to recognize two folks attending this afternoon: Jude Melville of Business First Bank is a member of the Atlanta Fed's Community Depository Institutions Advisory Council, and Stephen or \"Stevie\" Toups of Turner Industries is a member of our Energy Advisory Council. Thank you both for being here and for your service to our Bank.\n\nBefore I get too far into my remarks, I'd like to do a commercial. As many of you may know, we have an outreach program at the Atlanta Fed that we call REIN—the Regional Economic Information Network. Our regional executives, like Adrienne Slack here in Louisiana, and their staffs spend nearly all of their time out in the field, meeting with business leaders like you to get your take on economic trends, opportunities, and challenges. Through these meetings, they bring me real-time, real-world stories that paint a forward-looking picture of the economies in the Sixth Federal Reserve District and help inform my thinking on policy directions. So I have a request for you: When Adrienne or someone from our REIN team calls you, please take the call and meet with them. Only with your help can I have the best information possible when deliberating on policy.\n\nIn my comments today, I'd like to provide my latest view of the economy and my economic outlook. I'll share some thoughts on how my outlook has evolved since the beginning of the year. Then I'll offer my views on what the Federal Reserve is trying to achieve with our current monetary policy path and what might happen if we fail to act.\n\nBefore I begin, let me say that I am offering only my personal opinions today. I'm not speaking for anyone else in the Federal Reserve System or for the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC.\n\nCurrent economic conditions\nThe economy is in a good place. So good, in fact, that as I was sitting down to write this speech, I struggled to come up with sufficient variations on the word \"strong.\" Strong has many definitions that can describe physical prowess, the intensity of an odor or flavor, and, in physics, a type of force between particles. But one definition stands out to me as particularly apt to describe the economy at this moment: strong—able to withstand great force or pressure.\n\nAt the moment, there are headwinds in the form of tariffs, trade restrictions, and market volatility, each with the potential to disrupt economic activity and materially slow growth. There are also tailwinds in the form of recent tax reform and fiscal stimulus, with the potential to push economic growth up well beyond its longer-run potential.\n\nYet, after digging through the data, consulting our economic models, and gathering a Main Street perspective from our extensive network of business contacts, I come away with the sense that economic growth is on a strong trajectory. It's on solid footing and hasn't been materially pushed higher or lower.\n\nThat does not mean that the trajectory for the economy is immovable. As I will note later, there are ample reasons for a central banker like me to be concerned. But, from my perspective, the economy is performing well enough to stand on its own without support from accommodative monetary policy.\n\nOn Friday, we will get our first reading on real gross domestic product (or GDP) in the third quarter. Many analysts expect growth in the 3 1/2 percent range. Our own in-house tracking model—GDPNow—has an estimate that is slightly higher than that.\n\nIt's important to put that 3 1/2 percent figure in some context. Over the entire economic expansion, 37 quarters so far, real GDP growth has risen at an annualized rate of 2.3 percent. Given that trend, one quarter above 3 percent growth is not all that unusual. However, on the heels of the second quarter's 4.2 percent annualized increase in real GDP, this may suggest that the economy is shifting into a higher gear.\n\nEconomic outlook\nAs a result of these higher-than-expected GDP growth numbers in the second and third quarters, I've revised up my 2018 projection. I have also moved up my 2019 growth forecast a bit in light of the performance of the consumer over the past two quarters. But a note of caution remains with firms and households regarding longer-term investments.\n\nThat said, I do see the risks as being tilted to the upside. Should consumer spending hew to a higher growth trajectory, I suspect that would prompt firms to respond by ratcheting up expansionary investment.\n\nUncertainty from tariffs and recent changes in trade policy remain a feature of the economic landscape. That appears to be particularly true for Louisiana and its deep connection to oil and gas exploration. A Brookings Institution report released earlier this year identified Louisiana as highly exposed to the tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, ranked only behind Missouri in terms of its share of imports. So I imagine this is something you're all thinking a lot about.\n\nHowever, by all appearances, the majority of firms have remained resilient in the face of these risks. Businesses have yet to suggest that uncertainty regarding tariffs and trade policy has significantly changed their plans for employment, sales revenue, or capital spending.\n\nCosts are the one area where I have picked up a potential impact from changes in trade policy. Firms in my district are describing an upward shift in their cost structure. However, we have not yet seen a significant pass-through of higher costs into the final consumer space. Inflation remains stable, hovering around the FOMC's 2 percent objective.\n\nStill, the potential for changes in trade policy to affect the costs of production—through either direct tariffs, supply-chain disruptions, or firms switching to higher-cost routes to import supplies—remains a risk to my inflation outlook.\n\nMonetary policy: Shifting to neutral\nGiven the current strength of the economy and that retail prices are already \"on target,\" I supported the 25 basis point increase in the federal funds target range to 2 to 2 1/4 percent at the September FOMC meeting. And, unless the data talk me out of it, I view a continued, gradual removal of policy accommodation as appropriate until we get to a neutral policy rate.\n\nI want to be clear here. My assessment is that monetary policy has not yet reached a neutral stance. We are still providing accommodation. Let me use the analogy of driving a car: if the economy is the car and the driver is the FOMC, in my view we are still giving the economy gas at the moment. We have yet to pump the brakes.\n\nHigh-pressure economies: A policy consideration\nHere's a picture I've been thinking a lot about lately (see the next figure). I think it explains an important conversation monetary policymakers are having at the moment. The blue line in the figure is the official unemployment rate from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The black line is what's referred to as the natural rate of unemployment. This one is the current estimate from the Congressional Budget Office (or CBO).\n\n\n\nAs the CBO defines it, the natural rate is \"the unemployment rate that arises from all sources other than fluctuations in demand associated with business cycles.\" These \"other sources\" include frictions like the time it takes people to find a job or frictions due to a mismatch between the set of skills workers currently possess and the set of skills employers want to find.\n\nI think it is important to point out that we do not observe the natural rate directly. It's something we infer from statistical models, other labor market indicators, and indicators of wage and price pressure. So, there's some uncertainty about that black line, and it can be substantial. But let's set that aside for the moment.\n\nWhen the actual unemployment rate dips below the natural rate—highlighted as the red areas in the figure—the economy has moved into what economists call a \"high-pressure period.\" For simplicity, you can think of this as moving beyond full employment.\n\nAnd I think here's the interesting policy conundrum. What happens at the end of every high-pressure period? A recession or gray bar in the figure. The real question is why. One view is that it is because monetary policy tends to take on a much more \"muscular\" stance—some might say too muscular—at the end of these high-pressure periods to combat rising nominal pressures.\n\nThe other alternative is that the economy destabilizes when it pushes beyond its natural potential. These high-pressure periods lead to a buildup of competitive excesses, misdirected investment, and an inefficient allocation of societal resources. A recession naturally results and is needed to undo all the inefficiencies that have built up during the high-pressure period.\n\nYet, some people suggest that deliberately running these high-pressure periods can improve outcomes for workers in communities who have been less attached to the labor market, such as minorities, those with lower incomes, and those living in rural communities. These workers have long had higher unemployment rates than other workers, and they are often the last to benefit from periods of extended economic growth.\n\nFor example, research has shown that the gap between the unemployment rates of minority and white workers narrows as recoveries endure. So, the argument goes, allowing the economy to run further and longer into these red areas on the chart provides a net benefit to these under-attached communities.\n\nBut the key question isn't whether the high-pressure economy brings new people from disadvantaged groups into the labor market. Rather, the right question is whether these benefits are durable in the face of the recession that appears to inevitably follow.\n\nThis question was explored in a research paper by Atlanta Fed economist Julie Hotchkiss and her research colleague Robert Moore. Unfortunately, they found that while workers in these aforementioned communities tend to experience greater benefits from these high-pressure periods, the pain and dislocation associated with the aftermath of the subsequent recession is just as significant, if not more so.\n\nImportantly, this research tells me we ought to guard against letting the economy slip too far into these high-pressure periods that ultimately impose heavy costs on many people across the economy. Facilitating a prolonged period of low—and sustainable—unemployment rates is a far more beneficial approach.\n\nLet's fast forward to where we are now (see the next figure). The CBO's estimate of the natural rate is at 4.6 percent. Again, there is some uncertainty about where exactly that natural rate line lies. My estimate is about 1/2 percentage point below that. And it could be even lower. Given the general uncertainty about that line in real time, and given the current absence of accelerating inflationary pressures, we can't completely dismiss that possibility. Although, with the unemployment rate at 3.7 percent—a 49-year low—it seems likely that we're at least at our full employment mandate.\n\n\n\nGoing forward, I intend to weigh the risk of acting too swiftly and choking off the expansion against the risk of having the economy overheat and get into a situation with rising inflation and inflation expectations that would necessitate a muscular policy response. My thinking will be informed by the evolution of the incoming data and from what I'm able to glean from my business contacts. And while I wrestle with that choice, one thing seems clear: there is little reason to keep our foot on the gas pedal.\n\nInflation is at 2 percent, employment is at or near full employment, and the overall economy is strong. These are facts that are consistent with (at least) achieving the Fed's dual mandate. Moreover, the current data on both consumers and businesses suggests they are acting with prudence.\n\nHousehold incomes are rising amid continued job gains. Consumer attitudes have risen to relatively high levels. And measures of indebtedness such as the debt-service ratio and the household financial obligation ratio have fallen to and remain at multi-decade lows. Together, these fundamentals would suggest ample room for further acceleration in household purchases. Yet, much of the recent strength in consumer spending has been in services and nondurables, not in goods associated with longer-term commitments.\n\nTurning to the business investment picture, here, too, my sense is that growth will continue on at a moderate pace but not move markedly higher. I'm basing this assessment largely on the feedback I've heard from firms in my district either through surveys or from face-to-face interactions. These business leaders have struck a largely upbeat tone regarding the current environment, with the majority reporting that demand roughly matched or was slightly above their expectations. That said, my contacts generally indicated that they have not materially revised their outlooks for the remainder of 2018 and 2019.\n\nEven against a backdrop of tax reform and fiscal stimulus, what we hear from business leaders is that they have not yet bought into a significant and persistent pickup in demand beyond their current capabilities to meet that demand.\n\nIn that environment, we ought to shift into neutral. While there is some uncertainty surrounding estimates of neutral, as evidenced by the latest Summary of Economic Projections from the FOMC, my assessment is that we are still a few rate hikes away. At that point, after our policy foot is off the gas, but not on the brake, I will look to see if consumers and businesses continue to act in ways that do not suggest a buildup of excesses. If that continues, it will give me confidence that the economy is on a sustainable path.\n\nThank you for listening, and now I would be happy to take some questions.",

            "content": "It's a pleasure to be with you at this forum today. I think we can all agree that basic knowledge and information about how to fully participate in the financial system are essential to the success of our economy.\n\nAs many of you know, we have a program at the Atlanta Fed that focuses on economic and financial literacy. Critical to that program are partnerships with organizations like the Mississippi Council on Economic Education. My colleague Adrienne Slack's presence on your board of directors and the programs and workshops that Claire Loup and the council work on together demonstrate our commitment to this partnership and our shared mission of economic and financial literacy.\n\nThe Atlanta Fed supports these efforts across the six states in our District. For example, I spoke with economics teachers at Florida Gulf Coast University in Fort Myers, Florida, on financial literacy and economic opportunity this past spring, and our Bank is a longtime partner of the Georgia Council on Economic Education. I've learned a lot from those experiences and have seen some inspirational things. So it's an honor to talk with you today.\n\nToday I want to talk about economic education and the important role that it plays in our civic lives. This is a soapbox issue for me, and I will try not to be too preachy. But it's too important to ignore, and so I'm going to lean in on it. I will emphasize two aspects of economic education. First, I will highlight its importance for an issue of current policy concern—international trade. It is clearly a contentious and complex topic, but that makes it an excellent example of how equipping students with the basic tools of economic reasoning can enhance the public debate and, ultimately, consensus building.\n\nSecond, I want to discuss economic education in the context of what I see as unfortunate facts: the economic profession is not often enough the field of choice for some of our best and brightest, and it remains stubbornly unrepresentative of the population. I think all of us with a passion for advancing economic education and literacy should work hard to ensure that we increase the pool of young people who find economics interesting and exciting and that we add diversity to the profession. I'll close my remarks with a few brief comments on the economy and policy.\n\nAs always, the views I'll offer are mine alone. I don't speak for the Federal Open Market Committee (or FOMC) or for any other Fed official.\n\nThe important role of economic education and understanding trade\nI'll begin, then, with my first point: the importance of economic education in our civic lives in the context of international trade, and I'd like to start with a story.\n\nLast month, I participated in an event with the World Affairs Council on NAFTA, or the North American Free Trade Agreement. One of the attendees asked me why trade matters for monetary policy, and I talked through the issues with her. Her gratitude, and admission that she had not heard this before, surprised me, and made it clear that more needs to be done to explain the basics of international trade and why it matters to a monetary policymaker. So I will try to make progress on that front today.\n\nForeign trade has played an increasingly important role in the U.S. economy over time. Over the past 30 years, the value of U.S. exports—the goods and services we sell to the rest of the world—has risen by about $2 trillion in today's dollars. Imports—the goods and services we buy from the rest of the world—have increased by $2.5 trillion over that same period. As a result, almost 28 percent of the nation's gross domestic product (GDP) is now linked to the international trade of goods and services.\n\nThis growing international dimension has important ramifications for how the U.S. economy operates. For example, even though the largest share of consumer spending goes to goods that are produced in the United States, imported components are often used in the production process. Hence, part of the spending on items \"Made in the USA\" also pays for imported components and services.\n\nHere in Mississippi, we need only look at the automotive industry to see that force in action. From major auto assembly plants operated by Nissan and Toyota to vehicle parts suppliers scattered across the state, the industry relies on a global supply chain to bring products to U.S. consumers quickly and efficiently.\n\nAt the same time, when someone buys something labeled \"Made in China,\" that doesn't mean all of the retail price goes back to the Chinese producer. There are all kinds of local content going into that retail price, including some fraction of the profits, rent, marketing, distribution, and transportation costs, as well as the wages paid to workers here in the United States.\n\nSome imported products, like cell phones, even contain components that were produced in the United States and then exported to a foreign manufacturer for assembly. Foreign trade linkages are complex and not readily transparent.\n\nThe impact of trade on jobs can be similarly complex. While jobs are created and supported as a result of foreign trade, other jobs are at risk because of the competitive pressure of foreign production.\n\nRegarding jobs at risk, think back to the decline of the cut-and-sew apparel industry in Mississippi during the 1990s to recognize that the disruption caused by new foreign competition can be dramatic. On the other hand, the Southeast's foreign auto plants, for example, have grown to be important exporters of vehicles to places like China, Canada, Germany, Great Britain, Mexico, and the Middle East.\n\nIf assessing the impact of international trade is difficult, assessing the effect of trade policy can be even more difficult. Economic reasoning tells us that what might happen in the future can affect behavior every bit as much as what is happening today. In practical terms this means, for example, that the uncertainty touched off by the imposition of trade restrictions can easily affect firms' decision-making, independent of the direct effects of the restrictions themselves.\n\nIn a recent macroblog post published on our website, my staff at the Atlanta Fed reported on the results of a survey that asked whether firms are reassessing their capital investment plans in light of recent tariff hikes and fears of retaliation. An uncertain outlook can cause firms to delay investments while they wait to see how the situation unfolds. Such a development could grow to have macroeconomic ramifications the longer the uncertainty remains.\n\nThe survey results showed that about one-fifth of the firms surveyed in July say they are reassessing their capital spending plans in light of tariff worries. But only 6 percent report they are actually cutting spending or deferring previous plans in reaction to tariff worries. These findings suggest that tariff worries have had only a small negative effect on U.S. business investment so far.\n\nStill, there are reasons for concern. First, 30 percent of manufacturing firms report they are reassessing their capital expenditure plans because of tariff worries, and manufacturing is highly capital intensive. So the investment effects of trade policy frictions are concentrated in a sector that accounts for a substantial share of business investment.\n\nSecond, 12 percent of the firms report they have placed previously planned capital expenditures under review. Third, trade policy tensions between the United States and China have only escalated recently. The negative effects of sustained tariff worries on U.S. business investment could easily grow.\n\nGlobal interconnectedness is a fact. Its effects—and the effects of policies aimed at altering the landscape of international trade—are far from straightforward. The distinction between \"Made in America\" and \"Made in China\" is not always clear-cut. Trade poses competitive threats to many businesses and workers, but also has clear benefits for many others.\n\nTrade policies are not implemented in a vacuum, and perceptions of how our trading partners will respond to our actions can either accentuate or counteract the policies' intended effects. Reasonable debate about trade policies needs to be informed by the full picture. We will only talk past one another by pursuing a single-minded focus on either the costs or the benefits of trade and trade policy alone.\n\nThis is precisely why the work all of you do to promote economic education really matters to our nation's future. We need the voices of informed consumers to help shape effective policies and practices that are grounded in factual analysis and sound economic basics.\n\nThe case of international trade I have been discussing is just one example. Other questions that are vital to our collective futures include the effects of fiscal deficits and options for addressing them, the causes and consequences of wealth and income inequality, the case for and against independent monetary policy, and the value of market interventions of various sorts. In my view, basic economic literacy is the necessary foundation for understanding, let alone addressing, the challenges these questions pose.\n\nDiversity in economics and finance\nI'd like to use the balance of my time to share a few thoughts about a challenge we are facing in the field of economics—one that we need your help in addressing. It is widely recognized that the fields of economics and finance lack diversity, with women and minorities underrepresented among economists and finance professionals.\n\nYou should know that, for me, this challenge is personal. I discovered economics by accident. I was a good student in math through middle and high school, but had little formal schooling in economics or any kind of finance by the time I graduated. I found economics only after a particularly harrowing experience in an introductory chemistry class, which led me to find other channels to pursue academically. First, I studied psychology and, after that, economics. While I am very fortunate that serendipity worked in my favor in this case, I am committed to working to see that dumb luck doesn't turn out to be the field's main recruitment strategy.\n\nIn thinking about the lack of diversity in my profession, one explanation I have gravitated toward is that the pool of minority and women candidates coming to the market on an annual basis is too small to make a dent in longstanding shortfalls. For example, there were fewer than 25 African American economics doctoral students on the market for U.S. junior academic economic positions this year. That's 25 total. With numbers this small, it is unlikely that the vast majority of institutions could become measurably more diverse, even when devoting significant energy and resources toward this goal.\n\nI think we need to focus on both improving instruction and becoming more targeted in our approach. To improve instruction, we should build on the outstanding work of partners like the Mississippi Council for Economic Education to strengthen the instruction of economics and personal finance among high school students. As you know, the council partnered with the Mississippi Department of Education to create master teacher programs in economics and in entrepreneurship. Both of these are state-endorsed certificate programs for secondary social studies and business education teachers.\n\nThis year, the Atlanta Fed and the St. Louis Fed partnered with the council to develop a \"master teacher in personal finance\" program, one that I hope will become another state-endorsed certificate for Mississippi's teachers. After a successful pilot this summer, the curriculum is being finalized and readied for implementation. I strongly support these types of certification programs because they equip and empower teachers to provide engaging instruction that excites students.\n\nRegarding developing targeted approaches, the Financial Services Pipeline Initiative in Chicago has found that African Americans' and Latinos' interest in working in the financial services industry often crystallizes during the high school years, compared to college years for whites.\n\nThis suggests that, to increase diversity, we should introduce students to economic decision-making much earlier, during the earliest days of their education. In that spirit, economic education staff across the Federal Reserve System are creating engaging lessons that elementary school teachers can use to introduce key economic concepts to the youngest students. This approach strengthens students' ability to make good decisions and engage with the economic systems that will lead to a lifetime of better economic outcomes.\n\nI am actively working with my colleagues across the System to develop a program to help address these issues. We are in the early stages, but I think we can build on our existing programs and deepen partnerships like the one we have with the Mississippi Council on Economic Education to spark the imagination of all students, but especially female and minority students, to pursue a career in economics and finance.\n\nLet's be sure to continue to promote the economics profession as a place where bright, curious people from all backgrounds can roll up their sleeves to help solve real problems that affect individuals, businesses, and nations.\n\nFinally, let me say a few words about the economy and policy. As you may be aware, the FOMC has two mandated objectives: maximum sustainable employment and price stability, which the Federal Reserve has defined as 2 percent inflation. Relative to both of those objectives, the economy is performing quite well.\n\nThe unemployment rate is low relative to historical standards and has been at or below 4 percent since the spring. You'd have to go back nearly 20 years to find a similar performance. This suggests we are at, or at least very close to, full employment.\n\nGDP growth in recent years has been quite robust, helping to support the strong labor market performance we are enjoying. The recent economic data suggest that output growth is likely to continue at an above-trend pace in the current quarter. One particularly bright spot has been consumer spending, which rebounded sharply in the second quarter, and looks similarly strong currently.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of a full-employment economy, we have also moved much closer to our price-stability mandate. Underlying measures of inflation such as the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index and the Dallas Fed's trimmed-mean price index both hit 2 percent in July. There is little evidence to suggest that inflation is accelerating materially beyond this.\n\nWhen the economy is doing well and standing on its own, as it is now, I think monetary policy ought to be moving toward a neutral stance. For me, this means a gradual increase in nominal interest rates over the next handful of quarters.\n\nThanks, and now I'll be glad to take some questions.",

            "content": "Good afternoon, everyone. It's a real delight to be here in Savannah. I've had the chance to see a bit of your city this morning, and it more than lives up to its reputation for charm and history.\n\nAs I am sure you know, the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, voted to increase the federal funds rate target range by 25 basis points last week. Today, I'll explain why I think that action made sense in the context of current conditions and my economic outlook. Then I'll spend some time discussing economic resilience, particularly with regard to approaches we can take here in Georgia.\n\nI'll offer my usual disclaimer before I get started. I'll present only my personal opinions today. I'm not speaking for anyone else in the Federal Reserve System or for the FOMC.\n\nCurrent conditions\nLet's begin with how the U.S. economy is performing at midyear. It appears to be in a pretty good place. Unemployment is at its lowest rate since the early 2000s, and inflation is running close to 2 percent. As I've said recently, the economy is about as close to target as we've seen over this expansion. That does not mean that the FOMC can go on recess until conditions change. I think just the opposite is true now. The job of a monetary policymaker is becoming more difficult.\n\nFor the past nine years, the Fed's goal has been to help bring the economy back to a more normal place following the financial crisis. Now, with conditions reasonably close to the FOMC's dual mandate of full employment in the context of stable prices, the real work begins. We'll continue to pick apart the incoming economic data and combine it with real-time information from our business contacts as we set the path forward. The goal is to keep this expansion going in a sustainable manner. We want to ensure that the economy is not overheating, but we also do not want monetary policy to become too restrictive and threaten to choke off the expansion.\n\nIt does appear that the growth of real gross domestic product this quarter will come in above my previous estimate. But I suspect that some of this strength is tied to transitory or idiosyncratic factors that do not signal a major shift in momentum. On the consumer side, the recent spending data look to have picked up quite a bit. However, much of the recent bump in expenditures on services can be tied to a spike in spending on utilities due to unusual weather patterns. Most of our reports from businesses tied to the consumer sector indicate no discernible changes in the pace of spending relative to recent trends. So I'm taking a bit of a wait-and-see approach with the recent consumer data.\n\nIn a similar way, I am not inclined to read too much into the recent acceleration in business investment growth. A fair amount of that pickup is due to a rebound in spending on structures related to the mining and energy sector. Excluding energy and oil investment, investment growth is still below 5 percent on a year-over-year basis—a bit lower than the typical expansion average.\n\nEconomic outlook\nRegarding my outlook, my projection for overall growth hasn't changed materially since the beginning of the year. I still see output growing at a moderately above-trend pace this year and next, then slowing to a pace that corresponds with the longer-run potential of the economy, which is slightly less than 2 percent.\n\nGiven that the unemployment rate is already low by historical standards, and I expect growth to continue to outpace potential, one obvious concern I have is whether the economy is beginning to overheat in a destabilizing way. Here, I think it is important to recognize an important unknown. Most economists believe that even in periods of strong economic growth, some unemployment is inevitable, or \"natural.\" This either is due to the structure of labor markets or arises from typical flows of workers entering and exiting the labor market.\n\nBut the natural rate is unknown and has to be inferred from the available data. In last week's policy meeting, estimates from FOMC participants ranged between 4.1 and 4.7 percent. According to these estimates, the current unemployment rate is already below its natural rate. We don't need to go back that far in history to see how much the Committee's thinking on this concept has changed. Back in September 2014, a little less than four years ago, estimates of the longer-run natural unemployment rate were between 5 and 6 percent.\n\nMy point here is that these estimates are not set in stone. In my mind, the most informative data for uncovering the natural rate comes from the nominal side of the economy—that is, inflation and wage growth.\n\nRegarding inflation, I have not seen a dramatic shift in inflation expectations or measured retail price inflation. As for wage growth, I have yet to see evidence that it is accelerating at an unsustainable pace. In fact, aggregate wage growth appears to have flattened out over the past year or so at levels that appear to be in line with economic fundamentals (that is, productivity growth plus inflation).\n\nMost of the Atlanta Fed's business contacts characterize labor markets as tight, but not many of them plan to respond by raising wages across the board. I do hear some reports of planned accelerations in wages and salaries. But just as often, I hear that the issue is one of attracting sufficiently qualified workers. In these cases, firms are focusing on developing and training internal candidates and increasing investments in automation.\n\nReports of building price pressures are also sporadic. Although rising energy prices and anticipated tariff-related costs are generating more reports of upward price movement along the supply chain, we see few indications that the affected businesses expect to pass costs through to the final consumer.\n\nThe recent data on retail prices suggest inflation is running at or very near the FOMC's 2 percent goal. I expect it to continue in that neighborhood over the next few years.\n\nI began the year with a decided upside tilt to my risk profile for growth, reflecting business optimism following the passage of tax reform. However, that optimism has almost completely faded among my contacts, replaced by concerns about trade policy and tariffs. Perceived uncertainty has risen markedly. Projects already under way are continuing, but I get the sense that the bar for new investment is currently quite high. \"Risk off\" behavior appears to be the dominant sentiment among my contacts. In response, I've shifted the risks to my growth outlook to balanced.\n\nThe policy path forward\nShould the recent data unfold in a manner similar to my outlook, I am comfortable continuing to move policy toward a more neutral stance—one where monetary policy is neither accommodative nor restrictive.\n\nThe level of the policy rate that qualifies as neutral is not something we know with precision. But we are getting close to the lower part of most plausible estimates of the neutral rate. I don't think we are quite at neutral yet, even after last week's rate hike. But a key policy question going forward is how many more rate increases are required to complete the transition to a policy stance that is neither accommodative nor restrictive.\n\nEconomic resilience\nNow I'd like to shift my focus away from policy and talk about some factors that promote economic resilience in communities over time. I think this topic is particularly significant for smaller and midsized cities like Savannah.\n\nOne of the most important factors in creating the potential for positive economic outcomes is the presence of economic dynamism—that means a healthy amount of churning in a local or regional economy. Here at the Atlanta Fed, we recently published the second version of our Small City Economic Dynamism Index. You can get a copy of the report on our website under Community Development. In the report, we rank more than 400 small and midsized U.S. cities across 13 indicators of economic dynamism in four broad categories: demographics, economics, human and social capital, and infrastructure. Each indicator in the index has been shown to correlate with positive community and economic development outcomes. The index includes growth metrics as well as what we might call opportunity metrics.\n\nGrowth metrics capture information on things like population growth, employment growth, and population densification, which tracks the movement of people back into the city center. By these growth measures, Savannah and its peer cities in Georgia look pretty good over the past decade. Opportunity metrics include the rate of growth in poverty, median household income, and educational attainment. Here we see a mixed picture. Educational attainment seems to be improving, as measured by the share of people who have a bachelor's degree or higher. On the other hand, poverty and median incomes are moving in the wrong direction.\n\nEven in cities where employment is growing, like Savannah, median household income and poverty rates have not shown positive progress. In these places, we are learning that job growth alone is insufficient if these jobs are not accessible because of transportation barriers or mismatched worker skills. Another issue is that many of the jobs being created are low-wage and don't allow families to rise above the deeper challenges of poverty.\n\nThis pattern—some indications of growth, accompanied by deepening pockets of distress and poverty—is especially pronounced in the Southeast. That means it's a significant concern for the Atlanta Fed, whose district spans six states within the region.\n\nConnecting growth to community-based investment\nSo what can be done to improve economic outcomes? Community-based investment is one way to think about the kinds of local investments that help to translate growth into community assets that expand opportunity. Primarily, we're talking about either direct investment into projects or passive investment into intermediaries or funds that create housing, charter schools, facilities, and infrastructure projects, especially those that serve low-income families.\n\nAnd more often, we're seeing community-based investments focused on programs and services that have historically been funded exclusively with public dollars. These include things such as early childhood education, prisoner recidivism, health interventions, and even workforce development. In markets where growth is creating development pressure and where socioeconomic outcomes lag, community-based investments like these can be viable pathways to improving conditions of distress while also generating a financial return.\n\nSo you might be thinking, where does community-based investment come from? Well, some of it comes from government programs. Some of it comes from banks, motivated by regulations like the Community Reinvestment Act. But foundations also provide a lot of subsidized capital for community-based investment. These dollars can lead other investors, they can mitigate risk creatively, and they can seed innovations.\n\nMy team at the Atlanta Fed took a look at where foundations and other nongovernmental grant providers are investing in community and economic development. This research, which we call \"Following the Money,\" examined grants from larger foundations and other intermediaries that fill gaps in funding where the market or local tax revenues come up short.\n\nSo how did Savannah do in attracting these grants? From 2009 to 2014, the U.S. median metro area attracted $3.75 per capita each year in combined funding from large grant makers. By comparison, on average, the Savannah area attracted only about $2 per capita of this subsidy each year. These measures are adjusted for population. Compared to Atlanta and other smaller and midsized cities in Georgia, Savannah is attracting the fewest subsidy dollars from the outside to address community and economic development issues.\n\nWhat does it take to attract these community-based investment dollars? Many of Georgia's smaller and midsized cities, including Savannah, are growing, but they're also wrestling with difficult challenges such as poverty, stagnant incomes, blight, and vacancy. The community-based investment framework offers a way to think about connecting growth to broader opportunity. Community-based investors are like airplanes. They are flying around, looking for opportunities that meet their particular interests. Those interests might include projects in housing, charter schools, community facilities, small business incubators, and so on.\n\nBut for those investments to land and create the outcomes, we need runways. And there's a whole set of intermediaries that build runways—public/private partnerships, community development financial institutions, community development corporations, and a constellation of nonprofit organizations that absorb community-based investment. These intermediaries allow the investments to land where they can create positive outcomes. Intermediaries do this by coordinating shared priorities, by creating a pipeline of investment opportunities, and by working with public officials to ensure that the environment is amenable to community investment.\n\nIf the goal is to connect growth to broader opportunity, and to attract more community-based investment from local sources as well as from those outside our market, then we need to build more runways. We need those runways to be visible and well lit—meaning that we need a clear pipeline of community-based investment opportunities that take economic advantage of the growth we are experiencing to broaden opportunity for people living in conditions of economic distress.\n\nAs I see it, this group gathered here today has the resources, aligned interests, and capacity to build and augment Savannah's runways. We at the Atlanta Fed stand ready to help.\n\nThank you. Now I'll be glad to take a few questions.",

            "content": "It's a pleasure to be with you today. I'm proud of the Bank's affiliation with the Atlanta Economics Club and am pleased to be able to provide a place for you to gather.\n\nIn my comments today, I'd like to share my latest view of the economy and my economic outlook. I'll also be sharing some thoughts on recent inflation performance and how I am thinking about the Fed's inflation target going forward. Before I begin, let me say that I am offering only my personal opinions today. I'm not speaking for anyone else in the Federal Reserve or for the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC.\n\nCurrent economic conditions\nPrice stability is one part of the dual mandate given to us by Congress. Promoting maximum sustainable employment is the other half. From the perspective of that dual mandate, we're arguably as close to these goals as we've been over this expansion.\n\nThe unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest level since December of 2000. Broader measures of joblessness, like those that include people marginally attached to the labor force or those working part-time for economic reasons, have also improved.\n\nDespite the dramatic improvement in the employment picture, overall wage growth remains tepid compared with previous expansions. That said, we have seen evidence of increasing wages along some dimensions consistent with improvement in labor utilization rates. For instance, if you look at the typical wage growth experience of individual workers, as the Atlanta Fed's Wage Growth Tracker does, it shows that the premium for workers who change jobs is at a cyclical high.\n\nMy staff spends a lot of time canvassing businesses in the Sixth District to assess whether the facts on the ground seem consistent with our read of things based on the official statistics. Feedback suggests, as the data show, that labor market conditions have tightened, though I wouldn't characterize the situation as overheated. This all leads me to conclude that the economy is close to or at \"maximum employment\" but not yet significantly beyond that point.\n\nTurning to price stability, the other half of the FOMC's dual mandate, the Fed has determined that a 2 percent inflation rate, as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures (or PCE) price index, is most consistent with the notion of stable prices. The year-over-year growth rate in headline PCE inflation has now hit this target, and the less-volatile core PCE measure is just a tenth of a percentage point shy of that mark.\n\nThis is a significant development considering that annualized inflation over this expansion—which is nearly nine years long now—has fallen short of the 2 percent goal by roughly half a percentage point. On top of the recent inflation reports that suggest we are currently very close to our target, my staff and I are beginning to discern a shift in sentiment among our contacts and in our survey data that, if anything, suggests some upward pressure on inflation.\n\nReports on likely pricing pressure going forward are mixed. Significant pricing power appears contained to businesses and sectors that are exposed to cost pressures associated with actual or potential tariffs. But today, these are isolated developments.\n\nOn balance, I view the economy as on track and believe we are close to mandate-consistent outcomes for both inflation and employment. Given that measured inflation is already effectively on target, I won't be surprised to see a modest overshoot of our longer-run target. In fact, my own forecast is that, even with further gradual removal of monetary policy accommodation, inflation is likely to run a bit above 2 percent for a while.\n\nEconomic outlook\nSo with those considerations in mind, allow me to share the Atlanta Fed's baseline outlook. I continue to see the economy growing above potential this year, in the neighborhood of 2 1/2 percent, and slowing to its longer-run growth rate of around 1 3/4 percent over the medium term.\n\nOne area to watch over the next year or so is how consumers respond to tax reform. To that end, I have received few, if any, reports of a noticeable acceleration in consumer spending attributable to the tax cuts. Retailers generally report steady sales growth overall, but our anecdotal reports are consistent with the survey data from the New York Fed indicating that consumer expectations on future spending growth are relatively flat.\n\nA key swing factor in my outlook is the prospect for capital spending given tax reform. Surveys of businesses we've conducted suggest that capital expenditures will not grow explosively. Recent data potentially point to a stronger response, especially among tech firms. This represents an upside risk to our outlook.\n\nAs I've noted in previous speeches, an additional downside risk is the uncertainty about changes in trade policy.\n\nPondering a different framework\nIn the context of this outlook, I'd now like to tackle a fundamental question: Is the current monetary policy framework—one that targets a 2 percent inflation rate—still the best one? Over the course of roughly two decades prior to the global financial crisis, most monetary-policy experts and practitioners concurred that something like 2 percent is an appropriate goal—maybe even an optimal goal—for central banks to pursue.  So why rethink that target now?\n\nThe answer to that question starts with another consensus that has emerged in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. There is now a widespread belief that, once monetary policy has fully normalized, the federal funds rate—the FOMC's reference policy rate—will settle at a level significantly below historical norms.\n\nI like to think in terms of the \"neutral\" rate of interest—that is, the level of the policy rate that is consistent with the FOMC meeting its longer-run goals of price stability and maximum sustainable growth.  In other words, it's the level of the federal funds rate consistent with 2 percent inflation, the unemployment rate at its sustainable level, and real GDP at its potential. Estimates of the neutral policy rate are subject to debate. But a reasonable notion can be gleaned from the range of projections for the long-run federal funds rate reported in the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) after the March FOMC meeting. According to the latest SEP, neutral would be in a range of 2.3 to 3.5 percent.\n\nHere is the upshot: in the latter half of the 1990s, as the 2 percent inflation consensus was solidifying, the neutral federal funds rate would have been pegged in a range of something like 4.0 to 5.0 percent, much higher than the range considered to be neutral today. The implication for monetary policy is clear. If interest rates settle out at levels that are historically low, there will be a more limited scope for cutting rates in the event of a significant economic downturn. Even relatively modest downturns are likely to yield policy reactions that drive the federal funds rate to zero, as happened in the Great Recession.\n\nThis is where challenge to the 2 percent inflation target enters.  The neutral rate I have been describing is a nominal rate. It is roughly the sum of an inflation-adjusted real rate—determined by fundamental saving and investment decisions in the global economy—and the rate of inflation.  The downward drift in this neutral rate is attributable to a downward drift in the inflation-adjusted real rate.  This has been documented by a lot of research—one influential entry being the work by soon-to-be New York Fed president John Williams and Thomas Laubach, the head of the Monetary Affairs Division at the Board of Governors.\n\nAnd there is the essence of the argument. If the real rate of interest is governed by factors outside the central bank's control and is likely to remain low, then giving the central bank enough room to fight even run-of-the-mill downturns in the economy requires boosting the nominal rate of interest.\n\nThere are a number of different strategies the Fed could use to raise the nominal rate of interest. These include raising the FOMC's longer-run inflation target, targeting nominal GDP growth, adopting flexible inflation targets that are adjusted based on the state of the economy, and price-level targeting. While each of these strategies carries with it its own laundry list of pros and cons, I find myself drawn to a policy framework that has a version of price-level targeting at its center. Why?\n\nWhy price-level targeting?\nFirst, I think the Fed's commitment to the long-run 2 percent objective has served the country well. I recognize that the commitment part of that sentence may be more important than the specific 2 percent target value. But, credibility and commitment imply objectives that are changed infrequently and only with a clear consensus on a better course.\n\nSecond, former Fed chair Alan Greenspan offered a well-known definition of what it means for a central bank to succeed on a charge to deliver price stability. He suggested that the goal of price stability is met when households and business ignore inflation when making key economic decisions that affect their financial futures.\n\nI agree with the Greenspan definition, and I believe that the 2 percent inflation objective has helped us meet that criterion. But I don't think we have met this definition just because 2 percent is a sufficiently low rate of inflation.  I think it's also critical that deviations of prices away from a path implied by an average inflation rate of 2 percent have been relatively small in our country.\n\nUntil recently, the 2 percent inflation objective in the United States has been functionally equivalent to a price-level target centered on a 2 percent growth path. The following chart shows what a 2 percent growth price-level path would have been from 1995 to 2012.  I chose 1995 to start, as that is arguably near the date when the Fed began the era of inflation targeting in practice.\n\n\n\nThe policy outcomes we have seen from 1995 to 2012 satisfy what I will call the \"principle of bounded nominal uncertainty.\" This means that if you and I enter a contract to exchange a dollar at some future date, we can confidently predict within some range the purchasing power that dollar will represent. For me, this is the essence of a reasonable definition of price stability. It's another way to represent the Greenspan idea.\n\nHowever, as I mentioned earlier, since we began explicitly targeting a 2 percent inflation rate in 2012, the actual PCE inflation rate has persistently fallen short of the 2 percent goal. That, of course, means that the price level has fallen increasingly short of a referenced 2 percent path, as shown in this chart.\n\n\n\nIn the context of price-level targeting, how significant of an issue is this recent (and persistent) shortfall in inflation? The practical answer to that question is an implementation issue. However, for argument's sake, let's suppose that the FOMC commits to conducting monetary policy so that the price level will always fall within plus-or-minus 5 percent of the long-run target path (which itself we define as the path implied by a constant 2 percent inflation rate). In that sense, the current price level would be within the bounds of a hypothetical commitment made in 1995. If the central bank could perpetually deliver 2 percent annual inflation, that promise would remain intact, as we see in this chart.\n\n\n\nOf course, that picture depicts a forward path for prices whose margin for error is quite slim. Continued inflation below 2 percent would, in short order, push the price level below the lower bound, likely requiring a relatively accommodative monetary policy stance—that is, if policymakers sought to satisfy a commitment to this framework's definition of price stability.\n\nCentral bankers in risk management mode might opt for policies designed to deliberately move the price level toward the 2 percent average inflation midpoint in cases where the price level moves too close for the Committee's comfort to one of the bounds (as, perhaps, in the last chart). It bears noting that in such cases there are a wide range of options available to policymakers with respect to the timing and pace of that adjustment.\n\nThis scenario illustrates the flexibility of the price-level targeting framework I'm describing. I think it's important to think in terms of gradual adjustments that don't risk whipsawing the economy or force the central bank to be overly precise in its short-run influence on inflation and economic activity. A key feature of such a policy framework includes considerable short- and medium-run flexibility in inflation outcomes. The only caveat is that deviations from 2 percent cannot be so large and persistent that they push the price level outside the target bounds.\n\nThe crux of my argument is that a \"good\" monetary policy framework limits the degree of uncertainty associated with contracts involving transfers of dollars over time. In limiting uncertainty, monetary policy contributes to economic efficiency.\n\nAnd, as to the problem of the zero lower bound that makes further rate cuts infeasible, nothing in the notion of a price-level target rules out (or demands) any particular policy tool. If anything, bounded price-level targets could expand the existing toolkit. They certainly do not constrain it.\n\nSumming all of this up, then—to me, the important characteristic of a sound monetary policy framework is that it provides a credible nominal anchor while maintaining flexibility to address changing circumstances. I think some form of flexible price-level targeting can be a part of such a framework.",

            "content": "Good afternoon. It's great to be back in Jacksonville today. I'm about to reach my first anniversary as head of the Atlanta Fed next month, so it's getting harder and harder to say that I'm new. For example, this is my third trip to Jacksonville, and I'm starting to recognize new developments and even lawn decorations. But I plan to keep on saying I'm new until someone really calls me out.\n\nIn my 11 months, I've come to enjoy my role as a monetary policymaker. As you probably know, the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, decided to hold the federal funds rate target range steady last week.\n\nIn my remarks today, I'll try to provide some insight into how I see current economic conditions shaping up as we approach midyear and my outlook for the near term. I'll close by discussing my views on the role of trade policy and uncertainty as they influence that outlook.\n\nLet me state the usual disclaimer before I begin. I'll present only my personal opinions today. I'm not speaking for anyone else in the Federal Reserve System or for the FOMC.\n\nCurrent economic conditions\nCongress has charged the Federal Reserve—or, more accurately, the FOMC—with promoting maximum sustainable employment in the context of price stability. From the perspective of that dual mandate, we're arguably as close to that goal as we've been over this expansion.\n\nThe unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest level since December of 2000. Broader measures of joblessness, like those that include people marginally attached to the labor force or those working part-time for economic reasons, have also improved to cyclical lows.\n\nDespite the dramatic improvement in the employment picture, overall wage growth remains tepid compared with previous expansions. That said, we have seen evidence of increasing wages along some dimensions consistent with improvement in labor utilization rates. For instance, if you look at the typical wage growth experience of individual workers, as the Atlanta Fed's Wage Growth Tracker does, it shows that the premium for workers who change jobs is at a cyclical high.\n\nMy staff, including Chris Oakley and his team here in our Jacksonville Branch, spends a lot of time canvassing businesses in the Sixth District to assess whether the facts on the ground seem consistent with our read of things based on the official statistics. Feedback suggests that labor market conditions have tightened, though I wouldn't characterize the situation as overheated. This all leads me to conclude that the economy is close to or at \"full employment\" but not yet significantly beyond that point.\n\nTurning to price stability, the other half of the FOMC's dual mandate, the Fed has determined that a 2 percent inflation rate, as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, is most consistent with the notion of stable prices. The year-over-year growth rate in headline PCE inflation has now hit this target, and the less-volatile core PCE measure is just a tenth of a percentage point shy of that mark.\n\nThis is a significant development considering that annualized inflation over this expansion—which is nearly nine years long now—has fallen short of the 2 percent goal by roughly half a percentage point. As part of the Fed's stewardship of policy, we have spent considerable effort over the course of the recovery trying to understand the reasons for the shortfall.\n\nEarly on in the recovery, it was easy to explain the absence of inflation given the extraordinary amount of slack in the economy. But as the recovery gained momentum and the unemployment rate fell, and we began hearing more reports of labor scarcity, increased voluntary job changes, and firms stepping up their efforts to retain and attract new employees, the absence of rising inflation has been something of a puzzle.\n\nSome have suggested that new technologies, global interconnectedness, or changes in the structure of the economy have fundamentally altered the process that governs inflation dynamics. But I have to say that I view these alternative explanations with a skeptical eye.\n\nA plausible explanation is that the natural rate of unemployment is now lower than it has historically been. Among other things, technological changes in how people search for jobs may have reduced the time needed to find job matches. This trend implies that, at a given unemployment rate, there is more slack in the labor market than there may have been in prior eras.\n\nAnother explanation is that inflation expectations have become anchored below levels consistent with our dual mandate. I have been particularly concerned that households and firms were beginning to adapt to the lower observed inflation trend by lowering their inflation expectations. If true, that would make it even more difficult for the Fed to hit its target in the longer run. Fortunately, recent developments have alleviated some of my concern.\n\nOn top of the recent inflation reports that suggest we are currently very close to our target, my staff and I are beginning to discern a shift in sentiment among our contacts and in our survey data that, if anything, suggests some upward pressure on inflation.\n\nApril data from the Atlanta Fed's Business Inflation Expectations survey reveal a sizable increase in reported unit cost pressures over the past few months. Despite the increase, nearly half of these firms see profit margins as in line with what they would consider \"normal,\" and 15 percent reported \"above normal\" margins. Interestingly, the majority of those with \"above normal\" margins indicated they had achieved margin growth by increasing prices. So, there appears to be some evidence of pricing power that may end up affecting retail prices.\n\nAlso, while we don't have a very long history to draw from, longer-run business inflation expectations have risen to their highest level since early 2013, shortly after the Fed began its third round of quantitative easing. Still, reports on likely pricing pressure going forward are mixed. Significant pricing power appears contained to businesses and sectors that are exposed to cost pressures associated with actual or potential tariffs. But today, these are isolated developments.\n\nOn balance, I view the economy as on track and believe we are close to mandate-consistent outcomes for both inflation and employment. Given that measured inflation is already effectively on target, I won't be surprised to see a modest overshoot of our longer-run target. In fact, my own forecast is that, even with further gradual removal of monetary policy accommodation, inflation is likely to run a bit above 2 percent for a while.\n\nIn my judgment, such an outcome is not a problem that would, in and of itself, necessitate a more aggressive policy response. Rather, it is a feature of a well-calibrated approach that moves monetary policy to a neutral stance that will support both strong labor market conditions and our longer-run symmetric inflation goal.\n\nI'll offer a caveat. Although I think we are on track in satisfying our dual mandate, this does not mean we can hang up our hats and head home. There is still work to do, and risks on the horizon need to be monitored. Perhaps the most obvious risk facing the economy at the moment is how firms will adjust to recent and proposed changes in trade policy, a concern I will return to in a moment.\n\nEconomic outlook\nLooking forward, I continue to see the economy growing above potential this year, in the neighborhood of 2 1/2 percent, and slowing to its longer-run growth rate of around 1 3/4 percent over the medium term.\n\nFollowing a pattern we have seen for several years, gross domestic product, or GDP, growth in the first quarter softened after a strong reading in fourth quarter. This time, a large part of that slowdown was due to weakness in consumer spending. For now, I am willing to chalk up most of the recent softness to payback from a strong fourth quarter that was buoyed by rebuilding efforts from fall hurricanes.\n\nOne area to watch over the next year or so is how consumers respond to tax reform. To that end, I have received few, if any, reports of a noticeable acceleration in consumer spending attributable to the tax cuts. Retailers generally report steady sales growth overall, but our anecdotal reports are consistent with the survey data from the New York Fed indicating that consumer expectations on future spending growth are relatively flat.\n\nI expect to see a recovery in consumer spending over the balance of the year, but as of yet I don't see an acceleration that would risk a development of imbalances between supply and demand.\n\nA key swing factor in my outlook is the prospect for capital spending given tax reform. First-quarter growth in business fixed investment was in line with its trend rate over the past year, but the latest indicators on durable goods orders and shipments suggest a marked slowdown in investment spending on equipment going into the current quarter.\n\nWhile this is only one month, and the monthly data on factory orders tend to be rather volatile, it is concerning given that the recent tax cut legislation should be providing some stimulus to investment spending. It's possible that uncertainty about changes in trade policy may be offsetting some of the impact that might otherwise be generated by the tax legislation.\n\nTrade policy and uncertainty\nIn my conversations with Sixth District businesses, most appear to be reasonably satisfied with the current state of the economy, but their attitude shifts when we ask them about the future. Swelling optimism over tax policy in the beginning of the year has now been replaced almost completely by uncertainty regarding the proposed tariffs and the possibility of a trade war.\n\nThough there are exceptions, I come away with the sense that for now, many firms may be responding to increased uncertainty by moving to the sidelines with respect to new cap-ex plans. I have gathered little indication that firms are pulling back on investment projects that are already in progress. But investment projects slated for the pipeline have been pushed out.\n\nWhile it's not usually tallied when weighing the pros and cons of protectionist trade policy, the uncertainty touched off by the potential imposition of new tariffs appears to be affecting firms' decision making. I want to reinforce that I am talking about the uncertainty associated with the current trade discussions and not the specifics of any particular policy or policies. Indeed, trade policy is never as clear-cut as most of us would hope.\n\nThe benefits of free and unfettered trade are clear in a perfect world. By \"perfect world,\" I mean one with few, if any, trading frictions. Things are more complicated when the world does not mirror this ideal. Any economist worth his or her salt can conjure up a case for policy interventions based on some impediment to fully efficient markets. The question is always whether policymakers have enough information about the nature of those impediments, and can intervene with enough precision, to make matters better by acting. We all have heard the phrase \"unintended consequences,\" and we understand the potential for action to leave the situation worse. So this is truly tricky. The situation is even more complex when policy actions are taken against strategic players—consumers, businesses, and other policymakers—who will not be passive in the face of those actions.\n\nBut one thing is clear, and this is important. Even in a perfect world, economic change will typically create winners and losers. Let me use a concrete example. Consider the impact on the U.S. apparel industry from the rise in imports from less-developed countries during the 1990s. According to a Bureau of Labor Statistics study, in the mid-1990s, the average apparel worker in Honduras earned about 10 percent of the hourly wage of a comparable worker in the United States. The impact of the shift in production toward less-developed countries was dramatic. In Alabama, for example, employment in apparel production declined from around 45,000 in 1990 to a little over 5,000 by the mid-2000s. These jobs had provided stable employment in small towns across the South for many years. When those jobs went overseas, the dislocated workers had few options. U.S. consumers benefited from having access to cheaper clothing, but the affected U.S. apparel workers lost.\n\nThis reality need not be a problem. Many believe that the gains of the winners generally outweigh the losses of those who lose. If true, it should be possible in principle to redistribute the gains in such a way that nobody is worse off. But what is true in principle is very often hard to implement in practice. And that kind of redistribution rarely happens.\n\nWhether disruptions are brought about by shifting trade and production across borders or by the imperatives of technological change, some will be left behind. To those who have been left behind, it does little good to note that in principle they could be made whole. To those who would promote fewer rather than more trade restrictions, or who would argue that roadblocks to technological advance are unwise, we need to confront the very real dislocations associated with the application of those views.\n\nA major problem facing communities that have lost an industry is the lack of good-quality job opportunities. As a 2010 Brookings study noted, there are at least two aspects to this problem. First, many displaced workers do not have the skills needed for the quality jobs that are available locally. Second, communities are not creating sufficient-quality jobs to absorb the displaced workers. Further deepening these challenges are significant declines in worker mobility—both between and within states. As fewer workers are moving to where jobs are, displaced mid- and late-career workers in particular face major challenges in finding well-paying jobs.\n\nSolving these joint problems requires a coordinated workforce development system that acts in strategic partnership with the private sector and works alongside programs that encourage innovation and entrepreneurship. The Atlanta Fed's Center for Workforce and Economic Opportunity is contributing to this effort by helping to provide a bridge between research and practice. It connects researchers, businesses, and policymakers with innovative approaches to creating economic opportunity through education and employment.\n\nI believe that communities that can align worker-focused workforce development and business-focused economic development will be much more resilient to economic shocks and better able to capitalize on opportunities for growth. This approach can ultimately benefit the overall economy, but there is more to do to achieve full and effective collaboration between workforce development and job creation efforts.\n\nThese are big challenges. As a monetary policymaker, I have a vested interest in how these challenges are met because they ultimately shape the nature of the Fed's goals. This is particularly true for the sustainable employment part of the FOMC's dual mandate.\n\nThank you. Now I'll be glad to take a few of your questions.",

            "content": "Good afternoon. It's wonderful to be here today at this important conference.\n\nI'd like to thank David Kotok of Cumberland Advisors for hosting the event and for inviting me to speak. I'd also like to recognize Bob Eisenbeis, a former research director at the Atlanta Fed, who is joining us today.\n\nI think we can all agree that knowledge and information about how to fully participate in the financial system are essential to the success of our economy. But we have a problem. Limited basic math skills are correlated with lower levels of saving, less planning for retirement, and poorer understanding of credit, according to several economists.\nAnd there is reason to believe that many Americans are limited where math proficiency is concerned. In 2015, two scholars, Olivia Mitchell at the University of Pennsylvania and  Annamaria Lusardi of George Washington University,  found that only 32 percent of Americans could correctly answer three basic questions about interest rates, risk diversification, and inflation.\n\nWe have some big work to do on many levels—both individually and collectively.\n\nToday, I'd like to explore the connections between financial literacy and economic opportunity—in terms of equality, mobility, stability, and resilience.  Then I'll talk about what we at the Atlanta Fed are doing to help foster financial literacy. I'll close with some thoughts on what we can all do to keep the momentum going.\n\nBefore I begin, let me offer a quick caveat. I'm speaking only for myself today—not for anyone else in the Federal Reserve or for the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC.\n\nFinancial Literacy and Economic Opportunity\nWhen I think about the Federal Reserve's mandated goal of trying to maximize employment, I have come to a view that our success in achieving this mandate will depend on the degree to which people have access to economic opportunity. I see four foundational aspects of economic opportunity, and financial literacy is key to all four.\n\nThe first aspect is equality of opportunity. In the context of our work at the Fed, this means equal access to opportunity in the labor market and at educational institutions. While there will be differences in labor market outcomes depending on people's individual actions and aptitudes, these outcomes should not be predicted by a person's socioeconomic background, race, or ethnicity. Without equal access to opportunity, the country leaves economic potential on the table and limits the possibilities of its people.\n\nThe second aspect of economic opportunity is mobility. People have economic mobility when they have a decent chance to advance in economic standing as a worker or household. How does financial literacy connect with economic mobility? Making sound financial decisions allows people to avoid making costly mistakes that can work against advancing their careers and well-being. Everyone has dreams of having a better standard of living. That doesn't happen without understanding how to build wealth and prepare for the future.\n\nEvidence abounds that Americans need better financial and economic literacy. Let me cite just a few examples from the Federal Reserve's Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households in 2016:\n\nThe follow-on effects can be profound. An Atlanta Fed economist, Kris Gerardi, and his co-authors found that poor financial literacy on the part of borrowers played a real role in the subprime mortgage crisis. As we all know, the subprime crisis helped bring on the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.\n\nFinally on this point, the cost can be more than just financial. Atlanta Fed economist Melinda Pitts and her co-authors found that carrying heavy loads of delinquent debt can even literally take months off a person's life.\n\nThird on my list of key components of economic opportunity is stability. Economic stability is the ability to predictably earn, save, and meet financial obligations. Evidence from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors' Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking  suggests that increasingly unpredictable and intermittent incomes create challenges for households that can lead to financial stresses. Think about what a bad credit rating does to people. They will incur higher interest rates on loans—if they can even get a loan. They risk being rejected on a lease for an apartment and could be disqualified for a job. Knowing how to save, budget, and pay bills are all foundational aspects of financial literacy.\n\nThe fourth component of economic opportunity is resilience. The resilient person or family can adapt to personal financial crises like those caused by loss of a job or unexpected expenses and weather them with relatively little financial upheaval. I think of financial literacy as being key to economic resilience. Literacy will help families and individuals appreciate the importance of saving.\n\nPlanning and saving matter—a lot. For many households, it's not a question of if but when a financial emergency will happen. According to a 2015 report from the Pew Charitable Trusts,  60 percent of households had experienced a financial shock in the past 12 months. An unexpected car repair can drain resources and threaten employment—because you have to be able to get to work to earn a paycheck. A health crisis can drain savings and lead to time away from work, either to care for yourself or to care for a loved one. Having a rainy-day fund to help mitigate these shocks is an essential part of economic resilience. And sadly, as I've noted, too few families have saved enough to be close to a resilient position.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's Role in Promoting Financial Literacy\nEveryone in this room has an obligation to increase financial literacy—including me. I'm proud to say that we have been very active in this area at the Atlanta Fed over the years. Our economic education work has focused on schools across the Atlanta Fed's territory—the Sixth Federal Reserve District—which encompasses Florida, Alabama, Georgia, and big parts of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Tennessee.\n\nAll six states in our district require the implementation of state standards in economics and personal finance. Yet most teachers in these classes have limited training in these subjects. To address this constraint, we often partner with groups like the Florida Council on Economic Education to train teachers in economics and personal finance. We believe this is where we can add value and where there is a substantial multiplier effect: we aim to reach more students by reaching their teachers. Overall, our economic education team reaches more than 10,000 teachers a year through about 300 workshops and presentations.\n\nThrough workshops, including hands-on sessions at economic centers such as seaports and auto assembly plants, we not only engage the educators through effective teaching methods, but also equip them with lesson plans and tools they can immediately use in the classroom. These materials focus on the Fed, personal finance, and the broader economy. We make a concerted effort to serve underserved constituencies. Between 2015 and 2017, our team reached teachers at 75 percent of inner-city, majority-minority, and girls' high schools in our district.\n\nThe teach-the-teacher approach works. For example, researchers at the Georgia College and State University Center for Economic Education found that students of teachers who attended Georgia Council on Economic Education workshops, some of which were conducted in partnership with the Atlanta Fed, scored higher on required end-of-course exams than did students whose teachers did not attend the sessions.\n\nIn addition to our work with teachers, each year we reach hundreds of high school students directly as part of the Federal Reserve System's Financial Education Day program. Students take part in employability skills boot camps, where they learn and practice soft skills like résumé writing, interviewing, and networking. Federal Reserve hiring managers as well as professionals from community partner organizations serve as mock interviewers and provide constructive critiques to students. We also partner with nonprofit organizations like Junior Achievement, Jump$tart, Academy of Finance, and Habitat for Humanity to deliver personal finance programs that introduce middle and high school students to the basics of budgeting, saving versus investing, and the importance of using credit wisely.\n\nWe aren't alone in this pursuit. Eleven of the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks conduct educational programs. The tactics vary across regions, but the overarching goal is the same: to increase knowledge of economics, banking, and the Fed, and to bolster financial literacy among teachers, students, and the general public.\n\nFurther directions\nI'd like to close with a few thoughts about what you can do to help improve financial literacy. First, reinforce financial literacy lessons at home. Personal financial patterns start taking hold early. One study by researchers at the University of Cambridge  in the United Kingdom found that many money management habits of adults are established as early as age seven. So talk with your kids and grandkids about the importance of saving and investing. Maybe give them a piggy bank or set up a college fund that gets regular contributions. Take time with them to track the progress you make over the years. Make it fun.\n\nA second thing you can do is to help ensure that personal finance classes remain a requirement here in Florida. If you are from a state that does not require these classes, press for them.\n\nThird, you can push for financial literacy materials to be shared at the point of sale. Institutions that sell goods often offer some degree of financing to their customers. They should all do their part to ensure that people are making sound financial choices. I would argue that the days of “let the buyer beware” should have ended with the financial crisis a decade ago.\n\nFinally, employers should offer access to financial literacy materials to their staff.  If you have employees who are preoccupied with financial stress, they cannot be fully engaged in their work. Tools and pointers can help reduce that stress and help them become more fully productive. To help you with this one, we have placed at your tables some note cards we created that show you how to find financial tips on our website. As you engage with your staff and friends, feel free to use these materials liberally.\n\nThank you for the opportunity to talk about this important subject with you. As you have likely guessed by now, financial literacy is something I'm quite passionate about. The Atlanta Fed is committed to doing our part to innovate and improve outcomes in this area. I know you are, too.\n\nNow I'll be happy to take your questions.",

            "content": "Good morning. It's a pleasure to be with all of you today.\n\nI've been fortunate to have had the chance to visit many parts of the Sixth Federal Reserve District since I came on board last year. This is my first trip to Knoxville and to this university. I'm looking forward to learning more about this part of the region. I'll meet with some students and faculty later this morning, and then with some business leaders and your mayor before I head back to Atlanta.\n\nThe insights from regional experts help my staff and me understand emerging trends in the economy in real time, so these visits are a critical, and quite enjoyable, part of my job.\n\nAs you may know, the Fed wrapped up its second monetary policy meeting of the year on Wednesday, voting to increase the federal funds rate target range. This morning, I'd like to share my thoughts on why this policy move made sense based on some signposts my team and I are seeing in the current economic landscape. I am going to characterize Wednesday's policy decision as another step toward a more neutral monetary policy stance.\n\nThough I expect that a sequence of further rate hikes will be appropriate over the next couple of years, that view is based on certain assumptions about how economic conditions will evolve going forward. In the last part of my talk this morning, I will highlight some key assumptions that underlie my view of the economy, and I'll highlight some of the key risks to my outlook.\n\nLet me state the usual disclaimer before I begin. I'll present only my personal opinions today. I'm not speaking for anyone else in the Federal Reserve or for the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC.\n\nState of the economy\nSo let's begin with the current state of our national economy. Unemployment rates are at or below levels that prevailed before the crisis a decade ago. This is true for the official rate that dominates the headlines after the employment report is released every month. But, importantly, it is also true for broader jobless measures that, for example, count as unemployed those individuals who have part-time jobs but who would rather work full-time.\n\nInflation, which has been persistently below the FOMC's longer-run 2 percent target for six years, has been trending upward toward that target. The six-month average inflation rate—expressed as the annual growth rate of the Personal Consumption Expenditures, or PCE, price index—is now well above the 2 percent target.\n\nThat may sound like we have actually overshot our inflation objective, but I think it is important to explain that the overall, or headline, rate of inflation is not usually the best way to think about the inflation trend. The reason is that temporary influences can dominate the headline measure over shorter periods of time. That means that headline inflation today is not the best predictor of headline inflation tomorrow.\n\nThis is why we look at so-called core measures of inflation, which are better predictors of future overall inflation than is today's headline inflation rate. The annualized six-month core inflation rate has been steadily increasing since August, and it hit 2 percent in January. This is true whether we measure core inflation by the traditional index that removes food and energy from the inflation calculation or whether we use more sophisticated measures of trend inflation, like the Dallas Fed's trimmed-mean estimates.\n\nTwo percent, of course, is the magic number because it is the longer-run inflation rate that the FOMC has identified as consistent with price stability.\n\nThese two observations—unemployment at or near precrisis levels and trend inflation measures at or near 2 percent—give me confidence we are at or near the FOMC's sustainable employment and inflation objectives. And, subject to some caveats I will explain later, I am reasonably comfortable with a forecast that this situation will persist into the future.\n\nMoving toward neutrality\nWith the economy operating near its potential and inflation finally approaching the long-run target, it is appropriate, in my opinion, for monetary policy to be moving toward a more neutral stance. By neutral, I mean neither stepping on the gas to move the economy faster nor pumping on the brakes to slow the economy down.\n\nConceptually, the neutral policy rate is pretty straightforward. It is the interest rate determined by fundamental saving and business investment decisions, plus an adjustment for the rate of inflation.\n\nIt's hard to pin down the neutral rate with precision. But our estimates suggest a neutral rate that will over time fall in the range from 2 1/4 to 2 3/4 percent.\n\nAs of the FOMC decision on Wednesday, the upper end of the target federal funds rate range is 1 3/4 percent. This is below the lower end of the long-run range identified in the Summary of Economic Projections—or SEP. Even assuming that the underlying interest rate is still somewhat below its long-run value, the current setting remains below what I would characterize as neutral.\n\nThat is why I voted in favor of the 1/4 percentage point increase in the target federal funds rate range at the FOMC meeting. If the economy evolves roughly as I suspect, I will likely support further increases over the course of the year.\n\nWhy not support an immediate adjustment toward full neutrality of the federal funds rate? Three reasons.\n\nFirst, the SEP makes clear that most Committee members anticipate gradual increases in the policy rate over the next several years if inflation, GDP growth, and unemployment perform as forecasted. Market participants appear to be incorporating this path into the pricing of financial market instruments, so some of the effect of future target increases may already be priced into borrowing and lending rates.\n\nSecond, last September the Federal Reserve began the process of reducing its balance sheet.\n\nThe pace of balance-sheet reductions will ramp up over the course of this year, settling at a maximum rate of $50 billion per month by year-end. For reasons I have explained in earlier speeches, I expect the interest-rate effects of our balance sheet policy to be small. But that is a conjecture. It may be prudent to act somewhat less aggressively than we might do otherwise as we accumulate information about the effects of the balance-sheet side of the current policy mix. \n\nFinally, forecasts are inherently uncertain. It is generally appropriate, in my view, to steadily ease our way to higher rates, moving gradually and assessing the emerging circumstances before taking another step along the path to full normalization.\n\nAs I stated, I believe a gradual increase in interest rates to move toward neutral is appropriate if the economy evolves as I expect.\n\nNaturally, the key question for executing this strategy is: Will the economy evolve roughly as I anticipate? Clearly, there are many moving parts in such a large and complex economy. Let me now turn to three key assumptions that underlie my view of the economy, and the potential risks should these assumptions prove mistaken.\n\nGDP growth and nonmonetary policy\nFirst, my current forecasts for the next several years assume that fiscal policy will provide a positive, but relatively modest, boost to GDP growth.\n\nIn association with researchers from Stanford University and the Booth School at the University of Chicago, my staff conducted a survey last month asking business executives if the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed in December would materially change their capital expenditure plans in 2018 and 2019. Seventy-five percent of respondents indicated that the tax cuts would not change their investment plans in 2018. Seventy-three percent said investment plans for 2019 were unaffected.\n\nInterestingly, this survey question was a follow-up to a similar question asked in November in anticipation of the tax cut bill's passage. Fewer respondents indicated that investment would be positively affected in the February survey than responded positively in the November survey.\n\nThese survey results are largely consistent with anecdotal reports we have received from many business contacts, so I am not assuming a huge boost to growth from tax cuts over the next couple of years.\n\nThe tax cut bill, of course, is not the only source of potential fiscal stimulus over the next couple of years. The Bipartisan Budget Act passed last month will add near-term direct spending that we estimate will add a little less than one-third of a percentage point or so to growth in each year. That's not immaterial, but neither is it a game-changing sort of effect.\n\nSo, my baseline view of the economy reflects a relatively modest stimulus from recent fiscal policy changes in the near term. It would be fair to say that the actual effects could well be larger than I am suggesting, representing an upside risk to my GDP growth forecast. I hasten to add, however, that the prospects of any significant or pervasive tariffs—and the reactions from trading partners that could follow—represent a counterbalancing downside risk.\n\nLabor markets\nSecond on the list of assumptions underlying my forecast is the sense that, despite employment growth that is substantially outpacing the rates consistent with stable unemployment rates, U.S. labor markets aren't substantially \"overheated.\"\n\nI consistently hear reports from business contacts that labor markets are tight. But results from the most recent Federal Reserve Banks' Small Business Credit Survey provide some interesting insight into what this might mean.\n\nMost firms in this national survey—which canvasses businesses with fewer than 500 employees—report hiring difficulties, and the vast majority are doing something about it. However, a firm's response to these difficulties seems to depend on the nature of those difficulties.\n\nIncreasing compensation is the most common response, particularly among firms that cite employer competition or too few applicants as a reason for hiring difficulties. However, a large share of firms are reacting by loosening job requirements, increasing training, or reallocating existing job duties. An implication is that labor costs for firms have increased, but not only in the form of wages or benefits. Firms are spending more time on nonproduction activities such as training and the restructuring of employee responsibilities.\n\nTo me, one of the lessons is that many businesses are facing some pressure on labor costs, often in the form of nonwage expenses. Still, these costs do not yet seem to be accelerating, and my belief is that labor market conditions are not yet overheated.\n\n\"Not yet overheated\" is the operative clause. With the U.S. economy creating about 200,000 jobs per month over the past two years—as I noted, well above the pace consistent in the longer run with a stable, and not falling, unemployment rate—there is an upside risk for explicit and implicit labor costs going forward.\n\nInflation\nAnd that brings me to inflation. In a very informative speech last September, former Fed chair Janet Yellen offered a useful way to parse the inflation rate. She pointed to four elements: first, inflation expectations; second, the degree of tightness in the labor market; third, movements in import prices; and fourth, transitory factors that come and go.\n\nUpdating Chair Yellen's analysis, we find that virtually all of these elements that might drive headline inflation away from the Fed's longer-run 2 percent target are now benign. My own baseline forecast is that this relatively calm inflation environment will persist. However, with upside risks to GDP growth and employment, I do believe the risk to the inflation outlook is also to the upside.\n\nIn fact, my baseline forecast for the economy does contemplate some modest upward pressures on inflation over the next several years. For the first time in a long time, I see the potential for inflation to run somewhat above the Fed's longer-run 2 percent target as opposed to the below-target rate we have seen over the past six years.\n\nHow should the FOMC respond if inflation persistently runs somewhat above 2 percent? I have some thoughts about that, but they would take a long time to explain, and I have spoken long enough already this morning.\n\nIf you are interested, I suggest you look at the Atlanta Fed's macroblog next week for some details on those ideas. You can find it on the Atlanta Fed's website.\n\nThanks. Now I'll be glad to take a few of your questions.",

            "content": "Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for that kind introduction.\n\nThis is my first trip to Montgomery. I'm excited to be here and to get to know the city and region better. Later today, I'll be meeting with some local experts in workforce development—a topic I'm especially interested in. It's a big focus of our community development efforts at the Atlanta Fed.\n\nI want to acknowledge the thought leadership we have gotten from Alabama through your Alabama Industrial Development Training program. The leader of the AIDT effort, Ed Castile, sits on the advisory council for the Atlanta Fed's Center for Human Capital Studies.\n\nI've been learning a lot about the Southeast in the past few months, and it's my honor to bring that information to the monetary policy table when we meet every eight weeks or so.\n\nThis afternoon, I'd like to share my views on current economic conditions and talk a bit about how my team and I arrive at a policy outlook. Then I'll turn to an issue that is coming up in my discussions with my staff and local leaders more and more—namely, the differences we are seeing in economic prospects between rural and urban areas.\n\nBefore I begin, let me offer a familiar disclaimer. I'll present only my personal views today. I'm not speaking for the Federal Reserve or for the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nEconomic update  \nSo let's begin with where the national economy stands in the fourth quarter. Despite the series of recent hurricanes that hit the South, economic activity has grown at a reasonably solid pace in recent months. Gross domestic product, or GDP, is estimated to have increased by a little over 2 1/4 percent during the past year, and the unemployment rate now sits at 4.1 percent—down more than half a percentage point from a year ago.\n\nIn my view, the national economy is nearing full employment, meaning that a spike in demand could push the economy beyond its sustainable capacity. This would put pressure on labor costs, as businesses would have to compete more aggressively for an increasingly limited pool of available workers.\n\nThat said, I do not get much of any signal from the boots on the ground that a large, generalized expansion of business activity is in the offing. The Atlanta Fed has an extensive information-gathering network with business contacts in the Southeast. The feedback I have been getting is that businesses overall do not expect a surge in growth. Neither do they expect to see an upshift in growth for cost pressures, including labor costs.\n\nWhen we ask business owners about their prospects over the short to medium term, the dominant view is that business is good, and that acquisitions and market-share capture remain the go-to growth strategies.\n\nIt is possible that tax reform, if it's enacted, could be one of the needle-movers on economic activity. We've started conversations with our contacts to see how changes to the structure of corporate taxes might change their thinking about investment and business expansion. But, as everyone knows, the devil is in the details, and it's too early to know how we would incorporate the impact of fiscal policy changes into our outlook until we see those details.\n\nIn short, all of this anecdotal information convinces me that a reasonable economic forecast for the foreseeable future is more of the same: GDP growth continuing a bit above 2 percent, the unemployment rate in the low 4s, and modest increases in real wage growth.\n\nUnder my baseline scenario, I think it will be appropriate for interest rates to rise gradually over the next couple of years, as our policy position is still very accommodating rather than neutral. How gradual that pace will be depends on the strength of the incoming macroeconomic data and what it implies for the economic outlook.\n\nAnd, as you may know, inflation has softened since the beginning of the year. While I'm still holding to the view that the recent weakness largely reflects idiosyncratic noise, I'll be watching the next few inflation reports closely for signs of a pickup.\n\nThe path to a policy outlook\nI'd like to take a moment to explain how we develop the narrative I just shared. As you can imagine, my staff and I pore over many data releases and reports and run sophisticated econometric models to determine how the economy has performed in the recent past and predict how the economy is likely to perform in the near future.\n\nSeveral of the data points we use are developed at the Atlanta Fed—tools such as GDPNow, the Wage Growth Tracker, and the Business Inflation Expectations survey, for example. I hope you all check out those tools on a regular basis.\n\nOther data points for our models come from regular surveys we conduct of businesses in our region that span the nation's major economic sectors.\n\nAnd, importantly, we continually test the narrative that emerges using anecdotal input from businesses and community leaders to get their sense of how the economy is performing and is likely to perform in the near future.\n\nI can assure you, the Federal Reserve is no ivory tower. We make it a priority to listen to input from throughout the region.\n\nWe accomplish this through an innovative organizational structure that we call the Regional Economic Information Network. Through this network, we have a team of regional executives whose job it is to talk with business and community leaders across the Sixth District. I'd like to take this opportunity to introduce our regional executive for Alabama, Lesley McClure, who is here today. Lesley, could you please stand? I encourage you to share your thoughts with her. Our dialogue with our communities is central to everything we do.\n\nWhen combined with the insight and expertise of my staff, these inputs—data, models, and stories from Main Street—help develop narratives such as the one I shared a moment ago. I hope this gives you a better sense of how we do our work to fulfill our mission.\n\nI believe that meeting the Federal Reserve's dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment is a primary way we can help improve economic opportunity for workers and families in this country. However, expanding economic opportunity and striving for maximum employment require going beyond monetary policy alone, and beyond aggregate statistics on GDP growth and employment.\n\nFor instance, while the overall unemployment rate has declined substantially since 2010, some measures of labor market performance reveal divergences between regions and types of workers. These differences paint a picture of a very complex economy, one that includes many different economic realities. I believe policymakers across government should consider the sources of these differences when thinking about ways to expand economic opportunity.\n\nRural versus urban differences\nI would like to focus the remainder of my remarks on one dimension of difference—the difference in labor market and economic outcomes in rural and urban communities. The urban-rural economic divide, particularly the increasingly difficult plight of rural communities, has come up repeatedly as I've spoken with many business and community leaders. It is clearly an issue that merits attention.\n\nAt the outset, I should say that defining what is rural versus urban is not straightforward. There are no objectively delineated boundaries between the two. Rather, there is a progression such that population densities gradually decline. Different people have varied ideas about how to best draw the line.\n\nFor today, I will distinguish between urban and rural places by relying on official designations of metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas. As a rule, a metropolitan area consists of one or more counties that include a core urban area with at least 50,000 people, plus adjacent counties that have a high degree of social and economic integration with the urban core, as measured by commuting times to work. I will call metro counties urban places. Nonmetro areas are what I will refer to as rural.\n\nSecular forces, such as technological change and globalization, have been at work for several decades and have been particularly difficult for rural places. The Great Recession exacerbated this trend.\n\nThis difficulty is evident when we compare the demographics of urban and rural populations. For example, the rural population is older on average. This is due in part to the migration of younger people to urban areas for better education and job opportunities. As an aside, the older demographic is also associated with the in-migration of people planning to retire for lifestyle reasons.\n\nThe rural population also has less formal education on average, earns less income, has a higher poverty rate, is less racially and ethnically diverse, and has poorer health. The rural population is also less geographically mobile overall.\n\nThe picture is a little more nuanced when one considers labor force attachment. Among people in their prime working ages who have a college degree, the participation rate is actually higher in rural areas versus urban areas. By contrast, the rate of participation for those without a college degree is much lower in rural areas than in urban areas, which is an issue of particular concern here in the South.\n\nThe Great Recession and the subsequent recovery have intensified labor force disparities between urban and rural areas, even for people with less formal education, for whom recovery has been slow. Here in the South, the prime-age urban-area participation rate for those without a college degree, while still below its prerecession level, has been recovering over the past two years. In contrast, participation is more than 6 percentage points lower in southern rural areas than it was in 2007, and it shows no sign of improvement.\n\nResearch by my staff at the Atlanta Fed suggests that differences in health and disability account for a large part of this disparity among regions for less-educated workers. Diabetes and heart disease lead the list of negative health factors. The underlying reasons for these differing trends are not clear. However, the more limited access to health care services and higher incidence of poverty in some rural communities may be an important contributing factor.\n\nDifferences in the characteristics of businesses in urban and rural areas also affect regional labor markets. On the one hand, rural businesses tend to be older, more stable, and more profitable on average. The rate of new business formation is lower, but so is the probability of business failure. Evidence from a 2016 Fed survey of small businesses suggests that this relative stability means that rural businesses are less likely to be financially distressed. However, these businesses also tend to be smaller and not as well positioned to engage in regional or global markets.\n\nThis reality has shaped perceptions of the opportunities that rural areas can provide, prompting many to leave rural areas for the promise of better jobs and incomes in urban places.\n\nSo what does all this mean for the relative performance of rural labor markets? I think there is an interesting paradox.\n\nBecause of low population density and greater distance from population centers, rural businesses often face a more limited pool from which to hire workers who have the needed education, skills, and experience.\n\nPreliminary survey data we have compiled indicate that rural employers are currently having relatively more difficulty filling positions and are having to raise wages to attract workers. Data on average wage rates confirm that wages in rural areas have increased more rapidly in recent years, especially for less-skilled workers. As a result, the traditional urban wage premium for low-skilled workers has shrunk in recent years.\n\nThis evidence, when combined with the decline in labor supply noted earlier, suggests that the rural labor market, particularly for less-educated workers, has tightened more than in urban areas. While jobs requiring less education may be more plentiful in urban areas, the supply of labor has kept up with this demand. In rural areas, the supply of labor appears to be lagging behind demand.\n\nEnsuring access to opportunity and resources\nYou might be thinking that this is an unusual topic for the Fed to be concerned about, and perhaps the Fed should be worrying only about inflation. I think differently. We have a dual mandate: maintaining a stable-price environment and maximizing employment in a sustainable way. The challenges facing rural communities, and urban communities for that matter, may impede our ability to achieve our employment mandate, and we need to keep a focus on these issues.\n\nThat said, I recognize that expanding economic opportunity involves many domains beyond monetary policy, including education policy, workforce and economic development policy, public health policy, and even migration policy.\n\nI believe the Federal Reserve System can play an important role as a facilitator to help local and state business, community, and government leaders find ways to maximize economic opportunity in both rural and urban communities.\n\nFor example, we recently launched the Center for Workforce and Economic Opportunity. Every Reserve Bank has staff engaging in workforce development, and our Center can help advance and elevate this work to policy experts and practitioners alike. I see this effort as a way to find practical solutions to help ensure that all people have the opportunity and resources to enhance their economic circumstances.\n\nThanks for your attention. Now I'll be glad to take some of your questions.",

            "content": "Good morning. It is an honor to be here and to participate in this conference with our colleagues from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.\n\nThis morning, I'd like to kick off the first day of the conference with some reflections on Federal Reserve balance-sheet normalization. This policy represents an unwinding of quantitative easing, which was quite an unconventional policy when it was first implemented in the midst of unprecedented turbulent times. If expanding the balance sheet was unconventional, then the steps we take to normalize it will take us through uncharted territory as well.\n\nI'll begin by trying to answer the question \"Why now?\" with an overview of the current state of the U.S. economy. Then I will move to the expected effects of unwinding the Fed's balance sheet. Finally, I will present some longer-run questions for consideration.\n\nPlease take note that I am speaking only for myself. I do not speak for the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or for any other official in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWhy now? Current state of the U.S. economy\nSo why is the Fed embarking on balance-sheet normalization now? The short answer is that the U.S. economy appears to be on solid footing, and there are several signs that this performance is likely to continue. This year, the U.S. economy is expanding at roughly a 2 percent pace.\n\nMoreover, household incomes continue to rise, reflecting ongoing improvement in the labor market. These trends should provide support for increased consumer spending.\n\nOver the past few years, business investment in the United States has been tepid, partly reflecting a decline in the energy and mining sectors. However, investment growth has picked up over the past few quarters, and I expect it to continue to expand at a pace more consistent with a typical expansion.\n\nExports have also rebounded over the past few quarters, which should help boost the U.S. factory sector. This improvement reflects a stronger global growth profile and a slight depreciation in the dollar this year.\n\nNow, as you know, a few hurricanes have recently battered some of our nation's southern coastal areas. The result was widespread flooding, damage to homes and businesses, and a disruption in economic activity—not to mention the human toll and emotional trauma left in the wake of these storms.\n\nThese disruptions slowed economic growth in the third quarter—likely by up to a percentage point. As the rebuilding and recovery efforts move forward in the fourth quarter, growth should rebound by at least enough to offset the third-quarter loss.\n\nQuarter-to-quarter fluctuations due to the storms have already begun to distort the incoming data, as evidenced in the latest employment report. However, I do not think the storms were enough to knock the economy off track.\n\nNotwithstanding the weak, hurricane-affected September jobs figure, the underlying strength in the labor market has been somewhat of an upside surprise.\n\nThe unemployment rate is already down to 4.2 percent, a level modestly below the Fed's consensus on where it will settle out in the long run. Regardless of where one stands on the question of what unemployment rate we should observe at full employment, I think it is safe to say that we are very close to this, if not there already.\n\nMoreover, the pace of jobs gains is still running well above what is required to maintain the unemployment rate at its current level. In other words, net job creation in the United States remains strong.\n\nStandard measures of labor underutilization appear to be back to or slightly below their precrisis levels, worker confidence is up (as evidenced by increased quit rates), and measures of the number of available workers in the labor pool per job opening are low.\n\nNow, it is true that there are few signs that wage growth in the United States is accelerating.\n\nCombined with a prime-age labor force participation rate that, while rising, is still below its precrisis level, low wage growth may suggest that some residual slack may yet remain in labor markets. But I would judge the shortfall to be relatively small, and getting smaller.\n\nRetail price pressures, like wage growth, appear to be muted.\n\nThe year-over-year growth rate in the Fed's preferred index of inflation—the personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, price index—was at 1.4 percent in August. This is noticeably lower than the inflation rate we had entering into the year, which was near the FOMC's 2 percent longer-run target. Importantly, the weak inflation numbers are not just in the headline statistics. We have also witnessed a slowing in some measures of underlying inflation, such as the core PCE and the Dallas Fed's trimmed-mean PCE measure.\n\nSome of this recent falloff in inflation can be tied to a handful of one-off declines in just a few price categories. But abstracting from those transitory factors still leaves the inflation trend running a bit below the FOMC's target.\n\nThat said, with a relatively strong and still-improving labor market and stable inflation expectations, I am looking for inflation to drift up to 2 percent over the next year or so.\n\nAll told, I think the U.S. economy is in a pretty good place right now after a long period of subdued recovery.\n\nExpected effects of unwinding the Fed's balance sheet\nIt is with this background of the economy being in a relatively good place that I'd like to discuss the recent FOMC decision to begin the process of unwinding the Fed's balance sheet. Let me start by noting that I believe the asset-purchase programs the Fed implemented during the financial crisis and in the early phase of the recovery had meaningful macroeconomic effects.\n\nRecent work by Board of Governors staff estimates that, overall, the three major asset-purchase programs resulted in something on the order of a 100-basis-point decline in the 10-year Treasury yield. This result is primarily attributed to the Fed's acting as a consistent buyer of longer-dated securities, which removed some of the risk to private buyers of these securities and hence reduced the interest rate required by market participants to hold them. Other estimates of the effects of the Fed's asset-purchase programs are in the ballpark of the Board staff estimates.\n\nAs we embark on balance-sheet reductions, there is a natural question: Will these effects be felt in reverse? That is, will the reduction of reinvestments increase 10-year yields and tighten financial conditions as we proceed with winding down the balance sheet?\n\nWhile much is uncertain about this unprecedented policy unwinding, there are good reasons to think that the effects of a gradual and predictable ramping down of the balance sheet will be smaller than the effects measured as the balance sheet expanded.\n\nFirst, it is plausible to think that the effects of large-scale asset-purchase programs are more powerful in times of instability and significant market disruption. Reductions in risk during times of heightened sensitivity to risk should induce stronger market reactions than during times when risks are considered largely manageable or low.\n\nSecond, the size of the maximum monthly reductions will be quite low. To start, the balance sheet will be reduced by no more than $10 billion per month. Even at the maximum planned rate of at most $50 billion per month, the monthly reductions will be less than the pace of accruals during the earlier asset-purchase programs. Thus, the exit will be less dramatic than the entry.\n\nThird, as the economy has grown, the housing market has stabilized, the stock of outstanding Treasury debt has expanded, and the footprint of the Fed's asset holdings relative to the market has declined. In that sense, some reduction of policy accommodation associated with previous balance-sheet actions has already happened, and hence some fraction of the ultimate market effect has already occurred.\n\nFinally, the FOMC communicated its decision to begin reducing the stock of assets held by the Fed, and the contours of its approach, well in advance.\n\nThe series of slowly increasing caps on the size of the balance-sheet reductions that the FOMC has outlined will help ensure that markets can predict the flow of riskless assets that will be available to the private sector. As a consequence, much of the impact of these reductions is likely already built into market interest rates.\n\nOur recent experience in this regard supports this view. The announcement of the start of the program, in the September 2017 FOMC statement, had almost no effect on the 10-year Treasury yield. But even compared to the beginning of that deliberation process, some six months ago, the 10-year yield is little changed.\n\nI believe this outcome reflects the effectiveness of the FOMC's advance communication regarding the coming balance-sheet policy. And in my view, these communications were a great success.\n\nThe FOMC reported initial discussions in its March meeting minutes and issued an addendum to the normalization plans at the end of its June meeting. This document outlined the details of the caps and an implementation timeline.\n\nFinally, FOMC members' public testimony and speeches seemed to focus market participants on the likelihood of a September decision, and this indeed is what happened. As I mentioned, all this preparation was, in my view, key to minimizing any undesirable market volatility. We did not experience a reprise of the so-called \"taper tantrum\" of 2013.\n\nIn terms of lessons learned, in my view, the different market responses to the two attempts of our central bank to begin a normalization of the balance sheet—one extreme market volatility and the other virtually no response in real time—highlights the importance of clear communication. While such clarity of purpose and goals is always of value, it is especially so when in the realm of unconventional policy, where there are few guideposts to help shape the expectations of market participants.\n\nI was not a member of the central bank in 2013. I was teaching at the University of Southern California at the time. I will tell you that, though they understood that the size of the balance sheet needed to eventually be reduced, many industry people I encountered wondered if this new and, in their eyes, sudden decision to taper purchases signaled a return to higher levels of uncertainty and risk.\n\nThough I'm guessing the FOMC did not intend for such a market interpretation, it needed to say so, and with a consistency and relentlessness that left no room for doubt. Such consistency means making speeches that are difficult to give and perhaps even dull.  But the cost of giving too little focus on clear communication can be large.\n\nAnd as you consider changes to your unconventional policies in challenging times, I strongly encourage you to take extra care to ensure your communication strategy is explicit and incorporates enough time for markets to learn and adapt. The additional effort is well worth the reduction in risk.\n\nOn balance, the limited market reaction to the rollout of the Fed's new balance-sheet policy leads me to conclude that financial market participants do not view it as a significant tightening of conditions or a hindrance to economic growth.\n\nAlthough I don't expect financial market conditions to be significantly affected in the coming months by balance-sheet reductions themselves, I, along with my colleagues, will obviously be monitoring financial markets for any change in financial conditions that could affect the macroeconomy.\n\nLonger-run questions\nThe final question related to the balance sheet is, where to from here? The Committee has termed this policy \"balance-sheet normalization,\" but what exactly is a \"normal\" balance sheet for the Federal Reserve? Well, I'm not going to answer that question, because the FOMC has not yet made certain decisions regarding that definition. But I do think we know what some of the key issues are.\n\nThe first thing I should note is that the Fed's balance sheet will likely continue to respond passively to the public's demand for cash (which is a central bank liability). Since the demand for cash has grown substantially since the beginning of the financial crisis, the size of the balance sheet will be larger than precrisis levels.\n\nThe essential outstanding questions about the normalized size of the balance sheet are likely to come down to judgments about the appropriate quantity of reserves held by the banking system. Bank reserves are, of course, the accounts that depository institutions hold with the central bank, and they represent the principal noncash element of Federal Reserve liabilities.\n\nSo, what will the normalized quantity of bank reserves be? There are, in my assessment, two major issues.\n\nFirst, the nature of the FOMC's interaction with the banking system will depend on how private banks' demand for reserves has been fundamentally changed by postcrisis regulatory reforms.\n\nDodd-Frank created new regulations designed to improve the stability of the U.S. financial system. These regulations have likely changed the demand for reserves by U.S. banks and foreign banks with U.S. operations.\n\nFor example, the supplementary leverage ratio and new Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation assessment fee have made it more expensive for U.S. banks to expand their balance sheets. All else equal, this reduces the demand for reserves, which are assets from the vantage point of banks. On the other hand, the new liquidity regulation creates additional demand for high-quality liquid assets, which can include reserves.\n\nHow these factors intersect is complex and still evolving. But banks may well have a much greater demand for reserves now than they did precrisis. The July 2017 update to the Domestic Open Market Operations report offers one illustration of the range of possible outcomes. In that update, New York Fed staff lay out three scenarios for a normalized balance sheet. These scenarios are based on the surveys of market participants and range from $2.4 trillion to $3.5 trillion.\n\nThe second key issue in defining the normalized size of the balance sheet is the important unresolved question of what the operating framework for conducting monetary policy interventions will be.\n\nI'm assuming that all of you at this conference are familiar with the distinctions between the precrisis system in the United States that relied on reserve scarcity and federal funds rate management and today's system of abundant, or nonscarce, reserves with policy implemented via an administered interest rate paid on banks' reserve balances. However, if readers or listeners feel they could use a refresher, I commend the excellent speech by the New York Fed's Lorie Logan delivered to the Money Marketeers of New York University this past May 18.\n\nEffectively, the question becomes whether we \"go home\" to the precrisis operating framework that had been in place for many decades. This return would require engineering a large enough reduction in the balance sheet to once again create a situation in which reserves are scarce. In other words, we would need to find (and maintain) levels of reserves in the entire banking system such that there is competition for those reserves and the demand for them is once again sensitive to changes in the federal funds rate.\n\nWhile returning to an operating system that was well understood and successful sounds attractive, the situation may not be as simple as going home again. I've already mentioned the regulatory changes that make banks' aggregate future demand for reserves uncertain. In addition, the U.S. Treasury has recently altered the way it manages its \"checking account,\" which is held at the Federal Reserve. The balances of this account are an \"autonomous factor\" affecting the supply of reserves in the system. Under a scarce reserves system, daily variations in this autonomous factor need to be projected with a high degree of precision to exert monetary control. So essentially, both demand and supply conditions in the market for reserves would need to be relearned.\n\nConclusion\nThere are many other items on the list of pros and cons for choosing either the precrisis framework of scarce reserves and active funds rate management, or something more like the current situation, with abundant reserves and interest on excess reserves as the main tool for implementing policy. I have not attempted to do justice to them here, and I have not yet made up my mind on the question of what the normalized size of the balance sheet should be.\n\nMy point is only to acknowledge that answering this question is the next major step in the process of normalizing monetary policy. Of course, the Federal Reserve System has been actively engaging in this discussion. You can find reports on a few of these discussions in the minutes of the November 2016 FOMC meeting and in the presentation materials from a conference on normalizing central bank balance sheets that the New York Fed hosted this past July.\n\nWe have the luxury of continuing to be deliberate about seeking answers about the new normal. But I have noted that I view communications about the FOMC's plans as key to the success of full exit from the extraordinary policy interventions of the financial crisis and Great Recession. I look forward to actively engaging with my colleagues in both formulating answers to our outstanding issues and playing my part in communicating our thinking and decisions to the public.",

            "content": "Good morning. It is very good to be here and to be a part of this conference, which brings together leaders not only from the workforce development community, but also from the business community and the broader civic sector who are interested in helping to create employment opportunities. Thank you for taking part in our yearlong workforce development initiative.\n\nI'd also like to thank our partners in the conference: the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs and the Ray Marshall Center for the Study of Human Resources at the University of Texas–Austin; the John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers University; and the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research. Special thanks go to the Dallas Fed for hosting and to Steve Shepelwich from the Kansas City Fed, who led the development of the conference agenda. Finally, thanks to the many others who have contributed to the initiative and conference in ways that have made it much stronger.\n\nThis morning, I plan to frame my thoughts about employment and workforce development around economic opportunity. I'll first discuss where I think the labor market currently stands. Then I will define economic opportunity and some of the new challenges we face in fostering it. I'll wrap up by outlining how the Fed contributes to supporting economic opportunity and by introducing a new communications vehicle to galvanize those efforts.\n\nPlease note that my remarks are my own. I do not speak for the Federal Open Market Committee or for anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nToday's labor market\nSo let's begin with where we are now in terms of employment and opportunity. The good news is that unemployment remains low. The September jobs report showed an unemployment rate of 4.2 percent—essentially where it has been since April. We have seen sustained strong job growth of about 175,000 monthly over the past year. This is well above where the numbers would need to be to keep pace with population growth.\n\nMoreover, there has been a rebound in the share of people in their prime working years, ages 25 to 54, who are actively engaged with the labor market—either working or looking for work. I think the fact that this rate is rising once again is meaningful. It reflects the effects of a robust labor market that is encouraging more people who had been on the sidelines to enter the labor market.\n\nThat said, labor markets continue to suffer from problems that limit the ability of firms to fill vacancies. The average time to fill vacancies has increased significantly, and anecdotal reports from our business contacts suggest that this is largely because the mix of skills that firms are looking for is different from the skills of the people looking for jobs. This type of problem always exists to some extent, but it may be becoming a more significant issue due to the increasing pace of technological change.\n\nBusiness investment may also be linked to challenges in finding appropriately skilled labor. Reports suggest that lack of talent is affecting firms' decisions to invest. The Federal Reserve Banks jointly run an annual Small Business Credit Survey that reaches about 16,000 small businesses annually. In the most recent survey, many businesses noted that they had limited investment spending largely because they are unable to find the labor and talent that would justify the investments. The need for more skilled labor was even more pronounced when we analyzed businesses that were established and had revenues of over $10 million. Local surveys of businesses tell a similar story.\n\nAnd, when talking about labor market problems, we must not overlook the longstanding disadvantages that minorities face in the labor market. Even when adjusting for levels of education, where minorities already lag, some minority groups face unemployment rates between one-and-a-half and two times higher than the overall unemployment rate. These results are consistent across the business cycle.\n\nDefining economic opportunity\nSo how does workforce development fit into this picture? Before I answer this question directly, let me place the question into context. When I think about the Fed's mandated goal of trying to maximize sustainable employment, I have come to a view that another way to describe this mandate is trying to maximize economic opportunity.\n\nEconomic opportunity entails a few foundational aspects, including equality of opportunity. In the context of our work, this means equitable access to opportunity in the labor market and at educational institutions. It also means identifying and addressing gaps in opportunity. While there will be differences in labor market outcomes depending on individual action and aptitude, these outcomes should not be predicted by an individual's socioeconomic background, race, or ethnicity. Without equal access to opportunity, the country leaves economic potential on the table and limits the possibilities of its people.\n\nWith equality of opportunity as a foundation, economic opportunity includes socioeconomic mobility, stability, resilience, and competitiveness as key outcomes.\n\nSocioeconomic mobility is the chance to advance in economic standing as a worker or household. When we ask, \"Are workers able to move up the ladder or navigate the labor market to earn more money and build wealth?\" we are talking about socioeconomic mobility.\n\nStability is the ability to predictably earn, save, and meet financial obligations. Evidence from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors' Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking suggests that increasingly unpredictable and intermittent incomes create challenges for households that can lead to financial stresses. The same is likely true for businesses.\n\nResilience is the ability for communities and workers to adapt rapidly to job loss. Key to resilience is the ability to engage in lifelong learning to help prepare for inevitable change. People often think of resilience in terms of responses to natural disasters like the hurricanes we experienced last month, but it also applies to personal and macroeconomic shocks as well.\n\nFinally, there is competitiveness, which gets at whether businesses and regional economies can find workers and develop strategies to grow and compete in a competitive market. Continuous development of skills is increasingly a part of this outcome. Competitiveness for individuals, businesses, or communities usually depends on the other factors of economic opportunity. Places that provide equality of opportunity, mobility, stability, and resilience are likely to be more competitive in the future than places that do not.\n\nNew challenges in creating economic opportunity\nWorkforce development has always been an important component of helping families achieve true access to economic opportunity. But today, new trends in labor markets are changing how we should all think about supporting and creating economic opportunity.\n\nFirst, technological change continues to influence how workers engage with employers. These changes encompass everything from robotics to artificial intelligence, and include not only how work is executed, but also how it is managed. The adoption of new machines and methods may imperil certain types of work—particularly routine work, both cognitive and noncognitive. At the Atlanta Fed, we recently held a workshop looking at technology-driven changes in the labor market. Coming out of the workshop, we now believe that new ways of measuring change in the labor market are needed. Estimates of the impact of technological change on employment levels over the next several decades vary widely, but history suggests new technology will drive persistent changes in demand for skills.\n\nWe also must acknowledge that the pace of technological change continues to accelerate, making it difficult for workers and firms to predict which adjustments they should make to be successful. If automation and technology are adopted rapidly, tens of millions of people could be put out of work. In terms of workforce development programs, we have to ask ourselves if we are thinking on an appropriate scale. Broad and flexible workforce development and education programs are necessary if they are to be seen as viable supports in a rapidly changing labor market.\n\nThe classic relationship between employer and employee is also changing significantly. The growth of contingent, or \"gig,\" work, which has largely been driven by new software and mobile applications, is important to consider. Does career navigation align with the different ways that workers will engage with employers? If gig work becomes a part of the mainstream, then workers will need to find different ways to build wealth, save for retirement, and get health care than their predecessors did.\n\nThese represent just a few of the new complex challenges in creating economic opportunity. Continued study, response, and action devoted to the changing nature of opportunity will remain priorities at the Federal Reserve, and we hope they will be important to your organizations as well.\n\nThe Fed's role\nWe at the Atlanta Fed, and our colleagues across the Federal Reserve System, believe that a key way for the Fed to support economic opportunity is by meeting our dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment.\n\nBut given some of the challenges I have outlined this morning, we know that expanding economic opportunity and striving for maximum employment go beyond monetary policy alone. As a consequence, the Federal Reserve System is deeply engaged in community and economic development, especially with our focus on workforce development and the labor market. I see this engagement as a vitally important way that we help promote economic opportunity.\n\nThere are many examples of how the Federal Reserve is engaged in work beyond monetary policy that helps to identify and support creating both new economic opportunity and a better understanding of how workforce development can support opportunity.\n\nFor one example, colleagues across the Federal Reserve System have supported identifying links between workforce development and the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). Staff at the Dallas and Kansas City Feds have found examples of effective financial institution engagement in workforce development. As a System, we have been training CRA examiners on workforce development, largely through the leadership of the Richmond and Chicago Feds.\n\nAlso, Federal Reserve staff across the country have recently explored a wealth of related topics such as underemployment, rural issues of workforce development, opportunity occupations, early childhood education, business engagement, access to high-quality jobs, and issues in the labor market for young workers. I believe we need to find ways to elevate this work, to make it more accessible, and to connect it to the ongoing efforts of other organizations across the country.\n\nAs such, I am happy to announce that today, the Atlanta Fed is formally launching the Center for Workforce and Economic Opportunity. The Center, which is a part of the Atlanta Fed's Labor Market Initiative, will act as a bridge between research and practice. Every Reserve Bank's community development group is engaged in workforce development, and the Center will help advance and elevate this work both at our Bank and across the Federal Reserve System. I encourage you to bookmark the Center's website and visit it often to learn about the System's efforts on these topics.\n\nThe Center will help create a public face for the diverse work being done across the Federal Reserve System on workforce and economic opportunity. We want to make the Fed's deep research on the labor market available and accessible to the public.\n\nThrough the Center, my team will offer this research, with the goal of advancing opportunities for policymakers and practitioners to improve economic opportunities for all Americans.\n\nI believe that employment and education are critical ways to support economic opportunity for low- and moderate-income workers. But these interventions are also part of a larger mosaic of policies and programs that support economic mobility. We plan to take advantage of the deep relationships that we have with the community development field and work to link them with the workforce development and employment policy community.\n\nYou have started some important work here over the past two days, and I hope you will continue to connect with the Federal Reserve System and see us as partners in helping to create opportunities for workers and businesses. Thank you.",

            "content": "Good afternoon. I am delighted to address the Atlanta Press Club in my first official speech as Atlanta Fed president. I've been on the job since early June and already have three policy meetings under my belt. So I think I'm getting the hang of things in a hurry.\n\nAs you may know, I've never lived in the Southeast until now. Everyone asks me how I'm adjusting. I have to say that it has been wonderful so far. Southern hospitality is more than just a saying—it's a real thing that comes out in so many ways, from so many people and organizations. I feel right at home already.\n\nThis is a diverse region, but one that largely mirrors the national economy. And metro Atlanta itself is a powerhouse of opportunity for most people. I think it holds the promise of being a beacon for everyone.\n\nToday I plan to offer my thoughts on the state of the national economy as I see it today, focusing on our two main policy objectives—low and stable inflation and maximum sustainable employment. Then I'll move to the monetary policy situation and some of the questions my staff and I are wrestling with. Finally, I'll tease up some broader issues in the economy that I've been thinking about for future consideration.\n\nBefore I get started, let me offer this disclaimer. I don't speak for any of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve or the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). I speak only for myself.\n\nOverview of economic conditions\n I'd like to start by talking a bit about how the national economy is performing as the third quarter draws to a close. I want to point out that the next few sets of data points may not provide clear signals, owing to the disruptions caused by hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Jose, and Maria. These hurricanes were terrible events and caused a lot of pain and loss. Our thoughts and prayers remain with those who suffered losses as a result. I must say that I was very impressed by the resilience shown by this region and the Sixth District in the wake of Hurricane Irma. The professionalism and preparation of emergency responders was robust, and people came together wonderfully. It was a marvel to watch, and I am grateful for their efforts and sacrifice.\n\nIn terms of economic performance, my staff estimates that Harvey and Irma may well shave up to a percentage point from third-quarter growth, but we expect to make that all up in the fourth quarter, if not exceed it, as recovery and rebuilding efforts ramp up.\n\nBefore the storms, real economic activity had been proceeding about as I expected. Growth in gross domestic product, or GDP, picked up in the second quarter of this year after a relatively soft first quarter. The Commerce Department revised its estimate of second-quarter growth up to 3 percent.\n\nPrior to Harvey and Irma, it appeared that the second-quarter strength was continuing into the third quarter. And even after the hurricanes, real GDP growth in the neighborhood of slightly better than 2 percent still seems like a reasonable expectation for this year as a whole.\n\nNotwithstanding the somewhat softer-than-expected payroll employment growth in August, labor markets have generally surprised us to the upside. The U.S. economy has created an average of better than 175,000 jobs a month thus far in 2017.\n\nAll else equal, the number of jobs it would take to maintain the unemployment rate near its current level is about 115,000 per month, according to the Atlanta Fed's Jobs Calculator. So I think it is fair to say that the pace of job creation in the United States remains strong.\n\nThe official unemployment rate has fallen by a significant amount since the beginning of the year. It currently sits just below its pre-financial-crisis level, at 4.4 percent.\n\nI could point to many other statistics to suggest the solid condition of the U.S. labor market, but there is one that deserves special mention: the share of people in their prime working years, ages 25 to 54, who are actively engaged with the labor market—either working or looking for work.\n\nOver the last two years, the rate of prime-age labor force attachment has rebounded by more than 1 percentage point, after having fallen by about 3 percentage points from the beginning of the recession through 2015.\n\nI think the fact that this rate is rising once again is meaningful. I'm going to return to this point in a few minutes when I turn to what I think all of this means for monetary policy.\n\nI'll close my discussion of the state of the economy with a few words on inflation.\n\nAs you know, the FOMC has an inflation objective of 2 percent over the longer run, as measured by the annual increase in the price index for personal consumption expenditures.\n\nDefining the \"longer run\" is a matter of some art and personal preference, but by almost any measure, year-over-year inflation has fallen short of this objective for the past five years. I think five years is a contender for a reasonable definition of the longer run.\n\nAs a monetary policymaker, I take seriously the continued shortfall of inflation from the Committee's longer-term objective.\n\nAssessing the stance of monetary policy\n Now I'll turn to how these facts inform my thinking about the appropriate course of monetary policy. If you think you hear a definitive tilt in my position, I urge you to resist that conclusion. None of what I am about to say should signal a locked-in stance about the appropriate course of policy. I just want to be as transparent as possible in how I am currently processing the data as well as input from our business contacts in the region.\n\nIf you follow the public commentary of my FOMC colleagues, you would likely, and correctly, conclude that they are devoting considerable energy to understanding what underlies weaker-than-expected inflation, not just in the United States, but globally.\n\nOne prominent explanation is advances in technology that have yielded ever-lower costs of production. Another candidate is ever-increasing competitive pressures that have kept the lid on prices.\n\nI think the book is just being written on the impact of these developments, but I have some initial skepticism about whether these are adequate explanations for a long bout of lower-than-target inflation.\n\nIt is true that advances in technology should put downward pressure on costs, which should limit increases in the prices consumers face. But these advances should also spark growth in productivity.\n\nProductivity growth has been exceptionally weak for most of the recovery. There are almost certainly issues in measuring productivity in times when technology is evolving rapidly. However, it is not yet clear to me that the measurement issue is large enough to resolve the inflation puzzle of the last five years or so.\n\nWhat about increased competition as a cause of low inflation? This explanation certainly has some appeal. All we have to do is think of China and Amazon.\n\nBut here, too, I have some skepticism. If competitive pressures are the cause of ongoing low inflation, then we would expect to see, on average, persistently falling profit margins. I don't think the facts align with a story that fundamentally relies on an ongoing profit squeeze over the past five years.\n\nAs I say, the book is still being written on how well various explanations of lower-than-desired inflation hold up. But I think one extremely important point needs emphasis.\n\nThe FOMC has stated that \"the inflation rate over the longer run is primarily determined by monetary policy, and hence the Committee has the ability to specify a longer-run goal for inflation.\"\n\nTo me this means that, in the longer run, a central bank should be able to achieve its inflation objective independent of secular trends that exert downward pressure on the rate of change in consumer prices.\n\nPut more directly, if the inflation rate runs below a central bank's target for an extended period of time, it is difficult for me to conclude that monetary policy is overly easy.\n\nOf course, over much of the past five years, there was a widespread consensus that monetary policy was not overly easy in light of economic circumstances. The question becomes, is that still the case today?\n\nMy inclination is that the stance of monetary policy is not currently too accommodative. Let me point to two reasons.\n\nFirst, as noted, the rate of inflation remains below the FOMC's objective, with no sustained movement toward 2 percent.\n\nSecond, as I discussed earlier, I am impressed that the labor force participation rate for those in their prime working years has been increasing.\n\nThis increase reflects the effects of a robust labor market that is both encouraging more people who had been on the sidelines to enter the labor market and keeping more people engaged in the workforce who might have otherwise left.\n\nWork at the Atlanta Fed has shown that the recent increase in the prime-age labor force participation rate has been concentrated among women, and especially women with a high school education or less.\n\nAs noted in an article in the Economist, workers with less than a college degree tend to be \"the first to suffer from recessions and the last to benefit from recoveries.\" One interpretation of the surge in participation in this group is that the process of full recovery from the Great Recession is not yet quite complete.\n\nThis increase in prime-age labor force participation, combined with the lack of rising pressures on either aggregate inflation or wage growth, leads me to think there remains some residual amount of slack in the labor markets. This, in turn, persuades me that the current stance of monetary policy is not overly easy for the circumstances.\n\nI also want to note that U.S. monetary policy is not standing still. As you all are aware, at the last meeting the FOMC announced that it is beginning the process of slowly winding down the balance sheet from the elevated levels created by the Fed's policy responses to the financial crisis, recession, and slow recovery.\n\nTo summarize, I conclude that monetary policy is not currently overly easy. But this is not a statement as to whether or not further adjustments in policy are required. My staff's own projections indicate continued strength in the economy and progress toward the FOMC's inflation objective as the year concludes and we move into 2018. I think clear evidence of this path could certainly be consistent with an additional rate hike this year.\n\nAs for now, however, I have an open mind on when the next step in the normalization process will be necessary.\n\nSome future considerations\n I'll conclude with some future considerations that I believe will merit our attention in the coming months and years. Decoding the data that inform monetary policy is complicated by ongoing, and enormous, structural changes in the global economy.\n\nThough I am not yet convinced they provide an adequate explanation for recent inflation trends, there is little doubt that technological forces are generating important changes in the economic landscape. These changes go by many names: \"the new machine age\" and \"the fourth industrial revolution\" are among the more prominent ones.\n\nGlobalization, I might add, is both an effect and a cause of these technological forces. The combination of the two is rapidly altering the world as we know it. Think of examples like Uber and Airbnb, which have reimagined mainstream economic sectors.\n\nThe effects of these changes are not hard to find.\n\nOne is the shift in economic activity from medium-sized cities dominated by one or a few anchor businesses to big, diversified urban centers.\n\nA second one is the decline of middle-income opportunities for individuals lacking specialized skills or training—and the inequality and social dysfunction that lack of opportunity brings. I will be speaking to some of these issues next week in Austin at a workforce development conference the Fed is cohosting with partners in business and academia.\n\nA third effect of technological change is rapid financial innovation, often going under the rubric of \"fintech,\" which continues to transform familiar forms of financial intermediation. This innovation is of particular interest to the central bank because of our role as a financial services regulator and provider.\n\nAs you may know, beyond the conduct of monetary policy, the Federal Reserve System promotes the stability of the financial system, the safety and soundness of individual financial institutions and payment and settlement systems, and consumer protection and community development.\n\nThe challenges of the new industrial revolution affect every one of these purposes and functions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nAs the new president and CEO of the Atlanta Fed, I look forward to many opportunities to discuss these challenges and, perhaps more important, discuss how they might be best addressed.\n\nNow I'll be glad to take a few of your questions.",

            "content": "_______________________________________________________________\n\nThank you for the opportunity to speak to this group of leaders of the very important state of Florida.\n\nFlorida is a bellwether state in the national economy. It's the third most populous state, so consumer activity here contributes significantly to trends in consumer activity nationwide. Tourism—so important to this state—tells us a lot about the state of mind of domestic consumers and their propensity to spend. Residential real estate development in Florida is a signal of national (and also international) demand conditions and consumer confidence.\n\nI could go on, but the point is that Florida, with its diverse sub-economies and cultures, is an important window into the national economic picture. Trends, both positive and negative, and economic challenges in Florida have national relevance.\n\nToday I plan to do three things with my remarks. I will interpret the decision of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to leave policy unchanged at our recent meeting of September 20 and 21. I will offer my assessment of the current state of the national economy and the outlook. And I will discuss how human capital influences economic outcomes.\n\nGrowth is a central issue of our times. Growth results from rising numbers in the workforce, enhancement of their tools, and improvement of their skills.\n\nAt the national level, a central question today is, why is actual and potential growth restrained? Over the last several quarters, my FOMC colleagues and I have been progressively writing down our estimates of medium-term and long-run growth in official forecasts. There are a number of contributing factors. An important one is low growth of labor productivity. So another question is, why does the trend of productivity growth continue to run low? In my remarks I'll provide my personal views on these questions, and I'll offer some thoughts on state and local workforce development efforts as a way to improve labor productivity.\n\nAs always, all my remarks will be personal views. I'm not speaking for the Federal Reserve or the FOMC.\n\nStance of monetary policy\nAs I mentioned a moment ago, the FOMC left the policy interest rate—the federal funds rate—unchanged at our last meeting. The policy rate target range is set just 1/4 of a percent above a setting of zero, for all practical purposes.\n\nYou may also be aware that on three occasions in recent years, the FOMC undertook bond-buying programs in an effort to keep longer-maturity interest rates low. These programs swelled the central bank's balance sheet to around $4.5 trillion today. The FOMC is maintaining the status quo balance sheet as part of a quite accommodative stance of policy.\n\nIn the statement following last week's meeting, the Committee acknowledged that the national economy is improving and the case for a policy rate increase has strengthened. Nonetheless, the decision was to stand pat for the time being. That phrase—for the time being—appeared in the statement suggesting, as I see it, that a change in policy could occur before long. However, I did support the consensus view that, before taking the next move, it makes sense to see a little more evidence of progress toward our statutory policy objectives.\n\nState of the economy and outlook\nThose statutory policy objectives are full employment and low and stable inflation. They are the north stars of monetary policy. So, decisions of the Committee to adjust policy settings are highly influenced by our collective assessment of how far the economy is from the goals of full employment and a sustainable rate of inflation close to 2 percent. Think of full employment and 2 percent inflation as indications of an economy operating at steady state. When we've achieved those two objectives on a sustainable basis, policy should be set at neutral—neither intentionally stimulative nor intentionally restrictive.\n\nIn my opinion, the national economy remains short of these two steady-state conditions, but not by a lot. An evaluation of employment conditions ought to take into consideration a wide set of indicators, including conditions of various age cohorts and demographic groups. That said, the headline national unemployment rate is a useful gauge. Unemployment in August stood at 4.9 percent. This is within the range of last week's estimates from FOMC participants of the long-run sustainable unemployment rate.\n\nLikewise, there are a variety of ways to assess inflation. The measure preferred by the FOMC stood at 0.8 percent for the year through July. Headline inflation is influenced by volatile elements like prices of gasoline and foodstuffs. If these categories of prices prone to ups and downs are excluded, core inflation over the last 12 months stands at 1.6 percent. There is some difference of opinion among economists and my colleagues whether or not the core inflation shortfall is all that material.\n\nAs a policymaker, I take both the current employment picture and recent inflation indicators as encouraging. We're closing in on our objectives. We're nearing our objectives despite a relatively weak pace of growth.\n\nThe economy expanded slowly in the first half of the year at a rate closer to 1 percent. The Atlanta Fed's estimate of growth in the third quarter, the current quarter just about to end, is slightly below 3 percent. We believe this pickup in the pace of growth will continue through the fourth quarter such that growth for the year overall will likely end up just shy of 2 percent.\n\nA 2 percent annual rate of growth has been the story of our economy's recovery since the recession ended in the summer of 2009. We've made substantial progress even with sluggish growth, particularly in broad measures of employment.\n\nThe reality of a solidly performing labor market suggests that even at 2 percent, the economy has been running above its long-run potential rate of growth. The thought is that idle or underutilized resources—including labor resources—are absorbed into the economy when it operates for a period above steady state.\n\nPotential economic growth is limited by growth in the size of the labor force and how productive that labor force is. I'll repeat that in a slightly more complicated way. Population growth, adjusted for participation, times productivity yields economic growth.\n\nBoth labor force participation and the rate of growth of labor productivity have been constraining potential for a number of years.\n\nLet me elaborate further on each factor. The explanation for declining participation is multifaceted, but a significant portion of the decline is explained by demographics. Baby boomers are reaching retirement age, and although some are extending their working lives, their participation overall is falling. Florida, of course, is the beneficiary of this phenomenon from the perspective of population growth.\n\nThere are other things affecting participation—for example, millennials staying in school longer and two-earner families reverting to one earner as the economy has improved.\n\nRecently we have seen a slight uptick in participation. I attribute this to people who used to be out of the workforce rejoining the workforce, encouraged, in my view, by the continuing growth of jobs. Monthly payroll job growth has averaged 204,000 over the last year and 232,000 over the last three months. I expect we will continue to see job growth comfortably above the number needed to absorb population growth. So I expect we'll see either a further drop in the unemployment rate or a continuation for a while of the reversal of the participation trend. Possibly both. That said, my medium- to long-term assumption is a persistent decline in participation. Demography is destiny, you might say. It would require an implausible rise in the labor force participation rate to fully offset the predictable retirement numbers of baby boomers.\n\nLabor productivity growth\nLet me now comment on labor productivity growth. I believe a good deal of the explanation of weak productivity growth relates to weak spending on capital equipment. Investment in the structures, equipment, software, and other intellectual property products used by the labor force has been very soft since the early years following the end of the recession. When we at the Atlanta Fed ask business leaders across the Southeast about reticence to invest more, we hear a range of reasons. In Louisiana, we hear about the severe cutback in drilling structures investment because of the fall of oil prices. This is just part of the picture, however. A broader sample of businesspeople—representing both small businesses and larger enterprises—tells us that businesses are cautious about predicting future demand in a low-growth economic environment. And, very frequently, we hear references to greater perceived uncertainty—geopolitical, domestic politics, regulation, fiscal, financial stability.\n\nIn my latest forecast of economic performance through 2019, I assumed a modest pickup in capital spending just to sustain a 2 percent rate of growth over that timespan. Importantly, I am not assuming an increase of capital deepening across the economy of a magnitude that would rapidly and meaningfully boost productivity.\n\nI'll repeat the simple growth equation from my introduction. Growth results from rising numbers participating in the workforce, enhancement of their tools, and improvement of their skills. With declining participation—even while the population is growing—and weak investment in capital goods, the country has challenges achieving strong growth. How to respond? I believe workforce development programs have a place in the response to these challenges.\n\nThe role of workforce development\nOver the last year or so, my community and economic development team at the Atlanta Fed has sharpened its focus on workforce development systems and policies. The Federal Reserve System overall has stepped up resources devoted to workforce development research and engagement of stakeholders.\n\nWe believe workforce development represents fertile ground. I'll point to five opportunities.\n\nFirst, the workforce development landscape is fragmented and could be better coordinated as an industry. Our community and economic development team engaged with a group of 25 organizations across metro Atlanta engaged in workforce development. Atlanta is a representative large city. The group found a lot of duplication of services and limited communication between and among organizations. There is much scope for greater collaboration.\n\nSecond, too many providers of workforce development programs are not sufficiently aligned with employers. In a recent study of just over 200 providers in Atlanta's workforce development community, we found only 30 percent had a relationship with an employer.\n\nI'll note that Florida has taken an important first step in broadening connections to the business community by rebranding all of its public workforce boards under the CareerSource banner. This common brand has helped to make resources more available and understandable to businesses and job seekers.\n\nThird, programs do not operate at large enough scale to meet the needs of employers and workers. We see potential to expand programs that have a demonstrated record of success. We're also of the view that states in the forefront of workforce development efforts would be well advised to leverage the power of existing resources such as community and technical college systems.\n\nFourth, the funding situation of workforce development programs is complex. There has been significant reliance on federal and philanthropic grant funding. There are multiple federal programs that fund workforce development, but they have been in decline. Funding from state and local governments is uneven. Funding challenges make good programs hard to scale. My colleagues believe that new financial models are needed to attract funding to workforce development programs. We're working on this.\n\nFinally, improved data collection and dissemination will help direct resources to programs that are effective. We recently invited state labor data directors in our region to a meeting to discuss their data systems—what they thought was working and where they were seeking improvement. Representatives from CareerSource Florida and the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity joined in the discussion. They pointed to improvement in the state's longitudinal data system. The intent is to evaluate the effectiveness of training programs for workers over the long term. We also heard about efforts to source local information across Florida on prevailing salaries in order to direct resources to programs that fill actual labor market gaps and deliver higher and more immediate returns on investment.\n\nThese are opportunities—opportunities to bring workforce development efforts to bear on labor productivity and, ultimately, growth of potential and realized economic growth. An important state like Florida ought to be a leader in this movement.\n\nWe all want to see stronger growth. As a policymaker, I would like to see growth modestly above potential for the immediate future to absorb remaining labor market slack. I would also like to improve potential—that is, I'd like to find ways to improve the longer-run trend rate of growth. I believe doing so involves strategies that address fundamentals like our economy's endowment of human capital.",

            "content": "_______________________________________________________________\n\nI'd like to welcome this distinguished group of economists to Atlanta. You will see me twice today and will get a full dose of Fedspeak. I will present some views in the coming minutes, and then this afternoon I will moderate a discussion with the chair of the Atlanta Fed, Tom Fanning, who is the chairman, president, and CEO of Southern Company, based here in Atlanta. My colleague Dave Altig, executive vice president and director of research at the Atlanta Fed, will also speak this afternoon.\n\nFor those of you who closely follow commentary of Fed officials, today is your last chance to hear views of the FOMC (or Federal Open Market Committee) participants for a week and a half. As I'm sure you are aware, tomorrow we begin the observance of a blackout period on public comments related to monetary policy ahead of the FOMC meeting.\n\nFinancial markets seem to be very sensitive to remarks of Fed speakers at the moment. I'd like to avoid any chance of contributing to market volatility in advance of the September 20 and 21 meeting, so this morning I don't plan to offer an opinion on what will likely be done at the September, November, or December meetings.\n\nRather, I will talk about what I think are the most important considerations for a policymaker at this juncture and how I'm weighting certain considerations.\n\nYou are all familiar with the Fed disclaimer. I will offer my individual views. I am not speaking for the Federal Reserve or the FOMC.\n\nSummary economic picture\nIn interviews at the Jackson Hole meeting in late August, I took the position that if the incoming data leading up to next week's meeting remained consistent overall with my sense of the economy, I would encourage \"serious discussion\" of a policy rate increase.\n\nNotwithstanding a few recent weak monthly reports—from the Institute for Supply Management, for example—I am satisfied at this point that conditions warrant that serious discussion.\n\nI believe the economy is sustaining sufficient momentum to substantially achieve the Committee's monetary policy objectives in an acceptable medium-term time horizon.\n\nLet me provide a high-level summary of the economic picture, as I see it, and then I will go into a little more depth on key points. The economy is expanding at a moderate pace fueled mostly by growth of consumer activity. Business investment spending remains subdued. Jobs growth remains on a positive trend. I expect a slowdown as we approach full employment. Underlying inflation continues to run about 1/2 percent below target. Wage pressures are accelerating and broadening out as we approach full employment.\n\nIn its fundamentals, the economy seems to be chugging along, not stalling out. I'll go a little deeper on some of these points.\n\nA more detailed look at certain elements\n\nFirst, growth: After relatively weak growth over the first half of the year, I expect a stronger second half. Recent incoming evidence has pushed the Atlanta Fed's third-quarter tracking estimate above 3 percent annualized growth. I'm referring to GDPNow, our real-time nowcasting tool. The author of GDPNow, Pat Higgins, will be speaking at this conference tomorrow.\n\nStrong readings on consumer spending, a solid report on private construction activity, and a positive signal from the latest factory orders numbers have contributed to our sense that growth is accelerating in the third quarter.\n\nI probably don't have to explain to this audience that there are error bands around our tracking estimate. At this point in the quarter, the 70 percent confidence interval stretches from 2 1/4 percent annualized growth to 4 1/2 percent. A number of other forecasters have a point estimate in the mid-twos, so I believe I'm on solid ground saying we'll see stronger growth in the third quarter than we did over the preceding three quarters.\n\nI see full-year growth in 2016 coming in a little below 2 percent, just shy of the growth rate we've seen, on average, over the seven-plus years of recovery. With the weak first and second quarters, arithmetic produces that shortfall, but I consider the basic narrative of growth around 2 percent to remain intact. From that perspective, I see full-year 2016 as more of the same.\n\nEmployment\nTurning to employment, we are continuing to make progress toward our full employment mandate. Jobs growth has averaged 232,000 over the past three months, in line with the trend over the past year. I don't rely on any single indicator to judge the health of the labor market. Various measures of unemployment and underemployment are inside a range I would consider at or very close to full employment.\n\nAdmittedly, the headline unemployment rate has leveled off in recent months. But I attribute this to an increased flow of people into the labor force, along with fewer exits. Participation appears to have stabilized and ticked up slightly. This higher participation is likely a response to the ongoing, relatively strong employer demand for workers as suggested by surveys of job openings and measures of churn.\n\nThe 12-month trend in payroll jobs growth has slowed a bit from its peak in the beginning of 2015, and I think it's reasonable to expect some further slowing in jobs growth as the economy approaches full employment. Importantly, I consider the most recent number—151,000—to be comfortably above the various estimates of \"break even,\" the number needed to hold the unemployment rates constant. This suggests to me that we will continue to make progress in absorbing underutilized labor resources. While it is hard to pinpoint exactly when the labor market has reached full employment, I think the balance of evidence suggests the residual slack in the labor market is relatively small.\n\nInflation\nThat said, we are not yet seeing inflation data confirming that we're near full employment. I find the continuing shortfall from the Committee's inflation target and the ambiguous evidence of movement toward target to be a frustrating element in the picture.\n\nHeadline inflation is roughly 1 percentage point below target, while measures of underlying inflation are trending about half a percentage point below target.\n\nA number of factors are at work in any given period. To my way of thinking, inflation experience basically is a function of inflation expectations (the anchor), resource slack (the Phillips curve component), and transitory influences such as commodity prices, the dollar's effect on import prices, and seasonal factors.\n\nAs I've said, I see the slack component as modest. And unquestionably, transitory factors have had significant influence on headline numbers.\n\nAs regards expectations, even with declines in some expectations measures over the past year or so, I am satisfied inflation expectations remain stable and adequately anchored.\n\nMy staff has done some work recently looking at the spread of inflation expectations. Our conclusion is that the typical forecaster or business decision maker's inflation projection has remained fairly constant over the last few years, but the distribution of inflation expectations has tightened up. Those expecting a breakout of inflation to the upside have adjusted their expectations lower.\n\nI am a big believer in a dashboard approach to assessing the run rate of inflation. So, working with my team at the Atlanta Fed, I look at a wide range of price measures. For policy purposes, we are always trying to discern the fundamental underlying behavior of prices separate from transitory influences. Recently we have been closely monitoring the Dallas Fed's trimmed-mean inflation index as a reasonable proxy for the underlying inflation trend.\n\nThis measure of inflation has been very constant for four years now. It's been consistently around 1.6 percent and has varied from that reading by only two-tenths or less. By this measure, progress toward the Committee's inflation objective appears to have stalled. The inflation data overall have not been suggesting disinflation or deflation, but the flat trend line is enough below target that, in my opinion, the shortfall cannot be considered immaterial. I find this to be an awkward state of affairs.\n\nYou will recall that last December, when the Committee decided to raise the policy rate for the first time in almost a decade, accompanying communication used the expression \"reasonably confident\" when projecting the inflation outlook on which the decision was, in part, premised.\n\nI voted for the increase and supported the rationale. In my public comments after the meeting, I emphasized my desire to see tangible evidence of rising inflation in 2016 to support subsequent rate increases. At times during this year, we detected hints of accelerating inflation, but I have to say the evidence is not overwhelmingly convincing. I am still relying on \"reasonable confidence\" to a greater extent than evidence in hand. My base case forecast is that inflation will trend toward target once the slack in our labor and product markets is sufficiently reduced. Given ongoing improvement in labor markets and output, I believe that process is continuing, and, therefore, confidence is justified.\n\nPolicy setting in this context\nFor me, the inflation outlook is a very important consideration. I am putting a lot of weight on it. You've heard my base case inflation scenario, but I acknowledge the need to consider other narratives. I cannot totally dismiss an alternative scenario that describes the economy as stuck in a state of relatively weak growth, low productivity growth, and soft inflation. As you well know, this perspective is sometimes associated with the secular stagnation thesis. This line of thinking also shares ground with the attention given recently to the level of the neutral rate—both short-term R-star and the longer-term equilibrium policy rate.\n\nI have not signed on to this alternative view of an economy stuck in a state of weak performance. My approach to upcoming policy discussions is to hold to my base case outlook—one that sees both mandated policy objectives achieved in the medium term. I am treating the alternative scenario as a risk.\n\nMy base case forecast lines up well with feedback from many people in the economic trenches. Anecdotal reports of my contacts among business and community leaders pretty consistently have been describing steadily improving economic conditions—not great, but not bad. Most of our business contacts expect continuing growth of demand at a moderate pace and accelerating wage pressures. They cite a range of uncertainties restraining capital investment. They perceive their worlds as steadily returning to normal. They are cautiously optimistic for the most part.\n\nThese soundings of contacts in my region—even if anecdotal—influence how I frame the key questions I need to think about in the weeks preceding an FOMC meeting.\n\nAmong these—and I will close on this note—are, first, what is the right policy setting given an outlook of getting to full employment and price stability relatively soon—in the next couple of years? And, if 1.6 percent inflation and 4.9 percent unemployment were all you knew about the economy, would you consider a policy setting one tick above the zero lower bound still appropriate? These are some of the questions on my mind as I approach the next few meetings. I think circumstances call for a lively discussion next week.",

            "content": "_______________________________________________________________\n\nIn late July, the Bureau of Economic Analysis released its first estimate of second-quarter growth of gross domestic product (GDP). Growth in the quarter was estimated at 1.2 percent annualized. The number was below our expectations at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and below the predictions of many others. The report has been treated as a downer. I gave an interview on August 2 and got the question, \"What do you make of the dismal GDP report?\" It's not surprising a GDP report so much below expectations evoked strong reactions.\n\nWhen the history of the post-recession economic expansion is written, it will be described as a long period of relatively slow growth. Through mid-2015, GDP growth averaged a little over 2 percent. Over the last year, GDP growth has averaged just 1.2 percent. Over the first half of 2016, GDP growth has averaged just 1.0 percent at an annual rate. At face value, it might appear that economic momentum is decelerating.\n\nAt these low numbers, an apparent decelerating pace of growth would not seem compatible with policymakers' thinking about raising interest rates. Yet I, as one Fed policymaker, am not prepared to rule out at least one rate hike before year's end.\n\nToday I will examine the national economy's underlying momentum by decomposing recent GDP growth. I will argue that the headline number overstates weakness last quarter. I'll draw attention to real final sales, a subset of GDP, as a better indication of economic momentum. Looked at through the lens of real final sales, the report was not so disappointing and is consistent with our experience over much of the recovery that began seven years ago in the summer of 2009.\n\nI'll also lay out my baseline outlook for the rest of the year and next year, and I'll discuss the key risks I perceive around that outlook. As always, I will be presenting my individual views. I'm not speaking for the Federal Reserve, or for the Federal Open Market Committee, the FOMC.\n\nGrowth over the recovery\nLet me start by providing some historical context for our current economy. As I said, from the summer of 2009 up to mid-year last year, official readings of growth of economic output had averaged a little over 2 percent.\n\nIn speeches a couple of years back, I was arguing that although the U.S. economy seemed caught \"in a 2 percent growth world,\" the economy would shortly vault into a 3 percent world as various headwinds abated. That has not happened.\n\nIn my official forecasts submitted quarterly as part of the FOMC process, and in my public comments, I have marked down my expectations of what is sufficient growth. I've come to the view that GDP growth at around 2 percent in today's economy is sufficient to achieve the Fed's monetary policy objectives of full employment and price stability in a reasonable timeframe.\n\nWe've seen pretty strong employment performance despite the weaker-than-expected growth of real GDP. From the peak of unemployment in October 2009, the economy has added more than 14 million jobs, and the official unemployment rate has declined to 4.9 percent according to the last report of the Bureau of Labor Statistics for July. In the past 12 months alone, the economy has added two and a half million jobs.\n\nWhile jobs growth has been impressive, wage growth has been modest over the full period of recovery. Only recently have we begun to detect broad-based wage pressures. Still, these wage pressures may be signs we're approaching full employment. Wage inflation can also be a factor in the firming of broad inflation we desire.\n\nRecent growth story\nOver seven-plus years of moderate growth, the mix of factors contributing or detracting from growth has not been constant. The immediate drivers of and drags on expansion have ebbed and flowed.\n\nLet me take a moment and walk you through the moving parts, so to speak, of GDP accounting. Estimates of gross domestic product measure total output. The biggest elements of total output are goods and services produced and consumed in a given period, the net change in private-sector inventories (inventories produced in the current period to be consumed later, less those produced earlier and consumed in the current period), the net of exports (output produced here but consumed abroad) and imports (output produced abroad but consumed here), and residential and business fixed investment. In addition, roughly a fifth of our economy is government services and investment.\n\nEarly in the recovery, growth was driven by a substantial ramp-up in business investment. One way to understand this is as a catching up of investment deferred during the recession. Business investment included both fixed investment—that is, capital expenditures—and inventory. Consumer activity was fairly weak, except for autos. Government spending was a drag because of shrinking state and local budgets.\n\nLater in the recovery, investment trailed off and has recently become a drag on growth. Consumption has strengthened as household wealth and incomes have recovered.\n\nThis is, in good part, the picture today. Recent economic momentum has been consumer-driven. Inventory drawdown has been a drag on growth over the last five quarters, a rather long period. Exports relative to imports remain a drag. Government has moved from a drag on growth to a modest contributor to growth. And very importantly, business fixed investment—capital spending by the private sector—continues to be weak. Yes, the drop in energy prices has suppressed oil and gas structures investment, but this is just part of the story. Business investment overall has been on a slowing trend since 2012 and has actually declined over the past year.\n\nBusiness fixed investment\nWeakness in business investment is an unusual phenomenon for an expansion. There are a number of plausible explanations. I will cite some that my team has heard from our contacts across the Southeast.\n\nOur business contacts mention heightened uncertainty—both global and domestic. This has been a recurrent theme for some time.\n\nSometimes our contacts cite specific events on the horizon. An example would be the recent Brexit referendum in the United Kingdom. Recently I've heard mention of political uncertainty here in the United States associated with the upcoming election. I don't have direct causal evidence linking weak business investment and current political uncertainty, but it's possible the election is a factor—maybe not a primary factor—but a factor nonetheless affecting investment decision making.\n\nRecent research on the effects of uncertainty on economies suggests that even discrete spikes in uncertainty can have prolonged negative impacts on investment activity. Given the seeming frequency of risk events, the picture may just be one of decision makers never getting out of wait-and-see mode.\n\nSpecific concerns like Brexit have been elements of a general atmosphere of heightened uncertainty fueled by—for example—political dysfunction, distressing fiscal scenarios, and worldwide economic and financial developments. Starting with the FOMC's January meeting this year, the Committee has noted in post-meeting statements that risks associated with \"global economic and financial developments\" bear close watching.\n\nA second frequently cited explanation for a cautious approach to capital investment is businesses projecting relatively weak demand going forward. Firms continue to be cautious about an assumption of organic growth. In a number of recent conversations, companies mentioned mergers and acquisitions as their preferred growth strategy because they are not counting on organic growth.\n\nA third and related explanation is the lack of direct pricing power and continuing pressure on margins and profits. In this vein, some firms have mentioned excess capacity as well as foreign-sourced product competition responding to global capacity and the stronger dollar.\n\nAccurately measuring capacity utilization in a large, diverse economy is a challenge. The most familiar monthly measure of capacity utilization—currently calculated to be around 75 percent—is pretty narrow in scope. It is derived from a survey of manufacturing, mining, and utilities firms—hardly a comprehensive perspective in a services-dominated economy. Nonetheless, the figures are interesting. Over the past 30 years, the highs for capacity utilization metrics were around 85 percent. These came in the mid-1990s, a period of strong investment growth. In the Great Recession, capacity utilization hit lows in the mid-60 percent area. As I said, today these measures of capacity utilization are around 75 percent, and industrial capacity is barely growing. I infer that businesspeople, in the industrial sector at least, have some justification for deferring capital spending on excess capacity grounds.\n\nBecause my staff and I consider some renewal of business fixed investment to be pivotal, my Atlanta Fed colleagues have taken every opportunity in recent months to ask about capital spending plans and attitudes. Current capital spending is depicted mostly as replacement, productivity-improvement-oriented, or cost-takeout focused. While most of our conversations evinced some longer-term optimism about potential for expansionary, capacity-building investment, we heard little that would suggest a near-term reversal of the weak trend.\n\nBaseline outlook\nI have two key assumptions in my outlook for the second half of 2016 and for 2017. One assumption is continuing healthy consumer activity. I'm not counting on consumption growth at the brisk pace of more than 4 percent (annual rate) in the second quarter. Consumption growth will probably settle back to something closer to the growth of incomes. Last Friday, we received a retail sales report for July. It suggested a slowdown of consumer spending compared to the second quarter. I'm interpreting that slowdown as expected moderation, not a cause for alarm.\n\nA second assumption is a modest acceleration in business investment. I acknowledge there is tension between an assumption of an upswing in business investment and what people in the business community are saying. For that reason, I'll be watching carefully for signs of a pickup in capital expenditures.\n\nI'm expecting decision makers' caution regarding capital expenditures to fade, to an extent, as sustained growth of consumer activity proves out over the coming quarters. My staff has performed statistical analysis that suggests that increases in consumer spending tend to lead acceleration of business investment.\n\nI would argue that most of the fundamentals underpinning growth of consumption are pretty solid. Household balance sheets have been repaired. Employment prospects appear reliable, and the number of employed workers is growing. Interest rates are low for many borrowers. Gasoline prices remain low. Personal incomes are rising, and, as I said earlier, wage growth is beginning to pick up. Consumer confidence remains high. At the same time, it appears that recent consumption was fueled, in part, by drawing down personal savings. It's unlikely this will last. In my opinion, consumption growth as strong as last quarter isn't required for continued expansion.\n\nIf you look beyond the troubling headline GDP growth number for the second quarter and study real final sales, a more consistent picture of economic momentum emerges. \"Real final sales\" is GDP less inventory swings. The trend of real final sales is a good gauge of ongoing demand conditions. Real final sales rose at an annualized rate of 2.4 percent in the second quarter, more than a percentage point higher than the headline GDP growth number. Over the last year, growth of real final sales is 1.9 percent. Recent experience is consistent with results over the full seven-year period of expansion. Final sales growth has been fairly steady since 2009.\n\nSo, I'm holding to an outlook of moderate growth through 2017. Furthermore, my baseline forecast calls for achievement of the Fed's core monetary policy objectives over the next year and a half.\n\nJob gains cited in the most recent employment report (for July) were impressive, and gains were broad-based across industries. Taken together with an unemployment rate of 4.9 percent and stronger wage growth, I think it is fair to say we are closing in on full employment.\n\nPrice stability is the companion objective of full employment in the Fed's dual mandate from Congress. Inflation has not yet accelerated to the Committee's target of a 2 percent run rate, but seems to be moving in a healthy direction. Recent price data hint at the firming of underlying price pressures. I'm reasonably comfortable with a forecast of reaching 2 percent by year-end 2017.\n\nCertainly, there are risks to this hopeful scenario. For example, the U.S. economy is not completely insulated from weakness elsewhere. Judging from recent actions of foreign central banks, major economies continue to combat very weak conditions that may worsen. That said, as I explained earlier, the risk that concerns me most is the risk that an upswing in business investment fails to materialize.\n\nSo, to sum up, I caution against overreacting to the second-quarter headline growth number. Early indications of third-quarter GDP growth suggest a rebound. I don't believe momentum has stalled. I remain confident about prospects in the second half of 2016 and 2017. I will be watching the incoming data closely for confirmation that the outlook I've presented here today remains valid. I'm not locked in to any policy position at this stage, but if my confidence in the economy proves to be justified, I think at least one increase of the policy rate could be appropriate later this year.",

            "content": "_______________________________________________________________\n\n\n\nI have visited this part of Idaho several times, but for purposes other than talking about the economy and monetary policy.\n\nThe Snake River runs through this area. I’ve floated all three gorgeous sections of the south fork of the Snake testing my fly-fishing skills against the wily trout that inhabit the river.\n\nI am no expert fly-fisher, but I've had good instructors and read a bunch of books on the sport. Before ever throwing a line, a fly-fisher has to read the water. Reading the water involves identifying areas where the fish are most likely to be holding on that particular day. Considerations include the speed and depth of the flowing water, soft spots in the flow made by rocks, trees, and eddies, and places where aquatic insects are emerging.\n\nFly-fishers are always looking for signs of rising fish. This tells you they are feeding on the surface of the water. A hatch of emerging insects is a feast for fish and usually makes for good fishing if you can \"match the hatch\" with your artificial fly.\n\nSometimes it happens that you have a fishing outing planned for a day just after a storm has passed through. Bad luck. Storms can make the water cloudy and force the fish down to lower depths. In such circumstances there’s little activity on the surface, and the fishing may not be so good. A dry fly-fisher just has to exercise a little patience until the waters clear. I've found, in any event, that a bad day on the river is better than a good day at the office.\n\nThis may be a tortured metaphor, I admit, for current conditions Fed policymakers are facing. Brexit amounts to a storm that has clouded the economic waters. For the very near term, I see little choice but to exercise some patience and let the picture clarify.\n\nI will expand on this theme in my remarks today. Here's what I plan to cover today: The bison in the room is obviously Brexit and what it means for the U.S. economy. Whether fully deserved or not, Brexit is being treated as a seminal event evoking a before-and-after comparison of perspectives on the economic outlook. So first, I’ll walk you through my outlook before the momentous referendum of June 23. I’ll follow that with my after perspective, that is, my outlook in light of the uncertainty brought on by Brexit. I’ll also add some comments on how I think about uncertainty as a factor influencing economic performance.\n\nAs always, these will be my personal views. I am not speaking for the Federal Reserve or the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC.\n\nOutlook before Brexit\n\nLet me take you back to the beginning of the year, just after the FOMC made the decision at its December meeting to raise the policy rate by 25 basis points. The so-called liftoff decision was anticipated through much of 2015, and when the decision was made at the meeting in mid-December, it was the first increase in the federal funds rate in almost a decade.\n\nAs 2016 began, I foresaw a year of steady, moderate, above-trend growth. I expected a pace of growth slightly above 2 percent. I expected this momentum to deliver continuing movement toward full employment. I also expected a firming of the inflation rate with clear evidence of movement in the direction of the Committee’s inflation target of 2 percent. Based on this outlook, I was among the FOMC participants who forecast four rate increases over the coming year. I have since cut back that projection.\n\nThe first quarter had a spell of financial market turbulence lasting the better part of six weeks. The volatility was apparently caused by a number of global economic concerns including the slowdown in China, the selloff of Chinese equities, declining oil and commodity prices, the resulting weakness of commodity-producing emerging markets, and the perceived tightening by the Fed. The market turbulence subsided in mid-February.\n\nFor a variety of reasons, first-quarter growth was weak. The first estimate was a mere 0.5 percent annual rate of growth. This was ultimately revised higher to a 1.1 percent rate of growth, still quite weak compared to my forecast assumption for the year overall.\n\nThe employment markets in the first quarter seemed strong compared to the growth indications. Labor market data—including monthly payroll jobs growth—continued to show the strong momentum measured in 2015.\n\nWhen official estimates of second-quarter growth are in hand, my staff and I believe we’ll see a much stronger number than the first quarter’s. Our expectation is based on the output of our tracking estimate, called GDPNow. This is a nowcast as opposed to a forecast. As data are released, our model estimates the current quarter (or the just-ended quarter) in real time. Our most recent estimate of annualized second-quarter growth is 2.3 percent. We expect the official reading to be in that vicinity.\n\nThe second-quarter bounceback reflected continuing strength in consumer spending. We believe growth of consumer spending, at an annual rate, exceeded 4 percent in the second quarter. That’s a very brisk pace of consumer activity. Typically, consumer spending is influenced by factors such as the outlook for steady employment, real income growth, and the health of household balance sheets. Consumer fundamentals have been solid for several months and remain so, in my opinion.\n\nWhile growth seems to have accelerated in the second quarter compared to the first, the incoming data overall have been mixed. The employment report for May was published the first Friday in June. As you may be aware, it was disappointing. The monthly net growth of payroll jobs, even adjusting for the Verizon strike, was weak, and monthly numbers were revised lower back through March. At the time of its release, this report seemed to indicate that employment momentum had been slowing starting in the first quarter and throughout the second quarter.\n\nBecause of the doubts raised by the May employment report and the timing of the Brexit vote a few days after the June FOMC meeting, I was comfortable with the Committee's decision to keep policy on hold.\n\nIn preparation for that meeting, I made modest downward revisions to my growth forecast, but I have not really changed in any significant way my basic outlook for this year and the medium term. I continue to expect growth at a pace of around 2 percent per annum. This rate of growth is adequate to continue to absorb any remaining labor resource slack. Although inflation, by key measures, is still below target, I continue to expect the inflation rate to move higher and be near the Committee’s target in 2017.\n\nCurrent economic performance\n\nThis, then, was my sense of the domestic economy in advance of the Brexit referendum. Most of the data we've received recently is consistent with this base-case outlook. However, recent data releases mostly cover periods before June 23. Still, I have no basis—statistical or anecdotal—for assuming any significant change in economic momentum since June 23.\n\nAs of today, in mid-July, domestic demand appears to be holding up well. As I said, consumer fundamentals remain sound. Growth of personal consumption is robust. Auto sales (that is, light vehicle sales) remain strong—above 16 million units annualized. However, we do hear reports that sales at recent levels may be difficult to sustain. Business investment remains subdued, and second-quarter residential investment has weakened compared to the first quarter. But exports have improved recently, pulling up the manufacturing sector. Oil prices have remained between $45 and $50 a barrel, reducing the drag from declining “mining” structures investment. While the picture presented by recent data is mixed, overall the economy is performing adequately to substantially accomplish our monetary policy objectives in 2017, in my opinion.\n\nThe healthy employment report we received on July 8 buttresses this view. Payroll jobs growth in June, even after netting out the return of striking Verizon workers, was strong and quite broad-based. Many of the negative signals in May’s data reversed course. Over the past several months, it does appear that the trend in employment growth has slowed somewhat from the pace seen last year. However, I think this slowing is consistent with an economy operating close to full employment.\n\nBrexit\n\nLet me now turn to the impact of Brexit. The referendum outcome surprised many observers, me included. It roiled financial markets in the days just after the vote, but very importantly, the functioning of financial markets has been generally quite orderly.\n\nAfter a bout of volatility, financial conditions have mostly returned to the status quo before June 23. The broad dollar foreign exchange index is roughly unchanged from a month ago. The VIX index of financial volatility rose but then settled back into a normal range.\n\nA notable exception is the 10-year Treasury note yield, which has touched historic lows. I attribute much of the recent decline to safe haven flows reflecting a risk-off posture immediately following the referendum.\n\nIt's too early to sound the \"all clear\" as regards financial market stability. Fed and other policymakers will need to stay on alert for signs of instability severe enough to pose a threat to the broad economy. So far, the financial market turbulence we’ve seen does not seem to have caused direct harm to the country’s economy. As many have stated, it is not a \"Lehman moment.\"\n\nIn my view, a more nettlesome question is what Brexit might mean for U.S. economic prospects over the medium and longer term. I'll offer some tentative views from two altitudes.\n\nFirst, Brexit has raised the general uncertainty quotient at work in the world. The range of plausible (or perhaps I should say, not totally implausible) adverse political and systemic scenarios is very broad at this moment. Economic consequences of the Brexit decision could play out over years.\n\nWhat would plausible adverse scenarios actually mean for the U.S. economy? At this point, I don’t think it's possible to make a prediction with much confidence. Only very tentative and very general assertions can be made, as I see things. Elevated and protracted uncertainty will not help growth prospects of an economy constrained by low business fixed investment. Weak productivity growth is at least partially explained by subdued capital investment. Uncertainty that reduces business fixed investment activity is not helpful.\n\nMore immediately, there is the question of direct impact of Brexit on our economy. Negative effects could materialize through the trade channel if there is a sustained realignment of the dollar-pound exchange rate. We might also see similar effects in our trade with Europe and the euro area.\n\nImmediately following the vote, there has been a lot of effort by a number of credible parties to estimate direct near-term impacts. Again, it's early, but I'm persuaded the direct impact over a short time horizon will not be all that great.\n\nSo, to summarize my view of Brexit effects: negligible near-term effect; a risk factor over the medium term; higher uncertainty that could amount to a persistent economic headwind.\n\nThinking about uncertainty\n\nI want to make a few comments about uncertainty as a factor influencing economic performance.\n\nThe minutes of the June FOMC meeting clearly pointed to uncertainty about employment momentum and the outcome of the vote in Britain as factors in the Committee’s decision to keep policy unchanged. I supported that decision and gave weight to those two uncertainties in my thinking.\n\nAt the same time, I viewed both the implications of the June jobs report and the outcome of the Brexit vote as uncertainties with some resolution over a short time horizon. We’ve seen, now, that the vote outcome may be followed by a long tail of uncertainty of quite a different character.\n\nSince the Brexit decision of the British people materialized, economic commentators have invoked heightened uncertainty as a reason to be apprehensive. To repeat, the consequences of Brexit may play out over a number of years, and the associated uncertainty could become an economic headwind.\n\nIf uncertainty is a real causative factor in economic slowdowns, it needs to be better understood. Policymaking would be aided by better measurement tools. For example, it would help me as a policymaker if we had a firmer grip on the various channels through which uncertainty affects decision-making of economic actors.\n\nI have been thinking about the different kinds of uncertainty we face. Often we policymakers grapple with uncertainty associated with discrete events. The passage of the event to a great extent resolves the uncertainty. The outcome of the Brexit referendum would be known by June 24. The interpretation of the May employment report would come clear, or clearer, with the arrival of the June employment report on July 8. I would contrast these examples of short-term, self-resolving uncertainty with long-term, persistent, chronic uncertainty such as that brought on by the Brexit referendum outcome.\n\nMeasuring uncertainty is quite difficult, as you would expect. We have some tools, but they are imperfect. There are uncertainty indexes. We also have survey data. At the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, in partnership with the University of Chicago and Stanford University, we conduct large-sample surveys of business leaders to gauge how they assess the risks they face and how these risks inform their decisions. In a post-Brexit survey a few days ago, roughly one-third of the businesses we surveyed indicated that the result of the referendum made their sales outlook more uncertain. They indicated they would be more cautious in hiring and capital spending decisions as a result of Brexit. We had a spirited internal discussion of whether one-third is a big number or not-so-big.\n\nTaking a long view, policymaking may have to adapt to an altered environment. To avoid letting uncertainty become a nebulous rationale for repeated inaction, refinements to how we measure uncertainty and how we gauge its effects are to be encouraged. Economists have useful work under way on the problem. I look forward to more and better tools.\n\nI’ll close with a reminder as much to myself as anyone. FOMC policy decisions are to be grounded in the Committee's statutory monetary policy objectives—maximum employment and price stability. In that regard, it's important to re-emphasize that policy is data-dependent—that the economic performance of Main Street America will be the arbiter of the appropriate stance of the Fed's monetary policy. For now, I don’t believe the FOMC is behind the curve in the setting of the policy rate. For that reason, I'm comfortable with a cautious and patient approach to policy in the near term.\n\nSometimes you just have to take some time and let the waters clear.",

            "content": "_______________________________________________________________\n\nThank you for that introduction.\n\nI once read a dictionary cover to cover. I was in a situation of mandatory attendance of classroom lectures on some dull subjects. So I brought a dictionary to class and worked my way through it. The instructors—when seeing me peering into my Webster's—thought I was looking up one of the words they'd just used. This was an acceptable lapse of attention, I guess.\n\nOne of my favorite sections of the dictionary is the A-M-B words—words like ambiguous, ambivalent, ambidextrous, and amblyopic. Amblyopic refers to dim vision without obvious visual impairment. An apt word, perhaps. I'm from the Federal Reserve and I'm going to talk tonight about the economy.\n\nA meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, concluded a week ago. The Committee decided not to increase interest rates.\n\nThe statement that followed the meeting said that economic activity appears to have slowed even while labor markets continue to improve. The Committee cited slowdowns in consumer spending, business fixed investment, and net exports. The housing sector was mentioned as a positive element along with consumer sentiment and growth of household real income. The statement noted that inflation continues to run below our 2 percent target for the longer run, and inflation expectations remain stable. Finally, the Committee repeated that it is closely monitoring global economic and financial developments.\n\nAt the time of the meeting, we did not have in hand the first estimate of first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) growth; that reading of the economy was received last Thursday morning.\n\nIn the days running up to the initial GDP growth reading, the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow tracking estimate predicted an annual rate of growth for the quarter in the neighborhood of half a percent. That turned out to be pretty close to the Bureau of Economic Analysis's first estimate of 0.5 percent. That's weak growth.\n\nThe economy is throwing off mixed signals. The data have an ambiguous quality. We have weak first-quarter growth and at the same time strong labor market data and indications that inflation is firming. Firming is desirable. We want to see the inflation rate move up toward, and ultimately to, 2 percent.\n\nThe FOMC's next meeting is in mid-June. For the next few weeks, you can expect to hear lots of discussion and speculation about whether the FOMC will make a second increase in its policy rate. I'm not going to take a position tonight on that question. The policy path will depend on how conditions evolve between now and mid-June.\n\nRather, I'd like to provide you some insight into how I—one policymaker—am organizing my thinking on the economy and policy considerations at this juncture.\n\nThere are always many considerations, but I am especially attuned to four—actually four-and-a-half—questions that I feel I must think about as the June meeting approaches.\n\nHere are the four-and-a-half questions in shorthand:\n\nI need to stress that my remarks this evening are my personal views. I am not speaking for any other Federal Reserve official or for members of the FOMC.\n\nGrowth\nAs already mentioned, first-quarter growth appears to have been weak. The disappointing first quarter follows a better, but less-than-stellar, fourth quarter.\n\nWhen, at the beginning of the year, my team at the Atlanta Fed set our expectations for the first quarter, we knew that some components of economic momentum that underperformed in the second half of last year would likely remain soft. For example, we expected net exports to lag due to the dollar's strength, and we expected business investment in structures to stay depressed due to the fall in oil prices. It's worth noting that both the dollar and oil prices have reversed somewhat their strong moves over the last two years.\n\nHousehold spending—also called personal consumption—was soft in the second half of 2015, but we were counting on a rebound of sorts in the new year. The underlying fundamentals then appeared and still appear solid. These consumer fundamentals include household balance sheets, house prices, income growth, and low interest rates to finance purchases of homes, cars, and other durable goods.\n\nTo sum up, we were expecting solid growth of domestic demand fueled by strengthening consumer spending. So far this year, we've been disappointed. Although not a bad thing in the end, the savings rate has edged higher. Consumers appear to have banked some of the gasoline dividend. The consumer seems to be behaving cautiously.\n\nWhat to make of these conditions? Is slow domestic demand likely to be persistent or transient? And are the readings even fully reliable?\n\nDoubts are legitimate. The first quarter has been anomalous in recent years. In 2010, 2014, and 2015, the first quarter was substantially weaker than the remaining three quarters of the year. From 2010 through 2015, the first quarter averaged less than a percent.\n\nWe could be picking up statistical noise in first-quarter numbers. Some economists believe \"residual seasonality\" could be distorting the numbers. Rough estimates by my staff put the impact of residual seasonality on first-quarter growth anywhere between 1/2 and 1 1/2 percentage points.\n\nAn alternative interpretation of the data sees first-quarter weakness as just a lull. In other words, normal quarter-to-quarter ups and downs are at work.\n\nIn spite of the first-quarter estimate, I haven't revised my view that the economy is growing at a moderate pace. For now, I'm sticking with my forecast that growth will be stronger over the rest of the year. The fundamentals look solid for consumer activity.\n\nHow close to objectives?\nAs you may be aware, the FOMC sets monetary policy to achieve two objectives—the so-called dual mandate established by Congress. The two objectives are full employment and low and stable prices.\n\nThe exact measure of full or maximum employment is debatable. And it's widely accepted that full employment varies from year to year and period to period. Using the conventional unemployment number calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, most of my Fed and FOMC colleagues estimate today's full employment at a bit below 5 percent unemployment. The current rate is fairly close to that.\n\nI believe we are closing in on our full employment objective, but there is some evidence that unused or underused labor resources remain.\n\nData on involuntary part-time workers, for example, are a bit elevated compared with pre-recession levels. Perhaps more striking is the recent reversal in labor force participation. More than 2 million workers have joined the labor force over the past six months. The number of people coming off the sidelines tells me there's a shadow labor force, and it's now feeding employment gains. Monthly payroll jobs growth has averaged 234,000 over the last year and 209,000 over the last three months.\n\nAs for the inflation objective, the Committee has set the target at 2 percent over the longer run. Inflation readings remain below our target. Some of those readings show a gap to target that is not trivial. That said, there are indications that broad-based inflation is firming. This gives me some confidence that the run rate of inflation will rise to 2 percent over the medium term.\n\nHere's a key point in assessing the current situation: the tone of reports on our two objectives—the encouraging employment and even inflation data—isn't easily reconciled with the current growth picture.  As a policymaker, I've got to form an opinion on which data element is the most reliable signal of economic reality. For the time being, I'm favoring the encouraging employment data over the growth data. Our soundings of business leaders across the Southeast (a process led by our Jacksonville regional executive, Chris Oakley) are more upbeat than the recent GDP number.\n\nRisks—domestic and global\nThere are always risks—both downside and upside—around a baseline outlook for the economy.\n\nIt's an old joke that economists are ambidextrous—\"on the one hand, on the other hand\"—and that only a one-armed economist will give you a straight opinion.\n\nAs suggested by my earlier commentary on growth, my biggest worry is that a lull turns out, in fact, to be persistent. The motor of the economy is household spending and business investment. We could be seeing a downshifting in consumer activity along with continuing and persistent wariness on the part of business as regards capital expenditures.\n\nFurthermore, in its last three statements following FOMC meetings, the Committee has made a point of acknowledging concern about global financial and economic developments. As you will recall, the year began with a period of heightened volatility in financial markets that seemed to be triggered by factors such as the slowing of the Chinese economy, a sell-off in the Shanghai equities market, stress on commodity-exporting emerging markets, and concerns about diverging monetary policies around the world.\n\nIn my view, the downside risks from abroad appear to have subsided since January and February. Things have calmed down somewhat.\n\nLast week's FOMC statement reiterated that the Committee continues to monitor global economic and financial developments. The global watch list includes a number of concerns. I will mention one concern that has some potential to loom large as we approach the June meeting. That is Brexit, as it is called—the referendum in the U.K. on whether to remain in the European Union. Brexit could be a source of heightened global uncertainty.\n\nI want to make another important point. As we monitor global factors, what concerns me is the potential effect on our domestic dual-mandate objectives (employment and inflation), not the drama of the developments per se.\n\nPotential\nNow I'd like to shift from relatively short-term economic considerations to a longer-term frame of reference. The last question—or question-and-a half—deals with what may be structural aspects of our country's economic performance. The first question is about the trend rate of potential economic growth—that is, how fast can our economy grow over time on average?\n\nThere is growing concern that this number is simply lower today than it was in the past. Lower potential would have implications for the path of monetary policy. To explain, if the potential rate of growth is lower, it is likely the neutral interest rate is also lower. The neutral rate is the rate at which policy must neither add stimulus nor remove stimulus to keep inflation low and employment at maximum. In this state of the world, interest rates would remain low for a long while. Put differently, even as the FOMC normalizes the settings of interest rates, rates would be low by historical standards.\n\nProductivity\nThere are a number of reasons potential growth could be lower than in the past. I won't go into all the possible causes, but one in particular has become a matter of considerable concern and puzzlement. That is the low rate of labor productivity growth in recent years. Productivity, or output per hour worked, has averaged a mere 1/2 percent per year over the past five years.\n\nTo put that number in perspective, over the 20 years leading up to the Great Recession, U.S. productivity growth averaged 2.2 percent per year. At that rate of productivity growth, the American standard of living was doubling roughly every 32 years. If the recent trend is the new normal, our standard of living would double in about 140 years.\n\nWe don't have compelling explanations for the cause of slower productivity growth, but we do have some clues. If we look at what is different these days as compared to the pre-recession period, a factor that gets one's attention is the decline of what's called \"capital deepening.\"\n\nPut simply, U.S. firms are deploying net new capital at an unusually slow pace.\n\nAn implication of the recent trend in productivity is that the U.S. economy is growing almost entirely by pulling more workers into jobs. That's a good thing when the U.S. labor force is underemployed.\n\nBut if, as I asserted earlier, the economy is nearing full employment, at some point we should begin to see mounting pressure in the labor market. One sign of mounting pressure would be accelerated wage growth.\n\nWe have not yet reached that point. Generally speaking, wage growth remains tepid. Broadly based wage growth would be the clearest indication that the ability of the economy to grow by adding workers is reaching its limit.\n\nClose\nI'll sum up. As the next policy decision point in June approaches, I will be probing three immediate questions while considering one and a half other questions. Are data relative to growth improving, rebounding? How close are we to full employment and 2 percent inflation? What is the risk context? I will weigh answers to these questions keeping in mind the longer-run concerns of slow labor productivity growth and its contribution to what may be lower potential growth. At the moment, the data, overall, are ambiguous. As a policymaker considering whether to hike interest rates, I'm ambivalent at this point. But I continue to be ambitious for the performance of the U.S. economy for the remainder of the year.",

            "content": "_______________________________________________________________\n\nIt's good to be back at the Buckhead Rotary. I see a number of friends in the audience. That's always a good thing when one's task is to explain the Fed's monetary policy decisions, particularly just a couple of days after a policy meeting while debate still rages about whether or not we did the right thing.\n\nI'm sure almost everyone in the room is aware of what I'm talking about. The Federal Reserve's vehicle for making monetary policy—the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC or the Committee)—met last Wednesday and Thursday. The Committee decided to keep the policy rate—the federal funds rate—where it has been for almost seven years. That is, at just above zero, effectively as low as possible. The Committee held off a decision to lift off.\n\nSaid differently, the Committee held off on a decision to begin a process of normalization of the policy rate. Changes in the Fed's policy rate affect many other short-term interest rates and, in turn, longer maturity rates in the economy.\n\nThe Committee issued a statement just after the meeting ended Thursday. The statement described a domestic economy that is expanding at a moderate pace and making steady progress by most measures. The statement mentioned that underutilization of labor resources is declining. At the same time, the statement noted that inflation continues to run below our longer-run objective of 2 percent. Importantly, the statement acknowledged recent economic developments abroad and recent volatility in financial markets. It pointed out the possibility—but not certainty—that these developments could spill over to have some effect on the trajectory of our domestic economy, including realized inflation.\n\nAlong with this statement, the Committee also issued its quarterly Summary of Economic Projections. Each FOMC participant submits a forecast of key variables—growth, unemployment, inflation, the fed funds rate—four times a year. As a group, the five Fed governors and 12 Reserve Bank presidents who make up the FOMC continue to project growth in the range of 2 to 2 1/2 percent annualized over the next two to three years. This is very similar to the pace of growth seen on average over the now six years of economic recovery. The group sees inflation moving in the direction of 2 percent in 2016, arriving reasonably close to target by the end of 2017. The group expects some continuing decline in unemployment. But it's fair to say the current rate of 5.1 percent is close to what many participants would consider full employment, at least by the headline unemployment measure.\n\nLast week's meeting was clearly an important one, even if the much-discussed liftoff decision did not arrive. Today I want to walk you through my take on the various considerations that influenced the decision to hold off raising rates. In so doing, I'll share my sense of the current condition of the economy and what to expect going forward. I said \"my take\" because, as is always the case, you will hear my personal views. I am not speaking for my colleagues in the Federal Reserve or on the FOMC.\n\nGlobal economic and financial developments\nLet me start by talking about recent global economic and financial developments, acknowledged in the FOMC's statement as \"on our screen\" as we approached decision time.\n\nStarting in mid-August, financial markets here and abroad experienced markedly higher volatility. There are a lot of indicators of volatility. A useful one is the VIX, an index that measures implied volatility of traded option contracts on S&P 500 stocks. The VIX measures the U.S. market's expectation of volatility over the next month. It is sometimes called the fear index.\n\nFears of financial market participants apparently rose in mid-August. Although volatility is lower today, as of Friday it had not completely subsided. In my estimation, the spike in volatility was in reaction to the confluence of several factors. I will just list them in no particular order. Contributing factors were the drop in Chinese equity share prices and the devaluation of the Chinese currency. We also heard concerns about the apparent slowing of China's economy. And there was the weakness of emerging markets' economic conditions resulting from declining commodity prices and the knock-on effects of a slowing China. Also on the list was the appreciation of the U.S. dollar and its assumed downward pressure on U.S. exports as well as inflation. Additional factors were the renewed decline of oil prices and uncertainty about the Fed's near-term policy intentions.\n\nAs I said, about a month ago, uncertainties loomed larger, market volatility rose, and, from a policymaker's perspective, risks to the domestic economy ratcheted up a little. It's too early to know whether this episode amounts to a bona fide shock to the economy or just a nervous spasm in the markets.\n\nTaking the China considerations in isolation, I don't anticipate large first-order impacts on U.S. growth. First among first-order impacts would be effects on exports. I don't think weaker demand from China will greatly reduce our export performance. It's possible there will be indirect impacts, perhaps by way of demand for our exports from emerging markets or Europe.\n\nIt's widely expected that lower-cost imports from China and elsewhere will soften inflation. Because of ordering cycles and lags in import cost adjustments, the disinflationary effect of cheaper goods from China is hard to know in a specific time frame.\n\nAt this point, my summary assessment is that the sources of uncertainty that fueled financial market volatility represent a modest risk to our economy, but a risk factor nonetheless.\n\nI want to stress a basic point. Financial market swings per se are not my central concern. The broad Main Street economy is my essential concern. Market volatility can be a symptom of more fundamental ills. And market volatility, if protracted, can be a channel for damping forces on economic activity. It's too early to detect any significant impact on the real economy, to know whether any or all ofthe factors I cited will evolve into a significant headwind. For that reason, I thought it prudent to wait to evaluate whether recent developments change the outlook. I supported the Committee's decision last week to hold off, and the altered risk picture relative to the economic outlook was decisive in my thinking.\n\nCurrent state of the economy\nSince, as I stressed, the impact of unexpected developments on the course of the Main Street economy is my central focus as a policymaker, let me now comment on the state of the economy. The data indicate the economy is expanding at a moderate pace. The economy is performing solidly. This view is supported by feedback from our contacts across the Southeast.\n\nThe weak first quarter was followed by a quite strong second quarter. Our tracking of real-time incoming data in the current quarter suggests a slower third quarter. One cause is slower inventory stocking. Looking at final sales—a measure that removes the influence of inventory swings—the underlying demand picture looks much firmer. This picture of solid continuing overall demand growth is underpinned by consumption growth, strengthening business investment, and steady growth of residential investment.\n\nI've been describing GDP (gross domestic product) growth trends at a national economy level. Let me come closer to home with a few comments on the economy here in Atlanta.\n\nThe economy in our metro area has been tracking progress in the national economy with a slight lag. We see this in the data. Employment is growing. Trends in sectors important to the region are positive—for example, transportation and logistics, tourism and lodging, residential construction, commercial real estate, and business services. The business services sector is a mainstay of the Buckhead community. Atlanta is a recognized center of sophisticated business services with global reach. I consider Atlanta's economy to be better balanced, with a more diversified employment base, than before the recession. I'm bullish on Atlanta's economic prospects. Atlanta should grow along with the national economy.\n\nThe FOMC's decision criteria\nI have a little more to say about the national economy. So, back to 40,000 feet.\n\nAs many of you are aware, the FOMC has a dual mandate and is required by statute to pursue two objectives in making monetary policy. They are maximum employment and price stability.\n\nAs a decision to lift off—to begin normalizing interest rates—became a more immediate consideration, the Committee set out two principal decision criteria. They were \"further improvement in labor markets\" and achievement of \"reasonable confidence\" that inflation will rise to the targeted rate of 2 percent in the medium term. Obviously, both of these requirements derive directly from the FOMC's dual mandate objectives.\n\nLet me provide my assessment of conditions associated with these two decision criteria.\n\nFirst, employment: Over the past year, the economy has been adding jobs at a pace averaging 243,000 per month. This is a strong pace of job growth. In August, the unemployment rate ticked down 0.2 percentage points to 5.1 percent. This rate of unemployment is now quite close to the level many economists believe to be full employment. That includes Fed economists and my colleagues on the FOMC.\n\nAn important question for policymaking is how much slack remains in labor markets. I have long held that the most familiar measure of unemployment—what the Bureau of Labor Statistics calls U-3—is not a sufficient indicator of the degree of labor resource underutilization in our economy. Broader measures present a more complete picture. That picture incorporates measures of involuntary part-time workers and people who are only marginally attached to the formal labor force. This latter group is made up of people who are not actively looking for work but are available and might go back to work if economic conditions were creating more demand for their labor.\n\nWhile the growth in jobs and the decline in joblessness have been impressive, I'm not yet convinced we're at full employment. I think some slack remains. At the same time, I continue to maintain that achieving full employment is not a prerequisite for a liftoff decision. By most measures, we have seen substantial improvement in employment conditions, and we can expect that improvement to continue.\n\nOne way to size up the degree of remaining labor slack is to look at wage growth. Wage growth across the country remains subdued. Admittedly, wage growth is a lagging indicator and may be slow to reflect labor market tightness. Nevertheless, the lack of significant wage growth can be taken as a cautionary sign.\n\nThat said, I think it's worth taking a minute or two to compare what the data are telling us about wage pressures with what my staff and I hear from contacts among major employers in the Southeast. We hear of growing wage pressures for selected job categories. We get the clear impression that hiring challenges are intensifying. Very recently, our sense of rising wage pressures has become more generalized.\n\nThere are a number of ways employers might experience tightening labor markets before they resort to wholesale wage increases. (Perhaps here you can nod if you're experiencing some of my examples.) They might experience accelerating attrition broadly or in the category of higher-paying jobs. They might have more offers turned down because of pay. They might have to match outside offers to retain some of their current employees. And they might have to increase hours of part-time workers, triggering benefits, or increase hours of full-time employees, triggering overtime. If we put our minds to work, we could come up with a litany of things that could be classified as wage pressures. These are just a few examples of evidence that employment conditions may be tightening and wage pressures may be about to accelerate.\n\nAs one participant in the Committee's process, I am satisfied I can check off the requirement of \"further improvement in labor markets\" as having been adequately met. I am not so comfortable about inflation.\n\nIn January 2012, the FOMC set an explicit inflation target of 2 percent per annum over the longer run. Before 2012, individual Fed officials often referred to a target of 2 percent in their speeches and put it in their longer-run projections.\n\nOver much of the past six years and more of economic expansion, our policies have failed to deliver on the inflation goal of 2 percent annualized. Using our preferred inflation index, the rate of inflation has hewed closer to 1 1/2 percent, and, over the past 12 months, inflation has been essentially zero.\n\nA material share of the recent shortfall has been tied to falling oil prices. If we remove energy prices, inflation has been around 1 1/4 percent over the past year—still well short of goal.\n\nI think the recent numbers largely reflect transitory factors—oil, the rising dollar, falling commodity prices. These factors produce relative price changes, and relative price changes occur all the time. Relative price changes are not necessarily symptomatic of broad, fundamental inflation forces, but they do affect the numbers. Gauging the underlying reality of trend inflation has been and continues to be challenging. The inflation picture is likely to remain murky into next year.\n\nI think the case for checking off the criterion of \"reasonable confidence\" that inflation will converge to the 2 percent target is harder to make than employment. Even so, I have gotten comfortable enough on the inflation question to take a first step in one of the coming FOMC meetings in what will likely be an extended process of normalization of the interest-rate environment. My comfort is based on the belief that there are two forces at work that will shape the inflation outcome in the medium term.\n\nThe first is inflation expectations. I believe inflation expectations of U.S. households and businesses remain anchored around 2 percent. I base this on survey data of consumers and business leaders. This evidence conflicts with recent financial market-based trends in inflation compensation. In the current volatile circumstances in financial markets, these data are hard to interpret. I am willing to look past these measures for now.\n\nThe second force is the continuing expansion of the broad economy. I assume that continued absorption of resources associated with ongoing expansion will result in tighter labor and product markets. I expect such fundamentals will play through to the inflation numbers once transitory influences have subsided.\n\nThe way forward\nIn my vote at the recent FOMC meeting, I put most of the decision weight on prudent risk management around recent and current market volatility. As things settle down, I will be ready for the first policy move on the path to a more normal interest-rate environment. I am confident the much-used phrase \"later this year\" is still operative.",

            "content": "I want to thank the organizers of the Public Pension Funding Forum for inviting me to address this conference.\n\nI am not going to assume you are all fully up to speed on the structure of the Federal Reserve System, the role of the Reserve Banks, and the role of a Reserve Bank president.\n\nI am one of 12 Reserve Bank presidents. The Reserve Banks have multiple functions. We implement bank regulatory policy. We process incoming cash currency from banks and distribute currency to banks. We operate in the payments system as a provider of check clearing and settlement services as well as electronic funds transfer services. We conduct outreach programs with communities in our districts to enhance financial and economic literacy, to research issues affecting low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, and to gather anecdotal economic information to better understand ground-level economic reality.\n\nEach Reserve Bank has its own economic research department. Our economists conduct research and support the monetary policy role of their bank presidents. All of the presidents participate with the Federal Reserve Board governors in Washington in meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC). The FOMC sets monetary policy, which is substantially about interest-rate policy. Policy decisions of the FOMC influence the bond market yield curve. Monetary policy also influences the macroeconomy across multiple dimensions such as aggregate demand, growth, employment, and inflation.\n\nIn my remarks today, I will explore two points of intersection between your world and mine. The first is financial stability and systemic risk. To pose a question, to what extent should pension funding levels, particularly public pension funding, be considered a risk to financial stability—a potential systemic risk?\n\nThe second point of intersection is macroeconomic performance. What is the interplay between the condition of public pension funds and macroeconomic outcomes?\n\nMy overall objective today is a rather modest one. I'll just give you a sense of how I'm thinking about the questions I've just laid out.\n\nBefore I get into it, let me initiate you to the ritual of \"the Fed disclaimer.\" You will hear my personal views only. I am not speaking for the Federal Reserve or the FOMC. My colleagues may not agree with my views. This disclaimer is so regularly invoked in internal conferences that authors of papers and presentation slides don't even spell it out any more. We just put \"Fed disclaimer\" at the bottom of their title page or slide, and everyone knows what it conveys.\n\nFinancial stability and systemic risk\nFollowing the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, Federal Reserve System leaders were keenly aware that there were gaps in our institutional understanding of financial markets. We acknowledged some \"known unknowns.\"\n\nThere were four key areas in which we felt we were deficient. They were (1) money market mutual funds, (2) private equity and venture capital, (3) hedge funds, and (4) state and local government public finance.\n\nIn response to the near-death experience of the financial system, the Federal Reserve mobilized research and monitoring efforts to improve our knowledge of these potential sources of risk to the financial system and the economy. Teams were organized around each of these four areas. My Reserve Bank—the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta—joined with the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland to form a team for the last area I mentioned, state and local government public finance. The team's primary focus was on the municipal bond market and public pension funds.\n\nLet me insert here a comment on the notion of systemic risk. There's no official definition, but systemic risk is associated with financial instability, financial panic, runs on institutions, and contagion facilitated by interconnectedness in the financial world. Episodes of system-wide financial instability may impose severe costs on the broad economy and society.\n\nThe team's charge was to look at these two aspects of public finance—the municipal bond market and public pension funds—with respect to their relationship to the broader financial system. We already had many Fed economists studying the role of state and local government as a gross domestic product (GDP) component—that is, the impact of state and local government spending and employment on economic performance and growth.\n\nIn thinking about risks to financial stability, our economists applied a model with four sequential elements: shock, transmission, amplification, and feedback. Using this framework, they overlaid analysis and scenario evaluation on projections of real economy conditions with the aim of addressing questions such as:\n\nI'll give you, in my own words, my sense of the conclusions that can be drawn from the work done by our team. Public pensions are not likely to be a source of a systemic shock. The current state of underfunding of some public pensions is a serious problem, but the problem is long term in nature. By long term I mean two things. I mean over the long term—that is, a situation regarding public pension plans is likely to build gradually and not be prone to random surprises along the way. We will be able to watch the problem develop. It's unlikely a shock will come out of the blue.\n\nLong term also means in the long term. By this I mean that a coming to a head, a climactic moment, if one comes, is likely to be well into the future.\n\nIn this conclusion, I'm focusing on public pension funds in isolation. As we've seen recently, there could very well be a financial crisis-like moment at the level of the sponsoring government entity. If a pension system's funding declines enough, there is a risk that a state government could at some point find itself in such financial distress that it would be forced to choose between paying bondholders and paying pension beneficiaries.\n\nIt's my view that such an occurrence is low probability as a single event, and the probability is even lower that a bunching of such occurrences would amount to a significant shock triggering contagion in the financial system.\n\nGoing a little further with this thought process, if a large state were to default on its debt, an episode of financial instability, possibly fueled by contagion, would be more likely to follow from headline effects than through the direct exposure of financial institutions. The majority of municipal debt is held directly or indirectly by households, particularly high-net-worth households. The amplifiers of leverage and complex counterparty relationships that fueled the financial crisis of 2008 are largely not in play in the municipal sector.\n\nRecent headlines about episodes of financial distress in Detroit and Puerto Rico, for example, have not set off contagion affecting the entire municipal asset class. There was a market reaction, but repricing was consistent with credit fundamentals.\n\nMy conversations with members of the team working on municipal markets and public pensions leave me pretty sanguine about chances of a system-shaking event. That said, they were tasked with thinking about extreme scenarios. This was prudent, in my opinion, because we learned from the events of 2008 and 2009 that tail risks do sometimes materialize. I think the right posture, therefore, is one of watchful vigilance. Investors fleeing from the entire municipal bond asset class would raise the cost of debt for all state and local issuers. If prolonged, this could constitute a meaningful headwind for the broad economy.\n\nPublic pensions and macroeconomic outcomes\nPicking up from that last scenario, I'll shift now to reflections on the interplay of public pensions and the broad economy. I'll organize my comments around two directions of potential impact. I'll comment first on pensions impacting the economy and then conclude with thoughts on the economy impacting pensions.\n\nThe first question I want to explore is how pension funding problems might contribute to fiscal challenges that in turn spill over to the general economy. I will address this through the lens of the challenges created by significant cutbacks in state and local government spending.\n\nIn the wake of the Great Recession, one persistent issue—call it a headwind—was that even as private-sector employment and investment started to recover, cuts in state and local government spending, investment, and employment continued.\n\nIn particular, I note the large real declines in K–12 education (particularly school construction), highway and bridge repair, and state social programs. It is notable that while spending of this sort was falling, contributions to public pensions grew quite a lot. While the primary cause for this retrenchment in state and local spending was the decline in tax revenues, it is worth asking whether growing recognition of the extent of underfunding of public pension funds aggravated the belt-tightening experienced at the state and local government level.\n\nThis is not to suggest that states shouldn't have placed and shouldn't be placing a priority on funding their pension liabilities. Nor is it to make a judgment about the desirability of lower government spending.\n\nMy point is that ongoing public-sector spending cuts can represent a headwind to overall demand and complicate efforts aimed at supporting growth to meet the Fed's employment mandate. To the extent that funding issues with public pensions amplify fiscal stress, the longer-run problem of public funding may translate into growth challenges as the economy seeks to heal from periods of economic weakness.\n\nEconomic growth and pension funding/investments\nI'll conclude by turning the lens in the other direction. I'll comment on how the macroeconomic growth environment can interact with pension funding.\n\nI would think the macroeconomic outlook is of great interest to you as you set your investment objectives for the coming years, review your allocation, and decide how much risk you must accept.\n\nLet me frame the topic in this way: it's about the alignment of assumptions about overall investment portfolio returns with realistic assumptions about macroeconomic momentum and trends. Not all investments in portfolios of public pension funds are correlated with broad economic outcomes, but I suspect many are. Forecast assumptions regarding GDP growth underpin, to an extent, forecasts of fixed-income portfolio returns and total returns of other asset classes.\n\nMy outlook for GDP growth (for the medium term, at least) cannot help but be influenced by recent economic history. Since the recession ended in the summer of 2009, the domestic economy has grown at an average annual rate of 2.1 percent. Compared to other post-World War II recoveries, this is slow growth.\n\nOver this period, the economy has faced a number of headwinds and shocks. We've pushed through several domestic fiscal showdowns—including one federal government shutdown—a tsunami, two major winter weather events, geopolitical tensions, and wide swings of global energy prices. These developments slowed activity, shook confidence, and bred cautious economic behavior on the part of American consumers and businesses. These spells of cautious behavior have contributed to a slow pace of recovery. More recently, the Greek fiscal crisis was unsettling with its potential for a major financial event or worse. Currently, developments such as the appreciation of the dollar, the devaluation of the Chinese currency, and the further decline of oil prices are complicating factors in predicting the pace of growth.\n\nOur baseline forecast at the Atlanta Fed is for moderate growth with continuing employment gains and a gradually rising rate of inflation.\n\nThe fundamentals underlying this outlook relate to consumer spending, business investment, and the related issues of wage and income growth. I'll comment on the current state of each of these.\n\nOver the past year, consumer spending has strengthened to a pace consistent with the solid, but unspectacular, pace of growth I just predicted. This spending has been supported by reasonably good aggregate income growth, but it is important to note that aggregate income expansion has come more from employment gains in the workforce than from gains in wage rates paid to workers. Average wage growth has persisted at levels well below the prerecession pace, very likely in part due to subpar labor productivity growth over most of the recovery.\n\nWeakness in the pace of labor productivity gains has been associated with a relatively tepid pace of business investment. For example, during the past year, business spending on equipment has merely matched the lackluster growth of the overall economy.\n\nI am looking for some improvement in business investment spending other than energy-sector spending on wells and production infrastructure. The lower oil price has caused major cutbacks in that category of investment.\n\nThe fundamental factors underlying GDP growth are linked. Business investment supports productivity growth. Growth of productivity fuels wage growth. Wage growth fosters the acceleration of consumer activity. I'm expecting continuing improvement in all these elements of the growth outlook, but I'm not predicting sharp acceleration in the foreseeable future.\n\nConsistent with this picture, I expect the normalization of monetary policy—that is, interest rates—to begin sometime this year. I expect normalization to proceed gradually, the implication being an environment of rather low rates for quite some time.\n\nLet me wrap up. I've had the following basic messages for you today. I don't see the underfunding of public pension funds as a systemic risk. Nor do I see state and local government fiscal stresses, to which pension underfunding can contribute, plausibly posing systemic-event risk individually or collectively. However, state and local government spending cuts can become a headwind in a downturn and subsequent recovery. Pension funding gaps can exacerbate this tendency. Failure to shore up the funding of public pensions when times are relatively good can compound stresses on state and local budgets when economic conditions become more challenging. For the sake of the overall economy, the time to address funding gaps is before the next downturn arrives. Finally, in setting your expectations for returns, you may wish to consider the outlook for growth over the medium term. My own outlook foresees moderate growth, but not a breakout to strongly accelerating growth.",

            "content": "I very much appreciate the chance to address the Atlanta Press Club. As members of the fourth estate (and their guests), you certainly understand the qualities of a good story.\n\nThe daily news story, I'm told, mostly follows the format of who-what-where-when-why. Longer stories—both nonfiction and fiction—make the greatest impression when there is a hero or heroine, when there's a conflict that builds dramatically and with suspense to a climax, and when the point of highest drama is followed by resolution. The French have a great word for that part of the story—dénouement.\n\nToday I want to begin my remarks by telling the story of the U.S. economy over recent years. We might think of the economy itself as the hero. The recovery from deep recession is the struggle. The impending decision to begin raising interest rates is the climax. And the normalization of monetary policy, along with the further normalization of our economy, is the dénouement.\n\nIf that seems a tad contrived for this venue and this audience, please indulge me.\n\nTo put all this in a more conventional framework—one you might expect from a central banker—the story I'll tell is one of how far we've come, economically speaking. Specifically, I'll discuss how far we've come in terms of employment and labor market health. I'll tell the curious story of inflation, a story of less progress. And I'll present my personal forecast of how the story will play out for a couple of years after the point of liftoff, as it's called.\n\nAs always, you will be hearing my personal views. I don't speak for the Federal Reserve or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC, or the Committee). This must be emphasized given the current context of intense interest in what, when, and why the FOMC will decide to do something or not. I'm speaking only for myself.\n\nHow far we've come\nThe story could begin in the summer of 2009, when the economy emerged from the Great Recession and the long recovery began. However, I prefer to begin the story in December 2008, when the FOMC completed a rapid, year-long downward march of its policy rate, the federal funds rate.\n\nThe federal funds rate—the overnight rate for bank-to-bank lending—is the Fed's chief policy rate. Where this rate is set affects other borrowing rates broadly across the economy.\n\nThe downward march of the policy rate began in September 2007, when the Committee dropped the federal funds rate from 5 1/4 percent to 4 3/4 percent.\n\nAs the crisis unfolded, the FOMC pushed the rate lower, and it reached zero, effectively, in December 2008. It has been there ever since.\n\nThe economic conditions that evoked that policy response in 2008 were extraordinary, to say the least. Let me describe the situation of the national economy at that time.\n\nWhen the Fed's policy rate hit zero in December 2008, the official rate of unemployment had already climbed from a low of 4.4 percent to 7.3 percent and was rising fast. It would peak at 10 percent in less than a year. Between December 2007 and February 2010, U.S. payrolls fell by more than 8.7 million workers.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2008, real gross domestic product contracted at an annualized rate of 8.2 percent. The economy's performance in that quarter was its worst in 50 years. In December 2008, the economy had already been in recession for a year. The recession wouldn't officially end until the following June. When it finally did end, the cumulative loss in national output amounted to the greatest contraction in economic activity in the post–World War II era. The recession was extraordinarily deep, and it was broad.\n\nBy early 2009, a substantial majority of U.S. industries had either stopped hiring or were cutting their workforce. Construction activity and employment entered their deepest and most protracted decline since World War II. Industrial production was hard hit, too. In January 2009, for instance, four of five manufacturers and other industrial producers were generating output below levels six months earlier. Retail spending was off more than 10 percent from year-earlier levels. And measures of consumer confidence had fallen to near historic lows. Virtually every region of the nation and every economic sector were under substantial stress.\n\nLet me contrast this picture of the state of our economy at the end of 2008 and early 2009 with the picture we see today.\n\nSince bottoming out in the second quarter of 2009, real economic output is up about 13 percent. Said differently, the economy is 8 1/2 percent larger than its prerecession peak. To give a sense of the scale of improvement, the U.S. economy has added activity about equal to the economy of Mexico.\n\nAlthough the pace of improvement in output has been slower than hoped for, by most measures, real gross domestic product is approaching its full current potential.\n\nFrom its peak of 10 percent, the rate of unemployment has fallen to 5.3 percent. We received a new employment situation report on Friday. The official unemployment rate remains at 5.3 percent. This level of unemployment is just a shade above what some economists think is consistent with full employment. A broader measure of unemployment and underemployment—one that includes marginally attached workers and those working part-time involuntarily—continued to fall in July, to 10.4 percent. From the employment trough, the economy has added more than 12 million jobs.\n\nConsumer spending is almost 14 percent above its recessionary bottom, and consumer confidence has recently climbed back to near, and by some measures above, pre-crisis levels.\n\nTo sum up, the economy has come a long way in the more-than-six-and-a-half years since the federal funds rate hit bottom. The subtext is that the recovery has been slow. It's taken more than six years of recovery to accomplish what I just described. Clearly, this is a rather long story. The recovery has proceeded at an average annual pace of expansion of only 2.1 percent.\n\nOver this period, the economy has faced a number of headwinds and shocks. We've pushed through several domestic fiscal showdowns, including one federal government shutdown, two major winter weather events, geopolitical tensions, and wide swings of global energy prices. Most recently, the Greek and European Union stare-down was unsettling with its potential for a major financial event or worse. These developments slowed activity, shook confidence, and bred cautious economic behavior on the part of American consumers and businesses. These spells of cautious behavior have contributed to a slow pace of recovery.\n\nThe curious tale of inflation\nThe expansion over these six years has been sustained by extraordinary policy medicine involving not only ultra-low interest rates but also three episodes of quantitative easing, or QE. The Fed undertook these large-scale asset purchase programs to exert even more downward pressure on interest rates. QE3 ended last December in recognition of substantial improvement in the state of the economy.\n\nOne constant over this period has been the FOMC's focused attention on achievement of our Congress-mandated policy objectives. \"True north\" in the Committee's setting of monetary policy is maximum employment and low and stable inflation.\n\nIn January 2012, the FOMC took the step of defining a formal target rate of inflation. The Committee set the inflation target at an annual rate of 2 percent to be achieved over the longer run. The Committee believes this rate of inflation is most compatible with healthy growth, healthy conditions in the economy, and an adequate cushion against disinflation and eventual deflation.\n\nThere are many inflation statistics. The Committee chose to apply the headline, or total, rate of inflation according to the index of personal consumption expenditures, an index calculated by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.\n\nThe curious thing is that over six years of expansion, inflation has chronically remained well below this target. The average rate of inflation over the six-plus years of recovery has been 1 1/2 percent. Some of this weak price pressure can be explained by temporary influences such as falling oil prices and the appreciating dollar's effect on import prices. Oil prices, for instance, have fallen by about 50 percent since last summer and have fallen another 12 percent in the past month alone.\n\nThose downward pressures on the rate of inflation are not yet entirely behind us. Because of such factors, it has been difficult to discern the true underlying rate of inflation and its trend. This analytical challenge continues, and I expect it to persist for a while. But even if we heavily discount the influence of transitory forces on the headline inflation trend, inflation has remained low relative to our objective.\n\nThe plot progresses\nA few months ago, anticipating an eventual change of policy, the Committee set out two qualitative criteria for an initial interest-rate increase. We said we want to see \"further improvement in labor market conditions,\" and we want to be \"reasonably confident\" that the inflation rate will rise over the medium term to 2 percent.\n\nThe Committee has also repeatedly emphasized that the decision will be data-dependent. This means there is no foreordained date, and the incoming numbers will dictate the timing of the decision. When the Committee is comfortable that these two tests have been met, the policy move will come.\n\nMy colleagues and I always intensely monitor economic data, and that has especially been the case over recent months. Progress since the first of the year has been quite encouraging. As regards labor market conditions, almost one-and-a-half million more jobs have been added to U.S. payrolls since last December. And the national unemployment rate has fallen by half a percentage point in the past eight months. After a weak first quarter of 2015, during which the economy barely grew, the economy bounced back to some extent in the second quarter to record a solid rate of growth in excess of 2 percent.\n\nKey to my own thinking on impending policy decisions is the outlook from here. I expect somewhat stronger growth in the second half of the year. I expect the employment markets to continue to tighten. I expect continuing labor market progress to begin to put upward pressure on wages across the economy. And I expect convincing evidence to emerge that inflation is rising to a safer level and approaching our 2 percent target.\n\nThe story's climax\nThe economy has made great gains and is approaching an acceptable normal. Policy should shortly acknowledge this reality. The Fed took extraordinary policy measures in response to extraordinary economic conditions. Conditions are no longer extraordinary.\n\nCompared to earlier in the year, we know a lot more and can shelve some concerns. We appear to be past the most acute concerns of a spillover from Europe. I have more confidence in the resilience of the economy today compared to even a few months ago. I am much less concerned about a reversal of economic fortune. We are getting closer and closer to what feels like a healed state of the economy.\n\nFor me, the cumulative evidence of the economy's healing, and the likelihood the economy is on a path to achieving the Fed's mandated objectives, makes me comfortable that the economy can handle a gradually rising interest-rate environment.\n\nFed Chair Janet Yellen has stated she expects conditions to jell, justifying a start to policy normalization sometime later this year. I agree. I think the point of liftoff is close.\n\nAs the Committee approaches what I consider a historic decision, I am not expecting the data signals to point uniformly in the same direction. I don't need this. I'm prepared to see mixed data. Data are inherently noisy month to month and quarter to quarter. Given the progress made over the recovery and the overall recent tone of the economy, I for one do not intend to let the gyrating needle of monthly data be the decisive factor in decision making.\n\nThe dénouement\nThis is not to say that the process of policy normalization should be implemented with urgency, requiring a rapid pace of rate increases. Indeed, there are reasons to approach normalization with patience and at a deliberate pace. While the economy is a considerable distance from where it was when our zero-interest-rate policy was put in place, we have somewhat further to go.\n\nThe Committee has provided guidance that the path of interest-rate increases will likely be gradual. I expect such a stance of policy to be appropriate for some time after liftoff. This is perhaps the most important message to reinforce today.\n\nA private-sector economist whose commentary I follow has typecast monetary policy options as aggressively stimulative, stimulative, neutral, restrictive, and aggressively restrictive. I think this is a useful framework. In those terms, policy will likely transition from aggressively stimulative toward merely stimulative.\n\nLet me recap my main points. Much progress has been achieved since December 2008, when the Fed's policy rate reached zero, and mid-2009, when the recession ended. That progress has been accomplished with the support of extraordinary monetary policy. Current and prospective economic conditions increasingly do not demand the most aggressive stance of policy. I think the time to begin normalizing monetary conditions is close. Once underway, the process of raising interest rates to more normal, sustainable levels will likely be gradual. It has been a long story, sometimes frustratingly so, but one I am increasingly confident will have a happy ending.",

            "content": "I'm very pleased to be back in Baton Rouge.\n\nI'll start by setting the scene. The policy of a near-zero federal funds rate has been in place for more than six years. As you know, the federal funds rate is the Fed's official policy rate—the rate from which other interest rates are determined by market forces.\n\nThere is much anticipation of a decision by the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC) to move off zero sometime this year. And the Federal Reserve has been busy with technical preparation for what's being called \"liftoff.\"\n\nIn its official communication, the FOMC has laid out a framework for making this important decision. There are two key criteria. The Committee is looking for further progress in labor markets, and the Committee wants to be reasonably confident that the rate of inflation will move higher and converge to the target of 2 percent over the medium term. The assessment that these two criteria have been adequately met is data-dependent. That is to say, the Committee will be looking for evidence in incoming economic data. Those of you in the business world know the expression \"cash flow is king.\" Well, for us, data are king.\n\nToday, I would like to walk you through the data from the first quarter, the back story of my baseline outlook for the rest of the year. I normally prefer to think in terms of a medium-term horizon. But because the FOMC will likely soon be considering a major policy change, the incoming data over the coming days, weeks, and near-term months must be intensely watched and carefully interpreted. For policymaking purposes, the relevant timeframe has been foreshortened. I will provide you the key markers that I will be monitoring\n\nAs always, I will be presenting my personal views. I am not speaking for the FOMC or the Federal Reserve. My colleagues in the Federal Reserve may not agree with my views.\n\nThe first quarter\nAfter real GDP (gross domestic product) growth readings of a strong 5 percent in the third quarter of last year and 2.2 percent in the fourth quarter, the initial estimate of first-quarter 2015 GDP growth showed a marked deceleration. According to this first estimate, the economy grew at an annual rate of just 0.2 percent. There will be two more official releases on the first quarter by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, so revisions are possible, but as of now, it appears the quarter was unusually weak.\n\nEarly estimates of the current quarter's rate of growth are disappointing. I'm not overly concerned, however. Any estimate at this early date is based on just a few data points. Readings tend to get more accurate as more data on the current quarter stream in.\n\nWhile we can't say for sure, it appears that a variety of transitory or non-persistent factors restrained first-quarter growth.\n\nSevere winter weather was one such factor. My staff has a weather impact model that analyzes temperature patterns. This tool has produced an estimate that the economy lost a half percentage point of growth last quarter due to weather.\n\nAlthough the news, in February particularly, fixed our attention on weather in the Northeast, the temperature for the country as a whole was significantly colder than typical. Data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration measure the deviation in temperature from the long-term average. This source shows that seven of nine census divisions experienced significantly colder-than-normal temperatures in February. So severe weather was widespread.\n\nWeather effects on the economy are transitory. There were other factors at work in the first quarter. I'll call these transitional factors. These factors may not dissipate quickly like weather influences and may constrain growth beyond a single quarter. In any event, the bite of economic adjustment from these factors was likely felt most strongly in the first quarter.\n\nOne such factor was the drop in oil prices, the effects of which are quite apparent to you here in Louisiana, I'm sure. Lower crude oil prices have interrupted momentum in energy-related structures investment. Total investment in business structures, led by the sharp decline in the energy sector, is estimated to have shaved three-fourths of a percentage point off real GDP growth in the first quarter.\n\nThe damper on energy-related investment from lower oil prices may persist for a while. Baker Hughes's count of active oil rigs continues to decline. According to the company's numbers, active rig count has fallen from 813 on March 27 to 679 as of May 1.\n\nIt should be said that adjustment to lower oil prices goes further than upstream exploration drilling and related investment. As this audience knows well, downstream users of petroleum industrial inputs tend to benefit when costs fall. So there will be offsets to the falloff in oil and gas investment as we go forward. In addition, consumer activity is expected to demonstrate gains from lower gasoline prices, but this was not evident in the first quarter.\n\nA second transitional factor affecting first-quarter growth was an adjustment to the stronger dollar. The dollar has appreciated by roughly 15 percent since mid-2014, according to a common measure of dollar exchange-rate movements. The stronger dollar was likely reflected in a drag on net exports.\n\nThe GDP component \"net exports\" measures the relative impact on economic activity of exports and imports. Looking at exports in isolation, after solid expansion over the previous three quarters, exports fell sharply in the first quarter. Import growth, while a bit slower than its recent trend, still increased, which widened the trade deficit. In last week's GDP report, weak net exports subtracted 1 1/4 percentage points from first-quarter growth. We just received revised international trade statistics yesterday, and it appears that the rise in the trade deficit was even larger than originally thought—perhaps due to the effects of the now-settled port closures on the West Coast. This raises the possibility that first-quarter GDP growth was even slower than originally reported. Looking ahead, I expect net exports to be a modest drag on economic activity over much of the year.\n\nIt should be noted, however, that in recent weeks the dollar has stabilized and oil prices have begun to move up a little. These developments, if they stick, could dilute somewhat what would otherwise be drags on the economy in the near term. We shall see.\n\nMy outlook\nMy lengthy discussion of the first quarter sets up the question of the moment—how much weight should we put on weakness in the first quarter? I am looking through first-quarter weakness. That is to say, I am not taking much of a signal from the first quarter in my forecast of the second quarter and the rest of the year.\n\nWe've seen this movie before. It's a pattern we've seen over the years of the recovery. Since 2010, the first quarter has averaged 0.6 percent annualized growth while growth over the remainder of the year has averaged closer to 3 percent.\n\nI'm just making an observation. It reminds us there are often weak quarters that turn out to be aberrations.\n\nI believe the underlying fundamentals are strong enough to propel the economy along a growth path that delivers a bounce-back in the second quarter followed by a resumption of a pace of growth between 2.5 and 3 percent.\n\nThis is certainly consistent with what I hear, on balance, from contacts across the Southeast. Business sentiment seems to be positive and optimistic.\n\nWith a resumption of stronger growth, I expect to see further progress toward full employment and movement higher toward a healthier rate of inflation around 2 percent. These are the FOMC's ultimate policy objectives. Growth is the vehicle for achieving these objectives.\n\nAs I assess the possible and necessary contributors to a rebound in the second quarter and thereafter, attention has to fall on consumer spending, in my view. So a critical question is, how plausible is the assumption that consumer activity will strengthen and support resumption of growth?\n\nLet me paint the picture as regards consumption. The rate of real consumption growth slowed sharply in the first quarter after healthy gains over the second half of last year. Monthly details show a bit of an acceleration in March following a flat reading in February, perhaps because of weather. But taking a little longer view, since last December consumption growth has been rather soft.\n\nWhat's up with the consumer? It's puzzling. The fundamentals supporting consumption growth seem strong. I consider consumer fundamentals to be real personal income growth, household wealth, access to credit, and consumer confidence. Consumer confidence is, in turn, highly influenced by the broad employment outlook.\n\nLet's look at these factors. Growth of real disposable income (income after taxes, inflation-adjusted) jumped in the first quarter, partly because falling gasoline prices brought a decline in overall consumer prices. And real income is up almost 4 percent over the past year.\n\nGrowth in aggregate personal income as an economic statistic stems in large part from job gains (more people working) or wage gains (people earning more). With the exception of last month, the pace of job gains has been strong for more than a year. I should mention we will get the April report this Friday. Stay tuned.\n\nAlong with employment gains, accelerating wage growth raises the potential for consumption growth. Over most of the recovery, wage growth, by any measure, has been quite sluggish and has trended well below prerecession averages. Recently, we've seen a bit of an acceleration in some measures. Friday's employment report for April will include average hourly earnings. We'll be looking for confirming evidence of wage growth.\n\nThe wealth position of households, or household balance sheet strength, also influences consumption patterns. Household balance sheets have improved significantly since the recession. The ratio of household net worth to disposable personal income has risen sharply over the past year alone. Homeowners' equity is at its highest level since 2007.\n\nThe willingness and ability of consumers to access credit is another fundamental underpinning consumption. Households were deleveraging in aggregate until late 2013. Household debt began to grow again in 2014 and accelerated through much of last year, according to data from the New York Fed's credit panel. I take this as a healthy sign. Also, the willingness of banks to lend to consumers has continued to improve over the balance of the recovery. Lending standards have eased even if they are still much more stringent than precrisis levels.\n\nFinally, consumer sentiment measured in surveys has improved markedly over the past few months. The University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment has risen 16 percent since mid-2014. It is now at its highest level since January 2007.\n\nPrices of gasoline at the pump affect consumer sentiment. And the recent sharp decline in gasoline prices, which was reflected in the jump in consumer attitudes, should have bolstered spending growth. Instead, we saw a sharp, nearly full-percentage-point increase in the personal savings rate in the first quarter, from 4.6 percent to 5.5 percent.\n\nConsumers seem to be behaving cautiously in most categories of spending. Notwithstanding what they say in consumer sentiment surveys, consumers don't yet seem confident enough to increase discretionary spending in bellwether spending categories such as restaurants, movie theaters, and apparel. If there is an exception, it is durable goods, especially autos. Auto sales saw an annualized sales pace of 16.5 million units as of April.\n\nSo, as I said, the recent consumer behavior is something of a puzzle, and, at the same time, consumption spending is the key factor that will make my forecast of resumed solid growth come true.\n\nConcluding comments\nLet me sum up. Monitoring of incoming data is normal practice at the Fed. Given the possibility of a major policy decision in the near term, you can be sure we will be watching the data intently and putting great effort into their interpretation.\n\nThe near-term growth picture has yet to come into focus. There are many considerations that go into assessing economic conditions. No single number, or even a small set of numbers, tells the full story. That said, the outlook I've laid out depends heavily on the health of consumer spending. As support for growing consumer activity, I will be looking this Friday to see if job gains resume the robust monthly increases we saw prior to March.\n\nAnd over the coming weeks and months, I will be looking for direct confirming evidence that consumer spending is accelerating.\n\nThe FOMC has set out clear criteria for a decision to begin raising interest rates. Those criteria are further progress in the labor market and arrival at a position of reasonable confidence that inflation will move toward the 2 percent target over a medium-term horizon. Central to my own assessment of the sustainability of progress toward these objectives will be my confidence that growth is back on track. And, at this juncture, my confidence that growth will resume rests importantly on evidence that consumer spending is picking up.",

            "content": "Palm Beach County Business Leaders Luncheon\nPalm Beach, Florida\nApril 16, 2015\n\nThank you. It's a pleasure to be back in Palm Beach. I'd like to thank the Palm Beach Chamber and the Economic Council for hosting me at this event.\n\nAs a Fed policymaker, I consider it essential to get out and talk to people in my Federal Reserve region to hear how they are currently experiencing the economy.\n\nAt the same time, when I weigh options for optimal monetary policy and go to Washington to participate in meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), I consider policy from a national perspective only. I don't base my position on policy matters on what is best for the regional economy. However, what I learn about economic developments in the Southeast helps me build my national view.\n\nThe Sixth Federal Reserve District comprises six states in whole or in part. They are Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Tennessee. Florida is the largest state economy among these. The Southeast is expansive geographically and is a large chunk of the U.S. economy. It's over 40 million people and about 13 percent of the country's gross domestic product. If the region were a separate country, its economy would rank as number 9 in the world. It helps our work of gauging national trends that the Southeast economy is sizeable and resembles the national economy in industrial composition and employment distribution.\n\nThe Atlanta Fed operates from six offices across the region. Our Miami office is one of our largest. The Miami office focuses on South Florida and, particularly, Southeast Florida.\n\nTo ensure we are gathering information about the performance of the economy as systematically as possible, we have organized something we call our Regional Economic Information Network, or REIN. REIN is made up of business and community contacts in a variety of fields and includes firms and institutions of all sizes.\n\nOur economic information network in this part of Florida is overseen by our regional executive in Miami, Karen Gilmore. Karen, like me, is not a Fed career employee. She was a banker in South Florida for many years and brings valuable Main Street experience and knowledge to the Fed. We are teaching her how to talk like a central banker in Fedspeak. She's making appreciable progress commensurate with the extent of her temporal commitment thus far in her new capacity.\n\nAs someone who sits at the FOMC table, I can assure you that real-time economic intelligence about what's happening on Main Street is a big part of our discussions. I would like to thank those of you here who have shared your insights on business conditions with Karen. For potential new partners in this audience, if she calls, I'd be very grateful if you'd take the call.\n\nToday, I'll give you the opportunity to stand in my shoes as a Fed policymaker. I'll try to give you a good feel for a policymaker's considerations and thought processes as the FOMC approaches an important decision. The decision, of course, is whether and when to raise interest rates. I'm going to share my assessment of current national economic conditions. I will provide my views on the outlook for the economy and what the economic picture suggests as the appropriate path for monetary policy.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee has laid down two criteria to be met before we begin to raise interest rates. They are further progress in labor markets and reasonable confidence that inflation will rise to the longer-run target of 2 percent. The FOMC has also emphasized that the decision will be data-dependent. I consider this an essential discipline around our decision making on this matter. To me, data dependency means there is no preconceived plan. Data dependency means the decision will be based on the best evidence we have of the reality and trajectory of the economy.\n\nI always must begin with a disclaimer. I will be presenting my personal views. I am not speaking for the FOMC or the Federal Reserve. My Federal Reserve colleagues may not agree with my views.\n\nState of the economy\nI'll start by presenting the economic picture as I see it. Assessment of the performance of the economy requires at least three lens apertures to capture relevant timeframes.\n\nThe economy, in real terms, has made considerable progress over the past five years. Since mid-2009, real gross domestic product, or GDP, has grown by more than 13 percent. The unemployment rate has fallen from its peak of 10 percent to 5.5 percent in the latest reading.\n\nThe pace of improvement picked up steam over the past couple of years. The official unemployment rate, for example, is now only ½ percent above my estimate of the longer-run natural rate of unemployment—in concept, the lowest level of unemployment before job market slack is absorbed and inflation pressures begin to emerge.\n\nSubstantial progress has been achieved, and I believe the economy now has sustainable momentum, yet data available for the first quarter of this year have been notably weak. Most current tracking estimates of real GDP growth in the first quarter are in the neighborhood of an annual rate of only 1 percent. The Atlanta Fed's tracking estimate is considerably below 1 percent. A tracking estimate updates a key economic measure as each new data element arrives. A tracking estimate is a preliminary number. We are still receiving data on the first quarter, so we're still computing first-quarter tracking estimates.\n\nI'm sure many of you took note of the falloff in March payroll job growth reported early this month. The payroll jobs number came in at 126,000, well below the previous month. Importantly, there were downward revisions to the previous two months' numbers. The report for March brought the employment picture down to earth. Whether temporary or persistent, the pace of decline in the rate of unemployment, and the pace of growth of payroll employment, slowed somewhat. The apparent weakness of the first quarter can be partially explained, I believe, by transitory factors. Bad weather in February was a drag on economic activity. There was some inventory drawdown following inventory accumulation in earlier periods.\n\nConsumer spending in the first quarter was not as strong as expected. We did not see an expected boost to consumer spending coming from lower gasoline prices at the pump. At the same time, drilling activity in the energy sector predictably fell off in reaction to the drop in crude oil prices. As the year proceeds, I see consumer activity offsetting lower investment and employment in oil exploration and development.\n\nOne other unexpected factor appears to have weighed on activity in the first quarter, and that is the effect of the higher dollar on exports. Net exports—that is, the contribution to economic growth after imports are netted against exports—has fallen apparently as a result of the stronger dollar. Manufacturing activity has felt the pressure. Manufacturing growth numbers have softened considerably relative to a year ago.\n\nTo summarize, some factors at work in recent months were clearly transitory in nature, and some other factors have triggered rapid adjustment in certain sectors of the economy. Together, they are giving rise to heightened uncertainty about the track the economy is on.\n\nInflation\nIn addition, the ongoing picture for inflation adds to uncertainty about the path of the economy. You can think of inflation pressures as symptomatic of demand conditions across the economy. Or, saying the same thing in a different way, inflation pressures or the lack thereof may reflect the degree of slack remaining in product, service, and employment markets.\n\nIn January 2012, the FOMC set an inflation target of 2 percent over the longer run. There are many measures of inflation. Technically, the FOMC defined its target using a particular index—the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index—and chose the so-called headline version of the PCE index. In headline inflation statistics, the relatively volatile food and energy components are included.\n\nBy this measure and others, the inflation trends over the last few years have been disappointingly sluggish. The problem we face as policymakers is getting inflation up to target, and for quite some time this has been difficult. Annual inflation numbers have come in below 2 percent for each of the past two years. This has been the case in spite of some quarters of growth well above the estimated longer-run trend rate of growth. And this has been the case in spite of what I believe to be an acceleration in growth since mid-year 2013. It's a bit of a puzzle.\n\nRecent inflation readings continue to be soft, and the price data for the first quarter were especially weak. On a 12-month basis, headline inflation in February was up a meager 0.3 percent. Core inflation—which excludes the recently falling gasoline component—was up 1.4 percent for the 12 months through February.\n\nI also look at shorter-term measures of inflation to get a sense of the current run rate. For the three months ending in February, core inflation was up only 0.9 percent.\n\nEven factoring out the effects of lower gasoline prices on consumer price inflation and the appreciation of the dollar on import prices, the behavior of inflation poses an issue. To repeat, the FOMC has stated that to get comfortable about making the first move to raise interest rates, the Committee participants collectively need to be reasonably confident that inflation will trend higher.\n\nMy economic outlook\nIt is axiomatic that monetary policy has its effect with long and variable lags. Monetary policy is therefore forward-looking. For that reason, my colleagues and I always have a working forecast in place on which to make judgments about appropriate policy.\n\nIn spite of the recent weakness, I do not believe the economy in some fundamental way is faltering, stalling, slowing—pick your description. I expect something of a replay of 2014—a weak first quarter due to transitory causes followed by a pickup in growth in later quarters. My outlook for the remainder of the year is for further progress toward full employment with inflation gradually firming. I have the run rate of GDP growth resuming a pace between 2 1/2 and 3 percent per annum. But this forecast leans heavily on the assumption that recent weakness is a passing phenomenon. The evidence on which to make this forecast is not yet \"in the numbers.\"\n\nOver the coming weeks and months, I will be monitoring the incoming data closely and carefully for validation of my outlook assumptions. A murky economic picture is not an ideal circumstance for making a major policy decision. The decision to begin raising rates will be a Committee decision, of course. The decision will represent the consensus that emerges from a wide-ranging discussion that I know will include a range of interpretations of the picture presented by the data as well as different weightings of risks and priorities.\n\nBy laying down the marker of data dependency, the Committee has set limits regarding what is relevant. The state of and outlook for the broad economy will be central.\n\nAs I see it, data-derived judgments on the timing of the liftoff decision can be based on tests of increasing stringency. I think the bar can be set at three levels.\n\nThree tests or bars\nThe lowest bar is that key indicators of labor market progress and, especially, the inflation trend are at least stable—that is to say, not moving in the wrong direction. To explain, this test would be satisfied, in my opinion, if unemployment and underemployment numbers are not backing up. Core inflation measures would not be softening. This level of evaluation might call for evidence that core inflation measures are headed back to levels that prevailed before the oil price and dollar exchange-rate shocks. This requirement might also look for evidence confirming that the first-quarter weakness was an aberration. Some of the current uncertainty ought to have been dispelled.\n\nThe second bar would be set a little higher. The second test is that indirect evidence supports a favorable outlook for both continuing employment progress and especially the firming of price data. To explain, I think some amount of comfort about prospects for rising inflation can be based on the strength of GDP growth indicators, the trend in payroll job creation, and the acceleration of wage pressures.\n\nThe highest bar would be, as you would expect, the most exacting. It is direct, affirmative evidence in the data that the desired outcomes are in fact materializing. This test would call for a falling unemployment rate and rising inflation.\n\nIn a timeframe of a few months, I don't place equal probability on satisfying all three tests. I expect it will take longer for direct, affirmative evidence to appear that would validate a decision to begin raising rates. Falling unemployment and rising inflation may be unlikely in the very near term. In my working forecast, inflation does not pick up until the second half of the year.\n\nI'll state my preferences or leanings. Ideally, I'd like to see direct, affirmative evidence in the data that the desired outcomes are in fact materializing. But I can get comfortable with less. I prefer at least some indirect evidence that progress toward our objectives is likely to continue. To get to \"reasonable confidence\" about inflation, sufficient evidence could show up in growth numbers, employment numbers, and rising wages as an indication of tightening conditions.\n\nMy support for a liftoff decision will inevitably be a judgment call. I don't think it is advisable to approach such a decision with rigid quantitative triggers in mind. Strength in one aspect of the overall economic picture may offset ambiguity in another.\n\nThe post-liftoff path of policy\nOnce the initial decision to raise rates is made, attention will shift to the subsequent path of policy. The process leading to a normalized structure of interest rates will just begin with the liftoff decision. This is a crucial point. Our policymaking is oriented to achieving the best outcomes in the broad economy. I see the interests of the Main Street economy as more aligned with an approach that thinks of liftoff and subsequent rate moves as a package.\n\nTo my way of thinking, the data-dependency basis for a decision to lift off and anticipation of follow-on increases of the policy rate are connected. The less an initial decision to raise rates is based on concrete, unambiguous evidence of labor market progress and inflation convergence to target, the less that first move should bring an expectation of a rapid-fire string of subsequent increases. The more solid the data evidence underpinning liftoff, the more predictable the subsequent rate path can be, in my opinion.\n\nI think waiting a while longer improves the chances of seeing confirmation from incoming data that the economy is on the desired path. I think it is highly desirable that the public sees an economic picture at the time of the liftoff decision that is consistent with the decision criteria the FOMC has set out. Ideally, coherence between data and decision would be clear to all.",

            "highlights": "Atlanta Fed President and CEO Dennis Lockhart, in a March 20 speech at the University of Georgia in Athens, presents his views on prudential regulation of both banks and shadow banks.",
            "content": "Thank you for including me in this symposium on financial regulation. This is an important topic. Having spent most of my career in the private-sector financial world, I am a believer in the notion of regulatory balance. Our system of financial regulation neither should tolerate practices and risk-taking that imperil public welfare, nor should it strangle innovation, initiative, and sound risk-taking under a mountain of compliance requirements. The exact right balance is, realistically, a moving target that is responsive to financial system structure and evolving circumstances.\n\nToday I would like to explore questions related to prudential regulation as it applies to banks and nonbank financial firms. More specifically, I'll contrast prudential regulation of banks and so-called shadow banks, or firms that play a role in the shadow banking system. Banks are increasingly in competition with parties in the shadow banking system. I'll explore the logic of differential regulation between banks and shadow banks. I'll also comment on differential supervision within the banking industry per se.\n\nMy talk today anticipates a conference sponsored by the Atlanta Fed week after next titled \"Central Banking in the Shadows: Monetary Policy and Financial Stability Post-Crisis.\" As the title suggests, we will be looking at how shadow banking interacts with monetary policy and affects financial stability. Since I expect to learn a lot at this conference, please take my comments today as work-in-process thoughts preliminary to the discussion that will take place at that conference.\n\nAlso, as always, I have to begin with a disclaimer. I will be presenting my personal views. I am not speaking for the Federal Reserve or for my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nPrudential regulation\nLet me start with a few contextual observations on prudential regulation—that is, regulation focused on the safety and soundness of individual institutions.\n\nPrudential regulation of banks in the decades leading up to the financial crisis of 2008 had, as a central aim, the protection of insured consumer deposits. This was especially the case for smaller banks. The charge to regulators was multifaceted, to be sure, but careful stewardship of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation—the FDIC—insurance fund was central.\n\nThe aims of prudential regulation of larger banks were broader. A substantial proportion of large bank funding came from less stable wholesale funding markets.  Also, if and when these institutions faced distress, the regulators' safety net extended to nonbank subsidiaries. This became reality in the crisis.\n\nThe crisis also showed that the regulatory safety net might be used to address threats to financial stability associated with firms that were previously exempt from prudential regulation. These were firms with no real reliance on consumer deposits, but they were tightly integrated with vital money markets. Regulatory interventions in the crisis brought home the reality that substantial moral hazard accompanied exposure to such firms.\n\nI would argue that since the crisis, there is enhanced clarity around the broad aims of prudential regulation. The concept of prudential regulations has been broadened to encompass \"macroprudential supervision.\" The main goal of macroprudential supervision is to regulate banks—and, increasingly, some important nonbanks—to protect the financial system's ability to deliver vital services to the general economy. One could say, with little exaggeration, the goal is to protect Main Street from Wall Street.\n\nBanks have long been among the more heavily regulated firms. However, post-crisis, regulatory oversight has been taken to another level for all sizes of banks. Minimum capital requirements are higher for all banks. Supervisors are requiring more and better internal risk management. Larger banks must now subject their portfolios to annual stress tests that assume severe recessionary conditions. They must demonstrate an ability to absorb losses and continue lending to support the broad economy. Their capital plans must pass regulatory approval both quantitatively and qualitatively. New regulations on liquidity are now being implemented to strengthen the ability of larger banks to withstand deposit runs. There's more, but I think the point is clear enough. Banks are now even more heavily regulated.\n\nShadow banking\nIt has to be noted, though, that in the United States, banks represent only a part of the financial system. The structure of the U.S. financial industry is distinctive by comparison with other advanced countries. The financial systems of most countries—and I include those in Europe as a region—are bank-centric. The evolution of our financial system, by comparison, has resulted in a shadow banking system of considerable scale and institutional diversity.\n\nA perfect definition of shadow banking is elusive. A simple and workable definition is financial services providers and credit intermediaries that operate without a bank charter. The Financial Stability Board, an international body that monitors the global financial system, uses a similar definition. It is \"credit intermediation involving entities and activities outside the regular banking system.\" The key term in both definitions is \"credit intermediaries.\" Credit isn't the only financial service provided by banks and nonbanks, but lending is an essential function in the economy. Credit is the lubricant of economic activity and one of the principal channels through which monetary policy has its effect.\n\nThe scale of shadow banking activity is large. The most reliable numbers focus on system liabilities. Shadow banking, as measured by liabilities, grew rapidly in the decade prior to the crisis. According to a 2013 report on shadow banking by the New York Fed, shadow liabilities peaked at $22 trillion in June 2007 and exceeded the liabilities of traditional banks. More recently, by December 2013, traditional banks had the larger share. A crude estimate would have banks at 60 percent and shadow banks at 40 percent of credit intermediation.\n\nA wide variety of financial firms could be classified as shadow banks in part or all of their activity. The list includes money market mutual funds, broker–dealers, nonbank finance companies, business development corporations, hedge funds, pension funds to the extent they participate directly in financings, and so-called peer-to-peer online lending platforms. I would add the various functionally specialized participants in the securitization industry.\n\nSome of these types of intermediary deserve special mention. Broker–dealers, many of which are units of bank holding companies, fund themselves independently of their associated banks in short-term funding capital markets and lend to investors against their clients' inventory of securities.\n\nParticipants in the securitization industry—the biggest component of which is home mortgages—have a share of shadow banking. In securitization, there is a chain of linked roles starting with loan origination, followed by warehousing, leading to structuring an asset-backed security or a collateralized debt obligation that is distributed in the capital markets.\n\nAnother component of the shadow banking system that has received a lot of attention is the money market mutual fund industry. Money market funds have drawn attention because of the aggregate scale of the industry and the quasi-deposit nature of shareholder investments in these funds.\n\nThe concern in the regulatory community—including the Fed—regarding money market funds relates to the industry's size and perceived vulnerability to runs in times of financial turbulence. Current regulation of money market funds by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission allows only a very limited range of investments and tenors. There is considerable correlation among constituent funds that results from this tight regulation.\n\nThe industry has about $2.7 trillion of liabilities. Almost 40 percent of that is in funds that hold only government and government agency securities. And almost two-thirds of the $2.7 trillion in invested assets represents investments by institutional clients.\n\nThere is some basis for concern about the industry's potential role in an episode of financial instability. In the fall of 2008, a prime fund—the Reserve Primary Fund—\"broke the buck\" due to holdings of Lehman Brothers commercial paper. In the week or so that followed, roughly $500 billion flowed out of prime money market funds into government money funds. Prime funds met redemptions through decreases in commercial paper holdings, prompting a crisis in that market for issuers. The Federal Reserve quickly stood up market support facilities to address the crisis in short-term markets.\n\nThe money market fund sector remains a focus of regulators because of its potential to be both contributor to and victim of financial instability.\n\nThe banks' \"franchise\"\nToday, banks and nonbanks compete head-on to a great extent as credit intermediaries and in some other product markets. Put differently, the banking system and shadow banking system go after similar business and serve similar functions.\n\nThe banking system no longer enjoys anything resembling an exclusive \"franchise\" in its three key functions: deposit taking, payments, and lending.\n\nAs regards deposits, consumers and businesses have many deposit or deposit-equivalent options. They include money market accounts of various investment styles, interest-paying surplus balances on credit cards, and prepaid cards for various uses. I have a friend whose spouse keeps a substantial credit balance on her Starbucks payment card.\n\nIn payments, too, banks no longer have exclusivity. They no longer have end-to-end control of processing. Banks retain a virtual monopoly in final clearing and settling of payments, but now there are legions of financial transaction specialists doing payments processing. Some of these are relative newcomers—so-called fin tech startups—while others are well established. PayPal was founded in 1998!\n\nAs I said, the lending franchise of banks is also under pressure. Some nonbank competitors have substantial balance sheets. An example is GE Capital, the seventh largest domestic financial institution. Recently, we've seen the rise of online lending platforms that use powerful credit scoring and decision-making algorithms. The market share of these alternative lenders is small compared to banks. It's too early to assess their ultimate impact on the lending industry, but it's possible that these new nonbank lenders will become important players in some markets previously dominated by banks.\n\nI would argue that the coexistence of bank and nonbank credit providers benefits the overall economy. Not all credit extension is appropriately bank business. I once worked for a nonbank finance company. We took lending risk for variable upside, performance-dependent reward where risk and loan structure was outside the appetite and competence of many banks. The risk transformation accomplished by securitization is analogous. Exposures that are individually outside the comfort zone of banks are bundled to create a portfolio with reduced default risk.\n\nNonetheless, banking and shadow banking are direct competitors along many dimensions. But most nonbanks are much less regulated than banks, and that regulation is largely not prudential in character (that is, safety- and soundness-oriented).\n\nAside from the obvious question of whether this constitutes a level competitive playing field, is this good macroprudential policy? Furthermore, why are banks subject to more extensive regulation? And, given the experience of the recent crisis, is the relatively light regulation of shadow banks still sufficient?\n\nDifferential regulation\nBanks enjoy access to two important government programs that are designed to reduce the chances of economically damaging runs. They are the FDIC deposit insurance and the Fed's discount window—the central bank's lender-of-last-resort function. For the privilege of these two forms of support, banks submit to a process of regulation and supervision. Banks are not immunized from survival risk. The regulatory regime permits orderly bank failures and prompt resolution under procedures designed to safeguard the broader health of the economy.\n\nIf there is a case for greater prudential regulation of shadow banking institutions, it is also based on financial stability concerns. These institutions are a significant and growing source of credit in the economy. They depend greatly on wholesale funding. Many are opaque compared to banks in terms of their activities and exposures. They are part of an interconnected financial system that, in extreme circumstances, is prone to contagion. And shadow banking parties are not walled off from the banking system. They share some credit exposures with banks, and they receive funding or support for their security issuance from banks.\n\nHeightened regulatory requirements have recently been imposed on some nonbanks, but the norm remains differential regulation. After the crisis, a few of the country's most significant nonbank financial firms—firms that did not own commercial banks—were pulled under the Fed's regulatory umbrella. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley became bank holding companies subject to bank prudential regulation of the Federal Reserve. GE Capital has been designated a systemically important financial institution (SIFI), as have some large insurers.\n\nIs market discipline sufficient?\nResistance to expanded regulatory oversight is often grounded in the view that market discipline is an effective substitute. Is market discipline sufficient to address risks residing in the shadow banking world, risks that could have systemic impact? Some comfort can be taken from the reality that liabilities of the shadow banking system come predominantly from professionally managed money sources. Also, the spread of firms and activities classified as shadow banks or shadow banking may mitigate the risk of massive concentrations of risk. That said, shadow banking activity is large, growing, and opaque. The financial crisis that began in 2007 arguably began in the shadow banking arena. It propagated to banks and became global because investors and depositors could not assess their counterparties' exposures.\n\nAt a minimum, I feel the authorities responsible for preserving financial stability must monitor the sector very closely with ever-improving techniques. A robust regime of monitoring is justified, in my opinion, because of the natural tendency in our economic system for activity to migrate to where it is least regulated. I also do not believe we have to choose between complete exemption from prudential regulation and a wholesale extension of the existing framework of regulation developed for banks.\n\nIf we anchor calibration of regulatory oversight of firms, classes of firms, and markets in potential risk to the broad economy, then it seems to me we should variably monitor and supervise institutions and activities in the banking system that may have financial stability implications, and do the same in the shadow banking world. This does not mean we should undertake full-spectrum prudential supervision and regulation of everything in either sector.\n\nSelective supervision and regulation is both possible and desirable. The onus falls on regulatory policymakers to identify and respond to developments that threaten the general economy. Too much regulation can threaten the vibrancy of the U.S. economy—although, to be sober about it, not as catastrophically as too little.\n\nThe concept of differential supervision also is applicable among banks of varying size, scope, and complexity. The Federal Reserve is implementing differentiated supervision of individual banks based on a bank's size, complexity, risk profile, and systemic importance. We're calling this approach two-tiered regulation. The approach recognizes significant distinctions between larger banks and community banks. I expect continuing refinement of supervisory methods along this line.\n\nThe true north of shadow banking regulation\nThe current orientation of prudential regulation reflects learnings from the recent financial crisis. We learned about concentrations of risk across firms that may not be identified as excessive in individual firms. We learned about interconnectivity within the financial system and the threat of contagion in periods of financial stress. We learned about the role of opaque firms, markets, and vehicle structures, and how they can contribute to cascading illiquidity and market shutdown. At the beginning of my remarks, I argued that the experience of recent years has made the primary aim of prudential regulation to protect the financial system's ability to support the general economy. In my view, this should be the \"true north\" of any expansion of the regulatory overlay on shadow banking.",

            "content": "I want to begin by expressing thanks to Gary Tice for his service on the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's Miami board. Gary follows Gay Rebel Thompson from this community, who earlier served as a board member and chair of the Atlanta Fed's board for South Florida.\n\nThis year—2015—is widely expected to be the year the Federal Reserve initiates normalization of monetary policy. This prospect has generated a lot of interest and buzz.\n\nIf you follow the Fed-watching industry, as I do, you are well aware that a top-of-mind question regarding policy is: At what meeting will the Fed decide to lift off? At what meeting will the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raise the policy rate target above its current near-zero range?\n\nIf you are an investor in fixed-income or interest-paying assets, a lot of money may ride on the precise answer to that question.\n\nIn contrast, if you are a business person operating in the nonfinancial real economy, you may be less concerned about the precise timing of the first policy adjustment. You are likely to be more concerned about what a change in the interest-rate environment means for the outlook for overall demand conditions and the general direction of the economy.\n\nToday I will orient my remarks mostly to the concerns of Main Street. This keeps the focus where, in my opinion, it ultimately should be—that is, on the health, resilience, and momentum of the broad economy.\n\nWith this perspective in mind, I want to share my thought process, as one policymaker, on the decisions ahead and the economic context in which they may be made.\n\nWhen a Reserve Bank president speaks publicly, he or she is expressing individual views, not an official message of the Fed or the FOMC. That is the case today. My colleagues may not agree with my views.\n\nEconomic progress and outlook\nThe national economy has improved greatly from the recession's trough in 2009. Much has been accomplished.\n\nThe Great Recession was a particularly severe episode. The economy lost quite a lot of ground. We lost nearly 7 million jobs—more jobs than in the prior three recessions combined. During the recovery, we have regained that ground, and nonfarm payroll jobs are now about 2 million jobs above where they were at the onset of the recession.\n\nIn terms of total output, the economy is now almost 14 percent larger than at its nadir at the bottom of the recession.\n\nIt has taken a while—the recovery is five-and-a-half years old—and the job is not finished, in my opinion. But, as I said, much has been accomplished.\n\nI believe the economy has sufficient traction for the expansion to be extended through the medium term.\n\nMy baseline outlook for 2015 and 2016 assumes growth at around 3 percent per annum. I expect employment to continue to grow and both unemployment and underemployment to continue to decline. This morning, we received the Bureau of Labor Statistics' employment situation report for January. Payroll jobs grew by 257,000 on net. And over the past three months, job gains have averaged 336,000.\n\nAs a general statement, the improvement of economic conditions to date, in combination with the outlook I just outlined, leads me to the view that the economy is on a path to a satisfactory and desirable state of health.\n\nThe Fed's statutory objectives contained in the so-called dual mandate help define what is satisfactory and desirable. Our policy objectives are maximum employment and low and stable inflation. The Committee has put a clear definition on the inflation objective. The Committee has defined it as a rate of 2 percent annual inflation over the longer run as measured by a particular index called the personal consumption expenditures price index. Importantly, inflation is targeted on a total or headline basis including the highly variable components of food and energy prices. In practice, most Fed officials monitor a collection of inflation indicators in an attempt to discern the underlying trend. There are worrisome aspects of the current inflation picture, and reading underlying trends is problematic at present. Hold that thought. I'll emphasize the centrality of inflation concerns a little later.\n\nMaximum, or full, employment is less explicitly defined. Most economists assume that what constitutes full employment changes over time. Structural shifts in the economy cause the natural rate of unemployment to move around. For a good part of the recovery period, a number of Fed policymakers, me included, have estimated the unemployment level consistent with full employment as between 5 1/4 and 5 1/2 percent or a little higher. Today's report has the headline unemployment rate at 5.7 percent. So, on that basis, we would seem to be approaching an acceptable steady-state level of employment.\n\nIt's a fair question, then, why the FOMC has not already started to normalize interest-rate policy. My answer is the recovery has been sluggish for much of its five-and-a-half years. To accomplish what we have, the recovery has required the support of extraordinary policy measures—measures such as a policy rate set effectively at zero and three rounds of quantitative easing. Furthermore, the economy has endured periodic headwinds that threatened to dilute or reverse progress. And although the economy is growing, its strength has sometimes seemed tentative and fragile.\n\nA moment ago, I said the job is not finished. Some gaps remain.\n\nEmployment progress, for instance, may be less than meets the eye. Many of us have held that the conventional measure of unemployment probably overstates actual progress. There are still almost 7 million workers counted as employed who say they are working part-time involuntarily. As a point of reference, 7 million is about 4 1/2 percent of a labor force of 157 million. There are always people in this involuntary part-time category, but the number is still elevated compared to historical levels. Over the last few years, there has been a worrisome outflow of prime-age workers—especially men—from the labor force. I believe some of these people will be enticed back into formal work arrangements if the economy improves further.\n\nThe distance between current conditions and our goals doesn't have to be completely closed for the FOMC to start moving interest rates higher. Monetary policy is, of necessity, forward looking. If, as we look forward, it seems likely we will achieve our policy objectives, then we can consider beginning to adjust policy.\n\nFrom a Main Street perspective, it is the overall direction and extent of normalization that should matter most, rather than the exact date of liftoff. Liftoff will be a momentous event when it happens, but it is the evolution of the interest-rate environment over the next few years that will most influence real business activity.\n\nConfidence as linchpin\nThe linchpin in a decision to make a significant policy change is confidence. By that, I mean confidence in a forecast—an outlook narrative, if you will—that has the economy on track to achieve the FOMC's policy objectives in a reasonable timeframe. I think a reasonable time horizon is one to two years.\n\nI really want to emphasize this point. The Committee has repeatedly stressed that the first and subsequent policy moves will be data-dependent. It is confidence based on clear evidence in the data that will trigger the start of normalization.\n\nOne hundred percent confidence is never attainable. The test is one of sufficiency—that is, sufficient confidence that, in a defined period of time, the broad economy will reach conditions consistent with sustainable full employment and stable prices.\n\nAt this particular moment, I don't quite have sufficient confidence. There are factors at work at the moment whose effects I consider to be transient. Key among these factors is inflation.\n\nInflation, by almost every measure, has been running considerably below the FOMC's target of 2 percent. This was the case well before the recent drop in energy prices. Because of the sharp falloff of energy prices—especially gasoline prices—headline or total inflation has gone negative in the most recent readings. Core inflation—the measure that excludes the direct impact of energy and food prices—has recently been running below 1 percent.\n\nIn my baseline forecast, I have inflation getting past this period of broad disinflation and resuming a gradual rise to 2 percent. It's important, in my opinion, to be confident that this will occur, and certainly that the trend in overall prices is not continuing to move away from the FOMC's target.\n\nJust as current readings of inflation give some pause, broad wage trends seem to suggest we are not yet on the cusp of full employment. The quite modest growth of wages across the economy does not seem normal given the solid growth numbers we've seen in recent quarters.\n\nInflation and wages ought to be telling indicators that the gaps are closing. Their weakness is a concern.\n\nA noisy first half \nThe first half of 2015 will present challenges in evaluating the validity of economic assumptions.\n\nI've mentioned oil prices. After seven months of decline, prices firmed in trading sessions last week, then fell again. Financial market participants interpreted the firming as a positive development. A number of oil and gas sector analysts forecast that global petroleum supplies will exceed demand through the first half of the year.\n\nThe dollar has appreciated by 13 percent on a trade-weighted basis since last June. Exports in the fourth quarter seem to have been negatively affected by the dollar's rise. I will avoid predicting exchange rates, but suffice to say that the impact of the dollar on exports, as well as imported consumer goods prices, is part of the current swirl of variables making the state of the economy harder to assess.\n\nThe direction of the dollar is an aspect of the larger context of slow global growth with risk of spillover to the U.S. economy. Some of the influence of soft economic conditions abroad is incorporated into my baseline outlook. In contrast, more extreme scenarios are not.\n\nI should also comment on inflation compensation in inflation-protected securities. Compensation for inflation in these securities (so-called TIPS) has moved sharply lower since last summer. This decline may reflect transitory influences like falling energy costs. A less benign possibility is that investors are lowering their outlook for inflation. This could be either because their confidence is waning that the Fed will achieve its 2 percent inflation target, or because they see growing risks to the continued strength of the broad economy.\n\nSince mid-January, some inflation-compensation measures have shown signs of reversing. A firming in the inflation compensation data from their year-end lows is an example of the kind of encouraging development that will bolster my confidence in the medium-term outlook.\n\nTo put an exclamation point on the proviso that the first half of 2015 may be noisy and hard to read, I'll just catalog a few of the obvious things that might confuse true underlying conditions: oil prices, the dollar, the effects of both oil prices and exchange rates on headline inflation, their possible impact on core inflation, slow-to-improve wages, the ups and downs of quarter-to-quarter growth, and mixed messages from measures of inflation expectations.\n\nWhat am I looking for?\nSo, if the linchpin in a policy decision, for me, is confidence, what am I looking for?\n\nFor starters, as I said earlier, key indicators of economic conditions should not be moving away from my basic outlook. Assuming no substantial softening of GDP and employment growth, my attention will likely be on the path of inflation.\n\nI'd like to see some evidence that what we believe to be transient factors driving recent weak inflation readings are, in fact, passing. I would like to see firming of inflation readings. This will give me confidence that the outlook on which important decisions will swing remains realistic and likely to play out.\n\nInflation is appropriately a focal point because its firming will reduce concerns that the economy is somehow stalling, that prophesies of long-term stagnation have any basis, and that chances of accomplishing the FOMC's policy goals are receding.\n\nAs of today, I remain comfortable with the assumption that circumstances will come together around mid-year, or a little later, that will deliver sufficient confidence to begin normalization with the liftoff decision. I won't be more definitive than that. I think all possibilities from June on should remain open. I don't at this juncture have a prediction or preference. Timing will depend on what the data tell us.\n\nFrom a Main Street perspective, the important point for business planning is that monetary policy is likely to shift sometime this year, and a higher interest-rate environment will ensue. The decision to begin normalization should be a signal that the FOMC is confident the economy is on track to achieve its objectives and that the economy should have sufficient strength and momentum to handle higher rates. The start of the process of normalization should itself instill confidence on Main Street.",

            "content": "As I look back on 2014 and look ahead to 2015, I can comfortably assert that, more and more, the U.S. economy is hitting on all cylinders. The recovery that began in 2009 is well-advanced, and we are getting closer to a point where the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the body that formulates monetary policy, can begin a process of normalizing the interest-rate environment. That process will begin with so-called \"liftoff\"—that is, the first increase in the policy rate.\n\nChair Yellen, speaking for the Committee, has stressed that the liftoff decision will be data-dependent. That means we will be closely monitoring evidence of the performance of the economy as the year proceeds, and we will be assessing what the stream of economic data seem to indicate regarding the outlook.\n\nSo, today I want to present my forecast of how this potentially momentous year is likely to play out. I'll do this in terms of both the vital economic signs and policy. I want to give you a sense of what factors could materially change—even derail—that scenario. And I want to convey a sense of the basis on which important policy decisions ahead will be made.\n\nThis is my eighth annual address to this club. As always, you will be hearing my personal views. I am not speaking for the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC. My colleagues may not agree with what I have to say.\n\nCurrent state of economy and outlook\nSo let's start with the current economic situation. I'll do a short-form version of this focused on three key elements of economic performance—growth, employment, and inflation.\n\nAfter negative growth (contraction) in the first quarter of 2014 that was largely explained by bad weather, the economy experienced strong and accelerating growth through the third quarter.\n\nGrowth in the fourth quarter is likely to be slower than the very strong third quarter. We are still working with very preliminary measures of fourth-quarter performance. At the Atlanta Fed, we expect the fourth-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate to come in around 3 percent (annualized). That would produce an annual rate of growth in the second half around 4 percent. This is strong growth, and we believe there is solid momentum carrying over into 2015. Notwithstanding the equity market volatility of last week, we're starting the year on an optimistic note in terms of real economic activity.\n\nGrowth of consumer spending appeared to accelerate toward the close of 2014. Personal consumption expenditures rose at an annual rate of 9.2 percent in November, raising the year-over-year rate to 2.8 percent growth. Roughly half of the strong November growth of consumption was auto purchases, but other categories of spending accelerated as well. People seem to be more prepared to open their pocketbooks. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index for December reached its highest reading since January 2007.\n\nAnother reason for optimism is that 2014 was a year of significantly improved employment conditions. Payrolls increased by almost 3 million, the strongest reading since 2000, and the gains were spread across a wide range of industries. The headline unemployment rate fell by more than a percent over the year. The long-term unemployment rate, defined as 27 weeks or more, also declined meaningfully.\n\nAlso, we saw the smallest decline in five years in the participation in the labor market of working-age people. We believe this indicates increasing confidence in labor market prospects.\n\nOver the last year as the labor market has improved, we've paid special attention to trends in wages. Growing wages would validate tightening employment conditions and would also support growth of consumer activity and prices. Both are highly desirable in current circumstances.\n\nThe recent evidence on wages has been mixed. A number of measures of wage growth remained well below historical norms throughout most of last year, while others did tick up slightly in the second and third quarters.\n\nBased on research, my team has advanced the thesis that the elevated number of people working part-time involuntarily is restraining wage growth. There are about 6.8 million such workers as of December. It's encouraging that the number of involuntary part-time workers declined by almost a million over the past year, four times the decrease in 2013.\n\nOverall, there was more improvement in labor markets in 2014 than in any other year of the recovery. Employment conditions are improving, and improving faster, and prospects of continued progress are encouraging moving into the new year.\n\nThe behavior of wages and prices, in contrast, remains less encouraging, and, frankly, somewhat puzzling in light of recent growth and jobs numbers.\n\nMost recent readings of inflation remain considerably below the Fed's notion of a healthy rate, that is, 2 percent. In spite of extremely accommodative interest-rate conditions, inflation readings have tracked well short of the 2 percent target for the past two years.\n\nAt the Atlanta Fed, we don't rely totally on any single measure of inflation. We use a dashboard approach to tracking and assessing the broad inflation picture. The components that typically make up a traditional inflation forecast (including, for example, producer prices and commodity prices) are showing readings toward the lower end of their longer-term ranges.\n\nLet me summarize in captions. Solid growth. Improving employment conditions. Stronger consumer activity. But mixed wage growth and weak inflation readings.\n\nTaking account of all this, I see a positive outlook for 2015. I expect GDP growth to be around 3 percent for the year. I expect continued robust job creation accompanied by growing wages. And, while acknowledging some room for skepticism about the inflation picture, I'm looking for inflation to rise gradually through year-end. There will almost certainly be weak inflation readings early in the year influenced by energy prices. But once that influence has passed, I expect inflation to move toward the Fed's targeted longer-term run rate.\n\nPotential headwinds and downside risks\nWhat could derail or materially undermine this scenario? There are certainly risk concerns, whether we characterize them as potential headwinds or more serious downside risks. The most concerning is a soft global growth outlook. We're observing a rather sharp contrast between U.S. economic prospects and those of much of the rest of the world. The jittery financial markets last week probably can be explained, at least in part, by an interpretation of falling oil prices as reflecting weak global demand, deflation data in Europe, and a resulting flight of capital to safety.\n\nI'm sure the question of the broad economic effects of falling oil prices is on your mind. I am of the view, based on a preliminary assessment by Atlanta Fed economists, that lower oil prices will be a net benefit to the U.S. economy. I expect a decline in energy-sector new investment and some falloff in employment to be more than offset by a boost to consumer activity. Also, the lower cost of oil imports should positively affect the net exports component of the GDP growth calculation.\n\nThe appreciation of the dollar since last summer will likely affect the export sector, to some extent. My view is that the impact of the dollar's more expensive exchange value and, for that matter, the direct impact of lower oil prices on the energy sector are not severe for the national economy as a whole. But whenever two major world \"prices\" adjust so markedly, unanticipated second- and third-order effects could result. Geopolitical event risk connected to the rapid adjustment of these globally high-impact prices cannot be dismissed. Analytical humility is a sensible posture.\n\nPolicy outlook\nThese are concerns, not my base-case scenario. As I said earlier, I think the momentum evident in the second half of 2014 will carry over into 2015, and the ongoing outlook will remain solid.\n\nIf that is indeed the case, I believe the first action to raise interest rates will in all likelihood be justified by the middle of the year.\n\nThe phrase \"middle of the year\" is admittedly not very precise. That's purposeful on my part. Understandably, some financial market participants are fixated on what exact month the first move will occur. Perhaps it's easy for me to say, but I don't think the exact timing of liftoff is the most important concern. A couple of years hence, whether the first rate increase came at a particular meeting or another—whether a bit earlier or later than expected—isn't going to make a great deal of difference for the real, Main Street economy.\n\nThe key liftoff decision criteria ought to be closely linked to the FOMC's two principal policy objectives—maximum employment and low and stable inflation. In my view, the biggest factor influencing the actual timing of a liftoff decision should be the Committee's confidence that these objectives will be achieved in an acceptable timeframe and, especially, that inflation will move at deliberate speed toward the target of 2 percent per annum.\n\nInflation readings and forecasts may be pivotal in deciding when to begin adjusting policy. As already explained, we are, at present, experiencing inflationary trends well below target, and our readings are complicated by more-than-normal noise associated with the drop in oil and gasoline prices, falling import prices, and softening of some measures of inflation expectations.\n\nIt's quite possible there will be considerable ambiguity in the picture presented by data in the first half of the year. Beyond the noise in inflation numbers, it's obvious there is simply a lot moving around at this time—oil prices, the dollar, even quarterly growth numbers, in all likelihood.\n\nNoisy, jumpy data affect my confidence in the outlook. I'm likely to decide what policy decision to support based on where I think things are headed. When the numbers come in noisy, it's just harder.\n\nIf the early months of this year bring mixed news on the economy, the risk manager in me will lean to preferring a later date for the first policy move to an earlier one. That said, after six years of recovery and considering all that that has both transpired and been accomplished, I don't think we policymakers should get too rigid about liftoff a little earlier or later. My preferred timing may not be the Committee's consensus decision.\n\nJust as I think it's appropriate to downplay the exact timing of liftoff, I think it's important to understand that a decision to raise rates will not constitute the throwing of a switch from easy money conditions to tight. The rate environment will remain stimulative, even as the policy rate gradually rises, as I expect. The pace of rate increases will not be preordained. The path of policy will depend on the ongoing performance of the economy.\n\nAt the recent meeting of the FOMC in December, the Committee made an adjustment of its forward guidance by introducing the theme of patience in beginning to normalize the stance of policy. I supported and expect to continue to support a patient approach, one that is relatively cautious and conservative as regards the pace of normalization of rates.\n\nConclusion \nNow let me offer a few closing thoughts. I hope you will take away from this talk a distinct sense of satisfaction and optimism regarding the recent and prospective performance of the American economy.\n\nThe financial crisis of 2007 and 2008, the deep recession that followed, and the sluggish recovery after that presented extraordinary challenges, and the response involved the use of extraordinary policy measures. I feel the Fed is coming nearer to the end of our job as defined by those extraordinary circumstances, and anticipation of the normalization of monetary policy—interest rate policy—is appropriate. In that sense, I look for a new phase of policy to commence in 2015.\n\nLeaders of the Federal Reserve—both Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen—have repeatedly emphasized that the Fed's monetary policy is not a panacea, not a cure-all for all the nation's economic challenges. In my opinion, many underlying fundamentals of the economy remain to be adequately addressed. When I use the word \"fundamentals,\" I have in mind concerns such as the long-term fiscal balance; the strength and prospects of the middle class; the skills, capacity, and health of the workforce; the quality of infrastructure; and funding and incentives for continuing innovation. Addressing these really big challenges is not the work of monetary policy, but monetary policy can be a facilitator and shape a supportive environment for other actors—in the public sector, the private sector, and civil society—to tackle the hard work of strengthening these fundamentals. There's still work to be done.\n\nI will end with that thought—a call to action for everyone in the room.",

            "content": "\n\nOne of my favorite movies is A Few Good Men starring Jack Nicholson and Tom Cruise. I've seen it five or six times. It's about the murder of a Marine private down at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base and the trial of two young Marines who thought they were roughing up a slacker under orders.\n\nAt bottom, it's about a narrative that does not hold up and hang together.\n\nThe Tom Cruise character, Lieutenant Daniel Kaffee, a Navy JAG officer who has been assigned to defend the two Marines, puts the Jack Nicholson character—Colonel Nathan Jessup—on the stand. Colonel Jessup is a hardened Marine commander of Gitmo. He can barely contain his resentment of the young Navy lawyer and his disgust at being called to testify.\n\nThe scene builds to a climax when Lieutenant Kaffee confronts Colonel Jessup:\n\nPrivate Santiago was begging for a transfer. But when he finally got it, how many people did he call? Not one call to his parents or a friend saying he was coming. He was asleep at midnight and you say he had a flight out in six hours. Yet everything he owned was in his closet or his foot locker. Santiago was leaving for the rest of his life and he hadn't called a soul or packed a thing. Can you explain that?\n\nToday I'm going to review with you another narrative and ask the questions: Is it holding up? Does it hang together? I'm going to present my narrative of the path of the country's economy. This is the basic narrative on which I'm basing my thinking on the appropriate timing of a decision by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to begin raising interest rates.\n\nConsidering that the Fed's policy rate has been set at effectively zero since December 2008, the decision, when it comes, will be historic. As you might expect, my colleagues and I feel a great responsibility to get it right.\n\nAs members of the development community, I know you are quite interested in when and how this decision will be made. I know your business interests are highly attuned to the evolving interest-rate environment, the capitalization rates associated with the cost of money, and general demand conditions in the economy.\n\nSince we are nearing year-end and will soon enter what could very well be a transitional year in terms of monetary policy, this is a good time to review the economic story line of 2014 as prologue to laying out the outlook for 2015.\n\nAs I do all this, please keep in mind that I'm presenting my personal views. My colleagues on the FOMC and in the Federal Reserve System may not agree.\n\nDevising a narrative\nBefore I get to a summary of 2014 and my outlook for 2015, let me explain how my staff at the Atlanta Fed and I do our work of economic forecasting and then fitting my policy positions to the state of the economy. We construct a narrative of the path of the economy and the risks, both downside and upside, to that narrative. We continuously assess the validity of our narrative in light of incoming data. If the data are, on balance, consistent with our basic narrative, we stick with it. But when enough evidence has accumulated to seriously challenge the key assumptions in our narrative, we change our assumptions and adjust our narrative.\n\nColonel Jessup: \"You want answers?\"\n\nLieutenant Kaffee: \"I think I'm entitled to them.\"\n\nColonel Jessup: \"You want answers?\"\n\nLieutenant Kaffee: \"I want the truth!\"\n\nColonel Jessup: \"You can't handle the truth!\"\n\nGreat scene!\n\nIn economics, absolute truth is elusive, but here's what I'm thinking. Here's my economic narrative: For about a year now, I've put forth the view that the economy has shifted to a higher growth gear compared to the sluggish pace of growth over the first four years of recovery from recession. From the summer of 2009, when the recovery began, to mid-year 2013, growth averaged 2.2 percent. It has been my belief that, starting mid-year 2013, the pace of growth accelerated to around 3 percent, and that this growth rate will be sustained at least through 2015.\n\nIf that story holds up, the economy should continue to make substantial progress in terms of the two statutory objectives that make up the FOMC's dual mandate. Those objectives are maximum employment and low and stable inflation.\n\nLet's take a closer look at how 2014 has unfolded. I should mention that given the lag in receiving data and the likelihood of revisions, it will be well into 2015 before we can close the book on 2014. But based on what we know now, full-year 2014 GDP growth should come in a little above 2 percent.\n\nOn the face of it, that number seems at odds with my 3 percent growth narrative. But when the tale of 2014 is told, I think it will be about one crazy, anomalous quarter and three quarters of solid growth.\n\nThe first quarter of this year actually saw contraction of the economy approaching 2 percent. You will remember that much of that weakness was explained by unusual weather. My staff and I believed at the time, and with benefit of perspective we still hold, that the weak first quarter was a one-off event, not indicative of a trend. The strength of GDP growth in the second and third quarters seems to vindicate this view. With more than 4 percent annualized GDP growth in the second quarter and 3.9 percent growth estimated for the third quarter, our narrative seems to have remained intact.\n\nWe are well into the fourth quarter now, of course, and we expect this quarter to show a slowing of growth compared to the third. Our most recent estimate points to 2.1 percent annualized growth in the fourth quarter. We are prepared to interpret this slower growth as normal and predictable quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, not the start of a more persistent slowdown. We think the growth rate in the second half will come in at about 3 percent, the run rate that anchors our basic narrative of the path of the economy.\n\nPolicy decisions are guided by the outlook for achievement of the two objectives in the FOMC's dual mandate. So employment conditions and measures of inflation and inflation expectations are vital signs we monitor closely. To date in 2014, there has been ample and broad-based evidence of steady improvement of employment conditions. I'm sure you are aware of Friday's jobs number—321,000 for November. Net payroll jobs have been added at a monthly rate averaging 241,000 over the past 11 months. The conventional measure of unemployment has fallen from 6.7 percent at the end of last year to 5.8 percent in its last calculation (November). I don't think we're yet able to claim ultimate employment victory, but there is no question that substantial progress has been achieved and momentum looks to be pretty solid. The employment vital signs are very encouraging.\n\nThe inflation picture is not as encouraging. In January 2012, the FOMC set an inflation target of 2 percent over the long run as measured by the overall index of personal consumption expenditures. For much of the past two-and-a-half years, inflation has been stuck well below that 2 percent target. We've seen little evidence of upward price pressures across the economy, and very few of our business contacts claim much pricing power. Behind this soft inflation picture lies a very modest pace of growth of consumer spending.\n\nI have to say that simultaneous readings of robust job creation accompanied by falling unemployment and weak inflation are somewhat puzzling. The story doesn't hang together perfectly. Normally, we would expect a 3 percent run rate of GDP growth—a rate that is above what we believe to be the longer-run trend rate of growth of the American economy—to be accompanied by both improving employment conditions and firming prices. But that is not what we're currently seeing.\n\nIt's possible we may be reading too much into measures of improvement in the labor market. Or we may be overestimating the underlying strength and momentum of the economy.\n\nColonel Jessup to Lieutenant Kaffee: \"Are we clear?\"\n\nLieutenant Kaffee: \"Yes, sir.\"\n\nColonel Jessup: \"Are we clear?\"\n\nLieutenant Kaffee: \"Crystal.\"\n\nThe data are not presenting a picture that is crystal clear. There's some ambiguity.\n\nOutlook and the normalization decision\nFor now, I'm prepared to treat the conundrum of strong job creation and soft price pressures as suggesting some risk around my baseline outlook for 2015. I'm holding to an outlook of continuing growth around 3 percent. I'm expecting payroll job creation to continue at a rate of more than 200,000 a month. I'm expecting broad measures of unemployment to continue lower. I'm expecting the rate of unemployment, using the familiar headline unemployment rate published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, to fall between 5 1/4 percent and 5 1/2 percent by the end of next year. And I'm expecting measures of inflation to firm up over the coming year.\n\nWage gains may be a telling signal that the economy remains on this basic course, a course that may justify raising interest rates. Broad-based rising labor compensation will tell us we're nearing effective full employment. And some amount of higher unit labor cost to employers should pass through to prices.\n\nIn the four years before the recession, measures of labor compensation growth were running between 3 1/2 and 4 percent. This was consistent with inflation tracking at close to 2 percent a year and labor productivity growth between 1 1/2 and 2 percent a year.\n\nFor much of the recovery—that is, since 2009—wage and compensation growth has been stuck at around 2 percent a year.\n\nBack to my comment that we may be reading too much into the falling unemployment rate—my staff and I think this soft wage pressure mostly reflects the still considerable amount of underutilized labor resources in the economy. Our empirical work suggests that some amount of downward pressure stunting wage growth is coming from the large supply of people willing to take part-time jobs when they want full-time jobs. We believe there is more slack in the labor market than indicated simply by the share of the labor force that is currently out of work.\n\nEven so, labor market conditions, as reflected in wages, are unquestionably strengthening. Some measures of wage growth have accelerated a bit recently. The Employment Cost Index grew at an annualized 3 percent in the third quarter. Average hourly wage growth showed encouraging strength in November. And the number of involuntary part-time workers continues to gradually decline.\n\nAmong the payoffs from fuller utilization of labor resources, accompanied by moderately higher growth of wages, should be a boost to aggregate spending. Growth of consumer spending is a key ingredient of my outlook of sustained GDP growth around 3 percent.\n\nRisks to the outlook\nI've presented what is, on balance, a positive outlook acknowledging real momentum going into 2015. But there are always risks.\n\nColonel Jessup: I eat breakfast 300 yards from 4,000 Cubans who are trained to kill me.\n\nIn our narrative building and validation, we identify risks, but we do not necessarily factor them into our baseline scenario.\n\nOne risk to our baseline scenario is weakness abroad—particularly in Europe and Japan. Japan is technically in recession, according to the latest estimate of its third quarter. Both Europe and Japan are fighting to ward off the threat of deflation. Also, China's economy appears to be slowing. In general, the external environment seems somewhat precarious, which raises concerns of spillover to our economy and financial markets.\n\nAs regards domestic risk to the outlook, I've already explained that the fourth quarter may prove to be slower than the third. I don't see this as signaling the onset of a slowdown. The momentum I perceive in the economy gives me confidence that the Federal Open Market Committee can consider beginning to normalize interest rates in 2015. My publicly stated projection of liftoff is mid-year or later.\n\nIt will be a Committee decision, of course. And the Committee has been clear that a decision to begin normalization will be data-dependent. It will depend on how the economy performs, how the numbers come in, and, importantly, on what the pattern of those numbers suggests as a continuing outlook.\n\nConcluding points\nIf I as a policymaker intend to stay true to data-dependency in making a decision to begin raising rates, I have to bear in mind what I will know and when I will know it in 2015.\n\nGiven the lag in receiving data, the inevitable revisions to the data, and the predictable month-to-month variability of the data, I think it will be a few months before we can be sure the essential trends are solid and the economy is ready for a momentous shift of policy.\n\nIt's natural for us policymakers, business leaders like you, and the public in general to be eager to get to policy normalization. Who does not want things to move closer to a long-run normal? But I think the FOMC must do its best to avoid having to reverse course because, as it could turn out, we moved too early.\n\nOther central banks have seen this happen. The European Central Bank and the central banks of Sweden, Norway, Australia, and Japan have raised rates only to lower them when their forecasts didn't materialize.\n\nThere would be real costs associated with an irresolute path of policy. Suffice it to say, reversing a start to interest-rate normalization, and subsequently having to go back to the quantitative easing well, would erode Fed credibility and confidence in the economy for the longer term.\n\nColonel Jessup to the judge: \"I don't know what the hell kind of unit you're running here.\"\n\nI'm sure my colleagues, especially Janet Yellen, would not like to hear something like that.\n\nLet me wrap up. The balance of current economic evidence is encouraging and supports an optimistic outlook. That said, knowing what I know today, I think patience regarding timing liftoff and a cautious bias regarding the subsequent pace of rate moves is a sensible approach to policy. I don't see the risks of a patient approach as excessive.\n\nI've presented here today a working narrative of the performance of the economy in recent and coming quarters. In its basics, it foresees sustained GDP growth at an annualized rate around 3 percent, continued absorption of underutilized labor resources, and gradual movement toward the 2 percent inflation objective. If it continues to hold up, and I think it will, 2015 looks to be a year of policy transition.\n\nColonel Jessup: \"You want me on that wall. You need me on that wall.\"\n\nI mean nothing by ending with that quote. I just love the quote.",

            "content": "Good morning. On behalf of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and its Community and Economic Development team, I'm pleased to add my welcome to the conference. Together with our partners—the Kansas City Fed and the John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce Development here at Rutgers University—we are presenting this conference to encourage innovative thinking about workforce development.\n\nYesterday afternoon, Harry Holzer of Georgetown University ably set the scene and described the demographic, technological, and social context of workforce policy. He made the case for major changes, and I understand his remarks were well received.\n\nThe agenda for the remainder of the conference is appropriately ambitious. There are sessions on various target worker cohorts: the long-term unemployed, disabled workers, young workers. There are sessions on getting the facts straight and knowing what works through data analysis. The panel moderated by Ambassador Murphy will look at what we might learn from institutions and initiatives in Europe. And there are big-picture sessions that will build on Professor Holzer's opening session addressing questions like how to adapt formal workforce development efforts to changing realities and evolving challenges. This is a rich menu. I expect everyone here will find something of value to take away.\n\nFor my part, over the next few minutes, I want to offer some thoughts on preparing workers to be and remain employable. I will make a distinction between training for immediate, near-term employment and training (and retraining) to improve an individual's prospects of lifelong employability. I will comment on trends that will shape the reality of employer needs and wants over the longer run.\n\nJack Welch, the former CEO of General Electric, is reported to have said that he could not—as head of GE—guarantee a current GE employee employment, but he felt he could guarantee employability, even if somewhere else. He meant, as I understand it, that the experience of working for GE ought to make a GE employee employable elsewhere. Implicit in his statement was a sense of responsibility on the part of large employers to play a real role in fostering the employability of people in the workplace.\n\nAs I see it, the workforce development community, for its part, divides its attention between two areas of focus. One is what you might call remedial efforts to help the hard-to-employ or those looking for a second chance after losing a job. The other area of focus is strategic workforce development, with the ultimate aim of sustained economic development of a metro area, a state, or the country. In my remarks this morning, I will address the second of these—strategic workforce development including interventions to enhance employability.\n\nObviously this is a big subject. To make it manageable in the time I have, I'll reflect on three topics. They are: prerequisites for employability (sometimes called \"soft skills\"), \"hard skills\" (or harder skills) for the long run, and changing employer-employee work arrangements.\n\nDeveloping soft skills early\n To introduce the topic of soft skills, let me explain that the Federal Reserve is required by statute to set monetary policy with two objectives in mind—low inflation and maximum employment. This is the Fed's so-called \"dual mandate.\" To evaluate employment conditions, my Reserve Bank conducts frequent and systematic interviews of employers during the period between meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee, the entity that sets monetary policy. We ask businesses and other major employers about their hiring plans, their recruiting challenges, their willingness to spend on training, and their current wage policy.\n\nThroughout the economic recovery, we have heard a great deal about a perceived soft skills deficit on the part of job applicants. This is anecdotal input from contacts, not empirically grounded hard data. We take care not to interpret anecdote as fact. I will say, however, that the frequency of such comments coming from a wide spectrum of contacts makes me wonder if there isn't something real there. I'm asking myself if our feedback from employers calls for a structured effort to determine the extent of the problem and devise purposeful responses.\n\nAccording to many of these employers, their initial screening methods focus mostly on an applicant's readiness for employment. They look for prerequisite skills or individual attributes. Among the questions these employers try to answer are:\n\nJudging from the number of mentions, this last question concerns itself with a very real hurdle to employability in certain vocations.\n\nFormal efforts to engage prospective workers along these softer dimensions of attitudes, workplace conduct, and personal habits are most effective if started early in a working career or even before. Successful programs like \"Year Up\" are addressing these concerns head on by working with young adults in eight metro areas nationwide to develop professional demeanor and personal presentation skills. Year Up backs this up with stipends, internships, and college credits—all to put the individual on the path to economic self-sufficiency.\n\nA second example is the STRIVE model. The STRIVE approach, a national program that started in Cincinnati, helps communities build a local education ecosystem with sustainable civic infrastructure. The idea is to create a cradle-to-career approach to development. In Atlanta, we've seen the STRIVE model in action in an organization called New Hope Enterprises. This group has been effective in raising soft skills as well as improving neighborhood life. Successful programs like \"12 for Life\" blend work education with content designed to raise students' commitment to, and even passion for, work. Mike Wiggins, a founder of Southwire's 12 for Life program, spoke yesterday evening, I believe.\n\nI really think we need more work in the soft skills area, including development of effective training for adult workers. Complaints about soft skills are just too prevalent to dismiss entirely.\n\nFor many members of the workforce—especially, but not exclusively, the hard-to-employ—the prerequisites I've noted are just that. They are first tests of employability in advance of consideration of actual job qualifications.\n\nFostering hard skills for the \"second machine age\"\n Let me shift the focus now to so-called hard skills and trends affecting employer needs.\n\nA recent McKinsey article entitled \"The Great Decoupling\" starts with the statement, \"As machine learning advances at exponential rates, many highly skilled jobs once considered the exclusive domain of humans are increasingly being carried out by computers.\" The same article quotes from a recent book by Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee called The Second Machine Age.\n\nThat's a useful phrase, so I'll borrow it. We can quibble about the meaning of highly skilled, middle skilled, and low skilled, but I'll argue that the second machine age has seen the automation of many middle-skill jobs. It has contributed to the phenomenon of job polarization and middle-class income stagnation. Job polarization refers to the decline of mid-level positions relative to higher-level and lower-skilled jobs.\n\nIn work last year on job polarization, my staff cited a very useful framework for categorizing work that was developed by David Autor and David Dorn. Think of four quadrants involving the interplay of brain work and the nature of discrete tasks in a job. The four categories are routine/noncognitive, routine/cognitive, nonroutine/cognitive and nonroutine/noncognitive. Machine and computer substitution is bearing down on both the routine/noncognitive and routine/cognitive categories. Nonroutine/cognitive jobs are the high-skill positions requiring advanced education, critical and analytical thinking, sophisticated communication, and complex problem solving. As the second machine age accelerates, only the lowest-skill, noncognitive, nonroutine kinds of work will be immune from attempts at automation, in my opinion.\n\nTwenty years ago, I attended a seminar featuring the great Peter Drucker. In the course of the conference, one of the presenters asked rhetorically, \"Is there anything you would not buy online?\" Participants mentioned a number of goods and services that are now routinely purchased online. Fast forward to today. It's worth asking, \"Is there any work machines cannot do?\" I predict that many of the tasks running through your minds at this moment will be automated in some form 20 years from now. Indeed, I would argue that even today, we're seeing machine operators of all kinds becoming machine tenders who monitor digital interface devices and intervene only if something goes wrong. As a prominent bank economist put it in a recent newsletter, \"Manufacturing jobs are far less blue-collar today and more business casual.\" And who has not noticed changes in supermarkets and other retailers where one employee monitors the sales of four to six checkout stations?\n\nWe are seeing a wide range of relatively low- and middle-skill vocations under siege. As examples, I would point to production-line manufacturing positions, waiters, retail checkout clerks, hotel check-in personnel, and customer service staff. Maybe, before long, the list will include drivers.\n\nThe process of substitution will likely be gradual, but I find it hard to believe the trend will reverse. If you accept as reality the persistence and growth of automation, robotics, production algorithms, and digitization in general, I don't think it's difficult to imagine what jobs will increasingly require as hard skills and consequently what strategic workforce development will entail.\n\nHere are some thoughts: Most workers will deal with a digital interface device of some kind. Familiarity with technology and the literacy and numeracy skills to operate such a device will be essential.\n\nIn a world where much that is routine and repeatable is done by machine, human work will call for problem analysis and troubleshooting, critical thinking where judgment and discretion are required, and fine, customized work involving customer or colleague interaction and communication. Making emotional connections is human work.\n\nWorkers will need lifelong learning skills to adapt to changing job requirements dictated by the pace of substitution of technology for what they used to do.\n\nChanging work arrangements between employers and workers\n Just as job-specific requirements will be fluid over time, employer-employee work arrangements have their own fluid character. A number of current trends in the field of workforce management seem to have momentum.\n\nWorkforce management practices include the use of temporary staff as a permanent and flexible workforce component, the use of contractors (I've heard them called \"1099 employees\") for project work or as a semipermanent workforce, and the structuring of job positions as part-time.\n\nAt the Atlanta Fed, we've done some research on the part-time phenomenon. I'll share some of our findings.\n\nFirst, the share of employed people working fewer than 35 hours a week rose sharply during the Great Recession. That fact in itself is not surprising. Employers will often respond to a drop-off in demand by cutting hours of employees to avoid layoffs. However, the part-time share of employment has been slow to decline since the recession ended. Typically, hours are restored in a recovery, but this has not so much been the case in this recovery. Involuntary part-time employment seems to have become, to some extent, a structural thing. Part-time positions are prevalent in certain industries such as food service, hospitality, and construction, but our research finds that use of part-timers has become quite widespread.\n\nTo understand whether the shift to part-time jobs is structural in nature, we conducted a survey of 340 businesses in the Southeast, of which 86 currently have a higher share of part-time workers than before the recession. We found that two reasons were most commonly cited for elevated use of part-time employees. One was weak sales. This would suggest a cyclical driver. The other explanation was the perceived higher all-in compensation cost—even when adjusted for hours—of full-time versus part-time workers. We've concluded that there will likely be some falloff in use of part-time personnel as the economy strengthens further, but probably not to prerecession levels. In other words, preference for part-time workers is likely to persist. For Fed policy purposes, the balance of evidence suggests the labor market is still far from normal, even if normal is not what it used to be.\n\nWhat might be the implications of the growth of part-time employment? Clearly, employers are seeking staffing agility. Employers want to stay nimble to adjust quickly to a fall-off of business. They increasingly want the flexibility afforded by a mix of employment arrangements with varying degrees of commitment to classes of employee. Impermanent part-time workers are least likely to receive significant employer-sponsored training. The training burden is likely to fall outside employers. The workforce development community is going to have to come to grips with this new reality.\n\nConclusion\n To close, I'll summarize: What I've called \"strategic workforce development\" for long-term employability must anticipate, to paraphrase the great Wayne Gretsky, where the puck is going. In my view, the employability of young people and adults who are deficient in soft skills will go nowhere but down. The job-specific requirements in most industries and vocations will evolve rapidly and become more digitally demanding, if you will, in the second machine age. Widening automation and digitization will reduce routine job tasks, both cognitive and noncognitive. To be and remain employable, workers will trade on what cannot be programmed. And work arrangements with employers may be structured to provide those employers more tactical flexibility in their workforce management.\n\nThis is what I imagine going forward. It's our view at the Atlanta Fed that to be responsive to this future, the workforce development system needs to operate with greater coherence, cohesion, and coordination if it is to remain relevant. Through our Community and Economic Development program, we're working to help workforce training providers, educators, and employers become better aligned. To this end, we've catalyzed a program called the Metro Atlanta Exchange for Workforce Solutions (or MAX). This effort brings together more than 25 entities as partners to think and act in a more coordinated and streamlined fashion. This initiative will be officially launched in December. It's our hope it will help prepare the region's workforce development stakeholders for the reality of a 21st century economy.\n\nThank you for your attention this morning. And thank you for attending this important conference.",

            "content": "Thank you for honoring me with the invitation to be your keynote speaker today. As you may know, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta shares your goal to increase economic and financial literacy among our citizens. In fact, our New Orleans Branch staff has worked closely with the Mississippi Council on Economic Education for the past decade. Together, they produce \"Focus on the Economy,\" an annual conference that attracts teachers from throughout Mississippi for sessions about the Fed, the economy, personal finance, and related topics. I am pleased to continue that tradition of partnership here this afternoon.\n\nToday I want to share my views on current and prospective monetary policy with a medium-term horizon. I'll start by describing the context in which the most recent decisions on monetary policy were made. I will round out my remarks with commentary on five front-and-center questions. They are questions my colleagues and I are having to engage as we shape monetary policy and public expectations.\n\nI must emphasize that the views you'll hear are my personal views. I am not speaking for the Federal Reserve or the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC). There is a healthy spread of opinion on the FOMC. I can assure you I have colleagues in the Federal Reserve System who will not entirely agree with my views.\n\nBefore laying out the five questions, let me provide some background.\n\nFOMC decisions change little\nLast week, I participated in a two-day meeting of the FOMC. The Committee's decisions involved very little change. The policy interest rate—the target range for the federal funds rate—was kept at zero to 25 basis points. This decision continues the policy of keeping the bellwether Fed policy rate effectively as low as it can go. The policy of a rock-bottom policy rate has been in effect since the fourth quarter of 2008.\n\nThe statement that followed the meeting was updated in small ways from the July statement but conveyed little change in the outlook for the economy and the outlook for policy. Importantly, there was no substantive change in our forward guidance about how long the policy rate will be held at an effective rate of zero. The Committee reiterated the view that \"liftoff\" (the timing of the first move to raise rates) will likely occur a \"considerable time\" after the end of asset purchases (or QE, short for \"quantitative easing\") in October. The end of QE next month is now virtually certain. The statement also repeated the expectation of the Committee that once liftoff occurs, rates will rise at a gradual pace.\n\nI supported the Committee's decision to stay the course in both substance and language. For my part, I continue to expect conditions for liftoff to ripen by the middle of 2015 or a bit later.\n\nThere are two more FOMC meetings this year and eight next year. As each meeting approaches, speculation will intensify that the Committee will signal in some way when the tightening cycle will begin. The timing isn't foreordained. The performance of the economy in the coming quarters should and will dictate the timing of liftoff. This conditionality has been expressed by stressing that the decision will be data-dependent. The phrase \"data-dependent\" is a kind of shorthand, as I see it. It's shorthand for a process of assessing, based on the best and most recent evidence we have, whether the economy is on the track we assume it's on. The data should tell us whether the outlook has worsened materially and give some hint as to whether downside risks around the outlook have intensified.\n\nLet me lay out in broad strokes my sense of the outlook. I expect GDP (gross domestic product) to grow at an average annual rate of 3 percent this quarter and next and through next year. Inflation, by most measures, is running below the FOMC's longer-run target of 2 percent. I expect inflation to firm up gradually as the economy continues on a 3 percent growth track. And I expect unemployment and underemployment to continue to decline at a steady pace. I think the country will approach a condition near full employment by late 2016 or early 2017. I'll ask you to keep this forecast in mind as I walk you through five questions confronting policymakers.\n\nQuestion 1: Is the 3 percent growth story holding up?\nYes, it appears so. The first half of the year 2014 had some wild swings from contraction in the first quarter to growth over 4 percent in the second. The second quarter had nonrecurring elements of a rebound from the drop-off in the first quarter. At this date, we have only tracking estimates for the third quarter. Tracking estimates gauge apparent growth in real time and make adjustments with each incoming piece of data. Most tracking estimates for the third quarter—including our own at the Atlanta Fed—gauge growth this quarter at around 3 percent.\n\nThe recent run of data has been encouraging in many respects. Manufacturing data have shown improvement. The services sector has also seen improving activity. Consumer and business confidence indicators are rising.\n\nHowever, consumer activity per se has been growing only at a tepid pace, especially if you exclude auto sales. To be confident in an outlook of 3 percent or greater growth, we need to see consistency in consumer spending. The housing sector also raises some concern, and the recent appreciation of the dollar may dampen export activity in coming months.\n\nIn some respects, I view GDP growth as a means to an end. A chief end is full employment. The question is whether the pace of growth is enough to sustain progress in reducing underutilization of labor resources in the economy. Will we get enough growth to continue to shrink labor market slack? That sets up the second question.\n\nQuestion 2: How much labor market slack remains?\nFederal Reserve policy makers face the question of how much labor market slack remains. In its post-meeting communication last week, the Committee repeated the claim that significant underutilization of labor resources persists. I agree with this view.\n\nAs you no doubt have heard or read, the recent national monthly payroll jobs report for August was disappointing relative to the average rate of jobs growth for the prior seven months. At the same time, the official unemployment rate—which stands at 6.1 percent—has been stuck around that level for a few months. I wouldn't read too much into short-term movements in the data. I think steady progress is still the right characterization of employment markets.\n\nNo one measure of employment conditions tells the full story, in my view. I pay attention to a wide variety of indicators. In computing the unemployment rate, for example, if you worked an hour for pay in the last month, you're employed. A broader measure treats some part-time workers—namely those working part-time involuntarily—as not fully employed.\n\nThe same broader measure includes the so-called marginally attached in the workforce and in the ranks of unemployed. Marginally attached workers are available for work but, for whatever reasons, have not looked for work in the last month. It's worrisome that the proportion of prime-working age men has grown among the marginally attached.\n\nThe current level of headline unemployment is still some distance from my notion of full employment. And the gap between headline unemployment and broader measures suggests there is more work to do before we should be satisfied with employment conditions in the country.\n\nQuestion 3: What is the risk of inflation?\nOne way to assess the extent of labor slack is by observing wage pressures. Wage growth for the most part has been quite slow. We are not yet seeing much indication of broad-based wage or compensation pressure. Rising wages can be viewed as a link between employment conditions and broad price pressures, or inflation. Inflation is always a central banker's concern. I frequently hear a question about what inflation risk might be associated with keeping interest rates so low for longer. That's question three.\n\nAs I said earlier, inflation is running below the 2 percent target the FOMC established in January of 2012. Inflation ran considerably below target for most of 2013 and early in this year. We saw some encouraging firming of prices in the spring, but recently measures of inflation have backed up a little. Separating short-term and transient effects from the underlying trend is always challenging. In its fundamentals, inflation is reflecting what are still, in my view, lukewarm demand conditions. I expect the inflation rate to rise only gradually to a sustainable 2 percent.\n\nThere are two legitimate inflation worries. One is persistent undershooting, with all this would imply for the strength of economic activity. The other is an overshoot that gets out of hand. At this juncture, I'm more concerned about a persistent undershoot. I am relatively sanguine about the risk of a strong and undesired upside surge in inflation. Inflation expectations, which are very influential in shaping real outcomes, continue to be firmly anchored. Also, in talking to business contacts, I hear almost no claims of pricing power.\n\nQuestion 4: What about financial stability?\nAnother important question about the risk associated with keeping rates so low for longer is this: What risk of financial system instability might the Fed be feeding? Are we inviting another financial crisis?\n\nIt's clear that U.S. equity market indexes are hitting historic highs. It's clear that buoyant bond markets are pricing in some continuation of ultra-low interest rate policy. And it's clear that investors have been searching for yield for quite some time.\n\nAs a policymaker, I have to think about two scenarios. The first is that bond markets are somehow surprised in the coming months and that the transition to a period of tightening is disruptively and destructively volatile. Last year's so-called \"taper tantrum\" in the bond markets is something to avoid. The second scenario would resemble the recent financial crisis, not perhaps in its particulars, but in the sense that it was a systemic event.\n\nTo my mind, the key filter in assessing risk levels in this regard is the word \"systemic.\" I am comfortable that being patient regarding liftoff until the middle of next year or perhaps a little later will not bring on a systemic financial event. I take comfort in the much-strengthened defenses of the banking system, financial institutions in general, and financial regulators. I take comfort in the enhanced capital levels of the most systemically important institutions. I think defenses are dramatically improved, and the resilience of the financial system is measurably stronger than in 2007.\n\nQuestion 5: What about geopolitical risks?\nMy fifth and final question relates to the global context. With developments in the Middle East, tensions between the West and Russia over Ukraine, quite soft economic conditions in Europe, and challenges associated with a transitioning economy in China, it's fair to ask: how does a policymaker factor geopolitical risks into policy thinking?\n\nAll these developments and others are monitored carefully, I can assure you. All these sources of potential geopolitical or global economic risk have been in our consciousness for a while.\n\nIn my assessment, this concern is appropriately about an escalation of trouble that comes on suddenly and with great force. Such a shock could spill over through financial or commodity markets to the broad economy. It would be foolish to dismiss this risk entirely, but our financial markets seem to reflect a view that the U.S. real economy enjoys some insulation from severe spillover risk. I think that's a realistic assessment.\n\nConclusion\nI'll close with this thought: there are always risks around a projection of any path forward. There is always considerable uncertainty. Given what I see today, I'm pretty confident in a medium-term outlook of continued moderate growth around 3 percent per annum accompanied by a substantial closing of the employment and inflation gaps. In general, I'm more confident today than a year ago. I see the balance of risk around this outlook as reasonably balanced. No one has a perfect crystal ball, but I am rather confident that we'll get to economic conditions between mid- and late next year that would justify initiating a period of normalization of the interest rate environment.",

            "highlights": "Atlanta Fed President and CEO Dennis Lockhart, speaking at the Sixth Annual Rocky Mountain Economic Summit on July 11, discusses the timing of liftoff, or the raising of the federal funds rate.",
            "content": "I plan to focus my prepared remarks before the conversation with John Silvia and my colleague, Charlie Evans, on the question that is increasingly commanding the attention of Fed watchers, financial markets, and Fed policymakers. In its most succinct form that question is, \"When is liftoff?\" I will share how I, as one policymaker, am approaching that policy question.\n\nAs always, I must emphasize that I'm presenting my individual views. My colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and in the Federal Reserve System may not see things the same way.\n\nCurrent stance of policy\nA useful place to start, I think, is a quick review of the current stance of monetary policy here at the beginning of the third quarter.\n\nCompletion of the tapering of asset purchases—which began last December—is now virtually a foregone conclusion. The minutes of the June FOMC meeting indicate the asset purchase program will end in October, leaving just ongoing reinvestment of maturing securities.\n\nThe majority of FOMC participants through their individual quarterly projections have indicated that the first move to raise short-term interest rates will likely come in 2015 or 2016. Opinions vary among FOMC participants on whether the first policy action ought to come earlier or later. Chair Yellen—speaking for the Committee, in my view—has emphasized that the timing of the decision will depend on the evolution of the economy over coming quarters and will, therefore, be substantially data-driven.\n\nFinally, the Committee has stated that once a tightening process begins, it is likely to proceed at a gradual pace.\n\nThat's where policy stands at the moment.\n\nSo the question Charlie Evans and I are confronted with as policymakers is under what circumstances will it be appropriate to start raising the policy rate (the federal funds rate)?\n\nA framework for contemplating liftoff\nLet me lay out my current framework for thinking about that question.\n\nFirst, I tie a liftoff decision to achievement of the FOMC's two monetary policy objectives—price stability and maximum employment. This is not to say the Committee must or should wait until those objectives have been fully and unarguably achieved. Rather, I think we will be in the zone of liftoff decision making when the outlook for accomplishment of the two objectives suggests they are in sight. By \"in sight\" I mean that given the trajectory of the economy, they are highly likely to be achieved in a reasonable timeframe. You might call this a \"whites of their eyes\" approach to pulling the trigger on raising rates.\n\nDetermining that the economy is near achieving price stability and full employment is not entirely straightforward. I'll explain why.\n\nThe FOMC has defined price stability as a 2 percent rate of inflation over the long run as gauged by the overall (or headline) price index of personal consumption expenditures (PCE).\n\nI define price stability operationally to be, therefore, at or near 2 percent on a sustained basis. Speaking for myself, I can tolerate some deviation above or below the 2 percent target providing inflation does not drift too far away from target for too long.\n\nReading the true course of inflation can be challenging because of normal month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in the data as well as occasional shocks that cause episodes of transient changes in the numbers.\n\nInflation has been running below 2 percent for quite a while, a fact that has not gone unnoticed by the FOMC in devising its policy stance. Very recently the PCE inflation numbers have been firming along with other measures of price trends. Over the first five months of the year, the year-over-year inflation rate according to the PCE index rose from 1.2 percent to 1.8 percent. The three-month inflation rate, which is presented as an annualized rate, of course, rose from 1.4 percent in January to 2.5 percent in May.\n\nThe higher recent inflation numbers are welcome, in my view, and I do not see this development as cause for alarm. At the same time, I don't feel enough evidence has arrived to be sure price stability is here or near. Inflation does not typically come forth in isolation. We should be seeing other indicators of the absorption of economic slack. We should see accompanying wage growth especially. So far, such affirmation of the sustainability of recent firming has been meager. The recent firming of price data removes some downside risk, in my opinion. But a test of time hasn't been met.\n\nIt's a challenge also to arrive at an agreed-on definition of maximum employment.\n\nThe conventional approach is to define maximum employment in terms of the Bureau of Labor Statistics' official unemployment rate (U-3 on their scale). Today, U-3 is at 6.1 percent. My working estimate for full employment on this basis is, say, 5 1/4 percent.\n\nBut a number of troubling employment phenomena have been at work that make me less confident in the exclusive use of the unemployment rate. Two such phenomena are the drop in prime-age participation in the labor force and the rise during the recession and subsequent slow reduction over the course of the recovery of people working part-time for economic reasons (PTER).\n\nIn current circumstances, a single measure of employment or unemployment does not provide a complete enough picture of what I care about in labor markets. I care about the full utilization, both quantitatively and qualitatively, of available labor resources.\n\nMy assessment is that the gap to be closed on the employment objective is bigger than estimated by a simple comparison of today's U-3 unemployment rate and a projection of the equivalent unemployment rate at full employment.\n\nThat said, the report that came out on July 3 was certainly encouraging. As you know, the payroll survey showed the addition of 288,000 jobs and the unemployment rate fell to 6.1 percent. The trends and momentum are undeniably positive. We've seen four months in a row of quite healthy jobs reports, suggesting more is going on than just a rebound from the weather-affected first quarter. My caution in declaring that I see the whites of full employment's eyes is closely linked to the still-elevated level of involuntary part-time employment. That measure of labor utilization has been stubborn when compared to the decline of headline unemployment. The number of people working part-time for economic reasons increased in June. This series has been declining over the year, but over the last few months, it has toggled back and forth.\n\nAlso, as mentioned earlier, we have been seeing very little upward wage pressure, and this tells me there remains considerable actual slack in employment markets. I want to emphasize the important role of wage pressures as evidence that the employment gap is in fact closing and, for that matter, that the inflation numbers are for real. Slow wage growth seems to be connected to the PTER story. Studies have identified an empirical connection between slow wage growth and the elevated level of part-time employment.\n\nTo cut to my bottom line, the FOMC is still somewhat short of the point where achievement of the two objectives is confidently \"in sight,\" in my opinion.\n\nImportantly, the two objectives remain complementary. The same basic policy posture can promote accomplishment of both objectives, in my view. At the moment, there is little or no tradeoff between the two objectives. That could change, but that's how I see the situation for the foreseeable future.\n\nRisk considerations\nThere is another aspect of my framework for thinking about the circumstances that should accompany a decision to begin raising rates. I am also considering the risk picture.\n\nSpecifically, there are two risk concerns on my screen.\n\nFirst, given that the Committee is seeking to approach a 2 percent run rate of inflation from below, I think we have to contemplate the risk of a prolonged overshoot of 2 percent.\n\nI don't believe the recent broad-based uptick of inflation measures necessarily portends that inflation is going to get out of hand. Inflation expectations remain well-anchored. There is no sign that price makers, or the general public, anticipate a break with the experience of price stability the country has enjoyed for more than two decades.\n\nI am also monitoring the risk situation as regards financial system stability. With equity indexes at or near historic highs, financial market volatility very low, and evidence of \"reach for yield\" behavior, concern about financial system and market instability has been building. In the thinking of some observers, the potential for a rash of damaging financial system instability can be associated with a continued low-rate environment.\n\nAgain, while remaining watchful, I'm not overly concerned that financial market conditions today map to systemic risk concerns with high potential for spillover to the real economy, the Main Street economy, if you will. My emphasis on \"systemic\" and \"spillover\" is intentional. I see a difference between some degree of fragility in financial markets due to investors widely carrying \"risk-on\" positions and the realistic chances of a broad, systemic meltdown that engulfs the broad economy. I think the latter should be the Fed's and FOMC's greater concern.\n\nConclusion\nA policy position always involves a tradeoff of real or potential costs versus benefits. In my view, the potential and achievable benefits of sustaining very accommodative monetary stimulus, based on a policy rate in its current range of 0 to 25 basis points, beyond year-end 2014 and into next year continue to outweigh the possible costs.\n\nMy outlook for the economy in the coming quarters underpins my judgment on the cost/benefit tradeoff of current policy. The key element of my outlook is a run rate of GDP growth at or better than 3 percent through the next several quarters. I am focusing on the run rate as opposed to a projected full-year 2014 GDP growth rate because the weak first quarter will push down the full-year arithmetic. I think the run rate from the second quarter onward is more relevant to policy decisions ahead. On balance, recent data have supported a 3 percent GDP growth run rate assumption.\n\nI am still prepared to believe that the first-quarter contraction was an anomaly attributable substantially to weather, an inventory adjustment, health care spending, and exports. However, if there were temporary or unusual factors at work depressing the first quarter, then it is reasonable to expect that the lifting of those factors provided a bump in the numbers in the second quarter that may also have been transitory.\n\nThere is quite a divergence between what we thought was happening in the first quarter based on tracking estimates, for example, during the quarter and the ultimate verdict on first-quarter growth (contraction). Tracking the economy in real time is very hard. The Bureau of Economic Analysis first told us first-quarter growth was 0.1 percent. This first estimate of first-quarter growth was almost three percentage points off their most recent and final reading. My point is it will likely be hard to confirm a shift to a persistent above-trend pace of GDP growth even if the second-quarter numbers look relatively good.\n\nThis experience suggests to me that we can misread the vital signs of the economy in real time. Notwithstanding the mostly positive and encouraging character of recent data, we policymakers need to be circumspect when tempted to drop the gavel and declare the case closed. In the current situation, I feel it's advisable to accrue evidence and gain perspective. It will take some time to validate an outlook that assumes above-trend growth and associated solid gains in employment and price stability. I'm sticking to the view that conditions that would justify a liftoff decision will arrive in the second half of next year.",

            "highlights": "Atlanta Fed Vice President and Senior Economist Mike Bryan discusses using consumer price data to produce alternative measures of inflation in a presentation May 30, 2014, at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland's conference on Inflation, Monetary Policy, and the Public.",
            "content": "Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nRemarks at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland's conference on Inflation, Monetary Policy, and the Public\nMay 30, 2014\n\nWith the time afforded me this morning, I'd like to describe some of the ways I and others have tortured Commissioner Groshen's consumer price data to produce alternative measures of the inflation experience. This is not to say that I think the Bureau of Labor Statistics has somehow gotten it wrong. I don't believe that. I think the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is an exceptionally well-designed statistic for its intended purpose. It's just that I don't believe its purpose is, or was ever intended to be, the measurement of the inflation that a central bank controls.\n\nPlease keep in mind that these are my personal views. They don't necessarily reflect the views of my colleagues at the Atlanta Fed and in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe median CPI and other trimmed-mean estimators\nA useful place to begin this conversation, I think, is with the following chart, which shows the monthly, annualized change in the CPI. The chart shows two versions: The first is the seasonally adjusted CPI, which is what the media most commonly reports on. The second is the nonseasonally adjusted CPI, which is what the price statistic looks like before the BLS filters out the movements in the component price data that appear to be regular, or \"seasonal,\" in occurrence.\n\n(enlarge)\n\nSeasonal adjustment reduces the monthly volatility in the CPI by about 40 percent—but it is still an exceptionally volatile statistic. The monthly CPI often swings between a negative reading and a reading in excess of 5 percent. In fact, in only about one-third of the readings over the past 16 years was the monthly seasonally adjusted CPI within a percentage point of 2 percent—the FOMC's longer-term inflation target. (Officially, the FOMC's target is based on the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, but these and related observations hold for that price index equally well.)\n\nHow should the central bank think about its price-stability mandate within the context of these large monthly CPI fluctuations? For example, does April's 3.2 percent CPI increase argue that the FOMC ought to do something to beat back the inflationary threat? I don't speak for the FOMC, but I doubt it. More likely, there were some unusual price movements within the CPI's market basket that can explain why the April CPI increase isn't likely to persist. But disentangling which price movements we should pay attention to from those we should ignore is a risky business.\n\nThe Economist retells a conversation with Stephen Roach, who in the 1970s worked for the Federal Reserve under Chairman Arthur Burns. Roach remembers that when oil prices surged around 1973, Burns asked Federal Reserve Board economists to strip those prices out of the CPI \"to get a less distorted measure. When food prices then rose sharply, they stripped those out too—followed by used cars, children's toys, jewellery, housing and so on, until around half of the CPI basket was excluded because it was supposedly 'distorted'\" by forces outside the control of the central bank. The story goes on to say that, at least in part because of these actions, the Fed failed to spot the breadth of the inflationary threat of the 1970s.\n\nI have a similar story. I remember a morning in 1991 at a meeting of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland's board of directors. I was welcomed to the lectern with, \"Now it's time to see what Mike is going to throw out of the CPI this month.\" It was an uncomfortable moment for me and it had a lasting influence. It was my motivation for constructing the Cleveland Fed's median CPI.\n\nI am a reasonably skilled reader of a monthly CPI release. And since I approached each monthly report with a pretty clear idea of what the actual rate of inflation was, it was always pretty easy for me to look across the items in the CPI market basket and identify any offending—or \"distorted\"—price change. Stripping these items from the price statistic revealed truth—and confirmed that I was right all along about the actual rate of inflation.\n\nLet me show you what I mean by way of the April CPI report. The next chart shows the annualized percentage change for each component in the April CPI. These are shown on the horizontal axis. The vertical axis shows the weight given to each of these price changes in the computation of the overall CPI. Taken as a whole, the CPI jumped 3.2 percent. But out there on the far right tail of this distribution are gasoline prices. They rose about 32 percent last month. If you subtract out gasoline from the April CPI report, you get an increase of 2.1 percent. That's reasonably close to price stability—we can stop there, mission accomplished.\n\n(enlarge)\n\nBut here's the thing: there is no such thing as a \"nondistorted\" price. All prices are being influenced by market forces and, once influenced, are also influencing the prices of all the other goods in the market basket.\n\nWhat else is out there on the tails of the CPI price-change distribution? Lots of stuff. About 17 percent of things people buy actually declined in price in April while prices for about 13 percent of the market basket increased at rates above 5 percent.\n\nBut it's not just the tails of this distribution that are worth thinking about. Near the center of this price-change distribution is a very high proportion of things people buy. For example, price changes within the fairly narrow range of 1.5 percent to 2.5 percent accounted for about 26 percent of the overall CPI market basket in April.\n\nThe April CPI report is hardly unusual. The CPI report is commonly one where we see a very wide range of price changes, commingled with an unusually large share of price increases that are very near the center of the price-change distribution. Statisticians call this a distribution with a high level of \"excess kurtosis.\"\n\nThe following chart shows what an average monthly CPI price report looks like. The point of this chart is to convince you that the unusual distribution of price changes we saw in the April CPI report is standard fare. A very high proportion of price changes within the CPI market basket tends to remain close to the center of the distribution, and those price changes that do not tend to be spread over a very wide range, resulting in what appear to be very elongated tails.\n\n(enlarge)\n\nAnd this characterization of price changes is not at all special to the CPI. It characterizes every major price aggregate I have ever examined, including the retail price data for Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Columbia, South Africa, Israel, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Canada, New Zealand, Germany, Japan, and Australia.\n\nWhy do price-change distributions have peaked centers and very elongated tails? At one time, Steve Cecchetti and I speculated that the cost associated with unplanned price changes—called menu costs—discourage all but the most significant price adjustments. These menu costs could create a distribution of observed price changes where a large number of planned price adjustments occupy the center of the distribution, commingled with extreme, unplanned price adjustments that stretch out along its tails.\n\nBut absent a clear economic rationale for this unusual distribution, it presents a measurement problem and an immediate remedy. The problem is that these long tails will tend to cause the CPI (and other weighted averages of prices) to fluctuate pretty widely from month to month, but they are, in a statistical sense, tethered to that large proportion of price changes that lie in the center of the distribution.1\n\nSo my belated response to the Cleveland board of directors was the computation of the weighted median CPI that I produced with Chris Pike. This statistic considers only the middle-most monthly price change in the CPI market basket, which becomes the representative aggregate price change. The median CPI is immune to the analyst bias that I had been guilty of, while greatly reducing the volatility in the monthly CPI report in a way that I thought gave the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland a clearer read of the central tendency of price changes.\n\nCecchetti and I pushed the idea to a range of trimmed-mean estimators, for which the median is simply an extreme case. Trimmed-mean estimators trim some proportion of the tails from this price-change distribution and reaggregate the interior remainder. Others extended this idea to asymmetric trims for skewed price-change distributions, as Scott Roger did for New Zealand, and to other price statistics, like the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas's trimmed-mean PCE inflation rate.\n\nHow much one should trim from the tails isn't entirely obvious. We settled on the 16 percent trimmed mean for the CPI (that is, trimming the highest and lowest 8 percent from the tails of the CPI's price-change distribution) because this is the proportion that produced the smallest monthly volatility in the statistic while preserving the same trend as the all-items CPI.\n\nThe following chart shows the monthly pattern of the median CPI and the 16 percent trimmed-mean CPI relative to the all-items CPI. Both measures reduce the monthly volatility of the aggregate price measure by a lot—and even more so than simply subtracting from the index the often-offending food and energy items.\n\n(enlarge)\n\nBut while the median CPI and the trimmed-mean estimators are often referred to as \"core\" inflation measures (and I have done this myself), these measures are very different from the CPI excluding food and energy.\n\nIn fact, I would not characterize these trimmed-mean measures as \"exclusionary\" statistics at all. Unlike the CPI excluding food and energy, the median CPI and the assortment of trimmed-mean estimators do not fundamentally alter the underlying weighting structure of the CPI from month to month. As long as the CPI price change distribution is symmetrical, these estimators are designed to track along the same path as that laid out by the headline CPI. It's just that these measures are constructed so that they follow that path with much less volatility (the monthly variance in the median CPI is about 95 percent smaller than the all-items CPI and about 25 percent smaller than the CPI less food and energy).\n\nI think of the trimmed-mean estimators and the median CPI as being more akin to seasonal adjustment than they are to the concept of core inflation. (Indeed, early on, Cecchetti and I showed that the median CPI and associated trimmed-means also did a good job of purging the data of its seasonal nature.) The median CPI and trimmed-mean estimators are noise-reduced statistics where the underlying signal being identified is the CPI itself, not some alternative aggregation of price data.\n\nThis is not true of the CPI excluding food and energy, nor necessarily of other so-called measures of \"core\" inflation. Core inflation measures alter the weights of the price statistic so that they can no longer pretend to be approximations of the cost of living. They are different constructs altogether.\n\nIs it more expensive, or does it just cost more money? Inflation versus cost of living\nLet me make two claims that I believe are, separately, uncontroversial among economists. Jointly, however, I think they create an incongruity for how we think about, and measure, inflation.\n\nThe first claim is that, over time, inflation is a monetary phenomenon. It is caused by too much money chasing a limited number of things to buy with that money. As such, the control of inflation is rightfully the responsibility of the institution that has monopoly control over the supply of money—the central bank.\n\nMy second claim is that the cost of living is a real concept, and changes in the cost of living will occur even in a world without money. It is a description of how difficult it is to buy a particular level of well-being. Indeed, to a first approximation, changes in the cost of living are beyond the ability of a central bank to control.\n\nFor this reason, I think it is entirely appropriate to think about whether the cost of living in New York City is rising faster or slower than in Cleveland, just as it is appropriate to ask whether the cost of living of retirees is rising faster or slower than it is for working-aged people. The folks at the Bureau of Labor Statistics produce statistics that can help us answer these and many other questions related to how expensive it is to buy the happiness embodied in any particular bundle of goods.\n\nBut I think it is inappropriate for us to think about inflation, the object of central bank control, as being different in New York than it is in Cleveland, or to think that inflation is somehow different for older citizens than it is for younger citizens. Inflation is common to all things valued by money.\n\nYet changes in the cost of living and inflation are commonly talked about as if they are the same thing. And this creates both a communication and a measurement problem for the Federal Reserve and other central banks around the world.\n\nHere is the essence of the problem as I see it: money is not only our medium of exchange but also our numeraire—our yardstick for measuring value. Embedded in every price change, then, are two forces. The first is real in the sense that the good is changing its price in relation to all the other prices in the market basket. It is the cost adjustment that motivates you to buy more or less of that good. The second force is purely nominal. It is a change in the numeraire caused by an imbalance in the supply and demand of the money being provided by the central bank. I think the concept of \"core inflation\" is all about trying to measure changes in this numeraire. But to get there, we need to first let go of any \"real\" notion of our price statistics. Let me explain.\n\nLetting go of expenditure weights in favor of \"inflation\" weights\nAs a cost-of-living approximation, the weights used to construct the CPI are based on some broadly representative consumer's expenditure. It is easy to understand that since medical care costs are more important to the typical household budget than, say, haircuts, these costs should get a greater weight in the computation of an individual's cost of living. But does inflation somehow affect medical care prices differently than haircuts? I'm open to the possibility that the answer to this question is yes. It seems to me that if monetary policy has predictable, real effects on the economy then there will be a policy-induced disturbance in relative prices that temporarily alters the cost of living in some way.\n\nBut if inflation is a nominal experience that is independent of the cost of living, then the inflation component of medical care is the same as that in haircuts. No good or service, geographic region, or individual experiences inflation any differently than any other. Inflation is a common signal that ultimately runs through all wages and prices.\n\nAnd when we open up to the idea that inflation is a nominal, not real concept, we begin to think about the BLS's market basket in a fundamentally different way than what the BLS intends to measure.\n\nThis, I think, is the common theme that runs through all measures of \"core\" inflation. Can the prices the BLS collects be reorganized or reweighted in a way that makes the aggregate price statistic more informative about the inflation that the central bank hopes to control? I think the answer is yes.\n\nThe CPI excluding food and energy is one very crude way. Food and energy prices are extremely volatile and certainly point to nonmonetary forces as their primary drivers.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Otto Eckstein defined core inflation as the trend growth rate of the cost of the factors of production—the cost of capital and wages. I would compare Eckstein's measure to the \"inflation expectations\" component that most economists (and presumably the Federal Open Market Committee) think \"anchor\" the inflation trend.\n\nThe sticky-price CPI\nBrent Meyer and I have taken this idea to the CPI data. One way that prices appear to be different is in their observed \"stickiness.\" That is, some prices tend to change quite frequently, while others do not. Prices that change only infrequently will be more forward-looking than those are change all the time. So we can take the CPI market basket and separate it into two groups of prices—prices that tend to be flexible and those that are \"sticky\" (a separation made possible by the work of Mark Bils and Pete Klenow).\n\nIndeed, we find that the part of the CPI market basket that changes prices frequently (about 30 percent of the CPI) is very responsive to changes in economic conditions, but does not seem to have a very forward-looking character. But the 70 percent of the market basket that does not change prices very often—the sticky-price CPI—appears to be largely immune to fluctuations in business conditions, and these items are better predictors of future price behavior. In other words, we think that some \"inflation-expectation\" component exists to varying degrees within each price. By reweighting the CPI market basket in a way that amplifies the behavior of the most forward-looking prices, the sticky-price CPI gives policymakers a perspective on the inflation experience that can't be seen in the headline CPI.\n\nHere is what monthly changes in the sticky-price CPI look like compared to the all-items CPI and the traditional \"core\" CPI.\n\n(enlarge)\n\nLet me describe another, more radical example of how we might think about reweighting the CPI market basket to measure inflation, a way of thinking that is very different from the expenditure-basket approach the BLS uses to measure the cost of living.\n\nIf we assume that inflation is ultimately a monetary event and, moreover, that the signal of this monetary inflation can be found in all prices, then we might use statistical techniques to help us identify that signal from a large number of price data. (The famous early 20th-century economist Irving Fisher described the problem as trying to track a swarm of bees by abstracting from the individual, seemingly chaotic behavior of any particular bee.)\n\nCecchetti and I experimented along these lines to measure a common signal running through the CPI data. The basic idea of our approach was to take the component data that the BLS supplied, make a few simple identifying assumptions, and let the data itself determine the appropriate weighting structure to the inflation estimate.2 The signal-extraction method we chose was a dynamic-factor index approach, and while we didn't pursue that work much further, others did, using more sophisticated and less restrictive signal-extraction methods. Perhaps most notable is the 2007 work of Ricardo Reis and Mark Watson.\n\nTo give you a flavor of the approach, consider the \"first principal component\" of the CPI price-change data. The first principal component of a data series is a statistical combination of the data that accounts for the largest share of their joint movement (or variance). It's a simple, statistically shared component that runs through all the price data.\n\nThis next chart shows the first principal component of the CPI price data, in relation to the headline CPI and the core CPI.\n\n(enlarge)\n\nAgain, this is a very different animal than what the folks at the BLS are trying to measure. In fact, the weights used to produce this particular common signal in the price data bear no similarity to the expenditure weights that make up the market baskets that most people buy. And why should they? The idea here doesn't depend on how important something is to the well-being of any individual, but on whether the movement in its price seems to be similar or dissimilar to the movements of all the other prices.\n\nIn the table below, I report the weight (or relative importance) of a select group of CPI components and the weight they would get on the basis of their contribution to the first principal component.\n\n\n\nWhile some criticize the CPI because it overweighs housing from a cost-of-living perspective, it may be these housing components that ought to be given the greatest consideration when thinking about the inflation that the central bank controls. Likewise, according to this approach, restaurant costs, motor vehicle repair, and even a few food components ought to be taken pretty seriously in the measurement of a common inflation signal running through the price data.\n\nAnd what price movements does this approach say we ought to ignore? Well, gasoline prices for one. But movements in the prices of medical care commodities, communications equipment, and tobacco products also appear to move in ways that are largely disconnected from the common thread in prices that runs through the CPI market basket.\n\nThe challenge of communication\nLet me close with a few observations on the common criticism that measures of core inflation, and specifically the CPI excluding food and energy, disconnect the Federal Reserve from households and businesses \"who know price changes when they see them.\" After all, don't the members of the FOMC eat food and use gas in their cars? Of course they do, and if it is the cost of living the central bank intended to control, the prices of these goods should necessarily be part of the conversation, notwithstanding their observed volatility.\n\nIn fact, as I noted at the beginning of the talk, 40 percent of the monthly volatility in the cost-of-living measure of the commonly reported all-items CPI has already been purged through seasonal adjustment procedures. I think communicating in terms of a seasonally adjusted price index makes a lot of sense, even if nobody actually buys things at seasonally adjusted prices.\n\nReferencing alternative measures of inflation presents communications challenges for the central bank, to be sure. It certainly would be easier if progress toward either of the Federal Reserve's mandates could be described in terms of a single, easily understood statistic. But I don't think this is feasible for price stability, or for full employment.\n\nAnd with regard to our price stability mandate, I suspect the problem of public communication runs deeper than the particular statistics we make reference to. In 1996, Robert Shiller polled people—real people, not economists—about their perceptions of inflation. What he found was a stark difference between how economists think about the word \"inflation\" and how folks outside a relatively small band of academics and policymakers define inflation. Consider this question: Which of the following comes closer to your biggest gripe about inflation? Here is how people responded:\n\n\n\nSeventy-seven percent of the households in Shiller's poll picked number 2—\"inflation hurts my real buying power\"—as their biggest gripe about inflation. This is a cost-of-living description. It does not appear to be the same concept that most economists are thinking about when they consider inflation, as only 12 percent of economists indicated that inflation hurt real buying power.\n\nI wonder if, in the minds of most people, the Federal Reserve's price-stability mandate is heard as a promise to prevent things from becoming more expensive, and especially the staples of life like, well, food and gasoline. But this is not what the central bank is promising to do.\n\nWhat is the Federal Reserve promising to do? Again, let me emphasize that I don't speak for the Fed; my views are my own. But to the best of my knowledge, the first \"workable\" definition of price stability by the Federal Reserve was Paul Volcker's 1983 description that it was a condition where \"decision-making should be able to proceed on the basis that 'real' and 'nominal' values are substantially the same over the planning horizon—and that planning horizons should be suitably long.\"\n\nThirty years later, the Fed gave price stability a more explicit definition when it laid down a numerical target. Here is how the FOMC describes that target:\n\nThe inflation rate over the longer run is primarily determined by monetary policy, and hence the Committee has the ability to specify a longer-run goal for inflation. The Committee reaffirms its judgment that inflation at the rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve's statutory mandate.\n\nWhether one goes back to the qualitative description of Paul Volcker, or the quantitative description in the FOMC's recent statement of principles, the thrust is broadly the same. The central bank is intent on managing that longer-term, nominal trend in the price level that is determined by monetary policy, not the real fluctuations that are reflective of changes\n\nin the cost-of-living faced by households. And achieving price stability in the sense described above requires that the central bank and the public are talking about the same thing when communicating about inflation.\n\nPrices are volatile, and the cost of living the public experiences ought to reflect that. But what the central bank can control over time—inflation—is obscured within these fluctuations. What my work and the work of my coauthors have attempted to do is to rearrange the price data at our disposal, and so reveal a richer perspective on the inflation experience.\n\nThank you.\n\n1 Said in the language of statistics, the weighted mean of this price change distribution is pretty inefficient and makes the central tendency in the data harder to see.\n\n2 In 2002, we, along with Roisin O'Sullivan, expanded the set of component price data to include asset and wage data, arguing that the inflation signal runs through all nominal prices.

            "content": "I'm pleased to be back in Baton Rouge and to continue to build on the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's partnership with the Graduate School of Banking at LSU. The Graduate School of Banking at LSU has worked closely over the last two years with our supervision and regulation staff to put on banking outlook conferences. In our view, these conferences have been thought-provoking and have achieved a better dialogue between banks and regulators.\n\nI'm also pleased to be back on the campus of LSU. Our research department at the Atlanta Fed partners with the university on local economic analysis.\n\nHere's what I plan to cover this evening: I'll address the approach of the Federal Reserve to supervision of community banks as well as some of the challenges, as I see them, of operating a community bank. And I'll give you my sense of the economic outlook and the outlook for monetary policy.\n\nPlease keep in mind that you're hearing my personal views. My colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee and in the Federal Reserve System, including colleagues principally engaged in supervisory activities, may not fully agree with my views.\n\nA few weeks ago, Fed Chair Janet Yellen gave a particularly thoughtful speech at the Independent Community Bankers of America policy summit. I think selected highlights of her remarks are worth repeating. I'll take the liberty of elaborating on a couple of her points.\n\nChair Yellen stressed the important role that community banks play in serving Main Street America \"by providing credit to small business owners, homebuyers, households, and farmers.\"\n\nShe devoted much of her speech to the notion of tailored supervision of community banks. She stressed that there is no one-size-fits-all supervision scheme for banks. In both guidance from the Board of Governors and execution of supervisory programs at the Reserve Bank level, the Fed is working to tailor expectations of bank management to the size and complexity of the institution.\n\nBy way of example, we do not intend that community banks be held to the same formal requirements and standards as large banks in regard to stress testing portfolios and capital planning. That said, let me editorialize. Every bank is expected to know the risks in its portfolio and the potential impact on earnings and capital. This may not require, however, the extent of modeling and scenario planning required of larger banks.\n\nChair Yellen also commented that the Fed has been monitoring how reliant banks are on short-term wholesale funding. She took care to point out that community banks are not considered a source of potential systemic vulnerability related to wholesale funding.\n\nIn a summary statement, Chair Yellen reiterated that the Federal Reserve is committed to understanding community banks and their unique challenges.\n\nWhy so many community bank failures in the Southeast?\nOne way to put those challenges in perspective is by taking a look back at bank failures over the period 2007 through 2013.\n\nTo tee up this subject, let me show you two slides that depict bank failures in recent history; in particular, the slides show the geographic concentration of bank failures in the Southeast.\n\nHere you have a heat map of sorts. The horizontal cut is by Federal Reserve District, and the vertical shows the years. The numbers are the total failed banks by year.\n\nThe Atlanta Federal Reserve District covers the entirety of Georgia, Alabama, and Florida and portions of Mississippi, Louisiana, and Tennessee.\n\nThis second slide shows the same information across the United States with some added information on the drivers of individual bank failures in terms of portfolio delinquency concentrations. The key categories are residential acquisition and development loans, mortgages, commercial real estate, and consumer. As you can see, bank failures in the Southeast were mostly concentrated geographically around Atlanta, South Florida, and the panhandle of Florida.\n\nI don't intend to present here tonight an in-depth analysis of the many factors that contributed to this experience. I simply want to ask—and then try to answer, at a high level—the question WHY? Why was it that the banking system in this part of the country was, apparently, especially vulnerable, and what lessons can be drawn from this experience?\n\nAt the risk of some oversimplification, I'll propose four takeaways.\n\nFirst, concentrations can be deadly. Many of the banks that failed, especially around Atlanta, were relatively young banks that became highly concentrated in residential real estate loans, particularly acquisition, development, and construction, or ADC, loans.\n\nSecond, many of the banks that failed were excessively reliant on wholesale funding. The median wholesale funding-to-asset ratio of the Georgia banks that failed was 30 percent. Hot money can burn you.\n\nAnother factor that contributed to failures was inexperience with severe conditions along with overdependence on collateral values without an understanding of cash flows under various scenarios. I'm a former commercial banker. I was taught that cash generation repays loans, and analysis of the borrower's ability to repay is basic. I've heard the view that a lot of bankers weren't ready for what happened. Their inexperience showed up in lending practices.\n\nFinally, many of the failed banks suffered from weak governance. Banks need board members who understand their role as directors. Directors as a group set policy, define the risk appetite of the bank, and hold management accountable for risk management. I know most of you here are line bankers. In my opinion, you should welcome a board that challenges management. To perform this role, directors don't necessarily have to be banking experts, but they should be individuals with business acumen.\n\nThe current economic context and outlook\nI'll now turn to the here and now and talk about the economic context in which you are currently operating.\n\nThe recovery began almost five years ago. On the whole, economic growth over this period has been subdued. Up until the middle of last year, growth averaged a little more than 2 percent.\n\nBut the second half of last year showed a significant step-up in economic activity, with the pace of growth in excess of 3 percent.\n\nThen came the first quarter of this year. The first-quarter growth rate in the national economy was essentially flat. A new estimate is due Thursday, and it may show a slight decline in activity—that is, contraction of the economy.\n\nThe view is widely held that the weak first-quarter performance can be explained mostly by bad weather. As one of my contacts put it, the first quarter was wrecked by weather. My staff and I ascribe to that view.\n\nMy going-in forecast for the second quarter was for the economy to resume growth at a run rate similar to that exhibited in the second half of last year—that is, a growth trend close to 3 percent.\n\nThe March and April data have been consistent with this view. Said differently, looking through the normal month-to-month noisiness of economic data, there are no indications that an outlook of 3 percent or better growth through the rest of the year is wildly off base.\n\nAs you know, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is tasked with two principal objectives—achievement of full employment and low and stable prices (or low inflation). The Committee has defined the desirable rate of consumer price inflation to be 2 percent per annum.\n\nNeither objective has yet been achieved. That is to say, there is still slack in the employment situation of the country, and inflation is running below the desired rate.\n\nLet me update where the economy stands opposite these two objectives. Again, these are my personal views.\n\nWe are making progress on the full employment goal—by some measures, like the rate of civilian unemployment, a lot of progress. The rate of unemployment fell to 6.3 percent last month and is closing in on levels that many believe to be consistent with a practical definition of full employment. But a number of other measures of labor market performance tell me that the economy is still operating well short of full employment. Notably, there remains an unusually high percentage of prime working-age people who are marginally attached to the labor force, who are working part-time jobs when they would prefer to be working full-time, and who are leaving the workforce. These indicators and others suggest to me that fulfillment of our employment mandate is still a ways off.\n\nRegarding inflation, we saw rather broad-based firming of prices in the April Consumer Price Index. It's too early to conclude that the inflation trend is sustainably closer to target, but the risks associated with disinflation do appear to have receded.\n\nLooking ahead, I'm holding to an outlook of continuing growth over the next several quarters at a rate around 3 percent. With that, the official unemployment rate should decline and other measures of labor market health should continue to improve. I don't expect dramatic improvement in labor resource utilization, but I do expect steady progress.\n\nIn the same vein, I'm forecasting inflation to converge to the 2 percent target over the medium term. The inflation and employment objectives connect in the area of wages. Recently, we've seen some modest growth of wages, but again it is hard to conclude that the employment gap is very near to being closed.\n\nI've given you the broad strokes of a pretty optimistic outlook. Such an outlook is supported by anecdotal feedback from many of our business contacts. I would emphasize, however, that considering the weakness of the first quarter, it's still early in what you might call an assumption-validation process that would serve to confirm that the economy is indeed on the trajectory I've laid out.\n\nAs confirming evidence, I'll be paying attention to consumer spending and consumer confidence. Data on both have been, on balance, encouraging. I'll be monitoring industrial activity closely. While the manufacturing production numbers stepped down in April following very strong gains in February and March, the April report from purchasing managers on production and orders was quite positive. And I'll be looking for sustained employment gains. Payroll jobs growth was at 288,000 in April, and jobs have shown a decided firming since December.\n\nOn policy\nAchievement of economic progress along the lines of the outlook I've laid out will likely bring about conditions in which higher interest rates will be appropriate. The question is when. There is already much talk and speculation among commentators about the timing of \"liftoff\"—the date when the FOMC will begin to move the policy interest rate higher.\n\nI'm sure you are quite interested in this question. The management of interest-rate risk is a front-and-center concern for banks, a point that we have been emphasizing in our interaction with banks and bank holding companies we supervise.\n\nI'll conclude with comments on policy considerations, as I see them.\n\nI believe the wind-down of asset purchases continues to be appropriate. I expect tapering to continue at the pace we've seen since December with the result that the quantitative easing, or QE, program will come to a conclusion in the fourth quarter.\n\nOn the question of the timing of liftoff, let me make a few points.\n\nAt any given juncture, absolute certainty of the economy's direction is not achievable. As I've suggested, I feel the need to see confirming evidence in the data validating the view that above-trend growth is occurring and is sustainable, and that the FOMC is closing in on its policy objectives. One quarter's data isn't enough. I expect it will take a number of months for me to arrive at conviction on that account.\n\nWhen the first move to tighten policy is taken, I would expect it to begin a cycle of gradually rising rates. This will be a significant, even historic, transition that must be executed skillfully, with tools sufficient to the task, and with clear communication that fosters orderly market adjustment, to the extent possible. The discussion of so-called policy normalization documented in the latest minutes of the FOMC was just a first step, in my opinion.\n\nIt bears repeating that a discussion of policy normalization does not necessarily imply that a shift in policy is imminent. For the reasons I have discussed, I, as one policymaker, am not in a rush to get to liftoff. I continue to be comfortable with a projection of the second half of next year (2015) as likely timing.\n\nEven as the economy accelerates this year to a somewhat higher growth trajectory, as I expect, I think continued monetary accommodation will be warranted for some time. When quantitative easing is done, anticipation of the next policy move will likely intensify. A combination of a shortfall from full utilization of our nation's labor resources and inflation below the FOMC's longer-term objective would, in my view, justify patience in raising policy rates.\n\nOne last comment: You are here participating in continuing education to be the best bankers you can be. The history of bank failures in the Southeast contains a number of cautionary lessons. I'll add one more. Improving conditions bring their own challenges. Conditions seem to be improving. Be careful.",

            "content": "It’s a pleasure to return to this part of the world. I’m on a bit of a nostalgia tour. I began my career 42 years ago in the Middle East and spent a total of seven years here. I have very fond memories of my experience in the region.\n\nToday, I will offer my views on the state of and outlook for both the global economy and the U.S. economy, and will explain the current position of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy. And, given the weight of the U.S. economy and the importance of the dollar in global economic affairs, I will comment on how Fed policy affects the rest of the world, particularly emerging markets. I will also comment on the future risks and explain how financial stability concerns factor into my thinking on policy.\n\nPlease note that I am speaking only for myself. My views may not be shared by my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System. I am here at the invitation of the U.S. Department of Treasury and Department of State. However, I am not speaking for these arms of the U.S. government, and they, too, may not agree with the views I will express today.\n\nGlobal economy\nLet me start with a look at the global economy. The financial crisis of 2007 to 2008 affected the entire globe, and the ensuing recession in the United States was mirrored by weak or stagnant conditions in most of the advanced economies. Many of the major emerging-market economies performed relatively well in the years immediately following the recession—2009 to 2011—before slowing more recently. Overall, it’s been a slow process of recovery for much of the world.\n\nThe slow recovery has been supported by very accommodative monetary policies in the United States, Europe, and Japan. Interest rates remain quite low. Said differently, the global cost of credit has remained unusually low. Monetary policy decisions are rarely coordinated among the major central banks today, but widespread weak economic conditions have dictated similar policies in the advanced countries, to be sure. Some aspects of monetary policy have been quite unconventional. I’m referring, of course, to the measures taken in the United States and Japan when short-term interest rates could not be pushed any lower. The world knows these policies as “quantitative easing.”\n\nI believe that highly accommodative monetary policies have met with some success. However, the advanced economies still face large shortfalls in economic performance, as evidenced by still unsatisfactory levels of underemployment. Inflation in advanced economies has firmed a little lately, but remains low and below the targeted run rates of many central banks. Persistent low inflation has raised concerns of tipping into deflationary conditions, but at a global level, this outcome has not materialized, in part due to the extraordinary policies of the world’s central banks.\n\nRecently, the circumstances of some emerging markets have become less settled. Some emerging markets have experienced capital outflows, triggered in part by the winding down of extraordinary policy accommodation in the United States. A number of countries have had spells of volatility in their financial and currency markets. There are persistent concerns about emerging-market fundamentals, especially in countries dealing with high inflation and wide current-account deficits.\n\nTo generalize, however, the global economy has been enjoying a gradual recovery with moderate rates of growth and low inflation, but also significant resource slack in advanced economies.\n\nU.S. economy\nThe U.S. economy is my primary focus as a central banker, and the condition of the U.S. economy is very important in a global context, so let me spend a few minutes talking about how I see economic developments there. Since the middle of last year, the U.S. economy appears to have entered a higher growth path, although the preliminary data for the first quarter were much weaker than expected. After two quarters of growth above 3 percent (annualized), the quarter ended March 31 showed practically no growth at all.\n\nThe Bureau of Economic Analysis released an advance estimate of only 0.1 percent growth of real gross domestic product (GDP) for the first quarter of 2014.\n\nUnusually harsh winter weather seems to have been a significant factor in the disappointing first-quarter growth. Businesspeople have noted, for example, weather-related losses in production, retail sales, shipment time, workdays on construction sites, and visits to hotels and restaurants.\n\nStatistically, the drop-off in real GDP growth in the first quarter mostly reflected downturns in exports and capital spending, a decline in private inventory investment, and slower government spending.\n\nThe softness of the first quarter naturally raises concerns that the economy has lost momentum. Many forecasters, including Federal Reserve forecasters, are treating the first quarter as a temporary phenomenon with few, if any, longer-term implications. To generalize, forecasters and businesspeople alike are expecting a rebound in the second quarter and beyond. Most observers of the U.S. economy are optimistic that real growth will snap back to a pace of around 3 percent per annum.\n\nI share that outlook. My official forecast calls for growth accelerating starting this quarter to an annualized run rate around 3 percent. I expect stronger growth will help absorb underutilized resources in the economy, especially labor resources.\n\nA week ago Friday, we got the latest employment report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The trend in payroll jobs creation was quite encouraging. Also, the official unemployment rate fell by a surprising four-tenths of a percent to 6.3 percent, but with the April number, the labor force participation rate fell again to almost a 30-year low. In simple terms, last month, the United States apparently added jobs but lost workers. So I am hesitant to take on board this decline in the unemployment rate as indisputable evidence of progress toward full employment.\n\nAs many of you know, the Federal Reserve, through the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, conducts monetary policy with two primary objectives in mind. One objective is to support full utilization of labor resources, or full employment. The other objective is to maintain price stability, or low (but not dangerously low) inflation. The FOMC has chosen to define price stability in terms of a targeted rate of inflation of 2 percent over the longer term.\n\nConsistent with my view that the economic growth rate will improve, I expect inflation to firm to a healthier rate over the medium term on a track to the FOMC's 2 percent target. There are some signs of firming in recent data.\n\nHowever, it may not be clear for several months, or even quarters, whether the U.S. economy is undeniably on a stronger and sustained growth path around a run rate of 3 percent. To gauge the true extent of economic expansion, I will be watching for a stronger rate of industrial production growth, improved demand for capital goods, and a step-up in consumer spending.\n\nU.S. monetary policy\nLet me now take a few minutes to discuss the Federal Reserve’s policy stance in light of the outlook I’ve laid out (which, I might add, is pretty mainstream among Federal Reserve and private forecasters).\n\nAs you know, the Fed is winding down its asset purchase program, commonly known as “quantitative easing,” or QE. Starting last December, the Fed reduced its monthly purchases from $85 billion a month to the current level of $45 billion. I expect this program to be completely phased out by October or December this year.\n\nIn my view, this is a first step in the gradual normalization of monetary policy. Assuming continued recovery of the U.S. economy and the closing of employment and inflation gaps, the Fed’s policy interest rate would begin to rise at some point next year.\n\nFor now, the policy rate remains near zero, and the FOMC has indicated through its published statements its intention to keep policy rates low for a while longer.\n\nBased on my outlook, I think that conditions in the U.S. economy will justify beginning the process of raising rates in the latter half of 2015. Once rates begin to rise, I expect the process to normalization of interest rates to be gradual.\n\nEffects of U.S. monetary policy worldwide \nThe world watches U.S. monetary policy closely, and global capital flows are influenced by expectations of Federal Reserve policy. Recent turbulence in certain emerging markets led to substantial controversy over the effect of U.S. policy on the rest of the world.\n\nQuestions were raised about the wisdom and timing of the Fed’s decision to start withdrawing the extraordinary support provided by quantitative easing and the decision to do so seemingly without regard to the effect on other countries.\n\nI’ll give you my perspective as one U.S. policymaker. Changes in U.S. financial conditions do affect interest rates and asset prices in other countries through various channels. U.S. central-bank policy influences capital flows and their effects, in turn, on the foreign exchange rate, equity markets and debt markets, both external and domestic.\n\nAs a result, some emerging economies may face pressures when U.S. monetary accommodation is reduced. They may have to make policy and business adjustments. This was the situation earlier this year, but since then conditions in most affected countries have stabilized or at least calmed.\n\nStepping back, my sense is that overall emerging market vulnerability to external causes is considerably lower than it has been in the past. Many emerging-market policymakers responded to the financial crises in Asia and Latin America in the late 1990s and early 2000s by moving to flexible currencies, building official reserves, and cutting their dependence on foreign currency borrowing.\n\nThe Fed has tried to be transparent about the direction of its monetary policy. In my view, we have communicated clearly our intention to wind down asset purchases and eventually begin to raise rates as the U.S. recovery advances and our policy objectives look more attainable. These contingencies should have been clear even before last summer when the subject of phasing out the asset purchase program was broached in a Fed press conference.\n\nI believe it is in the world’s interest that the U.S. economy strengthens and that the Federal Reserve pursues policies appropriate for, and supportive of, improving conditions. Also, with my expectation that the United States will experience better economic growth over the medium term, I believe the outlook for emerging economies is also improved.\n\nRisks\nI have presented a rather upbeat outlook for the U.S. economy. I have to acknowledge some risks to my outlook. Risks can express themselves in a number of ways, but at present I see the risks falling under three headings. First, as I said, it may be a while before we know if the intrinsic growth momentum of the U.S. economy is indeed as strong as I’m projecting.\n\nSecond, there is the risk of financial instability. In a highly integrated global financial system, events almost anywhere can have an impact on financial stability in the United States, here in the Middle East, and elsewhere. To take a U.S.-centric view, given how long a low-interest-rate environment has been in place, it’s wise to keep a close watch on asset markets for signs of “irrational exuberance,” a phrase coined by former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan. I can assure you Fed policymakers are monitoring developments carefully. As one policymaker, I am not overly concerned that markets or institutions pose broad systemic risks at this time.\n\nThe third area of concern is geopolitical in nature. Tensions between Russia and the West over Ukraine have an economic dimension, both in the interplay between the parties and the potential for destabilization of markets and economies. Even in the absence of significant direct exposure (which is the case for the United States), I think there is risk that heightened conflict could produce volatility in global financial and commodity markets that, if prolonged, could spill over to the U.S. and global economies. The recent lessening of tensions is a welcome development.\n\nConclusion\nIn my comments today, I’ve tried to provide a summary perspective on the economic circumstances of the day that I think affect us all. I learned early in my career that geographic location influences a person’s perspective—where you sit often determines where you stand. I’m pretty certain the world looks somewhat different to you from here, and that what you think is important may not have been covered in my remarks. So, I welcome now your comments and questions.",

            "content": "Thank you for having me back here at Jungle Island. Miami has made quite a comeback from the recession's depths in 2008 and 2009. It's nice to visit a city that's enjoying such a strong rebound.\n\nI attribute that to Miami's unique position as a true international city and, of course, to collaborative leadership. I have some firsthand knowledge. Your chamber president, Al Dosal, also serves on our Miami Branch board. Thank you, Al, for your enthusiastic service.\n\nThere is an expression that seems especially apt as we watch events in the Ukraine. It is \"geography is destiny.\" In a quarter that's seen hard-hitting weather events across most of the country, South Florida was spared.\n\nI believe weather effects have been meaningful in the national economy in the quarter just ended. I'll elaborate on that point in my remarks today.\n\nHere's what I plan to cover today: I'll give you my sense of where the economy stands at this juncture and where it's headed. I'll argue that there remains a considerable amount of economic slack, especially in the utilization of labor resources.\n\nGiven my view on how economic conditions are likely to evolve, I will argue that monetary policy should remain quite accommodative for some time. To be even more precise, any uptick in the policy rate is unlikely to be warranted until at least the last half of next year. I will provide a sense of how I am assessing economic progress toward the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) goals and provide my view on developments that could lead to a revision of that general timeline.\n\nI have to emphasize that what follows are my personal opinions. My colleagues on the FOMC and in the Federal Reserve System may not agree.\n\nThe economy's current position and outlook\nFirst-quarter growth of gross domestic product (GDP) was weak on a number of counts following two quarters of relative strength. It will be many weeks before we have a final and conclusive number, but tracking estimates indicate that overall growth in the first three months of this year was below 2 percent on an annualized basis.\n\nWeather seems to have been a significant factor in the disappointing first-quarter growth. In our contacts with business people across the Southeast, we heard accounts of weather-related losses in production, retail sales, shipment time, work days on construction sites, and visits to hotels and restaurants.\n\nDepending on industry, some of our contacts expect the lost activity to be made up in coming weeks while others expect activity to resume only to normal levels.\n\nAs convincing as these anecdotal accounts of weather effects may be, the softness of the first quarter naturally raises concerns that the economy has lost momentum here in the early part of the year. Forecasters, including Federal Reserve forecasters, have to decide if the economy is likely to continue on this weak growth path or if the first quarter will turn out to be just a one-off spell of weaker performance.\n\nI am in the latter camp. My key working assumption is that growth will accelerate in the second quarter and repeat in subsequent quarters. I expect stronger growth will help to absorb underutilized resources in the economy, especially labor resources.\n\nMonetary policy objectives\nMy baseline forecast—just explained—is central to my view on the appropriateness of current monetary policy.\n\nAs many of you know, the Federal Reserve through the FOMC runs monetary policy with two primary objectives in mind. One objective is to support full utilization of labor resources, or full employment. The other objective is to maintain price stability, or low (but not too low) inflation. The FOMC has chosen to define price stability in terms of a targeted rate of inflation of 2 percent over the longer term.\n\nConsistent with my belief that the economic growth rate will rise, unemployment will decline, and resource slack in the economy will shrink, I expect inflation to firm to a healthier rate over the medium term on a track to the FOMC's 2 percent target.\n\nI want to spend some time describing how I think about monetary policy decision making in light of the ambiguity caused by first-quarter weakness. But before laying out my own framework for assessing the economy's true trend in coming months, let me refresh your understanding of the current state of the Fed's monetary policy.\n\nThe FOMC is currently using two instruments to implement its policy. One instrument is the program we refer to as large-scale asset purchases—what is often called \"quantitative easing,\" or QE. The other is communication about how long the Committee intends to maintain the key federal funds rate target at its present near-zero level. We refer to this policy tool as \"forward guidance.\"\n\nAs you know, quantitative easing is being wound down. Through all of 2013, the Fed used its power of money creation to fund the purchase of mortgage-backed securities and Treasury securities in the amount of $85 billion per month.\n\nIn December, the FOMC took the first step to phase out this program. At the past three meetings, the monthly pace of purchases was reduced by $10 billion. Today, the level of monthly purchases stands at $55 billion. At this pace, purchases will drop to zero in October or December.\n\nI support the continued phase-out of the asset purchase program. Growth has improved and the unemployment rate has fallen since the start of the latest round of QE. My assessment of the underlying momentum of the economy leads me to the view that the FOMC's forward guidance will adequately support ongoing progress toward the Committee's objectives.\n\nThrough forward guidance, the FOMC has indicated its intention to keep policy rates low for some time to come. I think this accommodative policy is right for the current circumstances. My forecast of continued improvement in GDP growth, labor market conditions, and inflation is predicated on the continued support of accommodative monetary policy. Furthermore, I think we are still some distance from full employment and a comfortable zone of inflation.\n\nWith our asset purchases tapering on a pretty predictable course, it is understandable that the focus has jumped ahead to the question of when the FOMC begins the process of \"liftoff\" of the federal funds target from the zero floor. Anticipation is a feature of monetary policy, not a bug. The essence of forward guidance is communication about the conditions that would make policymakers change course.\n\nIt is very difficult, and ultimately undesirable, to link such conditions with a precise date. The use of forward guidance does require that policymakers articulate as clearly as they can about how they are assessing economic conditions in formulating their views on appropriate monetary policy. In that way, the public can align their expectations with policy intentions.\n\nMy approach for assessing progress\nSo let me lay out my approach for assessing progress as the economy moves along in the coming months. Understand that this is just one policymaker's thinking, not the Committee's.\n\nFirst, my view is that sustained GDP growth in the neighborhood of 3 percent will generate sufficient movement toward the FOMC's objectives to justify a gradual liftoff in policy rates sometime in the latter half of 2015.\n\nBut, if that progress fails to materialize, a later liftoff date than I am assuming will likely be appropriate.\n\nIt is important to note that pickup in GDP growth is not a goal in and of itself. As I have indicated, I am looking to this pickup because I believe it will be sufficient to produce labor market and inflation outcomes that align with the FOMC's mandated objectives. So direct assessment of labor market and inflation developments is also critical.\n\nUnder ideal circumstances, we might be able to gauge the momentum of the economy using just a couple of economic statistics. For example, we might look mostly at the official civilian unemployment rate and the most recent 12-month trend growth rate of the price index of personal consumption expenditures (PCE). These indicators normally work pretty well. But in the complicated environment that emerged in the wake of the financial crisis and the Great Recession, a more comprehensive approach to assessing economic conditions is warranted.\n\nIndeed, I like to think in terms of a dashboard of indicators to help me gauge how close we are to full employment and price stability.\n\nMy staff at the Atlanta Fed has developed a labor conditions tracking tool based on a broad set of labor market indicators. Taken as a package, these indicators will help me assess progress toward full utilization of labor resources over coming quarters.\n\nFor example, in addition to the standard unemployment rate, I look at broader measures of unemployment that factor in marginally attached workers—people available and wanting a job but not currently looking for a job. Their numbers are about 1 million more today than before the Great Recession.\n\nAnother underutilized group are those working part-time but who claim they want full-time employment. They currently represent about 5 percent of the labor force, and that's an unusually high number relative to the official unemployment rate. We would clearly like to see an increase in the flow of these workers from part-time to full-time work.\n\nThe headline unemployment rate we are all familiar with is the U-3 statistic generated by the government. It currently stands at 6.7 percent. A more inclusive measure of unemployment that factors in the marginally attached and those who are involuntarily working part-time is called U-6. This measure is currently calculated as 12.6 percent.\n\nI'll be looking for two developments: an absolute drop in both the official and broader U-6 measures of unemployment over the coming months, but also a tightening of the gap between them. The good news is that over the past six months the difference between these two measures of unemployment has in fact been narrowing.\n\nMeasures of labor market turnover also help me gauge improving conditions. These give me indications of increased hiring by firms, and also of increased confidence of workers willing to move on to better jobs. Progress along these dimensions has been very slow, and the rate of hires and quits remains well below prerecession levels.\n\nOne other important indicator is wages. Wage growth by most measures has been very low. I take this as a signal of labor market weakness, and in turn a signal of a lack of significant upward unit cost pressure on inflation.\n\nLabor compensation growth is at the heart of the connection between labor market conditions and inflation, so wage growth would also be a key indicator on my inflation dashboard.\n\nIn fact, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta maintains an \"inflation dashboard\" of 30 monthly indicators of inflation that I find useful in summarizing broad inflationary developments.\n\nWith this dashboard as general guide, I will be watching for gradually stronger pricing power by firms as evidenced in a number of retail price measures.\n\nI would also hope to see a modest firming in commodity prices as global industrial activity improves.\n\nAnd I will be checking to make sure that the key measures of inflation expectations remain steady.\n\nConclusion\nAlthough my labor conditions dashboard shows signs of improvement, progress toward full employment has been very gradual and uneven when viewed from a broad perspective. With respect to inflation, the broad view has yet to suggest a clear movement back in the direction of the FOMC's 2 percent goal. So I believe the FOMC is still significantly short of achieving its two mandated objectives.\n\nLet me sum up. At the Atlanta Fed, my staff and I are in a period of collecting data in support of our baseline assumptions. We are assuming a resumption of growth approaching 3 percent in the second quarter and beyond. We assume the first quarter was weak mostly because of weather. We will know if our assumptions on that score are wrong relatively soon. Validation of our medium-term outlook, including progress on employment and inflation, may take a little longer.\n\nThe main instrument of monetary policy is forward guidance about the path of interest-rate policy and the conditions that will justify liftoff. If our assumptions are invalidated by incoming data, I think we will have to alter guidance. But based on my working medium-term outlook, I see the latter half of 2015 as the likely time frame for the first move to higher rates.",

            "content": "Today I will explore the challenge of estimating full employment and the implications for monetary policy. To give you a roadmap of my remarks, I will start with an assessment of current economic conditions here in the first quarter of 2014. I will follow that by laying out my outlook for full year 2014 and the early months of 2015.\n\nIt is axiomatic in monetary policy that the stance of policy should fit (be appropriate for) the outlook. I will explain the current position of policy and give you my opinion of its appropriateness. I'll then discuss the questions about the direction of policy that are on the public mind and the mind of financial market participants.\n\nI will argue that the most important question is the timing of the first increase in the Fed's policy interest rate. And I will share my framework for thinking about that decision.\n\nIn my thinking, there are two dominant and equal considerations in the decision to raise interest rates. They are, in shorthand, inflation and employment. I plan, in these remarks, to give most attention to employment (or, more to the point, full employment). And I will argue that there remains considerable slack in the country's employment situation.\n\nSome might add a third consideration—financial stability. I will touch on that subject but treat it as an ever-present, ever-pertinent contextual requirement.\n\nAs you follow my line of thinking this evening, please remember that you're hearing my personal views. I am not speaking for the Federal Reserve or the Federal Open Market Committee. My colleagues may not see things the way I do.\n\nCurrent economic conditions\nThe recession ended and the recovery began in the summer of 2009. For the first four years of recovery, gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged just over 2.0 percent. In the second half of 2013, however, the economy appeared to pick up momentum. Growth in the third and fourth quarters of last year averaged 3.25 percent (annualized).\n\nWe entered 2014 with high hopes that the economy would continue to experience a phase of accelerated growth that might be sustained for some time. Many forecasters, including those at a number of the Federal Reserve Banks, foresaw growth in 2014 around 3.0 percent.\n\nSince then, the economic indicators have been mixed, but generally softer than expected. Overall consumer spending rose strongly in January, but was heavily concentrated in home utility expenditures—power consumption—as colder-than-usual weather hit many regions of the country.\n\nAuto sales, which were strong in 2013, slowed sharply at year-end and early in 2014. Likewise, home sales and housing starts have fallen off since last fall.\n\nFinally, industrial activity has slowed quite a bit since last October, following a mid-2013 surge. There was a pronounced decline in manufacturing production in January. Survey data on factory orders in February show a modest increase.\n\nFor each of these data points, bad weather is thought to have had a significant, adverse influence on the reported number. Indeed, my research staff estimates that real GDP growth in the first quarter may have been reduced by about three-fourths percentage point (annualized) due to bad weather. I've seen roughly similar estimates from other sources, though I think all of these estimates are necessarily more impressionistic than precise.\n\nI think we could see an uptick in activity in the second quarter as business activity rebounds and some catch-up in sales and production occurs. If this is the case, forecasts of stronger growth in line with the second half of last year may still play out.\n\nThe alternative view, however, is that this quarter signals incipient renewed weakness—another false dawn. There is some ambiguity around the current state of the economy.\n\nOutlook\nIn my personal outlook for 2014 and the beginning months of 2015, I am holding to an optimistic outlook. By \"optimistic,\" I mean I expect a resumption of growth after the soft first quarter closer to a 3.0 percent annual pace. That rate of growth should bring continuing solid employment gains and a healthier economy in general, including a healthier rate of inflation.\n\nAs I said, current conditions are ambiguous. Why am I not succumbing to doubts, you might ask? Because, in my view, the economy's fundamentals are stronger, and the headwinds that have buffeted the economy and restrained growth are weaker.\n\nLet me expand on my claim that the economy's fundamentals are stronger. I think basic conditions in several key sectors of the economy are much improved compared with earlier in the recovery period. I would cite banking, housing, energy, and manufacturing as examples.\n\nHousehold balance sheets are much healthier now thanks to reduced debt, higher saving, and stronger asset prices, including higher home values.\n\nBusiness and financial-system leverage has been significantly reduced from levels precrisis that were demonstrated to be unsustainable. Business profitability is good, and firm balance sheets are generally liquid.\n\nLikewise, fiscal imbalances, while not solved for the long term, are somewhat less a near-term concern.\n\nFinally, employment markets are unquestionably in a better state compared to even a year ago.\n\nAt the same time, certain headwinds that have persistently buffeted the economy and restrained growth appear to have lessened. The fiscal drag associated with federal government budget austerity measures has eased. The risk of another financial meltdown emanating from Europe seems to have receded. Concerns about European sovereign debt and the exposure of the European banking system were an important source of uncertainty that weighed heavily on business confidence in the years 2011 and 2012, for instance.\n\nThat said, we live in a world where change can come quickly. At the moment, the Ukraine situation is front of mind. The situation presents some risk, particularly to Europe. Disruption of the European economy could spill over to our own in some measure. The situation calls for close monitoring of developments.\n\nMore broadly, slowing growth in certain emerging market economies—a potential headwind—bears watching.\n\nStepping back, though, my overall assessment is that conditions have significantly improved.\n\nPolicy stance\nIn my view, the current stance of the Committee's policy appropriately aligns with this outlook. In December, the Committee made the decision to begin tapering its program of asset purchases. The level of monthly purchases now stands at $65 billion, down from $85 billion.\n\nThe foundational policy instrument—the target for the federal funds rate—remains near zero. The policy rate has been as low as it can go for more than five years. Importantly, the Committee has communicated through what is called \"forward guidance\" that interest-rate policy is likely to stay put for a while longer. So, in spite of the phasing out of asset purchases, the intended overall position of policy is \"highly accommodative.\" I think this is appropriate and needed.\n\nThis is where we are today as regards policy. The public—including, importantly, participants in financial markets—is focused at the moment on two questions about the course of policy. The public wants to know under what conditions might the Committee reverse course on tapering—either pause the wind-down of purchases or actually increase the monetary stimulus that asset purchases aim to deliver. There is a high bar to reversing course, in my opinion. That is certainly my position. Unless the economy takes a major turn for the worse or a spell of intense disinflation develops, I expect the program to be completely wound down by the end of the year.\n\nThe second question—in my mind the more salient of the two—is the timing of \"liftoff.\" Liftoff is the date when the policy rate, and presumably all interest rates, will begin to rise.\n\nIn my bank's official forecast, we are putting liftoff in the back half of 2015.\n\nKey considerations in a liftoff decision\nNow I want to frame for you how I, as one policymaker, am thinking about the liftoff decision.\n\nI think there are two key considerations that should affect the timing of liftoff. They are inflation and employment. Inflation (sometimes called price stability) and employment (expressed as maximum employment) have been assigned to the Fed by Congress as the primary objectives of monetary policy. They are captured in the so-called dual mandate.\n\nI want to spend most of my remaining time talking about the employment side of our mandate, but let me comment briefly on inflation.\n\nIn January 2012, the Fed established a formal inflation target of 2 percent. The official time horizon for achieving this target was stated as \"over the longer run.\" It says \"over the longer run\"—which I take to mean most of the time—not \"in the long run,\" which I would translate as \"eventually.\" Two percent over the longer run is the Fed's notion of a healthy rate of inflation and our definition of price stability.\n\nToday, inflation is running well below the 2 percent target. The January headline Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index showed inflation at 1.2 percent for the last 12 months. The 12-month rate for the core PCE index (which excludes volatile food and energy prices) was 1.1 percent. There has not been much movement in the rate of inflation for several months. At the moment, it does not seem to be moving higher. Business contacts tell me they have very little, if any, pricing power.\n\nThe Committee would like to see the inflation rate rise to 2 percent over the coming many months. In my official forecast, I am projecting just this as a by-product of a sustained quicker pace of growth. In my view, the unhealthy low run rate of inflation justifies continuing monetary stimulus.\n\nThere are times when accelerating inflation might require putting the brakes on monetary stimulus. That is not the case now. Our inflation objective and full employment objective are not in conflict. They are complementary objectives. So, I will now turn to the second consideration in a liftoff decision, the outlook for achieving full or maximum employment.\n\nAchieving sustainable full employment\nThe current official level of unemployment is 6.6 percent. More than a year ago, the Committee set out a threshold of 6.5 percent as a criterion for beginning to consider a rate hike. Later, the Committee updated its rate guidance with a statement that it expects the policy rate to remain at its current level \"well past\" achievement of 6.5 percent.\n\nGiven that measured unemployment is so close to 6.5 percent, the time is approaching for a refreshed explanation of how unemployment or broader employment conditions are to be factored into a liftoff decision. In my mind, this requires a revisiting of what constitutes full employment.\n\nDefining full employment is a harder question than answering whether we are close to achieving such a state.\n\nIf all we had to go on was the official unemployment rate, we might think we are rapidly approaching full utilization of the nation's labor resources. There has been a significant decline in the unemployment rate. It was 10 percent at its peak and nearly 8 percent at the beginning of last year. As I said, it's 6.6 percent today. We get an updated number tomorrow.\n\nI think the current official unemployment rate may overstate the overall health of and progress achieved in employment conditions. As you may be aware, the interpretation of falling unemployment has been complicated by a decline in participation in the workforce.\n\nLet me explain what it means to be a participant in the workforce. The data used to construct the unemployment rate come from a survey of households conducted by the Census Bureau for the Bureau of Labor Statistics. To be counted as a participant in the labor force, a respondent must give rather specific qualifying answers to questions in the survey. To be counted as a member of the labor force—and, therefore, to be counted in the calculation of the official unemployment rate—respondents have to indicate that they were either working or available to work in the previous month. Evidence of availability for work is the claim to have actively sought employment in that month. Otherwise, they are not in the labor force.\n\nThe Census Bureau gets a variety of answers to its questions. Some people say they do not want a job. Others say they are available for work but have not looked for employment in the last month. Some who are counted as employed say they are working part time but would like a full-time job.\n\nThose who are available, have looked for work in the past year, but have not recently looked for work are labeled \"marginally attached.\" They are not in the official labor force, so they are not officially unemployed. You might say they are a \"shadow labor force.\"\n\nThe makeup of the class of marginally attached workers is quite fluid. About 40 percent of the marginally attached in any given month join the official labor force in the subsequent month. But only about 10 percent of those who move into the labor force find a job right away. In effect, they went from unofficially unemployed to officially unemployed. I think there is a strong case for assuming that at least a fraction of the marginally attached should be treated as unemployed even though they don't show up in the standard measure of unemployment.\n\nLet me insert here a short tutorial on the hierarchy of unemployment measures published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. There are six levels—U-1 through U-6, each with its own technical definition that includes or excludes categories of workers. The official headline unemployment rate (which stands today at 6.6 percent) is U-3. One measure that counts the marginally attached in the pool of the unemployed is U-6.\n\nU-6 also includes working people who identify themselves as working \"part time for economic reasons.\" These are people who want to work full time (defined as 35 hours or more) but are able only to get fewer than 35 hours of work. In official employment statistics, these part-time workers count equally with full-time workers. In my view, people who work part time for economic reasons might be thought of as partially unemployed. And among those \"economic reasons\" might be that the economy, in spite of recent growth, is not yet strong enough to close the actual, even if not fully measured, employment gap.\n\nHere's my point: what U-6 captures matters. Measures such as marginally attached and part time for economic reasons became elevated in the recession and have not come down materially. Said differently, broader measures of unemployment like U-6 suggest that a significant level of slack remains in our employment markets.\n\nSo what's going on with the marginally attached, and even some of the completely detached?\n\nThe health of the labor market clearly affects decisions of individuals to enroll in school, apply for disability insurance benefits, or stay home to take care of house or family. Discouragement over job prospects rose during the Great Recession, causing many unemployed people to drop out of the labor force and others not to enter it. People make a participation choice based on their sense—from what they hear—of employment prospects, the costs associated with going to work (for example, commuting costs, childcare, elder care, housekeeping), and the feasibility of alternatives to work (perhaps school or part-time tasks compensated in cash). People are well-attuned to incentives and disincentives and their opportunity costs. Individuals make personal calculations in answer to the question, am I (or are we as a household) net better off if I go to work? I'd argue that the responses of people in the surveys that determine the data are not independent of prevailing economic conditions. If the economy were hitting on all cylinders, many people would give different answers.\n\nAs a policymaker, I am concerned about the unemployed in the official labor force, but I am also concerned about the unemployed in the shadow labor force. To get close to full employment, as I think of it, would involve substantial absorption of this shadow labor force. I do not think we're near that point yet. This is one of the reasons I support continuing with a highly accommodative policy and deferring liftoff for a while longer.\n\nFinancial stability\nEarlier, I drew your attention to the two objectives of the Fed's dual mandate as key considerations in a liftoff decision. Before closing, let me draw your attention to a related consideration that could influence a liftoff decision. That is financial stability, or the risk of financial instability.\n\nFinancial stability can be viewed as a factor that is closely allied with our statutorily mandated objectives. A spell of financial instability, if severe enough, could be a spoiler in the Fed's pursuit of stable prices and full employment through its accommodative policy stance.\n\nThe first line of defense would most likely be use of the tools of macroprudential supervision of banks and the financial system. But, speaking for myself of course, I don't completely rule out a situation in which emerging threats would influence the stance of policy.\n\nSince I'm here at Georgetown, I'll mention my colleague Governor Dan Tarullo (who also has a Georgetown connection, having been a law professor downtown), who recently addressed the pertinent role of financial stability concerns in our policymaking. He said, \"[I]ncorporating financial stability considerations into monetary policy decisions need not imply the creation of an additional mandate for monetary policy. The potentially huge effect on price stability and employment associated with bouts of serious financial instability gives ample justification.\"\n\nConclusion\nLet me sum up. Current economic conditions are ambiguous, but I believe that after a weak first quarter, the economy will resume growing at the accelerated pace seen in the second half of 2013. I believe the fundamentals are stronger, and headwinds that previously restrained growth have diminished. The current stance of monetary policy—the ultra-low policy interest rate accompanied by the wind-down of the asset purchase program—is right for the outlook and the remaining work to be done.\n\nThe pivotal question in terms of policy is when it will be appropriate for the Fed to raise the policy interest rate. To answer that question, I look to the state of inflation and employment. I would argue that both are well short of goal. The employment goal is expressed as full employment. Even with the progress made to date, a careful evaluation of the employment situation suggests to me that full employment is still a ways off, and continued monetary accommodation is necessary.",

            "content": "I've been worrying about speaking in Macon for several weeks now. A few weeks ago, I was witness to a most amazing concert in Atlanta that involved musicians with Macon connections. Chuck Leavell was the organizer and lead performer of a night of rip-roaring southern rock that included Robert McDuffie, the superb concert violinist whose conservatory is here at Mercer University; Gregg Allman of the Allman Brothers; and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. One of the most-appreciated numbers was Chuck Leavell's rendition of \"Low Down Dirty Dog.\" You should've been there. Since then, I've been worrying about my gig here—a central banker talking about the economy and monetary policy. Will you tell your friends \"you should've been there\"? Or, maybe, \"you should've been there to hear that low down dirty dog from the Federal Reserve.\"\n\nWell, the pressure's on, I guess. Here's my playlist for this afternoon: I plan to talk about the country's current economic situation and the outlook for 2014. I'll describe the positioning of the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC's) current monetary policy in relation to the outlook. And I will spend quite a bit of my time discussing the FOMC's \"forward guidance\" about interest rate policy. My focus on forward guidance reflects its growing importance as a policy tool of the Fed. Indeed, we're now in a period in which effective communication between your central bank and the public, including participants in financial markets, presents heightened challenges for us policymakers. I'll elaborate on that point in my remarks.\n\nAs always, my comments are my personal views and may not reflect those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System or on the FOMC.\n\nThe economic situation and outlook\nLet me begin with my views on the current state of the economy and the outlook. The economy seemed to move to a higher growth track in the second half of 2013. As the data now stand (we do not yet have the final number for the fourth quarter), the economy expanded in the second half at an annual rate of 3.6 percent. This is the current estimate of real GDP (gross domestic product) growth—that is, growth net of inflation. That is about 1 1/2 percentage points above the economy's average growth since the end of the recession.\n\nMixed incoming data on economic activity in December and January have raised concerns about whether the economy has traction at this faster growth pace. There appears to have been a slowdown. Weather effects may very well have dampened retail sales, auto sales, housing starts, manufacturing activity, and of course transportation, among others. Weather is also likely to affect the February unemployment report, which we'll receive on March 7.\n\nAs a result, the current quarter is difficult to read as an indication of the most likely story for the full year 2014 and first part of 2015. The recent mixed data could be just a temporary thing—as the weather explanation suggests—or something more fundamental going on. While I am tracking the numbers carefully, at the moment I think it's too early to draw a conclusion. Even though the first quarter this year may turn out to be soft, I am \"looking through\" the recent information to a full year of sustained higher growth. In that sense, my outlook remains optimistic for the full year. I expect real GDP growth to be between 2 1/2 and 3 percent.\n\nI remain hopeful for the full year because I think the fundamentals underpinning economic performance are notably improved compared to a year ago and earlier. Factors that earlier impeded consumer spending and business investment have relented. Uncertainty about fiscal arrangements controlled by Congress is reduced. Business and consumer confidence is higher. Risks of financial instability associated with problems in Europe have abated. The recent spell of emerging market turbulence has quieted, and U.S. equity markets seem to have firmed.\n\nWhile conditions have improved, substantial gaps exist between where we are and where we want or ought to be economically. Inflation is currently running around 1 percent, depending on the measure used. The FOMC would like the ongoing rate of inflation to be closer to 2 percent. This is considered a healthier rate of inflation for the longer term. At 2 percent, there is less risk of slipping into a cycle of economic contraction, and at the same time, price changes over time are not significant enough to distort the planning of households and businesses.\n\nThere is also a sizeable employment gap between today's 6.6 percent rate of unemployment and estimates of full employment. We rely on a quantitative measure of unemployment to convey both quantitative and qualitative dimensions of the country's work picture. The FOMC's most recent estimates of full employment, using the official unemployment rate as a gauge, range from 5.2 percent to 5.8 percent. In my view, that difference of about 1 percent between today's rate and the Committee's estimate of full employment may understate the distance still to be travelled.\n\nEven with these caveats, my bottom line is that the economy is in a better place today than a year ago and before. I maintain that the outlook is positive and, in terms of its basics, much improved.\n\nPolicy stance today\nI'd like now to turn to an explanation of where the Fed's monetary policy stands. For all of last year, and since September 2012, the Fed pursued a program of large-scale asset purchases, or quantitative easing. Last December, the FOMC decided to reduce those purchases from $85 billion per month to $75 billion per month. In January, the Committee brought those purchases down by another $10 billion per month. These decisions were based on the economic progress achieved since the recovery began in June 2009, an improvement in employment conditions, and, importantly, the positive outlook for continued progress.\n\nAs long as the outlook remains solid and does not deviate dramatically from the path we believe it's on, I would expect the tapering of asset purchases to continue over the balance of the year. I expect the asset purchase program to be completely wound down by the fourth quarter of this year.\n\nIn our public remarks over much of last year, my colleagues and I stressed a couple of very important messages. First, even with the phase-out of asset purchases, the basic stance of policy remains highly accommodative. To translate, the Committee intends to keep interest rates very low. The second message was that the QE program and the Fed's policy interest-rate target are two separate tools of policy. Consequently, we can wind down the asset purchases—a program that was meant to provide temporary, supplemental \"oomph\" to the low interest-rate policy—and preserve the accommodative positioning of policy appropriate for the reality of our economic situation.\n\nThe financial markets—particularly participants in the bond markets—seem to have heard these messages. In the aftermath of the tapering decision in early December, longer-term interest rates did not rise and have not risen since then to any great extent. I think the transition currently underway has gone pretty well, and communication with the public and markets on this aspect of policy was rather effective.\n\nGuidance as lead policy tool\nThat claim sets up my next topic—the role of forward guidance about interest-rate policy as an actual policy tool.\n\nAs most of you know, the FOMC sets a target for the federal funds rate. This is the rate at which banks with surplus reserves at the central bank lend to banks short of reserves on an overnight basis. This one interest rate—which the Fed can more or less control—serves as the foundation of the whole maturity spectrum of interest rates and interest yields that matter to Main Street America. In that sense, the Fed's policy interest-rate decisions set the tone for broader financial conditions—tight or easy, as they say. And, importantly, participants in longer-term bond markets anticipate the future path of the Fed's policy rate in determining the rates charged for car loans and home mortgages, for instance.\n\nThe federal funds rate target—the FOMC's policy rate—has been set at effectively zero for more than five years. It would not be possible to push it lower even if economic conditions called for lower rates. Quantitative easing was a way to exert further downward pressure on rates in the absence of the ability, in practical terms, to set the policy rate below zero. These have been unusual times since 2008, requiring unusual measures.\n\nNow that the program of asset purchases is being wound down—to repeat, appropriately, in my view—more of the work of maintaining an accommodative environment falls to Fed communication in general and forward rate guidance in particular.\n\nTo put emphasis on that point, let me quote from a speech last spring by Janet Yellen, the Fed's new chair. She said, \"[T]he Federal Reserve's ability to influence economic conditions today depends crucially on its ability to shape expectations of the future, specifically by helping the public understand how it intends to conduct policy over time, and what the likely implications of those actions will be for economic conditions.\"\n\nIndeed, modern monetary policy is aimed at influencing economic outcomes through the \"expectations channel.\" Expectations drive decisions by consumers, households, businesses, and investors throughout the economy. These decisions, taken together, have a big influence on the trajectory of the economy.\n\nSo what we at the Fed say we intend to do as regards interest-rate policy should have a big impact on what happens. I would argue that under the current circumstances, forward guidance about the direction of rate policy is more than just added commentary; it is a policy tool itself. And for the period ahead—the next couple of years at least—forward guidance may be the lead policy tool, arguably the most potent method we have for influencing financial conditions and economic results.\n\nLet me repeat that point using different words. Getting the economy we want depends increasingly on the ability of the public and participants in financial markets to hear, understand, and believe FOMC communication about the direction of monetary policy and the intended financial conditions tied to policy decisions.\n\nThe state of play of guidance\nToday, the central question that forward guidance addresses, and the predominant focus of financial market participants, is the timing of liftoff. Liftoff is code for the date of the first increase of the policy interest rate.\n\nI'll lay out what the FOMC has said recently on this subject. A little over a year ago, in December 2012, the FOMC set an unemployment rate of 6.5 percent as a threshold for consideration of liftoff. The unemployment rate has been falling rapidly toward that 6.5 percent threshold, and today stands at 6.6 percent. Its decline has been faster than many expected, and the reasons have been more complicated than just unemployed people finding jobs.\n\nLabor economists follow the intensity of \"flows\" underlying employment statistics such as unemployment and labor force participation. At any given time, there are flows of employed and unemployed people into and out of the labor force.\n\nYou may be aware that some of the decline in unemployment has coincided with falling labor force participation. About half of the fall in participation can be explained by demographic trends— that is, baby boomers choosing to retire. At the same time, a nontrivial portion of the decline seems to be associated with a rising share of prime-age workers who are not in the labor force. Some of these individuals are categorized as \"marginally attached\" to the workforce—they are available for work but have not actively looked for a job in the last month. They represent what you might call a shadow workforce of people not actually counted among the unemployed. A subset of the marginally attached population is classified as \"discouraged workers.\" These people are not looking for a job because, for any number of reasons, they do not think there is work for them out there.\n\nI should also mention the people who have a job—and so are officially employed—but are working part time and say they would like more hours.\n\nAll of these categories of underutilized labor resources—underutilized human capital, if you will—grew during the recession and have stayed elevated through the recovery. As a result, I often point to what might be called qualitative weakness underlying the quantitative progress associated with the drop in unemployment to 6.6 percent.\n\nI would argue the official unemployment rate overstates progress to date. At the same time, the low readings of inflation are hard to square with stronger growth. I had these concerns in mind when I supported the FOMC's decision to adjust its guidance in December of last year. The Committee said it anticipates that the policy rate will remain at zero well past the 6.5 percent threshold. Further, in its official statement following the January FOMC meeting, the Committee said that the \"highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends....\"\n\nThere are two reasons for this guidance. One is the weakness in employment data that underlies the improving unemployment rate. The other is the weakness of inflation readings. I think that both factors should be equally important considerations in determining how long to keep the policy rate at its current level.\n\nMy current thinking on liftoff\nIn my Reserve Bank's most recent official forecast, we predicted liftoff of the policy rate in the second half of 2015. I remain comfortable with that forecast.\n\nEven with the intense interest in the date of liftoff, I expect that the work of forward guidance will not be finished just with the first increase of the fed funds rate. I expect communication and forward guidance to be especially demanding requirements for the FOMC, and for that matter other central banks, going forward.\n\nTo summarize my main points today, I see forward guidance on the Fed's policy rate as the lead monetary policy tool currently and for the foreseeable future. It is a challenge for policymakers.\n\nThe central policy question is the timing of liftoff.\n\nThe key criteria for a liftoff decision are a firming of inflation to near the FOMC's target of 2 percent and both a quantitative and qualitative closing of the employment gap.\n\nSo, that's the \"lowdown\" on monetary policy as I see it at this juncture. I don't know how to use the rest of the song's title. It would just get me in trouble. I'll now try to answer your questions.",

            "content": "Good afternoon and thank you to Philip Jackson, a former member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, for that kind introduction. I'd like to take a moment to recognize a few of our directors in attendance. I appreciate your dedication and service.\n\nI'm pleased to be with you today and happy to be back in Birmingham.\n\nMy overall message today will be optimistic. We are coming off two rather strong quarters of economic expansion. I think the year began with some carryover of momentum, and even with the recent decline in equity markets, I sense in my conversations with business contacts across the Southeast rather solid, well-grounded confidence about the year ahead.\n\nIn my remarks today I will offer an outlook for the year, but I will also give some time to a discussion of the tug and pull of mixed economic data. There always seems to be some ambiguity around the true state of the economy. I hope you will find it interesting to hear about some of the questions policymakers grapple with.\n\nI will close with comments on Fed policy. I'll share with you my mind-set on the appropriate positioning of monetary policy over the coming months. My colleagues in the Federal Reserve and on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) may not have the same mind-set and underlying views. I am speaking, therefore, only for myself, not the Federal Reserve or the FOMC.\n\nTransitional year\nFrom my perch at the Atlanta Fed, 2014 looks to be a transitional year. The Federal Reserve has a new leader. Janet Yellen was sworn in as the new Federal Reserve chair on Monday and will preside over her first FOMC meeting as chair in March. If you follow the public communication and policy decisions of the FOMC, you've seen an emphasis under Ben Bernanke on transparency in communication and assertive action in support of the recovery. I expect continuity under Chair Yellen.\n\nThis year is also transitional in terms of the mix of Fed policy tools used to move the economy ahead. In December, the Committee made the decision to begin tapering asset purchases. The first reduction brought purchases down from $85 billion per month to $75 billion per month. At the last meeting a week ago, the Committee decided to bring purchases down by another $10 billion per month. Absent a marked adverse change in the outlook for the economy, I think it is reasonable to expect a progression of similar moves, with the asset purchase program completely wound down by the fourth quarter of the year.\n\nAn orderly wind-down of asset purchases is contingent, as I suggested, on the economy staying substantially on track. It's hard to discern with absolute precision the track the economy is on. Incoming data are rarely unambiguously positive or negative. Data are always messy. Policymakers are challenged to separate true signal from noise and to decide how much weight to put on the arrival of disappointing data reports.\n\nWe had such a situation with the arrival of the December payroll jobs number. It came in at a 74,000 net gain. A number closer to 190,000 was expected. My reaction—and that of many of my colleagues—was to \"look through\" the December jobs report and assume the economy remains on the higher growth track enjoyed in the second half of 2013.\n\nThere was a notable difference between performance in the first half and performance in the second half of 2013. In the first half of the year, real gross domestic product grew at a rate of 1.8 percent annualized. This was a bit slower than the recovery average up to that point. In the second half of the year, growth picked up sharply, to an estimated annual pace of 3.7 percent.\n\nSome of the strength in the second half resulted from a buildup of inventory (which, of course, can't go on indefinitely), but we also saw strength in consumer spending, business spending on equipment, and exports. The pickup in consumer activity and business investment hints at rising confidence about future prospects for the economy.\n\nWe may get some not-so-great numbers in the first quarter of this year. First-quarter GDP growth may be affected by weather events as well as the inventory cycle. Employment numbers may also reflect these influences.\n\nStill, I think the fundamentals have improved, and the economy is likely to continue to perform in a higher gear over the full-year 2014. So, I will argue that 2014 may also turn out to be a transitional year in terms of economic performance.\n\nSustained higher growth ought to carry with it real progress on two key dimensions of economic performance—prices and employment. Both are explicitly set out as formal objectives of the Fed as determined by Congress. The Fed's dual mandate calls for stable prices along with full employment.\n\nTo give you a fix on how we are starting the year relative to these goals, inflation is currently running around 1 percent per annum.\n\nGiven my current baseline outlook for the economy, I project inflation to gradually rise to around 2 percent, reaching that rate toward the end of 2015.\n\nTwo percent is the FOMC's longer-term target for inflation. This rate is low enough that it does not materially distort the economic decisions of households and businesses. At the same time, it is just high enough to provide a safety margin against a debilitating cycle of deflation.\n\nJudging from a variety of indicators, it appears that expectations for future inflation are pretty well-anchored around 2 percent.\n\nUnfortunately, inflation is currently running well below this target. A persistent undershoot of inflation would likely be symptomatic of weakness in our labor and product markets, and reflective of risk to the economy going forward.\n\nI believe that a combination of appropriate monetary policy and the self-reinforcing pull of inflation expectations should bring inflation back in line with the FOMC's target, other things equal. That is my base-case forecast. But I am monitoring wage and price developments carefully for evidence that inflation will move back toward 2 percent.\n\nAs regards employment, my forecast calls for continuing steady improvement in labor market conditions, consistent with my growth outlook. The unemployment rate is not the sole indicator of labor market health, but it is an important benchmark. Unemployment—as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in its December monthly survey of households—is at 6.7 percent. We will get a new number on Friday.\n\nThe FOMC earlier set down a marker of 6.5 percent unemployment as a threshold for considering a change of interest-rate policy. We could cross that threshold before long. Recently, the Committee communicated that it expects to keep the federal funds rate at current levels well past 6.5 percent unemployment, especially if inflation is projected to stay below target. As I said earlier, absent a material change in the trajectory of the economy, the key policy question, as I see it, is how long to keep the federal funds rate target at zero.\n\nGaps/slack\nIn that regard, a question weighing on my mind as a policymaker is, how close or far are we from fulfillment of our mandated objectives—or, put differently, what is the extent of the current and near-term gaps we're dealing with?\n\nThe \"output gap\" is the distance between the economy's current performance and its potential. The \"employment gap\" is the distance between the current level of employment—often expressed in terms of the rate of unemployment—and an estimate of full employment. And the \"inflation or price stability gap,\" if you will, is the difference between current readings of inflation and the FOMC's official inflation target, 2 percent. The inflation gap can be on either side of this target. Today, as I have mentioned, it is to the downside of 2 percent.\n\nI believe we're still dealing with sizeable gaps in terms of overall output, inflation, and employment. If inflation were running above 2 percent, my diagnosis might have to be more nuanced, but today, the three gaps taken together suggest there remains a fair amount of slack in the economy. In the current context, the objectives are complementary.\n\nThe employment gap presents some analytical challenges. Much progress has been achieved in lowering the unemployment rate since the end of the recession. In fact, the unemployment rate has fallen faster than many forecasters expected.\n\nBut, as you have probably heard, this decline in unemployment has been accompanied by a sizeable drop in labor force participation—that is, the share of the working-age population in the labor market.\n\nSince the beginning of the recession at the end of 2007, the rate of labor force participation has declined by close to 3 percentage points—a very large and rapid decline by historical standards. In terms of today's population, that amounts to about 7 million people who are no longer part of the unemployment rate calculation. This development has led some to wonder whether a falling unemployment rate may have lost some of its value as an indicator of improving labor market conditions.\n\nThis is where the analytical challenges come in. If the decline in labor force participation is due to structural changes—such as population aging—that is one thing. Monetary policy cannot do much about the fact that we are getting older as a nation. But it is an entirely different matter if people are not participating in the labor market due to cyclical conditions. That would indicate the economy is not strong enough to create jobs and people are discouraged from looking for work. Monetary policy can do something to combat weak spending conditions that could be holding back economic recovery.\n\nSo, which is it? Has the labor force participation rate fallen because of structural changes or cyclical conditions? It's not entirely clear, but the answer seems to be \"both.\" The point is that even if we attribute much of the decline in labor force participation to structural developments, a significant part of the decline still seems to be a result of weak spending and the sluggish economic expansion.\n\nIn these circumstances, with indicators like the unemployment rate particularly difficult to read, readings of inflation can be especially informative. In general, we expect weak demand to be associated with weak prices. Therefore, watching inflation and wage growth closely will help us gauge whether we're getting the basic economic strength needed to improve the more complicated employment situation.\n\nAppropriate monetary policy\nIn closing, let me touch briefly on policy—the monetary policy of the FOMC. Notwithstanding the decision to taper asset purchases, the stance of policy remains very accommodative. Translation: short-term interest rates are quite low—and in my own outlook, they will remain low for quite some time. I expect the Fed's policy rate to stay put until well into 2015.\n\nThat assessment could be adjusted, of course, if economic conditions change a whole lot. But given my current views on the economy, I like the current positioning of policy.\n\nIt's in the right place for now, in my opinion. I think we policymakers should be patient—not too quick to respond to zigs and zags in the data.\n\nIn my view, the Committee should stay the course and let more clarity emerge on the sustainability of the recent pickup in growth, the path of inflation relative to the 2 percent target, and the nature of the employment situation.",

            "content": "History is likely to characterize the recovery from the Great Recession as slow and frustrating. The last four-and-a-half years have been frustrating, especially to those of us who give predictions about the economic path ahead. In previous years, many of us have forecast accelerating growth only to be disappointed by developments in the year that followed.\n\nI was not the most optimistic among my colleagues, but the outlook I offered in some of my earlier speeches here at the Atlanta Rotary didn't completely pan out. In recent years, there has been a tendency in my business to predict that the next year will be better. The repeat of \"false dawns\" has taught me to be cautious.\n\nI did a little better a year ago. In preparation for today, I took a look at that speech and can claim that my forecast for 2013 mostly played out. I predicted gross domestic product (GDP) growth of between 2 and 2 1/2 percent for the year. This pace of growth would be in line with the slow growth trend since the recession ended and the recovery began in 2009. Although I did not explicitly lay it out in last year's speech, I expected rather weak growth in the first half of 2013 followed by stronger growth in the second half.\n\nThe most recent estimate of full-year growth for 2013 is 2.5 percent, according to the consensus of private forecasters—and indeed, growth accelerated in the second half. The final number for third-quarter growth was 4.1 percent, and unofficial estimates for the fourth quarter, with the most recent export numbers, exceed 3 percent.\n\nCompared to previous Januaries, we are entering this year on a more solid economic footing. A year ago, I stressed the drag of uncertainties hanging over economic activity. Fiscal policy uncertainty was most prominent. Although it wasn't always pretty, Congress got past the fiscal cliff and the fiscal drama of October. I think the weight of uncertainty holding back the economy has diminished.\n\nSo here we are again—here I am again—at an appropriate juncture to take stock of progress achieved, the state of the economy, and the challenges and risks in the year ahead. And once again, I will offer an outlook for the coming year, this time with growing confidence. That's what I intend to talk about today. I hope to provide you some context for your own business decisions in 2014. I must emphasize I am speaking only for myself, not the Federal Reserve. My colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and in the Federal Reserve System may not see things the same way.\n\nProgress\nBy most measures, the economy has made significant progress since the recession ended. Financial markets have stabilized, and the banking sector overall is in a much healthier state.\n\nHousing has made a partial comeback. Housing starts are up significantly from recession lows. House prices are rising, and foreclosures are down.\n\nThe rebound in home values has helped households repair their balance sheets and given consumers more confidence. This trend, combined with the playing out of a long deleveraging process, has put the household sector in a healthier state.\n\nThe corporate community—to generalize—is in solid financial shape, with debt down and lots of cash available for investment. Business conditions are improving broadly. Manufacturing, for example, is making a comeback. Factory output, which had been growing slowly, accelerated late in 2013. Capacity utilization in manufacturing is now at its highest level since March 2008. Motor vehicle assemblies, which are an important and growing segment of our regional manufacturing base, have reached levels approaching the prerecession peak.\n\nManufacturing is benefiting from lower energy costs. Total U.S. oil and natural gas production stands at historic highs. We can thank technological advances for that. The strength of the U.S. energy sector, coupled with rising international demand for American products, has generated export growth. The long-term prospects for domestic energy supplies and cost reinforce my sense that the economy's fundamentals are improving.\n\nOutlook and risks\nNow let's look ahead. I expect the stronger pace of economic growth in the second half of 2013 to continue in 2014. My current view is that real GDP will expand between 2.5 and 3 percent this year, and I would not be surprised if we achieve results at the upper end of this range.\n\nGiven this outlook for growth, it's reasonable to expect further progress on the employment front. The trend in jobs growth improved throughout most of 2013, notwithstanding the surprisingly soft initial reading for December. The unemployment rate declined to 6.7 percent in December, about a year sooner than forecasters were expecting when the year began. Despite this improvement, about 4 million more people than before the recession are unemployed today. In a moment, I'll provide much more detail, but here's the point regarding employment. While we've made substantial progress, we are far from a satisfactory situation. Hold that thought!\n\nTo round out my outlook for 2014, let me say a word on inflation. Rising inflation is not currently a problem. If anything, inflation is too low—well below the FOMC's longer-term objective of 2 percent. I see inflation rates moving gradually toward that objective as economic growth gains momentum. Again, I want to come back to the subject of inflation, so please also hold that thought—too low, not too high.\n\nForecasting is not a very certain exercise. It breeds humility. Things can go wrong. I mentioned at the beginning that disappointment followed earlier forecasts. Things have gone wrong in past years that slowed the recovery. To name two, there have been global financial problems, particularly coming from Europe. More recently, fiscal policy uncertainty and some amount of fiscal drag have disrupted the pace of improvement. A replay of these factors is not in my baseline outlook.\n\nIn fact, if I gauge the risks around the outlook I've laid out here, I conclude that the risks (the downside risks, to be more precise) have lessened. The restraining effects of federal fiscal measures should diminish this year. That's one of the key reasons my growth outlook is more optimistic.\n\nEmployment\nSo now let me make my main point. While the country has made a lot of progress economically, and the economy appears to have some bounce in its step as we enter 2014, there's a fair distance yet to go before we should be satisfied. Both the employment picture and the inflation state of affairs have worrisome aspects.\n\nLet's first take a deeper look at employment. As I mentioned earlier, the unemployment rate—the share of the labor force not working—has come down significantly since the recession began. It doubled from 5 percent at the end of 2007 to almost 10 percent at the end of 2009, when employment trends began to improve. As of last Friday's report, the unemployment rate now stands at 6.7 percent. Sixty-five percent of the increase in the unemployment rate caused by the recession has been reversed.\n\nI don't often resort to slides in my speeches, but I want to back up my central point as vividly as possible. One way to look at the nation's employment conditions is utilization of the country's labor resources. I'll use a familiar image (a football field) as a backdrop to make the argument that the unemployment rate is far from the whole story. Progress in the employment sphere has been uneven.\n\n\n\nUsing the prerecession peak as the goal line, in terms of the unemployment rate, we've gotten the ball 65 yards down the field.\n\nBut the unemployment rate is influenced by labor force participation, and there has been a sizable decline in the share of the population in the labor force since 2009. This explains how you could get a big drop in the unemployment rate with anemic job gains, as occurred in December.\n\nSome of the decline in labor force participation since 2009 is due to the baby boomers retiring, but even among prime-age workers—those aged 25 to 54—the participation rate is down significantly. This suggests that other factors, such as low prospects of finding a job, are playing a role.\n\nTo examine this possibility, we can look at the sum of marginally attached workers. These are people who say they are willing to work and have looked for work recently but are not currently looking. During the recession, their numbers swelled. Using our football analogy, we've gained (or regained) only 12 yards of the ground lost (the increase in the marginally attached) from 2007 to 2009. It's accurate to say the country has a large number of people in the so-called \"shadow labor force.\"\n\nSome economists have suggested that, because of the challenge of interpreting the decline in labor force participation, it might be more illuminating to look at the share of the population that is working. When we look at the employment-to-population ratio for the prime-age group (aged 25 to 54), the picture is similarly discouraging. Since the end of 2009, employment gains for the core of the workforce have advanced down the field only 27 yards toward the prerecession peak.\n\nAlso, there is the issue of underemployment. Many Americans are working fewer hours than they would prefer because their employers are offering them only part-time work. The share of workers who are involuntarily working part time doubled during the recession and has moved only about 30 percent lower since the employment recovery began. In football terms, we've advanced the ball only 31 yards on this measure of labor utilization.\n\nTo sum up, these comparisons of employment data suggest that the labor market is not as healthy as the improved unemployment rate might indicate. The unemployment rate drop may overstate progress achieved.\n\nIt's worth noting that wage and salary income growth remains weak. I hear very little from business contacts about upward wage pressures except in a few specialized job categories. Wage pressures usually accompany growing demand and rising inflation but, although demand appears to be growing, inflation is very soft.\n\nInflation\nThe Federal Reserve has chosen an inflation target of 2 percent over the longer term.\n\n\n\nSuch a target is far enough away from the deflation danger zone and yet low enough to be ignored by businesses and households in their longer-term decision making.\n\nOver the past 12 months, inflation has averaged only 0.9 percent. Indeed, the broad patterns in the price data suggest we have been on a disinflationary trend for about two years, as shown in this slide.\n\nContinued disinflation could pose risks to economic performance. This slide shows the trend of one key measure of inflation (the personal consumption expenditures inflation index) over the last four years. At the Fed, we follow a number of inflation indices, and they show basically the same picture.\n\nThe inflation situation shown here seems disconnected from the recent growth momentum and the outlook that it will continue.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, I think inflation will stabilize and begin to move back in the direction of the FOMC's 2 percent objective as the economy gathers momentum. So I'm interpreting the soft inflation numbers as a risk signal. Through the lens of prices, the economy could be weaker than we currently believe.\n\nI talk with a lot of business people across the Southeast. Very few claim to have much pricing power. At the same time, inflation expectations—measured by surveys and inflation-adjusted financial instruments—have remained stable. There are no signs of disinflationary expectations being priced in. This gives me some confidence that inflation will firm.\n\nPolicy\nLet me conclude with a brief discussion of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. The overall posture of policy is very accommodative, as we central bankers say, and appropriately so, in my opinion.\n\nIn earlier communications, the FOMC set a threshold of 6 1/2 percent unemployment as a condition for consideration of raising rates. In our most recent statement after the December meeting, the Committee communicated its intent to keep the short-term policy rate unchanged \"well past\" the achievement of a 6 1/2 percent unemployment rate. I think this, too, is appropriate. As my football field representation showed, on what you might call a qualitative basis, we have a substantial employment gap. And, as of now, the inflation data indicate disinflation, which is also worrisome.\n\nAs I'm sure you know, the FOMC decided at its December meeting to begin reducing the amount of monthly asset purchases by $10 billion a month—that is, from $85 billion a month to $75 billion. This was the well-publicized \"tapering\" decision to phase out quantitative easing, or QE. This decision acknowledges progress made—especially in the employment realm—and improving confidence in the outlook.\n\nIf the positive outlook I've outlined plays out, I would support similar tapering steps over the course of this year. Of course, the Committee will assess how things are going, economically speaking, at each meeting, and decide on the next step.\n\nAt the end of one year and the beginning of another, it's tempting to attribute more and deeper historic significance to the turning of the calendar page than often turns out to be real. That said, 2014 does look to me to be a year of transition.\n\nThere will be a transition of leadership of your central bank—that is certain. Janet Yellen will become chair on February 1. I do not expect the leadership change to bring a change of basic policy direction, however.\n\nIf all goes as expected, there is a policy transition under way from a QE world, so to speak, to a post-QE world. As I said, that decision was made in December.\n\nAnd the economy itself seems poised to transition to better conditions. I hope I can return in a year and report I had it right.",

            "content": "Good morning and thank you for inviting me to speak to this prestigious group, the Broward Workshop. I'd like to take a moment to thank Tom Shea, a former director of our Miami Branch, and Al Dosal, who currently serves as a director. I would also like to acknowledge Mike Jackson, one of your members, who has been serving as chair of our Miami board.\n\nOur directors serve principally as economic advisers and play a vital role in supplementing economic data with useful regional and sectoral information. Let me publicly thank them all for their service.\n\nToday I plan to provide my take on the current state of the economy and the outlook for 2014. I will also share my personal views on the current stance of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. More specifically, I'll comment on the alignment of market expectations with the conditional framework for tapering bond purchases that Chairman Bernanke laid out on behalf of the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, in June.\n\nThe essence of the decision the Committee faces is whether to begin the process of winding down the use of an extraordinary monetary policy tool known to the public as quantitative easing, or QE. The current program has been operating since September 2012 and is the third episode of the use of this tool. The financial markets are exceedingly interested in the prospect of reducing, over the coming months, bond purchases that are currently running at $85 billion per month. These asset purchases are made up of a roughly equal mix of longer-term Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities.\n\nThe expectation of a decision to start tapering has been a factor in the pricing of bonds across the maturity and issuer spectrum and, therefore, the market's determination of long-term interest rates. The prospects for sectors like housing and autos are highly influenced by interest rates. It's fair to say that the near-term actions of the Fed are a front-and-center concern of the financial community, business community, and the general public.\n\nAs a preface to my remarks today, it's important that I emphasize I'm speaking for myself, not for the Federal Reserve, and my views are not necessarily shared by my colleagues on the FOMC or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nReview of progress and economic outlook\nLet me start by attempting to define the context of upcoming policy deliberations. In the four and a half years since the recession ended, the country's economic conditions have improved a lot, yet are short of what you'd call victory.\n\nThe economy has grown steadily, if slowly. Annualized GDP growth has averaged a little over 2 percent over this period. The level of real economic activity is about 5 percent higher than the pre-recession peak. And with that expansion, the economy has netted more than 7 million new jobs. Inflation has been low—averaging 1.7 percent measured on an annual basis over the postrecession period.\n\nA number of industries or industry sectors that contribute significantly to the overall economy have recovered a lot of ground. Improvement in the housing sector, for example, has been a positive factor, especially in the more recent stage of the recovery. Housing starts have almost doubled from their low point in 2009. The Case-Shiller house price index for the third quarter was up 11 percent from a year earlier and reached the highest level for the index since the third quarter of 2008. Other housing data tell a similar story of recovery. Existing home sales were up 13 percent last quarter from a year earlier and were at their highest level since early 2007. One of the concerns earlier this fall was the potential effect of higher long-term rates on the housing sector. Momentum in the housing sector has softened somewhat, but hasn't deteriorated markedly.\n\nStill, as I said, the recovery has been slow, and the acceleration of growth that many economists—including Fed economists—predicted has not really materialized.\n\nPositive developments that suggest the glass is half full are offset by areas of persistent weakness that bias some observers to the view that the economic glass is half empty.\n\nTo cite a couple of half-full/half-empty phenomena, unemployment has dropped from 10 percent to 7.3 percent today, but participation in the workforce has also fallen. And inflation, as I said, has remained low on average, but is actually too low to totally dismiss the concern that the economy is weaker than measured and vulnerable to a reversal.\n\nWe track a lot of data at the Atlanta Fed to consolidate a view of the trajectory of the economy. Recent evidence of forward momentum coming from the data has been mixed.\n\nAs a further example of mixed signals, let me relate a report on October construction spending received Monday of this week:\n\nYou can't help but think \"on the one hand\" and then \"on the other hand.\"\n\nAt a higher level, looking at the overall growth picture, the economy grew at a respectable annual rate of 2.8 percent in the third quarter, according to current estimates, which will be revised later this morning. That sounds like a pretty good number, but about one-third of that growth was greater inventory accumulation. The pace of spending (what economists call \"final sales,\" which eliminates inventory swings) rose just a shade above 2 percent last quarter, virtually right on its trend for the last three-and-a-half years.\n\nChanges in inventory investment are often followed by their opposite—in this case, the working off of inventories. As a consequence, growth this quarter is very likely to be only half that seen in the third quarter as those inventories are drawn down. Recent tracking estimates of fourth-quarter GDP growth are substantially below 2 percent.\n\nIn an economy as large, complex, and diversified as ours, the data are almost always going to be somewhat noisy. That said, it's my judgment that the recent incoming data are, on net, positive.\n\nTapering decision considerations\nI expect that a decision to begin tapering asset purchases will be considered in the coming meetings of the FOMC. In my assessment, the trajectory of recovery—the outlook for the economy—justifies consideration of such a move.\n\nMy outlook for 2014 calls for some firming in economic activity. Along with that expectation for stronger output growth, I am expecting labor markets to continue their gradual improvement and inflation to move in the direction of the FOMC's 2 percent target.\n\nMy Atlanta Fed colleagues and I will be monitoring the incoming data and taking stock of information gathered from business contacts—our directors being prominent among them. In this process, I'll be looking for positive evidence of momentum as well as the absence or retreat of factors that could restrain or even torpedo progress.\n\nLet me lay out my current thought process for coming to a decision to support or not support, as the case may be, tapering asset purchases.\n\nI'm looking for continuing positive evidence that employment is growing at a sufficient pace to sustain a steady, if gradual, march toward the Fed's objective of full employment. Job growth came in at 204,000 in October. Over the last 12 months (October to October), monthly jobs gains have averaged 194,000. The rate of unemployment has fallen to 7.3 percent from 7.9 percent a year ago.\n\nI'm also looking for evidence of important elements of growth—important components of GDP—acting as drivers. One such driver is the growth of consumer spending. I think there are reasons to be optimistic that consumer spending will strengthen. Real personal income growth has been firming. Household balance sheets are improving—in part because of rising home values and the rise of the stock market. Credit delinquencies are now below their pre-crisis lows.\n\nIn the category of what I'm hoping will be absent or shrink, I'm expecting a fall-off of fiscal drag in the coming year. Cuts in government spending have taken more than half a percentage point off GDP growth over the past year. The net drag of a downsizing government sector is projected to lessen, but not entirely dissipate, in 2014.\n\nI am also watching for any signs of disinflation. So, to turn that around, I'm looking for the absence of consistent disinflationary price trends. Inflation has, by a variety of measures, averaged about 1 percent over the past year, well under the FOMC's longer-term objective of 2 percent. Some of that shortfall has come from falling energy prices. But even if we look through the behavior of energy prices, inflation readings have been exceptionally soft. While I don't yet see convincing evidence that a disinflationary trend is under way, inflation trends bear careful watching.\n\nFinally, my thought process includes a scan of the horizon for potential sources of economic shocks of the kind that could precipitate a reversal, shocks that could throw the economy completely off track. There are always risks, but over the past year, I believe many of the most worrisome sources of risk have retreated.\n\nThe risk of severe financial instability coming from Europe has been managed down.\n\nWe've gotten past the fiscal cliff, and in October, the serious consequences associated with a fiscal default were avoided. The same fiscal matters come to a head again in January, of course, so we can't yet breathe easy. There is still significant risk—that has to be acknowledged.\n\nSome recessions in the past have been precipitated by sustained oil price spikes. The Middle East remains fairly unsettled, and there are a number of factors at play, but I think the risk of an oil or energy price shock affecting the United States is relatively low.\n\nAs I think through the various factors to take into account—the data evidence, the outlook, the balance of risks—I am pretty confident in the sustainability of the economy's progress. The recent flow of data is not pushing me off the outlook I espoused a few moments ago. Again, I am forecasting a firming in economic activity, a gradual improvement in labor markets, and an inflation trend moving in the direction of 2 percent.\n\nI didn't have such confidence in the fall of 2012, when the current program of asset purchases began. At that time, employment growth was slowing, and we were seeing continued weakness in housing, household deleveraging, and a much higher degree of uncertainty about the fiscal and banking situation in Europe.\n\nI also was not comfortable in September of this year with what appeared to be lagging job gains (they were later revised higher) and the fiscal negotiations coming in October.\n\nAnd I agreed with the decision at the October FOMC meeting to wait a while longer given the uncertain effect of the fiscal drama on consumer and business confidence and the complications the shutdown caused in tracking the economy through vital data.\n\nI now think it is appropriate in coming meetings to put a tapering decision on the table as long as the resulting overall posture of policy preserves a high degree of accommodation.\n\nKey points in Committee communications\nEven though communication of the Committee's direction with policy has been complicated and challenging over the last months, I think many in the financial markets have substantially internalized certain key points. They are:\n\nIf market expectations are that the asset purchase program will wind down over the coming year, I think that is reasonable.\n\nIf and when the FOMC arrives at a decision to wind down asset purchases, it's my view that it will be helpful to the transition process to provide as much certainty as possible about how this will be done. The minutes of the October FOMC meeting noted that\n\nI am among those who see merit in this approach as long as the economy follows roughly the path we expect. Once the decision is made, I favor providing the public as much clarity and certainty as possible about how the change will be executed.",

            "content": "Thank you for that kind introduction.\n\nOne of the ways the Federal Reserve's monetary policy shapes economic outcomes is through its influence on the expectations of the public about the policy environment. The Fed and particularly the financial markets are engaged in a continuous minuet of policy action and communication and asset pricing. The market's pricing of various interest-paying instruments—from overnight repurchase agreements to long-term bonds—sets the rate or yield curve. The price of credit affects decisions of consumers and businesses here in Montgomery and across the country on matters such as buying or refinancing a home, buying a car, and making a capital investment.\n\nIn an effort to orient the public's expectations, the Federal Reserve—specifically, the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC—employs a number of communications methods. A formal statement follows each FOMC meeting. Three weeks later, minutes of the meeting are published. The Chairman conducts a press conference after some FOMC meetings. The Chairman testifies at least semiannually before Congress. The FOMC publishes quarterly compilations of the economic forecasts of individual FOMC participants—Fed governors and Reserve Bank presidents. And Fed officials make speeches and do interviews. Many of these communications are reported and interpreted in the media.\n\nThe content of our public communication includes assessments of economic conditions, the outlook for the economy, risks to the outlook, and, importantly, the framework for making a future policy decision. Since policy must respond to evolving conditions and developments, the public and the markets are understandably interested in what is often called the \"reaction function\" of the Committee.\n\nThe Committee's reaction function is a matter of great interest at the moment because of anticipation of a decision about tapering. Tapering as commonly understood refers to the winding down of the Fed's program of asset purchases, or QE. Clarity regarding how a consensus-driven policymaking committee will react to a range of possible economic scenarios is a real test. It's especially challenging when the degree of economic uncertainty seems to be high.\n\nThe policymaking context today is murkier than I would like. Because of the federal government shutdown, some of the data we follow are likely to be less reliable than usual through December at least. Earlier in the year, uncertainty seemed to be dissipating. But in my recent soundings of business contacts across the Southeast, I hear sentiments that uncertainty is back and visibility is shortening.\n\nToday I'll do my best to be as clear as I can. I must emphasize that the views you'll hear are mine alone. They may not be shared by my colleagues on the FOMC and in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nFor the sake of clarity, I'm going to lay out my arguments right up front. Here are my key arguments: the Fed is pursuing two objectives—full employment and low and stable inflation. Currently, the economy is growing slowly. A lot of progress has been made since the end of the recession on employment, but there is a way to go before we should be satisfied. Inflation is too low. It is well below the FOMC's goal of 2 percent.\n\nMy baseline outlook calls for an improved economy in 2014—growing a bit faster than it has been. But that may not happen. There is a nontrivial chance that 2014 will look like 2013. Next year's economic outcomes will swing importantly on fiscal drag and consumer spending. Even with better growth, in all likelihood, at year-end 2014, inflation will still be too low and employment levels will be well short of the goal. Therefore, monetary policy overall should remain very accommodative for quite some time. The mix of tools we use to provide ongoing monetary stimulus may change, but any changes will not represent a fundamental shift of policy.\n\nAt the FOMC meeting two weeks ago, the Committee chose to hold to an accommodative monetary stance to support ongoing recovery. As most of you are aware, the FOMC is using two principal tools to provide this policy accommodation. The first is a near-zero level of the federal funds rate target along with communication of how long and under what conditions we will maintain that level. The second is bond purchases, so-called QE3. The Fed is buying $85 billion per month of longer-term Treasury securities and government-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities. In late October, the Committee decided to keep both of those policy tools in force.\n\nCurrent state of the economy\n As context for that decision, let me elaborate on the condition of the economy. As I said, the economy is growing slowly—averaging around 2 percent. At the same time, consumer inflation is low. Consumer activity is expanding modestly. The consumer remains cautious. Manufacturing activity is continuing to gain strength, but not by leaps and bounds. Business investment is restrained. To generalize, businesses are not placing big bets on the future—they seem to be expecting more of the same in terms of demand.\n\nEmployment is growing at a pretty steady, if unspectacular, pace. Monthly job gains over the last six months have averaged 174,000. It's fair to say employment conditions are improving. The official rate of unemployment calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics was 7.3 percent in October, down from 7.9 percent a year ago. Over the last year, the economy has created 2.3 million payroll jobs on net.\n\nThis is a good story, and an important story. When the current asset purchase program was announced in September 2012, private forecasters expected that the unemployment rate at the end of this year would be about 1/2 percentage point higher than it is today. In that sense, there has been substantial improvement in labor markets over the past year.\n\nOn the other hand, several measures of labor market health are less satisfactory. Long-term unemployment is at historically high levels. And the number of people working part time while looking for full-time work remains elevated. There are about 4 million more people unemployed today than before the recession. And there are significant numbers of discouraged workers who are not counted in the labor force who would return if conditions were more encouraging.\n\nEven though the economy is growing, and we're making progress on unemployment, there are real concerns about whether the recent modest pace of GDP growth is enough to maintain employment momentum.\n\nInflation trend\n Finally, I'll comment on inflation. People generally tend to worry about the upside risk of inflation. But as I said at the outset, inflation is too low. A persistent low rate of inflation raises concerns about a stalling out of economic expansion.\n\nIn January 2012, the FOMC established an official inflation target of 2 percent as measured by the personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, price index. By that measure, the trailing 12-month rate of inflation was 0.9 percent in September. The recent three-month trend is only marginally stronger at 1.2 percent.\n\nMy interpretation is that inflation has been reasonably stable, but at a low level—well below the desired level of 2 percent. It's not falling, but it's also not showing much tendency to move toward our targeted goal.\n\nI don't think the inflation situation is that alarming yet. There are few signs of disinflation (the slowing of the rise of prices), let alone outright deflation (that is, broadly based falling prices). And inflation expectations of the public remain stable. But I would like to see the inflation rate rise to around 2 percent and stay there.\n\nThe outlook\n Now let's look ahead to 2014. I'm assuming stronger economic activity next year—a growth rate in the range of 2 1/2 to 3 percent. Even with the  preliminary third-quarter GDP estimate of 2.8 percent, full-year 2013 is likely to come in closer to 2 percent. To achieve a faster pace of growth, it's my opinion that we'll need to see two developments. First, we'll need a pickup in consumer activity and, second, we'll need a fall-off of intensity of fiscal drag.\n\nThe fiscal drag weighing on the economy has a number of elements. They include the ongoing effects of the tax increases at the beginning of this year, the effects of the sequester, any lingering effects of the recent government shutdown, and the effects of fiscal policy uncertainty on business investment and consumer spending.\n\nAs regards the shutdown, we at the Atlanta Fed expect the direct impact of the shutdown to be relatively small and temporary. We expect to lose half a percent of GDP growth in the fourth quarter, with a similar amount added back, in all probability, in the first quarter of 2014.\n\nMy greater concern relates to fiscal policy uncertainty because it can affect consumer and business confidence. I've recently heard opinions among contacts in the region to the effect that consumer confidence took a hit with the debt ceiling drama and the shutdown. In fact, consumer confidence did fall sharply between August and October this year. Whether these effects are long-lasting remains to be seen.\n\nTo sum up, I remain cautiously optimistic that growth will pick up next year. This is my baseline outlook. But, at this juncture, I can't fully discount the possibility that the expected economic improvement won't materialize and that we'll see a replay of the weak growth of the past three years. This possibility is an influence on my thinking about the appropriate direction of monetary policy, the topic I'll turn to now.\n\nStance of policy\n Monetary policy is highly accommodative—as central bankers say. The FOMC is currently using two tools to maintain the desired degree of monetary accommodation—the policy interest rate and bond purchases. Importantly, the FOMC has stated that it intends to keep the short-term policy rate low at least until the unemployment rate falls below 6 1/2 percent. This \"forward guidance\" is meant to convey a sense of how long short-term interest rates will stay near current levels.\n\nThere is some confusion about how the Fed's forward guidance and asset purchase program relate to each other. I will give you my view.\n\nIn the toolkit the FOMC has at its disposal, there is a sense in which asset purchases and low policy rates are complementary. Asset purchases and forward guidance on interest rates are complements in the sense that they are both designed to put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates. Asset purchases obviously exert downward pressure through the act of buying in specific maturity sectors of the Treasury and mortgage-backed securities market. Forward guidance on the short-term policy rate (the fed funds rate) influences market beliefs about the path of policy, and that too influences longer rates. Lower long-term rates encourage spending on business investment and consumer activity in interest-rate-sensitive sectors like autos and housing.\n\nBut there is also a sense in which these tools are substitutes. By substitutes I mean that guidance pointing to a sustained low policy rate and asset purchases are discrete tools that can be deployed independently or in varying combinations. They can be thought of as a particular policy tool mix chosen to fit the circumstances at this particular phase of the recovery. In my view, the use of these two tools has been effective in combination over the last many months. Both have provided stimulus. I think of asset purchases as supplemental stimulus on top of low short-term interest rates—current and prospective.\n\nGoing forward, it may be appropriate to adjust the policy tool mix. That will depend on circumstances and the economic diagnosis of the moment.\n\nI want to close where I began and repeat the basic points of my remarks today. The economy is growing at a slow pace. Even with that slow growth, substantial progress has been made on the employment front, but there is more to be done. At the same time, inflation is too low, and that carries some risk of a weakening economy.\n\nI expect things to pick up in 2014, but it's possible the economy will stay on its current track and we'll see no acceleration. The right monetary policy for these circumstances is continued strong stimulus. That is not to say, however, that the mix of policy tools needs to or will stay the same.",

            "content": "Introduction\n\nThank you for that kind introduction. I would like to thank the University of Mississippi for inviting me to participate in today's banking symposium. I think it is a stroke of genius to schedule this symposium the day before a big football game.\n\nThis is my first visit to Oxford. If I were to indulge in word association, the city's name, \"Oxford,\" evokes Southern literature and fine writers—William Faulkner, John Grisham, Willie Morris.\n\nMorris wrote a book called \"Always Stand in Against the Curve, and Other Sports Stories.\" If you'll allow me an off-season metaphor, I feel like economic policymakers have been thrown a few curve balls lately.\n\nThe context of policymaking—monetary policy, in the case of the Fed—is murkier than I would like. Because of the federal government shutdown, some of the data we follow are likely to be less reliable than usual through December. Earlier in the year, uncertainty seemed to be dissipating. But in my recent soundings of business contacts across the Southeast, I hear sentiments that uncertainty is back.\n\nI feel the need as a policymaker to be clear as I can. Before proceeding, let me emphasize that it's always the case that I am speaking only for myself. My views are not necessarily shared by my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC) and in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nFor the sake of clarity, I'm going to lay out my arguments right up front. Here are my key arguments: the Fed is pursuing two objectives—full employment and low and stable inflation. Currently, the economy is growing slowly. A lot of progress has been made since the end of the recession on employment, but there is a way to go before we should be satisfied. Inflation is too low. It is well below the FOMC's goal of 2 percent.\n\nMy baseline outlook calls for an improved economy in 2014—growing a bit faster than it has been. But that may not happen. There is a nontrivial chance that 2014 will look like 2013. Next year's economic outcomes will swing importantly on fiscal drag and consumer spending. Even with better growth, in all likelihood, at year-end 2014, inflation will still be too low and employment levels will be well short of the goal. Therefore, monetary policy overall should remain very accommodative for quite some time. The mix of tools we use to provide ongoing monetary stimulus may change, but any changes will not represent a fundamental shift of policy.\n\nAt last week's meeting of the FOMC, the Committee chose to hold to an accommodative monetary stance to support ongoing recovery. As most of you are aware, the FOMC is using two principal tools to provide this policy accommodation. The first is a near-zero level of the federal funds rate target along with communication of how long and under what conditions we will maintain that level. The second is bond purchases, so-called QE3. The Fed is buying $85 billion per month of longer-term Treasury securities and government-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities. Last week, the Committee decided to keep both of those policy tools in force.\n\nCurrent state of the economy\n\nAs context for that decision, let me elaborate on the condition of the economy. As I said, the economy is growing slowly—averaging around 2 percent. At the same time, consumer inflation is low. Consumer activity is expanding modestly. The consumer remains cautious. Manufacturing activity is continuing to gain strength, but not by leaps and bounds. Business investment is restrained. To generalize, businesses are not placing big bets on the future—they seem to be expecting more of the same in terms of demand.\n\nEmployment is growing at a pretty steady, if unspectacular, pace. Monthly job gains over the last six months have averaged 174,000. It's fair to say employment conditions are improving. The official rate of unemployment calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics was 7.3 percent in October, down from 7.9 percent a year ago. Over the last year, the economy has created 2.3 million payroll jobs on net.\n\nThis is a good story, and an important story. When the current asset purchase program was announced in September 2012, private forecasters expected that the unemployment rate at the end of this year would be about 1/2 percentage point higher than it is today. In that sense, there has been substantial improvement in labor markets over the past year.\n\nOn the other hand, several measures of labor market health are less satisfactory. Long-term unemployment is at historically high levels. And the number of people working part time while looking for full-time work remains elevated. There are about 4 million more people unemployed today than before the recession. And there are significant numbers of discouraged workers who are not counted in the labor force who would return if conditions were more encouraging.\n\nEven though the economy is growing, and we're making progress on unemployment, there are real concerns about whether the recent modest pace of GDP growth is enough to maintain employment momentum.\n\nInflation trend\n\nFinally, I'll comment on inflation. People generally tend to worry about the upside risk of inflation. But as I said at the outset, inflation is too low. A persistent low rate of inflation raises concerns about a stalling out of economic expansion.\n\nIn January 2012, the FOMC established an official inflation target of 2 percent as measured by the personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, price index. By that measure, the trailing 12-month rate of inflation was 0.9 percent in September. The recent three-month trend in inflation was only marginally stronger at 1.2 percent.\n\nMy interpretation is that inflation has been reasonably stable, but at a low level—well below the desired level of 2 percent. It's not falling, but it's also not showing much tendency to move toward our targeted goal.\n\nI don't think the inflation situation is that alarming yet. There are few signs of disinflation (the slowing of the rise of prices), let alone outright deflation (that is, broadly based falling prices). And inflation expectations of the public remain stable. But I would like to see the inflation rate rise to around 2 percent and stay there.\n\n\n\nThe outlook\n\nNow let's look ahead to 2014. I'm assuming stronger economic activity next year—a growth rate in the range of 2 1/2 to 3 percent. Even with yesterday's preliminary third-quarter GDP estimate of 2.8 percent, full-year 2013 is likely to come in closer to 2 percent. To achieve a faster pace of growth, it's my opinion that we'll need to see two developments. First, we'll need a pickup in consumer activity and, second, we'll need a fall-off of intensity of fiscal drag.\n\nThe fiscal drag weighing on the economy has a number of elements. They include the ongoing effects of the tax increases at the beginning of this year, the effects of the sequester, any lingering effects of the recent government shutdown, and the effects of fiscal policy uncertainty on business investment and consumer spending.\n\nAs regards the shutdown, we at the Atlanta Fed expect the direct impact of the shutdown to be relatively small and temporary. We expect to lose half a percent of GDP growth in the fourth quarter, with a similar amount added back, in all probability, in the first quarter of 2014.\n\nMy greater concern relates to fiscal policy uncertainty because it can affect consumer and business confidence. I've recently heard opinions among contacts in the region to the effect that consumer confidence took a hit with the debt ceiling drama and the shutdown. In fact, consumer confidence did fall sharply between August and October this year. Whether these effects are long-lasting remains to be seen.\n\nTo sum up, I remain cautiously optimistic that growth will pick up next year. This is my baseline outlook. But, at this juncture, I can't fully discount the possibility that the expected economic improvement won't materialize and that we'll see a replay of the weak growth of the past three years. This possibility is an influence on my thinking about the appropriate direction of monetary policy, the topic I'll turn to now.\n\nStance of policy\n\nMonetary policy is highly accommodative—as central bankers say. The FOMC is currently using two tools to maintain the desired degree of monetary accommodation—the policy interest rate and bond purchases. Importantly, the FOMC has stated that it intends to keep the short-term policy rate low at least until the unemployment rate falls below 6 1/2 percent. This \"forward guidance\" is meant to convey a sense of how long short-term interest rates will stay near current levels.\n\nThere is some confusion about how the Fed's forward guidance and asset purchase program relate to each other. I will give you my view.\n\nIn the toolkit the FOMC has at its disposal, there is a sense in which asset purchases and low policy rates are complementary. Asset purchases and forward guidance on interest rates are complements in the sense that they are both designed to put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates. Asset purchases obviously exert downward pressure through the act of buying in specific maturity sectors of the Treasury and mortgage-backed securities market. Forward guidance on the short-term policy rate (the fed funds rate) influences market beliefs about the path of policy, and that too influences longer rates. Lower long-term rates encourage spending on business investment and consumer activity in interest-rate-sensitive sectors like autos and housing.\n\nBut there is also a sense in which these tools are substitutes. By substitutes I mean that guidance pointing to a sustained low policy rate and asset purchases are discrete tools that can be deployed independently or in varying combinations. They can be thought of as a particular policy tool mix chosen to fit the circumstances at this particular phase of the recovery. In my view, the use of these two tools has been effective in combination over the last many months. Both have provided stimulus. I think of asset purchases as supplemental stimulus on top of low short-term interest rates—current and prospective.\n\nGoing forward, it may be appropriate to adjust the policy tool mix. That will depend on circumstances and the economic diagnosis of the moment.\n\nI want to close where I began and repeat the basic points of my remarks today. The economy is growing at a slow pace. Even with that slow growth, substantial progress has been made on the employment front, but there is more to be done. At the same time, inflation is too low, and that carries some risk of a weakening economy.\n\nI expect things to pick up in 2014, but it's possible the economy will stay on its current track and we'll see no acceleration. The right monetary policy for these circumstances is continued strong stimulus. That is not to say, however, that the mix of policy tools needs to or will stay the same. Regardless, you can be assured the Fed will continue to \"stand in.\"",

            "content": "Introduction \nMy thanks to the organizers of this leadership summit for inviting me to be part of this important event.\n\nToday I want to talk about a trait that has characterized U.S. economic life, often with positive comparisons to other advanced economies. That trait is economic dynamism. This is a broad concept with dimensions such as innovation, entrepreneurship, new business formation, risk tolerance and risk taking, labor mobility, and job creation. The question I want to address is whether the economic dynamism of the United States is declining. Is America losing its economic mojo?\n\nOn this question, there are many opinions out there and no scarcity of anecdotes supporting those opinions. I will try to step beyond the world of anecdote and, to the extent possible, look at the evidence. I will explore what the data tell us about this question.\n\nA couple of caveats up front: I won't be able to give comprehensive and exhaustive treatment to this subject in the few minutes I have this morning, so I plan to look at three interrelated aspects of the subject—job reallocation (job creation and destruction), productivity growth, and new business formation. And I won't offer a definitive answer. My remarks are intended to raise awareness and contribute to an ongoing conversation.\n\nAs always, I am not speaking for the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). I'll present my personal views. My colleagues may not agree.\n\nThe economic context for this discussion\nI'll start with a very brief economic context for thinking about economic dynamism. As you may already know, the Federal Reserve pursues two main longer-run objectives through its economic policies: price stability and maximum employment. In the postrecession recovery period, the employment objective has been the more challenging of the two.\n\nThe recovery has been under way for more than four years now. Unemployment at its peak reached 10 percent. The official unemployment rate now stands at 7.3 percent—somewhat higher than the 5.3 to 6 percent range that many economists have historically referred to as \"full employment.\" We've made a lot of progress, but there's a way to go before the Fed can claim that the maximum employment objective has been achieved.\n\nSignificant progress has been accomplished just in the past year. The official unemployment rate has fallen from 8.1 percent to 7.3 percent, and payroll employment has grown by about 2.2 million jobs. Payroll job gains for the past 12 months have averaged 184,000 per month, but recently there appears to have been some slowing. The monthly average for the most recent three months is 148,000.\n\nThis progress on the Fed's employment objective has been recorded in spite of rather weak economic growth. Over the 17 quarters of recovery since the recession ended, gross domestic product (GDP) growth has averaged a little above 2.2 percent. This is a lackluster pace of growth, and the progress we're enjoying on the jobs front makes sense only in the presence of low labor productivity growth. That, in fact, is the reality. Labor productivity growth is averaging significantly below historic norms. I'll return to this concern in a moment.\n\nEmployment dynamics and job reallocation\nLet me introduce the concept of employment dynamics. Employment in America is in a constant state of churn. Workers, or potential workers, are entering and leaving the labor force. Employees are moving from one firm to another. Firms are changing the composition of jobs in their workforces. Firms are adding jobs in one category while eliminating jobs in another. All of this movement is a good thing, on balance. It is part of an economy that is continuously adjusting to shifting reality by reallocating resources from sector to sector, industry to industry, firm to firm, and job type to job type.\n\nA particular type of churn is job reallocation. The rate of job reallocation across firms can be measured.1 During the 1990s, job creation at expanding firms and destruction at shrinking firms, taken together, typically amounted to about 16 percent of total private-sector employment per quarter. To put that figure in context, private-sector payroll employment today is around 113 million. A 16 percent job reallocation figure would amount to roughly 18 million jobs created and destroyed per quarter. This is a picture, clearly, of a very dynamic economy.\n\nSince the early 2000s, however, the job reallocation rate has slowed. The most recent data for 2012 suggest that the quarterly reallocation rate is now closer to 12 percent, or 14 million jobs, per quarter.\n\nInterpreting this apparent loss of dynamism across firms is not straightforward. It could be that these slowing dynamics are not a bad thing if we get the same growth of productivity we've enjoyed in the past without so much churning of jobs. But that doesn't quite fit with the low productivity growth we've experienced during this recovery.\n\nAt the level of the business firm, we observe similar trends in measures of internal employment flows. An expanding firm is one whose hires exceed its separations (meaning quits, retirements, and layoffs). A firm that is expanding its payroll must hire employees both to replace some separations and to fill the newly created jobs. A firm that is shrinking its workforce has more separations than hires. The data show that both the rate of hiring and the rate of separations have also been declining since the early 2000s.\n\nSome of this decline reflects the rate at which people are voluntarily quitting their current jobs to do something else, including going to work for a different employer. On this dimension, too, there has also been a decline, with the drop most evident during the last recession.\n\nPutting these various pieces together, we see a picture in which fewer firms are expanding employment, and each expanding firm is adding fewer new jobs on average than in the past. At the same time, fewer firms are shrinking, and each is downsizing by less on average. Fewer people are being laid off or are quitting their job, and firms are hiring fewer people. In other words, the employment dynamics of the U.S. economy are slower.\n\nThe low rate of hiring has contributed to an unusually weak flow of unemployed people into the workforce. Even though the unemployment rate has declined from 10 percent at peak to 7.3 percent in the most recent reading, the flow rate from \"U\" (unemployed) to \"E\" (employed) dropped from close to 30 percent a month prior to the recession to 16 percent during the recession and has improved only marginally over the past four years. Low job-finding prospects are almost certainly contributing to a larger share of unemployed workers leaving the labor market. While boomer retirement demographics are a partial explanation, this outflow of potential workers from unemployment is a factor behind the sharp decline in labor force participation we've witnessed in recent years.\n\nI will mention one final dimension of employment dynamics, and that is a shift in the mix of jobs from full time to part time. The number of people who report they are working part time when they would prefer to work full time (what economists call \"part time for economic reasons\") rose sharply during the recession and remains high. You can conclude that the unemployment rate does not fully capture the true underutilization of labor resources today in our economy.\n\nJob reallocation and productivity growth\nI'd like to return to the subject of productivity growth, which is the second piece of the economic dynamism question as I've framed it. Recently, the rate of productivity growth has been significantly below its historical norm.\n\nIn my official economic outlook submitted a week ago as part of the FOMC's forecasting exercise, I have assumed we are experiencing a temporary spell of low productivity growth that will correct itself. I am assuming this will happen as demand kicks into higher gear and as businesses expand production somewhat faster than they expand their payrolls.\n\nThe likely direction of productivity measures in our economy is the subject of considerable debate. Another, more concerning possibility is that the slow advance of productivity reflects a fundamentally less dynamic economy. There are innovation pessimists, for example, who question the potential for transformative technological change in coming decades. I'll leave that for others in this conference to weigh in on.\n\nAt ground level, the productivity question is a bit of a puzzle, in my view. In many conversations with business leaders in recent years, I've heard accounts of lots of productivity-oriented investment—investment in software, automation, and robotics, for example. This would have resulted in enhanced productivity within a firm. But there is a between-firms aspect as well. Historically, the process of shifting resources from less-productive sectors and firms to more-productive activities has been an important driver of overall productivity growth. But—as already noted in my discussion of employment dynamics—resource reallocation appears to have been on a declining trend in recent years.\n\nNew businesses, employment dynamics and productivity\nFinally, let me comment on the third component of my \"mojo triad\": new business formation. The American economy benefits from an extraordinary ongoing dynamic that is, well, dynamic. New businesses are launched. Some survive the start-up phase, but it's just as likely that they fail in the early years. Some of the survivors grow rapidly. Much job creation and destruction accompanies this process of start-up and failure or survival. Young firms account for a significant share of both job creation and job destruction. In that sense, young firms are a key factor in the cycle of job reallocation in the economy.\n\nThe vast majority of new businesses do not have highly ambitious growth aspirations. They start small and stay small. However, a few new firms desire to grow substantially, and an even smaller fraction of these will actually succeed and take off. These high-growth survivors generate a lot of new jobs and contribute to raising overall productivity, often by taking market share from less-productive incumbents and through product innovation.\n\nThe data on new business formation show a slowdown in recent years—paralleling the decline in overall job creation and destruction. The rate of new business formation took an especially large hit during the last recession and has been slow to recover. The data suggest that there has been very little growth in the number of businesses being launched since the end of the recession, and those that are starting are creating fewer new jobs on average.\n\nWhy is that? There has been a general atmosphere of uncertainty in the wake of the financial crisis and recession. Also, reduced access to start-up financing and tighter credit have constrained the flow of new firms. Until recently the collapse in real estate values all but extinguished an important source of start-up financing for many entrepreneurs. Similarly, tighter standards on personal credit cards limited another important source of start-up funds. This situation is improving as real estate values rise and credit standards ease somewhat. However, it's also possible that the sluggish pace of new business formation reflects other, possibly more entrenched factors such as regulatory barriers to starting a business. Demographics may also play a role. An older population is not as ambitious and risk-taking as one that is on average younger.\n\nWe at the Atlanta Fed have been trying to learn more about aspects of the entrepreneurial ecosystem that have been particularly important in fostering high-growth businesses. Borrowing a term coined by the Kauffman Foundation, my research staff is undertaking what we call the \"Gazelle Project.\" We've been looking at the early-stage development stories of a number of successful fast-growing young businesses (so-called gazelles) in the Southeast. One of the interesting preliminary findings of this research is that knowledge of and access to high-quality talent, social networks, and local support resources are critical. That is, businesses start in a particular location for a reason—because entrepreneurs know the place has the key resources they need. It's encouraging that so many local communities have taken up the challenge of strengthening their entrepreneurial environments. I don't think it's an overstatement to say there is a nascent entrepreneurship movement underway led by community leaders.\n\nClosing thoughts\nSo, against this backdrop of declines in the rates of job and worker reallocation, slower new business formation, and a subpar rate of productivity growth, is there a call to action? I think yes.\n\nCan public policy do anything to foster greater dynamism? At a high level, I think public policy can do three things.\n\nFirst, public policymakers can try to remove obstacles to growth and entrepreneurship—obstacles such as policies that discourage new business formation and disincentives to invest.\n\nSecond, the public sector can contribute with positive, pro-growth actions that address economic fundamentals, such as investment in human capital and critical, productive infrastructure.\n\nAnd finally, I think there is a role for monetary policy. Monetary policy can help deliver appropriately favorable interest rate conditions that can promote a faster economic recovery, always in a context of low and stable inflation. Monetary policy can also play a critical role in creating the most favorable conditions for other policy actions to do their work.\n\nThe question I posed at the outset was whether the economic dynamism of the United States is declining. Is America losing its economic mojo? There is some evidence to the affirmative. I believe some of what we observe can be explained by the recent recession and frustratingly slow recovery. There are reasons to believe that some of the decline is cyclical in nature and will reverse itself over time. Anything more will call for creative leadership—the subject of this conference. My congratulations to the Louise Blouin Foundation for convening this important event.\n\n1 The data referenced on job creation/destruction and hires/separations are measured at the establishment (business unit) level within a firm. Because some reallocation occurs across establishments within the same firm, the data overestimate the total amount of churn at the firm level. However, the vast majority of firms have only a single establishment, and the trends are similar at both the firm and establishment level.",

            "highlights": "Atlanta Fed President and CEO Dennis Lockhart, in an August 13 speech to the Kiwanis Club of Atlanta, Georgia, reviews the Fed's monetary policy actions to support economic recovery, including large-scale asset purchases&mdash;often called quantitative easing, or QE.",
            "content": "Introduction\nThank you for that very kind introduction. And I would like to thank the Atlanta Kiwanis for inviting me to speak here today.\n\nToday, I want to review with you the policy actions the Federal Reserve has taken to support recovery from what has come to be known as the Great Recession. I also want to talk about a sometimes controversial aspect of the Fed's policy—large-scale asset purchases. The public knows this policy as quantitative easing, or QE. Specifically, I want to discuss prospects for winding down the most recent version of this policy, known as QE3, and how I, as one policymaker, am thinking about the decision—or multiple decisions—to do so.\n\nI would like to emphasize that I am speaking for myself, and that my views are not necessarily the views shared by my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nA brief look back\nTo understand the context of upcoming deliberations on this policy, I think it would be helpful to take a look back. The Federal Reserve responded to the Great Recession and supported the recovery with aggressive policy actions, including some that are considered unconventional by historical standards.\n\nIn late 2008, the FOMC cut its policy rate to nearly zero, and it remains there today. The Fed's policy rate is the federal funds target rate, the rate at which banks lend and borrow from each other to meet their reserve requirements. The level of the fed funds rate influences other short-term interest rates and establishes a foundation on which a wide array of market interest rates, including long maturity rates, are determined by market forces.\n\nIn addition to lowering the federal funds rate to effectively zero, the FOMC brought to bear less conventional methods of monetary stimulus. Beginning in early 2009, the Federal Reserve began purchasing long-term assets in the form of Treasury notes and agency mortgage-backed securities.\n\nThere have been three rounds of asset purchases. These purchases have been intended to put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and raise prices of financial and other assets. I supported these decisions and believe the asset purchase programs have been successful in helping the economy to recover.\n\nThe recession ended in June of 2009, and since then the economy has averaged annual growth at a rate of 2.2 percent over 16 quarters. In October 2009, unemployment reached 10 percent. Today, unemployment stands at 7.4 percent. Inflation over this period has averaged 1.8 percent. Over the longer term, the Committee projects that achievement of full employment would see an unemployment rate between 5.2 and 6 percent. And the Committee's target for inflation over the long run is 2 percent.\n\nAt the Committee's last meeting in late July, there was no substantial policy shift, and the Committee decided to continue asset purchases at the pace of $85 billion per month. So that is where monetary policy stands at this moment—a near-zero policy rate and ongoing asset purchases.\n\nTalk of tapering\nAs early as the January meeting this year, FOMC participants were discussing the possibility of varying the pace of purchases. Mention of these discussions in the minutes of the FOMC meetings initially surprised financial markets and increased market volatility.\n\nFed Chairman Ben Bernanke and others subsequently clarified the Committee's position by making several important points. First, the asset purchase program and the FOMC's guidance on interest rate policy are two separate tools. The federal funds rate is the lead policy tool aimed at improving economic conditions and achieving the Fed's statutory objectives. The asset purchase program plays a complementary and supplementary role. It clearly was intended to have a beginning and end. It is not QE infinity.\n\nSecond, keeping short-term interest rates near zero for a considerable time after asset purchases end will help maintain a high degree of monetary policy accommodation. Very low rates will continue for a while. The Committee's guidance on the policy rate is that it will stay near zero for at least as long as the unemployment rate stays above 6.5 percent.\n\nAnd third, the asset purchases might be dialed back and ultimately phased out based on evidence of progress in the economy and an outlook of sustained progress, especially in labor markets.\n\nThis is a key point. Decisions to reduce asset purchases will be data-dependent. Economic performance will dictate the path of policy.\n\nOver the past several weeks, the first question on the minds of investors and much of the public regarding monetary policy has been: What specifically is the FOMC going to do with asset purchases?\n\nParticipants in the financial markets understandably would like to know the dates, amounts, and proportion of reductions in purchases. But up to now, the uneven performance of the economy has not permitted the FOMC to provide this certainty.\n\nNonetheless, the expectation that purchases will be tapered and ultimately ended is now firmly established. Financial market participants put a higher probability on near-term tapering happening than not.\n\nWhat the data tell us\nAs I just suggested with the phrase \"uneven performance,\" I would argue that recent data do not present a clear picture.\n\nOne feature of the data in hand that contributes to a lack of clarity is the fact that employment gains have been strong enough to lower the unemployment rate while GDP growth has remained lackluster.\n\nAs a matter of arithmetic, healthy employment growth coupled with tepid GDP growth implies weak labor productivity growth. And in fact, productivity growth in recent quarters has been significantly below historical norms.\n\nThe likely direction of productivity measures is the subject of considerable debate. On one side of the debate are innovation pessimists, if you will, who argue that the country is entering a long period of slow productivity growth because of the relative dearth of transformative technologies coming along.\n\nOthers—and I include myself in this camp—believe that the recent low growth of productivity is probably just a temporary downdraft after the rather strong productivity growth when the economy emerged from recession. Productivity grew in the early months of recovery because firms held staffing levels flat while business activity expanded. That's one way to get productivity growth—squeezing greater efficiency out of the existing workforce instead of expanding payrolls. Another spur to productivity growth is capital spending, and capital expenditures appear to be on the rise. Orders for nondefense capital goods have recently been on the upswing. An expansion of business investment bodes well for growing productivity going forward.\n\nIf productivity growth rebounds to more typical levels, the coincidence of job gains at a pace of around 190,000 per month in recent months and GDP growth below 2 percent cannot persist. Again, it's a matter of arithmetic. Either GDP growth will rise to levels consistent with recent employment growth, or employment growth will fall to levels more consistent with the weak GDP data we've been witnessing.\n\nBaseline outlook\nHow this dynamic plays out is quite relevant to upcoming policy deliberations on asset purchases, in my opinion. The answer will be in the data. I've got a working assumption on this question, and it is captured in the Atlanta Fed's baseline forecast for the second half of this year and 2014.\n\nThis outlook calls for a pickup in real GDP growth over the balance of 2013, with a further step-up in economic activity as we move into 2014.\n\nI base this outlook on a number of factors. I expect consumer activity to strengthen, I expect business investment to accelerate somewhat, and I expect the rebound we have seen in the housing sector to continue. I expect the recent improvement in exports to last. And I expect to see an easing of the public-sector spending drag at the federal, state, and local levels.\n\nI think this is the most probable forecast. But it's not a sure thing.\n\nThe play-out of deliberations in Congress in September on the debt ceiling and other fiscal matters could contribute to a weaker scenario by influencing business and consumer confidence. I don't think the risk of a fiscal confidence shock is negligible. Remember that just two years ago, Standard & Poor's (S&P) downgraded the credit rating of the U.S. federal government based on an assessment of the ability of fiscal policymakers to address serious issues relating to the nation's growing debt obligations. S&P specifically cited \"political brinksmanship\" as a reason for the downgrade, and this had a damping effect on confidence. Between July and October of 2011, consumer confidence fell sharply, the worst reversal of confidence we've seen over the recovery period. Some of that decline was certainly attributable to the spectacle of dysfunction in Congress and the downgrade.\n\nOther considerations\nWhen I weigh the balance of risks around the medium-term outlook I laid out, I have some concerns about the potential for ambiguous or disappointing data. I also think that it is important to be realistic about the degree to which we are likely to have clarity in the near term about the direction of the economy. Both the quantity of information and the strength of the signal conveyed by the data will likely be limited.\n\nAs of September, the FOMC will have in hand one more employment report, two reports on inflation, a revision to the second-quarter GDP data, and preliminary incoming signals about growth in the third quarter. I don't expect to have enough data to be sure of my outlook. For that reason, I don't think a decision that commits the Fed to a full phase-out of asset purchases and lays out a precise, beginning-to-end path for doing so would be advisable.\n\nIn my mind, the first adjustments to asset purchases, when they occur, should be the beginning of a process with steps that will be determined as later information arrives and certainty about the direction of the economy accumulates. As I see it, a decision to proceed—whether it is in September, October, or December—ought to be thought of as a cautious first step.\n\nPolicymaking is quite appropriately forward-looking because monetary policy actions affect the economy with a lag. The rolling outlook from here is what really matters in making future decisions on asset purchases. I will need to get comfortable that the employment progress we've enjoyed is not stalling and that disinflation pressures are not building.\n\nAll that said, in considering a decision to reduce purchases, I think it is important to acknowledge the progress that's been made since the launch of QE3. The most recent program of asset purchases has been in force for just short of a year. In August a year ago, the unemployment rate stood at 8.1 percent. A year later, the unemployment rate has fallen to 7.4 percent and monthly job gains, looking back over the year, are averaging just below 200,000. Consumer activity has grown, house prices and housing activity have picked up, and equity markets have shown strength.\n\nWe have continued to see steady progress in economic fundamentals, in my opinion. Progress is evident, and we should not lose sight of that.",

            "content": "Introduction\n\nI want to thank the Marietta Kiwanis for inviting me to speak here today. I have held Kiwanis in high esteem for a long time. In high school in California, I was a member of the Key Club. My father was a Kiwanian. He would take me to Kiwanis meetings from time to time. I remember that his club had the tradition of imposing fines of a dollar on any members whose name had been in the newspaper or had gotten community recognition in some way. I remember thinking I was watching my allowance evaporate when my father put money in the pot.\n\nI am sure many of you have been closely watching the Federal Reserve's recent moves and the financial markets' reactions to those moves. Maybe you've felt emotions similar to those I had 50 years ago when I thought I was seeing my allowance dissipate.\n\nThis afternoon, I will share my views on state and national economic conditions and the outlook. I will also discuss the Fed's recent communication about the direction of monetary policy and comment on its interplay with recent market turbulence.\n\nAs you listen, please keep in mind that my comments are my personal views and may not reflect those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System or on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nGeorgia and the national economy\n\nLet me begin with some thoughts on economic conditions here in Georgia. We at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta spend a lot of time monitoring the economy in our district, which includes not only Georgia but also Alabama and Florida and portions of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Tennessee. Through what we call our Regional Economic Information Network, we gather grassroots information about conditions across the Southeast, which helps us contribute to national monetary policymaking. Because we're headquartered here in Atlanta and so many of our contacts are nearby, we feel we have pretty good grassroots intelligence on Georgia's economy.\n\nOur state's economic performance has steadily improved since the recession ended and particularly over the past year. Since January 2012, jobs growth has averaged a little more than 5,700 per month. This is much improved from the previous two-year average of only 3,000 per month. It's important to note that we are climbing out of a pretty deep hole. Given the current pace of job creation, we are still about two years away from our previous employment peak.\n\nGeorgia's current unemployment rate stands at 8.3 percent—still high by historical standards but down from its peak of more than 10 percent. The state's unemployment rate ticked up in May, but this was largely the result of more people entering the labor force and actively looking for work, a positive sign.\n\nEmployment continues on a positive trend in most sectors in our state. The monthly labor market data for the state are quite volatile, but looking through the noise, we can see that the fundamental signals suggest the state is gaining momentum even though we have not yet returned to our prerecession pace of growth.\n\nGeorgia's economy during the recovery has mostly tracked national trends. I think that will continue. So let me now turn to the national picture.\n\nSetting the scene\n\nI'll start with some scene setting. The recession that began in late 2007 and ran to the summer of 2009 was the deepest since the Great Depression. The national economy has been in recovery—that is, expanding—for almost four years now.\n\nIf you look through month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, the annual growth rate of gross domestic production (GDP) over the recovery period to date has been around 2 percent. This very modest pace of growth has brought gradual progress in reducing unemployment. Unemployment peaked nationally at 10 percent and now stands at 7.6 percent. Over this period, inflation has been moderate. And inflation expectations of the public have remained well anchored.\n\nCurrent state of the national economy—vital signs\n\nGDP growth has not been uniform quarter to quarter. Recently, the numbers have jumped around somewhat. The final reading for the fourth quarter of 2012 was an annualized 0.4 percent, quite weak. The first quarter of this year came in at 1.8 percent after a pretty sizeable downward revision from 2.4 percent. The second quarter number is expected to be in roughly the same neighborhood—an annualized rate between 1.5 percent and 2 percent. So if the second quarter numbers come in as economists currently expect, the past three quarters will post a pace of growth a shade under 1.5 percent, below the recovery-average pace of about 2 percent. These incoming data readings leave some question about what to expect going forward.\n\nThe vital signs of the economy are mixed. I'll comment on some of these vital signs under three headings. I'll use the familiar dashboard device of green, amber, and red.\n\nGreen news first. The housing sector is clearly rebounding. Residential construction is increasing. Auto sales are holding at a very healthy annual level, just above 15 million units. Retail sales are holding up rather well in spite of the tax changes at the beginning of the year. The energy sector is very active as measured by both exploration and production. Confidence levels—both business and consumer—are rising.\n\nIn the more neutral, amber category, exports are contributing little to growth nationally. Weakness in Europe and slowing in Asia have softened U.S. export performance. Business investment has slowed recently. Businesses still seem to be hesitant to invest or hire for expansion.\n\nIn the red category, some amount of fiscal drag from the sequester appears to be holding back the economy. Manufacturing and industrial production have slowed considerably. And growth of household income in the early months of the year had been weak and trailing the rate of consumption growth. This morning's numbers showed some reversal of that picture. Still, any gap between income growth and consumption growth bears watching.\n\nAlso, there is the curious matter of inflation. Inflation—as indicated by a composite of indices and analytical cuts—is low. It's arguable that inflation is running too low. In January of 2012, the FOMC set an official inflation target of 2 percent to be achieved over the long run. Key measures of inflation have recently been tracking below 2 percent. It's possible these low inflation readings indicate an economy that is weaker than I, for one, believe it is.\n\nThe Atlanta Fed regularly surveys a sizeable sample of businesses across the Southeast. In our recent surveys, very few businesses claim to have much pricing power. In our most recent survey of business inflation expectations, a significant number of respondents said they expect input costs to remain flat or to decline over the next 12 months.\n\nIt's my view that the inflation situation calls for close monitoring. If inflation expectations of the public and those indicated by financial markets soften appreciably, we policymakers would have to reevaluate the appropriateness of policy for the situation.\n\nThe outlook\n\nThis scenario is not my base-case outlook for inflation. I expect the rate of inflation to rise gradually toward the target of 2 percent.\n\nMonetary policy is set based on the outlook for the economy. It is in this context of weak inflation readings, mixed vital signs, and choppy quarter-to-quarter growth statistics that each participant in the Federal Open Market Committee, myself included, recently updated the forecast.\n\nHere in a few words is my growth forecast: I expect the moderate pace of growth we have been experiencing to continue, resulting in a GDP number for the year as a whole in the range of 2 to 2.5 percent. To achieve that, the second half will have to be a little stronger than the first half, and I expect 2014 to improve slightly on the pace of the second half of 2013.\n\nWith moderate growth and low inflation, I think it is appropriate to put emphasis on growing employment and improving labor market conditions. The official rate of unemployment that is calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics stands at 7.6 percent. The rate of unemployment has declined 0.6 percentage point over the last year and about 2.5 percentage points over the last three years. Clearly, this is progress.\n\nLike the larger story of slow growth and gradual recovery, employment conditions have improved only gradually. Payroll employment increased an estimated 175,000 in May, similar to the average over the past 12 months. I am forecasting a continuation of this trend. If we get month-to-month job growth of this magnitude or a little better and if labor force participation remains stable, we should see an unemployment rate of around 7 percent by the middle of next year. Such progress will be pivotal for the management of monetary policy over the next year.\n\nIt's important to remember, however, that the official unemployment rate and the monthly payroll jobs growth number don't represent a complete picture of labor market conditions.\n\nFor example, the movement of the unemployment rate is influenced not just by the flow of workers from unemployment to employment, but also by the flow of workers in and out of the labor market. Before the recession, about 1.6 million unemployed workers dropped out of the labor market each month. Today, the flow from unemployed-but-looking to out-of-the-labor-force is 2.5 million a month.\n\nThe official unemployment number, therefore, swings on participation in the labor force. As confidence in economic prospects improves, we would expect this to result in the return of people who are currently out of the workforce, potentially causing the unemployment rate to rise, as we saw in last month's data. So drawing conclusions strictly from the unemployment rate is not straightforward.\n\nThe (appropriate) stance of policy\n\nTo sum up the outlook, as I see it, growth will accelerate slightly from its current moderate pace, inflation will rise gradually toward 2 percent, and unemployment will decline steadily at a modest pace. To realize this forecast or something close to it, monetary policy, which is \"highly accommodative\" (in central banker speak), will have to remain so for quite some time. The Fed's policy interest rate—the federal funds rate—is as low as it can go. The FOMC has stated the policy rate will remain there at least until the unemployment rate approaches a threshold of 6 1/2 percent. Nothing has changed as regards that policy position. The timing of the first move to raise the policy rate will depend on overall economic conditions, but I would estimate \"liftoff,\" as it is called, to come sometime in 2015.\n\nAt the most recent FOMC meeting last week, the Committee decided to continue for the time being to apply additional monetary stimulus in the form of asset purchases at the pace of $85 billion per month. The public knows this supplemental stimulus as \"quantitative easing,\" or QE. The purchases are split pretty evenly between agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and Treasury securities. I supported this decision.\n\nIn his press conference following last week's FOMC meeting, Chairman Bernanke stated that if the unemployment situation continues to improve, the QE program could slow down starting later this year. This process of reducing asset purchases could continue in measured steps through the first half of next year, with purchases ending when and if sufficient progress has been made in employment conditions. At midyear, the composite forecast of the committee would have the rate of unemployment around 7 percent.\n\nAs the Chairman made clear, there is no \"predetermined\" pace of reductions in the asset purchases, nor is the stopping point fixed.\n\nThe pace of purchases, the composition of purchases, and the ultimate size of the Fed's balance sheet still depend on how economic conditions evolve. All elements of the asset purchase program will be considered on a meeting-by-meeting basis in light of the incoming data and economic outlook.\n\nIn my view, the comments by the Chairman do not constitute an enormous shift in policy. The asset purchase program is best thought of as a supplement to the FOMC's interest rate policy, designed to add a little more heft to efforts in support of ongoing recovery. As I said a moment ago, I still anticipate that the very low interest rate policy will remain in place for a considerable time after the end of asset purchases, and thus policy will remain highly accommodative.\n\nThis policy course will not be particularly difficult if the signals are clear that the economy is evolving as envisioned. But the world is rarely so cooperative. I would argue that uncertainty is lower today than a year or two ago, and consequently confidence in the outlook is justifiably higher. But stuff happens. I don't think we can completely rule out greater fiscal drag than anticipated, or intensified effects of global economic weakness, or structural challenges becoming more apparent, or shocks that move the economy off course. We know from the events of 2008 that financial markets can shake and sometimes shock the overall economy.\n\nFinancial markets have been volatile recently. They may be reacting to a number of things. Certainly among these is Fed communication. It could be argued that financial markets are reflecting a different interpretation of Chairman Bernanke's commentary. I don't want to be too cute about a serious matter, but to make an analogy, it seems to me the Chairman said we'll use the patch (and use it flexibly), and some in the markets reacted as if he said \"cold turkey.\" In any event, the upshot has been a rise of market volatility, higher long-term interest rates, and a decline in bond and equity prices.\n\nThe financial markets are in constant interplay with the real economy. As a policymaker, I'm watching closely to see if there is negative spillover into the real economy—Main Street. That, I think, is the key consideration.\n\nIf the broad economy evolves close to the outlook I laid out—which itself is close to the composite forecast of the 19 FOMC participants—then the economy will be on track to a better place. In that circumstance, I think the position that the economy does not need quite as much stimulus is fully supportable.",

            "content": "Community Development Research Conference\nResilience and Rebuilding for Low-income Communities: Research to  Inform Policy and Practice \nWashington, DC\nWelcoming Remarks\n\nGood morning. I'm pleased to  welcome all of you to the second day of the System Community Development  Research Conference. This is the eighth biennial conference, and it is truly a  collaborative effort among the 12 Reserve Banks and the Board of Governors.\n\nThis year, the Atlanta Fed has  had the honor of organizing this event, working with colleagues at the Board of  Governors here in Washington. My thanks to everyone who has contributed to this  conference and made the agenda so rich and compelling.\n\nMy duty this morning is to kick  off the day's proceedings. Having your attention for a few minutes gives me an  opportunity for input of my own. So, I'd like to make a few  observations—thinking out loud, really—on a theme captured in the title of the  conference.\n\nI was pleased to see the notion  of resilience woven into the theme of the conference. I have long thought there  is a national agenda that could fall under the organizing concept of enhancing  resilience.\n\nI would define \"resilience\" as  the ability to absorb shocks and recover from them. Not many years ago, parts  of my Fed district experienced Hurricane Katrina, a natural disaster that had  significant economic consequences in Louisiana and Mississippi, and on the Gulf  Coast. More recently, the mid-Atlantic suffered Megastorm Sandy.\n\nThe ability to bounce back from  natural disasters is an obvious example of resilience. Beyond disaster  recovery, the goal of enhanced resilience is a fit with a number of areas of  public interest: the financial system, financial markets, physical  infrastructure, cyber infrastructure, public health, and supply chains, to name  just some.\n\nThe financial crisis of 2008 and  2009 and the subsequent recession presented a test of the country's overall  economic resilience. The bounce-back has been agonizingly slow in some  respects. After four years of recovery, unemployment and underemployment remain  elevated. Progress in employment is a central aim of the Fed's current monetary  policy stance.\n\nThis morning, I want to lay out  some thoughts on the topic of workforce resilience. To my way of thinking,  workforce resilience as a concept goes further than response to economic  shocks.\n\nAs it applies to workers both  collectively and individually, I'd define resilience as the ability to adapt to  changing economic reality. That reality is very demanding of many people in our  workforce.\n\nCountries are in intense  competition for a share of global work. Macroeconomic trends, competitive  pressures, disruptive technological change, demands for improved  productivity—all shape an employment environment for many people of job  insecurity and continuous change in the nature of their work.\n\nAn article in the Financial Times by Robin Harding just  last week touched on the harsh realities many American workers face. The  article noted that the United States has lost almost 2 million clerical jobs  since 2007. Mr. Harding argued that clerical worker jobs such as bookkeepers,  tellers, data entry personnel, and retail cashiers are in structural decline.\n\nHe quoted Susan Lund of McKinsey,  coauthor of a McKinsey Global Institute report on the future of work. She said,  \"We see growth in jobs that require complex, personalized interactions … and  continued declines in routine transaction and production jobs that can be  scripted and automated.\"\n\nAlan Blinder, former Fed Vice  Chairman, wrote of encouraging trends giving rise to reshoring, such as rising  transport costs and the narrowing of labor cost differentials. But, he wrote,  advanced countries will have to compete on factors beyond labor costs,  including worker skills and training, worker flexibility and motivation,  supplier availability and proximity, and regulation.\n\nWhat are the characteristics of a  resilient workforce, one that can adapt to changing demands and realities? At  the risk of oversimplifying, I'll mention four important dimensions. They are 1)  the ability to evolve hard work skills with changing demands of the workplace,  2) a value set that shapes work-related soft skills, 3) physical or geographic  mobility, and 4) a financial cushion to ease transitions that may involve  periods of unemployment or underemployment.\n\nI think responsibility needs to  be shared between individual workers and what you might call the leadership  cohort that defines the context in which someone works or pursues a career. Raising  workforce resilience isn't all about personal responsibility, but likewise it's  not all about community leadership, government policy, or employer obligations.\n\nWith that said, let me elaborate  briefly on each of the four dimensions of resilience. First, hard skill  acquisition and retooling over time: one of the Atlanta Fed's directors in  Miami is in the business of helping companies with outplacement. A few months  ago, he observed that workers need to think of themselves as lessors of their  professional skills.\n\nMore specifically, he argued for  a mind-set in which the individual worker acknowledges continuous  responsibility for the maintenance and upgrade of his or her skills. He said  many of the people he encounters get this, but many do not.\n\nI have long been an advocate of  the ethic of employers meeting motivated employees halfway by presenting  opportunities for skills acquisition and personal development.\n\nEarlier this year, the Atlanta  Fed held a conference with leaders of many of the nation's historically black  colleges and universities. In her keynote address at the conference, Fed  Governor Sarah Bloom Raskin described the current job market for graduates as  among the most difficult since the 1930s. She noted the phenomenon of job  polarization—new jobs concentrated among high- and low-skill occupations. This  trend has had the effect of raising both hard and soft skill requirements for  some entry-level jobs.\n\nThe presidents of the  historically black colleges and universities commented on the demands of the  workplace for soft skills, my second dimension of resilience. This term  encompasses work ethic, attendance discipline, teamwork attitude, personal  presentation of self, and interpersonal communication and relationship skills. I  frequently hear in anecdotal accounts of employers the disqualifying  deficiencies of job candidates in the area of soft skills. A resilient  workforce is well endowed of these soft attributes.\n\nThird, a dynamic economy with  intense competitive pressures requires, to some degree, a mobile workforce. Research  indicates that worker and household mobility in our economy has been declining  gradually for many years. During the recession and afterwards, it was widely  believed (although not proven by research) that individual mobility was  constrained by so-called house lock. Workers who were willing to relocate could  not sell their homes and move to another part of the country for work.\n\nRecently, mobility statistics  have been improving. Again, it's believed this may reflect rising house prices.\n\nMobility within an urban  metropolitan area can be limited by the inadequacies of transportation  infrastructure. Some workers in larger cities are discouraged from taking  available jobs because of the difficulty and expense of commuting to and from  the job site. Job matching within an urban area can be inhibited by shortfalls  in transportation infrastructure, including mass transit systems. We know this  all too well in Atlanta.\n\nThe transportation challenge also  exists in rural areas. Last year, many of the Federal Reserve Banks convened  listening sessions to explore workforce development challenges. Among the  issues we noted was the lack of public transportation in rural areas or the  constraint of access to affordable and reliable vehicles. These issues put some  employment opportunities out of reach.\n\nMy last resilience dimension is  financial cushion. Personal savings and indebtedness affect an individual  worker's resilience. High aggregate household debt, or leverage, weakens  overall workforce resilience. During the Great Recession, we saw how the burden  of personal debt exacerbated the circumstances of many unemployed workers. The  interplay of loss of work and mortgage debt was a prime cause of the foreclosure  crisis.\n\nThe reality is that many members  of the country's workforce live more or less from paycheck to paycheck. Their  reserves of cash to weather a period of unemployment are often minimal.\n\nAn institutionalized cushion in  the form of unemployment insurance enhances workforce resilience. At the same  time, I see the many initiatives out there—including those of the Federal  Reserve Banks—to upgrade teenager and adult financial literacy as contributors  to resilience.\n\nThank you for indulging me with  your attention while I have thought out loud about the resilience of our  workforce. Now let me tee up the remainder of the day's discussion.\n\nThroughout the remaining sessions  today, I expect there will be a clear thread of resilience in regard to the  community development industry, low-income neighborhoods, and households.\n\nThe next session is a  \"Collaborating for the Future\" roundtable, during which experts will discuss  the future of jobs, health and healthcare, city planning, and financial  services for low-income communities and people. Then we will have two  concurrent sessions, one on human capital and jobs and the other on housing and  neighborhood revitalization.\n\nI am delighted that we will wrap  up by hearing from Chairman Bernanke, who will offer his perspectives on the  community development industry.\n\nEnjoy the day.",

            "content": "Good afternoon, and thank you for the invitation to speak with you today. I’d like to take a moment to recognize Drew Langloh, a member of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s Birmingham Branch, and Don Boomershine, a former chairman of the branch. I greatly appreciate their commitment to the Fed and to this region.\n\nOne of the most enjoyable aspects of my job as the Atlanta Fed president is to speak to businesspeople and visit communities across the Sixth Federal Reserve District, and it’s a privilege to address the Birmingham Kiwanis Club.\n\nToday I’m not going to stray much from the topics you would expect someone from the Federal Reserve to address. I’ll begin with a brief review of the current national economic environment as I see it. In that review, I will emphasize labor market conditions, a focal point of policy. I’ll then describe the posture of monetary policy opposite this picture and conclude with some thoughts on policy-related issues.\n\nMy remarks today represent my own personal views and do not necessarily reflect the views of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nEconomic outlook\n\nFrom 2010 to 2012, economic growth averaged about 2 percent a year, a pace far below what was expected for the aftermath of a deep recession.\n\nAs we move into the second quarter of 2013, the national economy is expanding at a moderate pace. Although admittedly choppy from quarter to quarter, economic activity is gradually but steadily improving.\n\nHowever, tighter fiscal policy is likely to take some near-term strength from GDP growth. I am referring to the end of temporary payroll tax cuts for workers, the increase in income tax rates on higher-income individuals, and expenditure cuts prompted by sequestration. While we face uncertainties stemming from contentious fiscal issues, I do see some upside potential for better growth and more robust job creation this year.\n\nThere are some encouraging signs in the overall economic picture. Recent survey data suggest that businesses are looking more favorably at capital spending decisions over the next six months. In addition, new orders for capital equipment have been growing in recent months.\n\nThe housing sector, after several years of exerting a drag on economic growth, has begun to contribute positively again in a variety of ways. For instance, home price appreciation, on a year-over-year basis, is now approaching 10 percent—the largest annual gain since 2006.\n\nConsumer spending has also picked up in the past few months. Rising equity markets and higher housing prices may have created an increased sense of economic well-being among many households. Sales of domestically produced autos are running more than 10 percent higher than a year earlier.\n\nOn the inflation front, despite volatile fuel and food prices, overall inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index continues to be tracking the 2 percent objective set by the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC. Other inflation measures are running below the 2 percent objective.\n\nMy outlook for the economy calls for continued moderate growth. I now expect GDP to come in a bit north of 2 percent for 2013 as a whole, with inflation expectations remaining well anchored.\n\nAs we look at the Alabama economy, we expect to see economic growth mirror that of the nation.\n\nPositive news coming from the automotive industry should bode well for this region. This sector should continue to strengthen as housing recovers and consumer confidence grows, providing an additional boost to the local economy.\n\nEmployment\n\nThe national employment situation continues to be a central focus of policymakers. The Federal Reserve has a dual mandate from Congress—to foster both price stability and maximum employment. We have seen some progress on employment, but that progress has been relatively slow and remains short of commonly cited definitions of maximum employment.\n\nEncouragingly, we did see a drop in the national unemployment rate to 7.7 percent in February from 7.9 percent in January—and that brought unemployment to its lowest level in four years. Nonfarm payrolls are also estimated to have advanced at a better-than-expected pace of 236,000 jobs in February. We will get a reading for March on Friday.\n\nThe February employment data contributed to an improving recent trend in job creation. Over the past three months, employment has risen by an average of 191,000 per month, compared with an average monthly gain of 183,000 in 2012.\n\nWhile these recent employment trends are encouraging, I am also reminded of what happened last year. We saw strong data in the early months of 2012, followed by a mid-year swoon. So I think it is appropriate to be a bit cautious in extrapolating these recent employment trends. More evidence is needed.\n\nThe fact is that conditions in the broad labor market are quite mixed. While some indicators of labor market health have improved a lot since the recession, others have not improved much at all or have even worsened. As I said, net job creation is picking up. Initial claims for unemployment insurance have fallen. But the official rate of unemployment remains high, many discouraged workers have left the labor force, and there are many people working part-time jobs who want to work full time.\n\nAt the Atlanta Fed, we have created a tool called the Jobs Calculator to compute employment paths under different scenarios. Assuming that labor market participation remains stable, the Jobs Calculator shows the economy would need to add at least 180,000 new jobs each month to get the unemployment rate down to 6 percent within three years.\n\nBut it is also possible that labor force participation could pick up somewhat if job prospects improve. In this case, more jobs would be needed for people returning to the labor market. For example, a 0.5 percentage point rise in labor force participation would mean that about 210,000 jobs a month would be needed to achieve an unemployment rate of 6 percent within three years. I think this example illustrates the challenge that lies ahead on the employment front.\n\nStance of monetary policy\n\nLet me now address the current stance of monetary policy and some policy-related issues.\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s policy posture remains very accommodative to support continued economic growth and job creation.\n\nThe federal funds rate target remains effectively at zero, where it has been for more than four years now. The FOMC has indicated that this ultra-low interest rate policy will stay in effect at least until the unemployment rate reaches a threshold of 6 1/2 percent.\n\nTo support the housing market recovery, the Fed began purchasing agency mortgage-backed securities last September at a pace of $40 billion per month. We have also been purchasing longer-term Treasury securities since that time at a pace of $45 billion per month. We refer to these policy actions as large-scale asset purchases. You may know this program by the commonly used term “quantitative easing,” or QE. The QE program is open-ended. The FOMC has conditioned ending these bond purchases on “substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market.”\n\nIf the current pace of asset purchases continues to year’s end, these programs will have added about $1 trillion to the Fed’s balance sheet compared with its scale before last September. There are quite valid concerns about the longer-term consequences of continuing to expand the central bank’s balance sheet.\n\nIn brief, here are those concerns: First, there is concern about the potential for a rise in inflation expectations and resulting inflation if the balance sheet remains too large for too long. Second, concerns have been raised about the possible effects of further asset purchases on the functioning of financial markets and on financial stability more generally. And third, there is concern about losses the Fed might incur as it sells assets in the process of shrinking the balance sheet.\n\nAs I weigh these concerns against the need for policy to buttress economic momentum, I conclude that these asset purchases continue to be justified.\n\nThere are encouraging developments in the economy, to be sure, but the evidence of sustainable momentum that will deliver “substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market” is not yet conclusive. I favor a “wait and watch” mode for the time being. Several more months of positive data—especially in a range of employment data—would give me confidence that the economy has real traction and is unlikely to backslide.\n\nHow will I, as one policymaker, determine that the balance has shifted and the time for a policy change has come? Well, one key consideration is the array of risks to the economic outlook and my degree of confidence in the outlook.\n\nGiven the inherent inaccuracy of economic forecasts, I give particular attention to the most serious downside scenarios—what economists often call “tail risks.”\n\nIn 2012, I perceived significant negative tail risks. They included the possibility of a financial spillover from financial instability and a recession in Europe and a congressional impasse that would have driven us over the so-called fiscal cliff.\n\nToday, I think those tail risks have diminished. Notwithstanding the recent alarm over banks in Cyprus, I think the potential for a shock coming from Europe is smaller today than it was a year ago. Overall, it seems to me the economy has moved beyond the most worrisome downside possibilities that concerned so many of us last year at this time.\n\nToday, business optimism is on the rise, and I think there is potential for a step-up in business investment and hiring activity as the year progresses. I hear anecdotal comments to this effect from contacts across the Southeast. This is something I could not have reported to you a year ago.\n\nThe key word in the phrase “substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market” is outlook. For my part, a critical consideration in judging how much longer asset purchases should continue will be confidence in the positive outlook. Confidence that is solidly grounded in improving economic data, accumulated over a sufficient span of time, will help me conclude that the work of the large-scale asset purchase program, as a temporary supplement to conventional interest-rate policy, is complete.\n\nThe decision to curtail asset purchases ought to be forward-looking, and in my judgment, that point could come later this year or early next year without harm to the momentum of the economy.\n\nNow I’ll be happy to take some of your questions.",

            "content": "Introduction\nIt's a pleasure to be back in Knoxville and at the University of Tennessee.\n\nAs you may know, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the monetary policy-setting body of the Federal Reserve, has two overriding objectives. They are promoting stable prices and fostering maximum employment. The achievement and the balancing of these two objectives are always front-and-center concerns of the FOMC.\n\nThe focus of my remarks today will be on how I view the status of this balancing act in the context of the FOMC's current program of open-ended asset purchases. I will give particular attention to the state of the employment markets, the improvement of which is a central purpose of the asset purchase program.\n\nMy remarks this evening reflect my own thinking on these subjects and do not necessarily reflect the views of my colleagues on the FOMC or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nCurrent economic situation and outlook\nI'll start with a summary of current economic conditions and my outlook for 2013.\n\nThe overall economy ended last year with a weak quarter as measured by gross domestic product (GDP). However, I don't take much signal from this number because the reasons for it were largely technical and transitory. Most significant among these was a large decline in government spending after an unusual increase in the third quarter of last year. Outside this decline in government spending, GDP rose at close to a 2 percent pace in the fourth quarter.\n\nOur readings of the incoming data, complemented by anecdotal characterizations of the economy provided by our contacts across the Southeast, suggest a continuation of a 2 percent GDP trend in the first quarter. For 2013 overall, I expect GDP growth to come in between 2 and 2 1/2 percent. This pace of growth implies steady, but not accelerating, net job creation. At this pace of expansion, unemployment will likely continue to decline gradually.\n\nI think the risks around this outlook are currently pretty much in balance. Congress and the administration still have some very controversial fiscal issues to negotiate. My outlook assumes some amount of fiscal drag from spending cuts, but does not assume a political shock resulting from a self-inflicted crisis of some kind.\n\nIt also appears that the biggest downside risks associated with the European sovereign debt problems have been contained. These risks have receded, in part, through monetary policy actions by the European Central Bank and through progress on a common supervisory framework for the euro zone's financial system.\n\nI see some potential that the U.S. economy could do better than growth between 2 and 2 1/2 percent. The economy has been growing at a sluggish rate of around 2 percent since the recovery began in the summer of 2009. Although still rather mixed, the data show some encouraging signs. For instance, the housing market appears to have stabilized and begun a recovery as measured by home sales, house prices, and, to some extent, construction activity. Despite some recent movement in gasoline prices associated with seasonal influences and refining capacity, the domestic energy industry is vibrant in both exploration and production. And the auto industry, important in the Southeast, continues to record strong sales. Of these three examples of relative strength, both housing and autos are interest-rate-sensitive sectors.\n\nIf momentum continues and some of the potholes out there are avoided (particularly a political crisis around fiscal decisions), growth could accelerate. I admit it's a qualitative assessment, but I sense rising optimism among much of the public in terms of economic prospects. Although it's not reflected in our baseline forecast, I detect a growing conviction that the economy is beginning to emerge from a long spell of anemic performance.\n\nInflation\nThe inflation rate fluctuated fairly widely last year, mostly pushed about by volatile gasoline and food prices. But if you step back and look at the trend of prices with a broader perspective, inflation has been measured at a level persistently under the FOMC's longer-term objective of 2 percent. At times, the rate has been closer to 1 percent. To significantly and persistently undershoot the central bank's inflation target could be worrisome in some circumstances, but, at this point, I think the inflation outlook is benign.\n\nStance of monetary policy\nAgainst the backdrop of the picture I just painted, monetary policy remains very accommodative. I know that sounds like central banker speak. To translate, very accommodative means low interest rates that are intended to stimulate borrowing by businesses and consumers that will in turn have the effect of expanding economic activity. The FOMC's policy rate—the overnight federal funds rate—remains effectively as low as it can go. In addition, the Fed is purchasing longer-maturity Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities. This purchasing program is a tool of monetary policy popularly referred to as quantitative easing. These purchases are intended to keep downward pressure on long-term interest rates and support financial asset prices.\n\nIt's difficult in any precise way to isolate the effectiveness of this policy. But I believe the FOMC's monetary policy actions overall have without question helped achieve the economic progress we've made since the end of the recession. These policies have also helped to bring us to the current environment in which the presumption of continuing and potentially quickening progress is a reasonable one.\n\nFOMC's guidance regarding interest rates\nTo support the effectiveness of policy, the FOMC has undertaken a number of measures to improve communications with the public about the future path of policy. Most recently, the FOMC stated that its short-term policy interest rate —that is, the target federal funds rate—would in all likelihood remained fixed where it is today at least until the official unemployment rate reaches a threshold of 6 1/2 percent. In my view, full employment in the longer term—the ultimate objective—corresponds to a rate of unemployment somewhat below 6 1/2 percent, so this threshold is an interim goal on the way to full employment. We made this threshold explicit in part to allow members of the public to gauge progress in the labor markets and draw their own conclusions about how long financing rates are going to remain at bargain levels.\n\nFOMC's communication regarding large-scale asset purchases\nCommunication around quantitative easing—also referred to as large-scale asset purchases—has also evolved. We are now in the third round of quantitative easing since it was first introduced in November 2008. In the previous two rounds, the FOMC gave explicit quantitative targets for total purchases and the expected time frame of the programs. In the most recent round, the Committee did not state an explicit amount or duration of purchases. Instead, the Committee has conditioned continuing the purchases on achieving a qualitative criterion, which is \"substantial improvement in the outlook for labor markets.\"\n\nIt's important to note that the statement that laid out this criterion also mentioned consideration of the efficacy and costs of the program. In other words, pursuit of \"substantial improvement\" would be tempered by assessment of whether the policy is in fact working and whether the degree to which it is working justifies what might be the longer-term unintended negative consequences of such extraordinary monetary expansion.\n\nInterpreting \"substantial improvement...\"\nUnlike the 6 1/2 percent unemployment rate threshold of the Fed's policy for the federal funds rate, the threshold for quantitative easing is not straightforward. \"Substantial improvement\" may be in the eye of the beholder.\n\nLast November, I spoke in Chattanooga about the complexities of assessing the health of the nation's employment situation. I argued in that speech that relying on a single metric like the unemployment rate is simplistic and potentially problematic. When the Committee took the step of conditioning the size and duration of the latest asset-purchase program on \"substantial improvement,\" we widened, in my opinion, the number of considerations.\n\nMy staff has developed a graphical tool to track labor market developments over recent years. I normally do not use slides in my talks, but I think the picture I'm about to show you helps illuminate the challenge of determining \"substantial improvement in the outlook for labor markets.\"\n\nFor obvious reasons, this is sometimes called a \"spider chart\" (probably more accurately a \"spiderweb chart\").1 Let me walk you through what it shows. We've taken the approach of dividing indicators of labor market conditions into four segments. The segment labeled Employer Behavior includes indicators related to the hiring activities of employers. The segment labeled Confidence includes indicators of employer and worker confidence in the labor market. The segment labeled Utilization includes measures of how available labor resources are being used. And the segment labeled Leading Indicators shows data that typically provide insight into the future direction of overall labor market activity.\n\nThe circle at the perimeter of this chart represents labor market conditions that existed before the recession got under way.2 We have dated this as late 2007. The inner yellow circle represents the state of affairs when payroll employment reached its trough in late 2009.3 You might think of the outer circle as the \"boiling point\" and the inner circle as the \"freezing point,\" if you like. This oddly shaped light blue figure inside the perimeter4 depicts where each of the indicators was in January 2011 relative to the benchmarks. This green figure5 depicts the state of the labor market in January 2012. And finally, this red figure6 shows where the indicators were as of January 2013.\n\nI should point out that four of the indicators are inverted, meaning that we want them to shrink. These are unemployment, marginally attached, part-time for economic reasons, and initial claims. So for these four indicators, \"improving\" means declining, but the improvement is still represented by outward movement on the chart.\n\nThe progression of these point-in-time snapshots provides us with a picture of how labor market conditions have evolved over the past four years. As you can see, substantial improvement has been achieved in the leading indicator series. As a group, these data points are approaching their pre-recession levels. Employer hiring behavior and confidence are slowly moving outward but remain quite weak relative to the pre-recession benchmarks. Finally, the labor utilization measures are very weak and, notably, have hardly improved at all over the past two years.\n\nMonitoring a set of indicators like these is useful for tracking labor market developments along various dimensions. However, interpreting these developments is complicated by the fact that structural changes in the labor market can influence the evolution of these indicators.\n\nAdmittedly, the definition of \"structural\" is a bit ambiguous. I think a useful working definition is that structural impediments to employment growth are those that cannot be addressed by policies designed mostly to stimulate spending.\n\nThe extent of structural labor market impediments is an important factor to consider in any attempt to estimate the efficacy and cost of policy actions. If the structural impediments are large enough, then aggressive policy actions might not be very effective in helping to lower unemployment. Moreover, if structural impediments are large, policy may generate significant economic costs that are not immediately recognized. At the same time, if monetary policy is too timid, cyclical problems may become structural. Chairman Bernanke has commented several times on the risk that the skills of the long-term unemployed may atrophy, making these individuals increasingly unemployable as time passes.\n\nConclusion\nAs the minutes of the last two FOMC meetings indicate, policymakers are engaged in discussions of the extent and duration of the quantitative easing program. Considering current labor market conditions, I think continuing the asset purchase program to support the recovery and to improve employment conditions remains appropriate for now. And given the outlook and associated risks, I am comfortable with sticking with the current approach at least into the second half of the year. All things considered, I do not think that monetary policy has yet crossed the line where the benefits of the current policy—specifically the quantitative easing element—are swamped by serious concerns over problems the policy might be creating for the longer term.\n\nThe spider charts I presented illustrate that progress across indicators of labor market conditions may be uneven, making the state of overall employment conditions difficult to interpret. For this reason, I think we policymakers should be seeking to carefully balance considerations of longer-term potential costs against the efficacy of policy designed to achieve \"substantial improvement.\"\n\n1Chart 1: Labor market tracking\n\n(enlarge)\n\n2Chart 2: Labor market conditions before the recession\n\n(enlarge)\n\n3Chart 3: Payroll trough in 2009\n\n(enlarge)\n\n4Chart 4: Labor market in January 2011\n\n(enlarge)\n\n5Chart 5: Labor market in January 2012\n\n(enlarge)\n\n6Chart 6: Labor market in January 2013\n\n(enlarge)",

            "content": "Introduction\nI'm very pleased to be here in Madrid and at the distinguished Instituto de Empresas. Many thanks to the Ramon Areces Foundation for partnering with IE to organize this event. Many thanks also to Professor Marco Tombetta, Associate Professor Juan-Pedro Gomez, and Isabel Garces Correa at IE for your individual efforts in pulling together many details.\n\nI confess I am biased in favor of IE for two reasons. First, because my daughter got her MBA here in 2010. And second, because IE is known for its educational emphasis on entrepreneurship. Greater entrepreneurship—that is, more new business formation and more investment in innovation is part of the solution to two great problems advanced economies are facing. These problems are growth and employment.\n\nI am out of my natural habitat. In the United States, an audience might be interested in a pretty detailed analysis of U.S. economic challenges and my view of the economic outlook. I might even get away with some discussion of the intricacies of the Fed's monetary policy—the federal funds rate at the zero lower bound, quantitative easing, Fed communication policies, and all that. This evening, I'd like to frame my remarks in a way that's somewhat less U.S.-centric by talking about these two concerns—growth and employment—that are common to both the United States and Spain (and more broadly to much of Europe). I will talk about what's going on in the United States to highlight challenges being faced on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nI will share with you some thoughts on the prospects for economic growth and the causes of weak growth in the United States. I'll spend some time on the role of early-stage firms in generating employment, a topic that should be of interest here at IE given the entrepreneurship emphasis of the school. I'm going to share some thinking that I admit is a work in process. I'll give you a sense of the evolution of my staff's and my understanding of the role of early-stage entrepreneurial ventures in job creation.\n\nFaster growth and higher employment are complex challenges. The solutions aren't simple or easy. On either side of the Atlantic, progress will depend on a lot of relatively small things getting fixed or done better rather than one big thing.\n\nAt this point, let me add a disclaimer. When a Federal Reserve Bank president speaks, he or she is putting forth personal views and is not speaking for the Federal Reserve. Only Federal Reserve governors speak for the Federal Reserve and only Chairman Bernanke speaks for the Federal Open Market Committee. So my remarks will represent my personal views.\n\nPolicymakers on both sides of the Atlantic are grappling with the question of how to generate more rapid GDP growth and how to bring down the high rates of unemployment.\n\nIn some respects, I prefer thinking about the latter concern in terms of its mirror image—how to generate sufficient employment.\n\nThe official unemployment rate in the United States is currently 7.9 percent, considerably below the rate of unemployment here in Spain. That's not a reason for Americans to gloat. The larger employment reality in the United States involves a high rate of underemployment (people working part time who would prefer full time) and low levels of participation in the workforce (discouraged would-be workers who have dropped out of the labor force and are not counted in unemployment).\n\nGrowth outlook in the U.S.\nThere's an ongoing debate about the extent to which the causes of weak labor markets are structural or cyclical. The cyclical view maintains that the problem is just a deficit of aggregate demand and, with a quicker pace of growth, much of the problem will be solved.\n\nA sense of urgency is appropriate for this goal. If policymakers are too patient, what started as cyclical problems can evolve into structural problems.\n\nI think faster growth would indeed improve employment conditions significantly, so let me summarize the prospects for growth in the American economy.\n\nSince the end of the recession and the beginning of recovery in the summer of 2009, the U.S. economy has experienced average GDP growth of 2.1 percent. This is better than in many other advanced economies but is still very sluggish.\n\nFor 2013, I'm forecasting a continuation of this basic picture. I expect full-year GDP growth to be between 2 and 2 1/2 percent. I could be wrong, but I don't expect 2013 to be a breakout year.\n\nCauses of weak growth in the United States\nThere are several ongoing causes of this weak growth. Households continue to either reduce or contain their debt levels. This constrains retail sales, home sales, and purchases of consumer durables that often require financing. The one major exception has been autos. The average American automobile is more than 11 years old, so new car sales, supported by credit availability, have been strong and are rising.\n\nThe financial system, the centerpiece of which is the banking system, is going through a gradual process of repair, so credit flows are constricted in comparison to the years before the recession. Bankers have also tightened credit standards in response to recent experience. At the same time, bankers continue to report that most categories of credit demand remain weak.\n\nBusiness spending—including investment spending—has been restrained by a very cautious attitude on the part of decision makers. They cite uncertainties related to the federal government's fiscal situation as a primary concern along with the sovereign debt crisis here in Europe.\n\nProductivity growth has also slowed. At the end of the recession and at the beginning of the recovery, productivity gains were substantial as employers streamlined their workforces while maintaining or growing top-line revenues.\n\nRecently, it appears that much of the potential associated with company restructuring, headcount reduction, and cost cuts has already been exploited.\n\nPessimism regarding long-term growth prospects\nAs I said a moment ago, I hope I'm pleasantly surprised about upside prospects for the U.S. economy. There are some hopeful signs in the recent data on the U.S. economy. The housing sector—which was hammered in the recession (much like here in Spain)—appears to be coming back. We have a vibrant hydrocarbon energy sector. As I said earlier, our auto manufacturing sector is improving. And U.S. equity markets have been quite buoyant recently.\n\nIn the near term, I think growth prospects will depend on the removal of short-term obstacles to growth. Chief among these is finding workable solutions to immediate fiscal problems and to the uncertainty these challenges generate. Here in Europe, the challenge has been and continues to be one of finding the optimal balance between necessary fiscal consolidation and the conditions needed for economic stabilization and expansion. To some extent, the United States is behind Europe in tackling fiscal problems, but further along in economic recovery and stabilization.\n\nLooking at the growth challenge more broadly, however, there is serious commentary led by Professor Robert Gordon of Northwestern University to the effect that the longer-term growth potential of the U.S. economy has shifted lower. He cites growth headwinds such as the retirement of the large baby boomer generation, lack of progress in educational attainment, and growing income inequality. Furthermore, he argues, future technological change won't deliver productivity boosts equivalent to earlier periods of rapid innovation.\n\nWhether or not such views turn out to be true over the long term remains to be seen. Time will tell. In the medium term, I take some encouragement from emerging technologies like the industrial Internet using sensors, 3-D printing, robotics, and energy exploration and production technologies. Of course, these are some of the very technologies that Professor Gordon rejects as transformative.\n\nThese are big questions. This is a conversation that needs to occur because small changes in fundamentals underlying growth that accumulate over generations can have profound implications.\n\nTo arrive at answers, I believe you have to roll up your sleeves and get into the messy reality on the ground. It's useful, I think, to ask the simple question, \"Where does employment growth come from?\"\n\nThe United States, in all economic circumstances, is a very dynamic economy with continuous birth and death of enterprises. The employment the private sector produces is in a constant state of churn. Jobs are being destroyed, being created, and being redesigned. This is the practical context—both here in Europe and in the United States—for the appropriately intense focus on job creation.\n\nNew and young firms: A complex dynamic\nRecently, in both the United States and Europe, including Spain, there has been increasing focus on the role of young, growth-oriented firms—so-called \"gazelles\"—as a major source of employment growth. In my view, some misconceptions and misrepresentations have crept into the conversation, so I want to take some care to explain our current understanding of some of the characteristics of firms that, on net, are job creators, at least in the United States.\n\nI would argue that gazelles as a group, while unquestionably an important contributor to growth of jobs, should not be portrayed as a savior. It's important, I think, that policymakers not exaggerate any single source of job creation in pursuit of healthy employment markets.\n\nMy colleagues and I learned a number of things as we conducted research on employment and job creation.\n\nLet me walk you through the sequence of our learning over the last couple of years. We started with the premise that small businesses, generally, are the key source of jobs. This claim was frequently made by candidates in the recent political cycle. While small firms are important, we found that it's not accurate to say small businesses are disproportionately responsible for job creation.\n\nAlmost all businesses, by number, in the United States are small. But we shouldn't confuse the number of firms with the number of jobs. In 2010, for example, businesses with 100 or more employees accounted for less than 1 percent of firms, but close to 50 percent of private-sector employment.\n\nWhile today's larger, mature businesses are important as employers, they were not born large. So we looked at the age dimension of firms in explaining job creation. The premise was that it is younger firms, almost all of which are small, that disproportionately create jobs.\n\nWe found that the role of young firms in job creation is easily overstated. For instance, the claim is often made that new firms alone account for all net job creation. This is true in what you might call an accounting sense. That is, the number of jobs created by new firms about matches or exceeds the net number of jobs created by all firms.\n\nBut this fact ignores the reality that established firms that are growing create many more jobs each year than do new firms. It's just that established firms that are downsizing are responsible for destroying a lot of jobs as well. New firms haven't been around long enough to downsize. In fact, as a group, young firms between one and five years old destroy more jobs than they create because of the high failure rate.\n\nMoreover, we found that many small firms are not established with an objective to grow and add employees. The landscape of small, young businesses is heavily populated with \"mom-and-pop\" businesses. They play an important social role, but are not a major source of jobs beyond the initial number of employees at establishment.\n\nIn our investigation we then looked at the argument that it is the relatively small subset of small, young, fast-growing firms—the gazelles—that drive job creation. It's clear that gazelles do contribute significantly, but it's the growth dimension, not the age or size dimension, that matters most. That is to say, fast-growing mature firms also account for a lot of job creation. And heavy emphasis on technology and bioscience industries—so popular among economic development professionals—may also be misplaced. High-growth firms emerge in a number of industries, some decidedly low tech. All in all, it's not so obvious that the likely source of high-growth firms can be identified.\n\nThe recent recession significantly constrained the growth opportunities of companies. By one definition of fast growth, there are about a third fewer fast-growing firms in the U.S. economy now compared to the mid-2000s, and they are adding about half as many jobs compared to the earlier rate. It may seem like an obvious point, but one still worth emphasizing. Innovation and entrepreneurial activity are most likely to achieve maximum impact in terms of job creation in a context of general economic growth.\n\nWhat can policy, broadly speaking, do to foster growth, innovation, and job creation? At a high level, three things. First, policymakers can remove obstacles to growth—for example, uncertainty regarding the fiscal path of government, policies that discourage new business formation, and disincentives to invest. Second, and the mirror image of obstacles, is positive, pro-growth policies. Examples include investment in human capital and critical infrastructure.\n\nAnd finally, there is a role for monetary policy. In my view, monetary policy can deliver appropriately favorable interest rate conditions, always in a context of low and stable inflation. Monetary policy plays a critical role in creating the most favorable conditions for other policy actions to do their work.\n\nClose\nThe term \"silver bullet\" has become a popular way of capturing the idea of a single, straightforward solution perceived to have extreme effectiveness.\n\nMy bank's experience in trying to understand the role of small businesses, small-growth businesses, young businesses, and mature-growth businesses in job creation illustrates a key point, I think. In the pursuit of economic growth and increased employment, there is no silver bullet. Rather, the policy community should be pursuing an effective mix of policy elements (with focus in areas such as new business formation, labor rules, and regulatory efficiency, to name a few) that together catalyze a virtuous circle of innovation, growth, and employment.\n\nCertainly, entrepreneurial risk-taking, whether by large, mature businesses or start-ups aimed at becoming growth companies, is part of the solution. You are being very well-trained here at IE for this work.",

            "content": "I am delighted to provide my first official remarks of the new year here at the Rotary Club of Atlanta.\n\nI see 2013 as a pivotal year for national economic policy.\n\nFiscal policy decisions were subordinated last year to the November elections. Congress and the administration deferred action on many of the stickiest fiscal questions, including the most basic question of how and when the federal government will take steps toward long-run budget sustainability. Electoral considerations gave fiscal authorities something of a pass for the year.\n\nI doubt that any such passes will be issued in 2013. Our fiscal imbalances are still building, as are the damaging effects of moving from one short-term budget crisis to another. Lawmakers have a short period of time before the political cycle associated with the midterm elections kicks in. These realities lend a \"now-or-never\" dimension to the year ahead.\n\nFiscal uncertainties have challenged the Federal Reserve just as they have challenged all private decision makers. The Fed has done a great deal to date to promote recovery, but the ongoing effectiveness of Fed efforts does depend critically on the removal of fiscal policy uncertainty. In addition, consumer and business confidence—factors that have great influence on the direction of the economy—may swing on how these policy concerns play out.\n\nIf 2013 is a pivotal year for fiscal authorities to deliver clarity on future policy, it is by extension a pivotal year for the course of monetary policy. In my remarks today, I'll lay out my sense of the economic context in which critical policy choices will be made. I'll begin by briefly reviewing how economic conditions evolved in 2012. I'll summarize where I think the economy stands at this moment, the beginning of 2013. And I'll present my outlook for the year ahead.\n\nI will also detail the moving parts of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy and try to clarify aspects that may not be well understood.\n\nAs always, my comments are my personal views and may not reflect those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System or on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nState of the economy and outlook\nFirst, let's briefly look at what happened in 2012. The economy grew slowly as it continued to struggle with various restraints on growth. These restraining forces kept overall economic activity subdued with the result that employment expanded only very gradually. For 2012, real GDP growth is expected to come in at around 1.8 percent when finally totaled. Nearly four years after the end of the Great Recession, the pace of recovery remains sluggish.\n\nPerhaps the most potent restraint on growth was wariness born of uncertainty. The uncertainty factor presents analytical challenges. Businesses (and for that matter consumers) always face risk. There's always risk in making a decision to invest, expand operations, or hire another employee. Businesses try to manage risk, but uncertainty, if severe, paralyzes businesses. The distinction between risk and uncertainty is like guessing the outcome of a bet based on a coin toss versus guessing the outcome of a bet when you don't know the rules and have no idea how a winner will be determined.\n\nIn 2012, an array of uncertainties rendered both consumers and businesses quite cautious about spending. The uncertainties that most weighed on economic actors related to the outcome of the elections, fiscal issues here at home, the cost of health care, regulatory rules, and the European sovereign debt crisis. Two severe storms, obviously unanticipated, also set back the economy in certain regions of the country.\n\nThe question is whether we've been facing degrees of uncertainty materially more confounding than in whatever you think of as normal times. Recent attempts to measure comparative uncertainty conditions over time suggest the answer is yes. And I heard over the past year a lot of comments by business people to the effect that they were (and remain) very reluctant to step out and expand aggressively.\n\nThis was especially the case in the final weeks of the year, starting just after the election, when anxiety about the fiscal cliff no doubt had a damping effect on activity in spite of some encouraging developments in the course of the year.\n\nSome good things did happen last year. There were a number of positive signs in the economy from which we can take heart, I think, as we enter 2013. For example:\n\nThat said, at a macro level, the national unemployment rate changed little during the first half of 2012. From January through July, the unemployment rate hung between 8.1 percent and 8.3 percent. By September, the rate had fallen to 7.8 percent, where it remains today.\n\nThe overall employment situation continues to be a major concern. Despite pretty steady job creation since 2010, unemployment remains far too high. About 40 percent of the people who are out of work have been so for six months or more, and many people who desire full-time work are still working part time. Participation—that is, participation in the labor force—has been falling over recent years and is very close to the lowest rate on record since 1980. Unemployment, underemployment, and abandonment of efforts to find a job, taken together, present a sobering picture for policymakers.\n\nAt the same time, inflation stayed somewhat below the FOMC's 2 percent target for a good part of the year. We saw a slight uptick in inflation numbers during the first quarter of 2012, mostly due to higher energy prices, followed by numbers below 2 percent later in the year.\n\nIn brief, the story of 2012 was one of moderate growth with occasional, short-lived periods of acceleration off that trend. That's been the case, for the most part, since the recession ended in the summer of 2009.\n\nSo we begin the year in a mode of slow overall growth, tolerable inflation, and gradual progress on unemployment.\n\nOne of the ways we \"do\" economics at the Atlanta Fed is to step back and try to discern the basic trend lines of the economy looking through the month-to-month up-and-down movements of the data. We try to frame a basic narrative for the evolution of the economy. When the incoming data and other indicators seem to diverge consistently and materially from this narrative, we rethink our explanation of what's happening.\n\nOver the last months our narrative has not changed much. The continuing theme is slow growth hovering around 2 percent. This rate of growth compares unfavorably with past recoveries. We remain in a long slog.\n\nFor 2013, we at the Atlanta Fed are expecting GDP growth in the range of 2 to 2 1/2 percent—basically more of the same.\n\nHowever, there may be some upside depending on how fiscal policy deliberations go. A number of our business contacts across the Southeast believe that there is some amount of pent-up demand on the part of businesses and consumers resulting from deferred spending and that this demand could be unleashed with removal of fiscal uncertainties. I want to believe this is realistic.\n\nThe FOMC's asset purchase programs\n\nNow let me turn to a discussion of monetary policy as an element of the effort to promote economic recovery.\n\nThe FOMC has held its policy rate—the federal funds rate—at a range of zero to 25 basis points since December 2008. That's a little over four years now.\n\nAs you know, the Fed has also applied additional monetary stimulus through use of what might be called balance sheet tools.\n\nIn September, the FOMC decided to increase its support for housing market recovery and began an open-ended program of purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month.\n\nAt its December meeting, the FOMC decided to continue purchasing longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month. You may know this program by the commonly used term quantitative easing. It is also open ended.\n\nIn continuing these purchases, the Fed replaced what we called the maturity extension program, or the so-called \"Operation Twist,\" with outright purchases of the longer-term Treasuries. Operation Twist involved simultaneous purchases of long-term Treasuries and sales of short-term Treasuries. We stopped because we effectively exhausted our stock of short-term Treasuries.\n\nI'd like to make three points about these policy actions. First, the December action shouldn't be viewed as new, additional stimulus, but rather as a continuation of an already-in-force policy designed to put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates. The difference between Operation Twist and the open-ended purchase program is that the latter expands the size of the Fed's balance sheet, while the former did not. I do not view this distinction as important in its economic effects, but I do think the growth of the Fed's balance sheet could have longer-term consequences that are worrisome. While I've supported these policy decisions to date, I acknowledge legitimate concerns.\n\nMy view is that purchasing longer-term Treasury and mortgage-backed securities has likely put some downward pressure on longer-term interest rates broadly and has helped housing markets in particular. At the same time, the benefits of indefinite purchases are debatable, and it's been argued that the potential costs could rise as the size of the balance sheet increases. Let me explain what I mean by \"costs.\"\n\nThere is a risk, given the Fed's cumulative share of the Treasury and MBS markets, that at some point securities purchases could have adverse effects on market functioning and financial stability. Also, depending on the interplay between the eventual shrinking of the balance sheet and the path of interest rates, the Federal Reserve's net income and its remittances to the Treasury could be significantly affected during the period of policy normalization.\n\nFurthermore, the accumulating purchases of bonds could complicate the FOMC's efforts to withdraw monetary stimulus when the appropriate time comes. We have tested tools for exit, but it will be uncharted territory.\n\nAs my second point, let me make clear that expansionary monetary policy based on bond purchases does not increase the fiscal deficit or the federal debt.\n\nThe liabilities of the central bank do not add to the national debt that must be serviced by tax receipts.\n\nAnd, virtually all of the income the Fed earns from the securities it buys is remitted to the U.S. Treasury, which means these earnings are used to reduce the fiscal deficit.\n\nSuch an asset purchase program is designed to strengthen economic activity and reduce joblessness. This should add to government tax revenue and reduce the burden of spending on extended unemployment and other social benefit programs.\n\nIt's been argued that the Fed policy of keeping interest rates low makes it easier for Congress to kick the can down the road. Well, this critique can be applied to every expansionary monetary action. An easier monetary policy necessarily lowers the cost of borrowing to the government. We simply cannot use our policies to stimulate economic activity and be neutral regarding the cost of funds to the Treasury. Monetary policy is certainly not formulated with the intent to influence fiscal deliberations and outcomes. The monetary policy decisions of the FOMC are directed by law to promote the goals of maximum employment and stable prices.\n\nOpen-ended purchases and forward guidance\n\nMy third point is that \"open ended\" does not mean \"without bound.\" The program is not \"QE Infinity.\" There appears to have been some confusion about this.\n\nIn determining how long the purchase programs should continue, the FOMC has indicated that it intends to assess labor market developments on the one hand and review the program's efficacy and costs on the other.\n\nFor now, I think the open-ended nature of the asset-purchase programs is called for because the outlook for the pace of improvement in the labor market and the broader economy remains unclear. From this juncture, with so many unknowns, quite divergent economic scenarios are plausible. In these circumstances, it would not be prudent to commit up front to a specific size, pace, and mix of asset purchases.\n\nIn December, the FOMC also adjusted its so-called forward guidance on how long it expects short-term interest rates to remain near zero.\n\nSpecifically, the FOMC announced that it anticipates the federal funds rate will remain near zero as long as the unemployment rate exceeds 6 1/2 percent and as long as projected inflation one to two years out does not exceed the Fed's long-run 2 percent inflation goal by more than one-half percent. I want to stress that these are thresholds, not triggers.\n\nPreviously, the guidance on how long interest rates would remain near zero was expressed in terms of a date, specifically mid-2015. The 6 1/2 percent threshold is fully consistent with the FOMC's earlier guidance of interest rate \"liftoff\" in mid-2015. The majority of the Committee still believes that the \"liftoff\" date for the FOMC's policy rate will be in 2015 or later.\n\nThe 6 1/2 percent unemployment threshold—conditional on inflation being contained—was introduced to make it easier for people to assess how policy might evolve along with economic conditions. It was not intended to signal any fundamental change in policy. Equally important, the 6 1/2 percent unemployment rate threshold does not apply to the FOMC's asset purchase programs. The asset purchase programs are designed to provide a boost to the economy, to put \"wind in the sails\" of economic recovery. For me, the decision to continue with these programs will be based on the ongoing assessments of benefits and costs, as I mentioned earlier.\n\nClose\nHow fast might the economy reach the 6 1/2 percent threshold? To get some idea, consider that the average pace of job gains over the past six months has been 160,000 a month. And suppose that this pace is sustained going forward and that labor force participation remains at the current level of 63.6 percent. Using a tool we've developed at the Atlanta Fed—the Jobs Calculator—it is straightforward to compute that it would take almost three years to reach an unemployment rate of 6 1/2 percent.\n\nIt's obvious that the faster the average pace of job creation, the sooner the 6 1/2 percent will be reached. For example, job gains of 184,000 a month implies about two years to reach 6 1/2 percent. But it takes job creation averaging 262,000 a month to shorten the time period to around one year.\n\nClearly, a lot is riding on the pace of job creation. And to a substantial extent, the pace of job creation is riding on reducing uncertainty, especially policy uncertainty. The coming months will be, in my opinion, something of a moment of truth for fiscal policymaking. The year 2013 will be a test of the country's ability to govern itself in the realm of public finances.\n\nMonetary policy has done a lot to move the country to this juncture. Monetary policy actions over the past four years have fostered faster growth than we otherwise would have experienced. Without these policy actions, growth of GDP and jobs would have been lower, in my opinion. The tools of monetary policy remain at work in support of continued recovery and an acceleration of growth and hiring. But monetary policy simply cannot offset the effects of failing to resolve today's fiscal crisis.\n\nThat is why 2013 is a pivotal year. I had a boss once who, bless his heart, was a classic hard-charging, action-oriented type A. He ran us ragged, but he got results. He had a plaque on his desk that read \"Get the spectators off the field.\" I'll rework that idea. Fiscal policy uncertainty is part of what is keeping businesses and consumers \"on the sidelines.\" If our fiscal policymakers can successfully address the remaining issues and provide a multiyear roadmap toward fiscal health, I believe those actions would go a long way toward reducing the uncertainty that has been holding back the economy and get spectators off the sidelines and onto the field.",

            "highlights": "Atlanta Fed President and CEO Dennis Lockhart is speaking on two potential sources of financial instability to European and U.S. policymakers, economists, and analysts at the Hyman P. Minsky Conference on Financial Instability in Berlin on November 27.",
            "content": "Introduction\nI'm delighted to be here in Berlin among so many distinguished central bankers, academics, and policy experts to offer some views on the sources and implications of financial instability.\n\nIt strikes me as wholly appropriate to give most of our attention in this conference to the debt crisis in the euro zone, public sector deficits in many advanced economies, the state of repair of banking systems, and the financial markets that link these areas together. These are the areas in which we would expect to see the severe disruption that would evidence financial instability.\n\nIn the United States, as a consequence of requirements in the Dodd-Frank Act, the Financial Stability Oversight Council, or FSOC, has geared up to monitor potential sources of financial instability. In support of Chairman Bernanke's participation in the FSOC, efforts are under way in the Federal Reserve System to monitor and more deeply understand a variety of possible sources of trouble and to evaluate how serious a threat they represent. These efforts have put focus on some of the sectors and activities you would expect—for instance, the shadow banking system.\n\nI expect you will agree that at a global level, the span of vigilance needs to be extremely broad. The events of 2007 and 2008 brought many surprises. Markets that some thought too small to cause much trouble ultimately posed systemic-scale problems. The pathways of contagion and the speed of development of second-, third-, and fourth-order effects surprised most of us.\n\nSo my point is our radar should scan widely—beyond the most obvious sources of risk.\n\nToday I would like to share some observations on two instability risk areas that are not so front of mind—the payments system and public pensions. I'm going to look at these from very much an American perspective and let the Europeans and others here draw from my remarks whatever is useful and applicable in your own affairs. My interest in these two areas of concern derives from work we're doing at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta to gauge the evolution of risk to the payments system and the systemic risk associated with municipal finance and fiscal problems at the state and local levels of government.\n\nBefore I get into these two topics, I must state the usual disclaimer. All the views I will express are my personal views. My colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee and in the Federal Reserve System may not agree.\n\nWorking definition of financial instability\nLet me start by laying out a working definition of financial instability. To my mind, an event or development that brings financial instability is one that interrupts crucial financial intermediation services, affects markets and institutions, and threatens the real economy. If the period of instability is severe and long lasting, it may cause a serious amount of wealth destruction. Such a working concept of financial instability serves as a test of the validity of payments system risk and public pension solvency as potential sources of instability.\n\nPayments system risks\nI'll touch on payments system risk first. The payments system in the United States processes about $4.5 trillion of transactions daily. The system is fragmented in a variety of ways. First, to the extent that banks still enjoy a significant franchise in payments services, the banking system is quite fragmented. We have more than 7,000 banks operating in the United States. Also, in recent years, we've seen tremendous growth in the nonbank sector of payments services providers. Nonbank providers participate in markets for remittances, prepaid cards, transaction processing, and online payments. And, as you well know, payments are moving to mobile devices, and there are a number of nonbank entrepreneurial ventures in this space.\n\nIt's important to point out that there is no single, comprehensive supervisor overseeing the payments arena. Bank supervision and regulation is divided among a collection of federal entities, and the nonbank providers are lightly regulated by comparison.\n\nThe fragmented nature of the payments industry and its rapid evolution are creating many points of vulnerability. Fraud is one such vulnerability. Certainly the public is quite aware of credit and debit card fraud and identity theft involving account takeovers. This activity erodes trust in the financial system, but I don't see these problems as imperiling financial stability at a systemic level.\n\nA real financial stability concern, however, is the potential for malicious disruptions to the payments system in the form of broadly targeted cyberattacks. Just in the last few months, the United States has experienced an escalating incidence of distributed denial of service attacks aimed at our largest banks. The attacks came simultaneously or in rapid succession. They appear to have been executed by sophisticated, well-organized hacking groups who flood bank web servers with junk data, allowing the hackers to target certain web applications and disrupt online services. Nearly all the perpetrators are external to the targeted organizations, and they appear to be operating from all over the globe. Their motives are not always clear. Some are in it for money, while others are in it for what you might call ideological or political reasons.\n\nUnlike other cybercrime activity, which aims to steal customer data for the purpose of unauthorized transactions, distributed denial of service attacks do not necessarily result in stolen data. Rather, the intent appears to be to disable essential systems of financial institutions and cause them financial loss and reputational damage. The intent may be mischief on a grand scale, but also retaliation for matters not directly associated with the financial sector.\n\nBanks have been defending themselves against cyberattacks for a while, but the recent attacks involved unprecedented volumes of traffic—up to 20 times more than in previous attacks. Banks and other participants in the payments system will need to reevaluate defense strategies. The increasing incidence and heightened magnitude of attacks suggests to me the need to update our thinking. What was previously classified as an unlikely but very damaging event affecting one or a few institutions should now probably be thought of as a persistent threat with potential systemic implications.\n\nI'm drawing your attention to this area of risk because of recent events and because of the obvious reliance of our societies on electronic networks and commerce. But I feel the need to be measured about the potential for severe financial instability from this source. In my judgment, cyberattacks on payments systems are not likely to have as deep or long lasting an impact on financial system stability as fiscal crises or bank runs, for example. Nonetheless, there is real justification for a call to action. The deputy undersecretary for cyber security at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security recently suggested that \"companies in the same industry could pool infrastructure resources to help each other mitigate the effects of cyberattacks and work together on security issues.\"\n\nEven broad adoption of preventive measures may not thwart all attacks. Collaborative efforts should be oriented to building industry resilience. Resilience measures would be similar to those put in place in the banking industry to maintain operations in a natural disaster—multiple backup sites and redundant computer systems, for example.\n\nPublic pension funding\nNow I'd like to turn to another possible source of financial instability in the United States: public pensions. At a systemic level, this area of concern is more likely to be manifested as a gradually accreting threat to growth than a single event shock.\n\nThe traditional public pension model we find in U.S. states and municipalities is a defined-benefit model that, to be deemed solvent, relies on expected returns on a portfolio of investments to fund future benefits. All together, these pension funds provide retirement benefits for approximately 23 million current and retired public employees and control roughly $3 trillion in invested assets.\n\nPublic pensions are evaluated on the basis of each plan's funding ratio. A pension's funding ratio is defined as the current market value of the invested portfolio as a percentage of the present value of promised future benefits.\n\nLosses on investment portfolios during the financial crisis lowered the aggregate funding ratio from 88 percent in 2007 to 75 percent in 2011. Several large state plans—those in Illinois and Connecticut, for example—currently have funding ratios below 60 percent.\n\nBut these calculations may underestimate the true magnitude of the problem. A funding ratio of 75 percent equates to an assumption of an 8 percent average annual return on the portfolio of investments. It's fair to ask whether this is a realistic assumption given current forecasts of the economic and financial environment. Arguably not.\n\nUsing this optimistic 8 percent return assumption, public state and municipal pension funds have an $800 billion funding gap to fill. Using a lower, more realistic return assumption (such as the longer-term rate on U.S. Treasuries) implies a $3 trillion to $4 trillion funding gap. You might call this \"the other debt problem\" in the United States.\n\nWhat are the options available to deal with these funding gaps?\n\nOne option is to delay action or apply low-pain palliatives and, at some later date, force what amounts to a confrontation between taxpayers and pension fund beneficiaries. To the extent that taxpayers believe this will be the chosen path and the likely outcome, there may be emigration from the worst states and cities—only hastening the day of reckoning.\n\nIf inclined to deal with a funding gap now, fund sponsors have three strategies they can employ: increase contributions, decrease promised future benefits, or take more investment risk in an attempt to outgrow the problem.\n\nMany states and municipalities have begun to pursue reforms that include all of these strategies in combination. Examples include increasing the required contribution of current employees and expanding allowable investments to include alternative assets such as hedge funds and private equity. Several plan sponsors have also attempted to lower benefits that will be paid to future beneficiaries by lowering cost-of-living adjustments. However, decreasing even future benefits may be subject to legal challenge in the United States. A majority of states have laws that treat pension benefits as part of a labor contract between the state and employees with, in some cases, even constitutional protections.\n\nThe underfunding of public pension plans is an implicit form of state and municipal debt with no direct market discipline. Hyman Minsky warned of the dangers of the buildup of private debt, but certainly under some conditions, government debt poses similar risks to economic growth.\n\nAs a financial stability consideration, the problem of pension underfunding is not likely to be the source of any immediate shock or trigger a broader systemic crisis. However, the situation needs to be monitored, as public finance does contribute to financial and economic stability more broadly. The public pension funding problem, as it grows, has the potential to sap the resilience we wish for to withstand a future spell of financial instability.\n\nClosing thoughts\nI will close on a lighter note, but make a serious point. Many of you will remember the scene at the end of the film \"Casablanca.\" Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) has just shot Major Strasser, and a sympathetic Captain Louis Renault (played by Claude Rains) says, \"Round up the usual suspects.\" Just as the world was surprised when the subprime mortgage-backed securities market in the United States triggered a deep financial crisis that affected the whole world, we may be surprised at the source, or sources in combination, of the next episode of financial instability. A modest suggestion: as central banks and other authorities systematically scan for potential sources of financial instability, let's keep an eye on the usual suspects, of course, and on the unusual suspects as well.",

            "highlights": "Atlanta Fed President and CEO Dennis Lockhart discusses current monetary policy in light of the looming fiscal cliff at the University of Virginia Investing Conference on November 16.",
            "content": "Introduction\nAs a policymaker in a very fluid world, I think it is sound practice to periodically take stock of the sum of all policy elements in place and the appropriateness of the full stance of policy for prevailing conditions. At this juncture, it's possible to imagine economic scenarios that are quite divergent, depending especially on how fiscal questions play out.\n\nFed officials—as monetary policymakers—typically maintain some distance from fiscal policy issues. Federal fiscal policy is the domain of the administration and Congress, while monetary policy is the domain of the Federal Reserve.\n\nToday I will venture more than usual into fiscal territory because, given the threats to the broad economy growing out of immediate fiscal concerns, it is unavoidable. In this vein, I want to draw your attention especially to the tension between the downside potential associated with the fiscal cliff and the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) open-ended quantitative easing policy. The dramatic conflict—to use a literary term—boils down to this: if the fiscal cliff is mishandled, the economic outcome could be a recession, adding new challenges to monetary policy and an uncomfortable tension between monetary policy and fiscal policy.\n\nIt's that tension I want to comment on today.\n\nI must emphasize that these are my personal views. My colleagues on the FOMC and in the Federal Reserve System may not agree.\n\nReview of stance of monetary policy\nI'll begin by reviewing the complete makeup of current monetary policy. By any accounting, today's monetary policy is very accommodative, very aggressive.\n\nCurrent policy has three active ingredients—interest rate policy, balance sheet policy, and communication as an actual policy tool versus just an explanatory device. These three elements are intertwined. Balance sheet policies are being used because the policy rate cannot go lower. Communication policies are meant to strengthen the credibility and actionability of both interest rate and balance sheet policies, in effect making expectations a real policy lever.\n\nLet me review these three elements of policy individually.\n\nThe policy interest rate (the federal funds rate) has been at the \"zero lower bound\" since December 2008. The FOMC has stated that the policy rate is likely to remain at that level at least until mid-2015. Said differently, what we call \"liftoff\" (the beginning of a tightening phase) is unlikely to occur before mid-2015. This is not an absolutely firm, cast-in-stone commitment. Rather, it's conditional on the economy evolving as the Committee expects. This means the date could be advanced or pushed back.\n\nBalance sheet policies have been focused, by and large, on the composition of the balance sheet without significant net changes in scale. Initially, this involved increasing the size of the balance sheet, but since 2011, the balance sheet has held steady in scale.\n\nThe balance sheet has grown from about $900 billion prior to the crisis to about $2.9 trillion today, as the first two quantitative easing programs more than replaced special credit facilities established during the crisis. But since 2011, the two main balance sheet programs are the maturity extension program (or \"Operation Twist\") and the large-scale asset purchase program (or QE3, for the third round of so-called quantitative easing), which involves monthly purchases of $40 billion of mortgage-backed securities. Operation Twist is scheduled to conclude by year's end, and a decision will have to be made as to whether to replace it by another round of Treasury securities purchases.\n\nIt should be noted that there is one additional balance sheet policy element in place, and that is the reinvestment of maturing Treasury and mortgage-backed securities.\n\nLet me now turn to the FOMC's communication as an active tool of policy.\n\nThe Committee has had a longstanding practice of providing guidance in some form on the path of the policy interest rate, but this practice has really ratcheted up over the past few years. The most recent iteration has involved communicating a date up to which the low-rate policy is expected to remain in effect. In August of 2011, the Committee provided a date of mid-2013. In January of this year, the date was extended to late 2014. Then, most recently, in September the Committee again extended the date, this time to mid-2015.\n\nThe September statement changed this forward guidance on the interest rate in an important way by adding the condition that the FOMC's low-interest-rate policy would likely remain in effect beyond a point at which the economic recovery strengthens. This escalation in the communication approach could be interpreted as signaling an intention to maintain stimulus and hence deviate from the policy that would be indicated by simple rules for policy formulation—for example, the rule authored by John Taylor, who is here today.\n\nAnother communication innovation introduced in the September statement conveyed that the QE program of mortgage-backed securities purchases is open-ended and that conditionality for stopping the purchases will be tied to \"substantial improvement\" in the outlook for the labor market in a context of price stability. That section of the statement also suggests that the Committee might conduct further asset purchases and deploy other tools if improvement in the labor market is slow to materialize.\n\nWhat constitutes \"substantial improvement\" has not yet been defined. As I said in a recent speech, the health of the labor market is more complex than a single number like the unemployment rate can convey. As with any assessment of the economy, I think it will be appropriate to take a \"dashboard\" approach to get a full picture of prevailing conditions.\n\nThe more aggressive use of communication methods—it's fair to say—is an attempt to improve the public's sense of how the FOMC will respond to changing economic conditions. This would serve to remove uncertainty as much as possible from the environment and improve the confidence of businesses and consumers so they can predict where monetary policy will be, given developments in the economy. The idea is that this predictability is itself potentially stimulative.\n\nJust as balance sheet policies are a natural step when the policy interest rate is at zero, higher-powered communication methods are a natural step as a complement or substitute for balance sheet policies. To sum up my review of policy, monetary policy is certainly very accommodative at this time. Policy is not at its limit, but is well out there on a spectrum measuring degrees of accommodation.\n\nState of the economy and outlook\nLet me now talk about the economy and the outlook. The economy is recovering from a deep recession at a pace of GDP growth gravitating around 2 percent. This may be close to the economy's long-run potential growth rate. In a cyclical sense, we should expect the economy to be growing faster than its long-run trend as a result of the still-substantial amount of slack in the economy, as evidenced by an unemployment rate that is still near 8 percent. Moreover, this sluggish pace of growth implies vulnerability to shocks and stall-out.\n\nThat said, there are positive signs suggesting some firming of economic conditions. The Institute of Supply Management's index of manufacturing activity ticked up in October, and new orders—a forward measure of activity—were encouraging.\n\nConsumer spending growth continues to hold up, and sentiment about prospects for future conditions is improving.\n\nThe housing market has shown signs of life across a variety of indicators, from sales to construction to inventory levels to prices. These trends give me some confidence that a sustainable recovery in this crucial sector is under way. This improvement in turn reinforces my confidence that our policy actions to support this recovery will be effective.\n\nSimilarly, the recent employment numbers have been encouraging. According to the latest report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, payroll employment gains over the past four months have averaged 173,000 net new jobs. If sustained, this pace is fast enough to bring the unemployment rate down at a more rapid rate than we have seen over the past couple of years.\n\nNonetheless, I am not prepared to say we are remotely close to substantial improvement on the employment front. There is still a disproportionate share of part-time jobs reflected in the overall employment gains, long-term unemployment remains unacceptably high, labor force participation rates are still surprisingly low, and initial unemployment gains have not yet fallen to levels that seem consistent with a truly robust jobs picture.\n\nSo in spite of some signs of firming in the overall economy, I'm holding to a base case outlook that has real growth only modestly above a 2 percent growth trend. Inflation should remain moderate and close to the Committee's target of 2 percent. For the reasons I just cited, I expect the employment picture to improve only gradually. This forecast does not incorporate significant effects coming from the major potential sources of downside risk, most prominently the fiscal cliff threat in early 2013.\n\nI expect that continued aggressive use of balance sheet monetary tools will be appropriate and justified by economic conditions for some time even if fiscal cliff issues are properly addressed. I hold to this view even though further growth of the Fed's balance sheet raises concerns of longer-term unintended consequences.\n\nRisk components and the path forward\nConcerns about risks accompanying the Fed's nontraditional monetary policies fall mostly in three areas. There is the risk of distorting and damaging financial market function both in the further expansion and normalization phases. There is the risk of overstimulating the economy in a period of accelerating growth, credit expansion, and possibly increase in money velocity, which could lead to a repeat of boom-and-bust cycles. And there is the risk of dislodging inflation expectations, leading to a far higher than desired level of inflation.\n\nI think it's best for policymakers to assume an attitude of humility when on a path not trod before. There is no guarantee further easing won't bring on the unintended consequences I just mentioned, but I remain comfortable with the course the Committee has chosen. Let me detail the \"whys.\"\n\nA plan for eventual exit has been developed, and the principles that will guide this exit have been published. These principles are sound and actionable. The tools to manage the balance sheet have been developed and tested in small volumes, and I expect they will be effective when employed. The timing question—when to implement these tools—will be critical.\n\nI believe signs will be evident, especially in relevant data like the credit aggregates, which will foretell a credit-fueled pickup in growth and activity. Credit markets hardly seem poised for a great leap that would put monetary policy in a catch-up mode.\n\nThe inflation expectations of the public remain in a zone of comfort. I see no indication of a developing expectations problem, and, if expectations began to drift in a worrisome direction, I'm confident the problem will be identified early enough and addressed.\n\nThe Fed is now an inflation-targeting central bank, having established a formal target of 2 percent in January of this year. The formality of the target should reinforce the Fed's credibility as regards the intended path of inflation.\n\nFiscal concerns\nAt the beginning of my remarks, I pointed out the tension between monetary policy and fiscal policy. That tension is caused by an open-ended asset purchase program whose cessation is conditioned on economic conditions that may be highly and negatively affected by the handling of the fiscal cliff. I'd like to come back to that thought.\n\nThe length and persistence of the FOMC's asset purchase program, and hence the ultimate size of the Fed's balance sheet, depend critically on the pace of economic recovery.\n\nIt's obvious that it's in everyone's interest that the recovery gain momentum and that labor market conditions improve sooner rather than later. I believe that monetary policy is providing the appropriate level of support for that goal. But the FOMC's open-ended commitment to providing monetary accommodation raises the stakes with respect to the outcome of the other big policy elephant in the room: the avoidance of the fiscal cliff and the pursuit of budget sustainability for the federal government.\n\nAs a monetary policymaker, I will stick with my practice of not recommending specific fiscal measures, but I do want to emphasize that Congress and the administration must find a way to avoid the fiscal cliff or risk very serious economic consequences. The near-term economic risks presented by failure to deal effectively with the fiscal measures collectively referred to as the fiscal cliff are so serious that to sidestep this concern feels like trying to whistle past the graveyard.\n\nHere's my operating assumption regarding the economic impact of going over the fiscal cliff: The Congressional Budget Office, or CBO, estimates that the fiscal cliff would cost the economy a little more than 2 percentage points in GDP growth in 2013. Most of the impact would be felt in the first half of the year. In terms of the labor market, the CBO estimates that going over the fiscal cliff would raise the unemployment rate to 9.3 percent. A number of private-sector forecasters have come up with numbers that are broadly similar to the CBO's.\n\nFrom early in the year, my Atlanta Fed colleagues and I have detected a fiscal-cliff drag on activity in grass-roots soundings of business people. But in the 10 days since the election, media attention to the fiscal cliff has risen dramatically. This is only going to be compounded, in my opinion, until resolution is achieved. Observers across the globe are riveted on this potential shock, and that reality suggests the possibility of financial market disturbance if the matter is not handled well.\n\nThe right way to resolve the fiscal cliff and bring the federal budget closer to balance is appropriately left to the political process. But, at a minimum, the chosen solutions should support continued growth. Any approach that compromises the continuation of the economic recovery will be, in my view, very damaging. While the Fed could extend the period of time over which monetary policy accommodation is required, monetary policy would not be able to make up for the body blow to the economy that \"going over the cliff\" would represent.\n\nI have supported with my votes each of the FOMC decisions made this past year. I think that monetary policy is appropriately calibrated to give the U.S. economy its best shot at ongoing, or even accelerating, growth. A sustainable fiscal strategy would provide necessary further support to that process.",

            "highlights": "Atlanta Fed President and CEO Dennis Lockhart discusses the complexity and dynamics of labor markets in a speech to the Chattanooga Downtown Rotary on November 1.",
            "content": "Introduction\nI'm happy to be back in Chattanooga. Chattanooga stands out among mid-sized cities in the Southeast and, indeed, nationally as a place that has mustered the civic leadership and popular support to change the trajectory of its economic destiny. You have seized economic development opportunities, generated new jobs to replace those that were disappearing, and made investments in workforce development that should pay dividends for many years. I have frequently cited Chattanooga as a city where interesting and impressive things are happening. I'm sure many who are responsible for the inspiring story of Chattanooga are in this room.\n\nYour city's resurgence cannot, I suspect, be attributed to a single strategic decision or program of action. But to highlight one thing—you have done something about employment. Today I want to talk about the challenges of understanding employment trends and prospects at the national level, particularly as they are linked to recent decisions by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) as regards monetary policy. I'll begin with a brief summary of the country's economic situation and outlook. I'll then review the current posture of Fed policy and draw attention to what is now a defining aspect of our policy—that is, a focus on improving employment outcomes. And, finally, I'll share some work-in-progress thinking on how to assess the \"substantial improvement\" in labor markets that we will need to see before discontinuing the bond-buying program popularly known as QE3.\n\nAll the views I will express are my personal views. My colleagues on the FOMC and in the Federal Reserve System may not agree.\n\nSummary of current economic situation and outlook\nLet me try to summarize in a few words the current state of the economy and the medium-term outlook. The advance estimate of real GDP growth in the second quarter was posted a week ago. It came in at 2 percent. The number is subject to revision in the weeks ahead and could be revised either lower or higher, but I doubt revisions will be so substantial that the basic narrative will change.\n\nIn my view, the economy has been operating at a pace of growth of around 2 percent since recovery began 40 months ago. There have been quarters of faster growth and certainly quarters that clocked in below 2 percent, but the summary trend rate approximates 2 percent. The economy is stuck in a slow-growth mode.\n\nThe slow and halting progress in bringing down unemployment is mostly attributable to the slow pace of growth. In the prerecession period, the national unemployment rate reached a low of 4.4 percent in May 2007. Unemployment peaked at 10 percent in October 2009. And, as you know, the unemployment rate was 7.8 percent in September of this year. We will get another reading on unemployment tomorrow.\n\nInflation has been well-behaved for the better part of two decades, and that trend has continued over the past few years. Headline inflation has spiked in some quarters because of volatile energy and, to a lesser extent, food commodity prices. But the underlying trend looking back, and I would add looking forward, is close to the FOMC's official target of 2 percent. Inflation expectations—which are a very important factor in determining realized inflation—remain stable.\n\nA mix of positive and negative elements is at work in the economy at this juncture. The housing sector is showing definite signs of improvement as indicated by sales, building activity, and rising house prices. Rising house prices affect consumer confidence, which contributes to growth in consumer spending. Consumer activity has continued to grow at a modest pace in spite of a still-weak economic picture overall.\n\nIn contrast, business investment has slowed in recent quarters. I hear a lot of anecdotal support for the view that many decisions are on hold pending the election results and the hoped-for resolution of the fiscal cliff problem. Europe is also top of mind. At the moment, we are in a bubble of uncertainty that is restraining the economy.\n\nAs to the outlook beyond these immediate concerns, I think the most plausible forecast is continued modest growth with gradual employment gains. Around this more-of-the-same forecast are downside risks of economic shocks as well as chances of somewhat better economic performance if certain risk elements are eliminated or attenuated.\n\nCurrent stance of monetary policy\nOne aim of the current set of monetary policies, in my view, is to construct a floor of support under a still-vulnerable economy. To this end, monetary policy continues to be very accommodative. Let me detail its components.\n\nThe policy interest rate remains at effectively zero. When the policy rate cannot go any lower, central banks resort to so-called balance sheet policies to add further stimulus. In the United States, the Federal Reserve has implemented such programs by purchasing Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities issued by government-sponsored enterprises. This has the effect of increasing the scale of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet.\n\nThe FOMC recently initiated its fourth round of policy initiatives using the balance sheet as the delivery vehicle of stimulus. On September 13, the Committee announced a new program of bond buying concentrated in agency mortgage-backed securities.\n\nThis action supplements what the public knows as \"Operation Twist,\" due to end in December. Operation Twist is the Fed's simultaneous purchase of long-term Treasury securities and sale of short-term Treasuries designed to put pressure on longer-term rates. The short-term sales have the effect of neutralizing the potential balance sheet scale effects. In addition, since September 2011, the Fed has been reinvesting proceeds of maturing Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to avoid any semblance of tightening.\n\nWhat distinguishes the newest round of bond purchases from earlier ones is the open-ended nature of the commitment. In its post-meeting statement on September 13 , the FOMC said, \"If the outlook for the labor market does not improve substantially, the Committee will continue its purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities, undertake additional asset purchases, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate until such improvement is achieved in a context of price stability.\"\n\nSo what is meant by substantial improvement in the outlook for labor markets? I want to devote the remainder of my time to that question. Arriving at an answer is not so straightforward.\n\nComplexity and dynamism: Many moving parts of employment market reality\nThe U.S. labor market is complex with many moving parts. I won't do justice to its complexity and dynamism in my few minutes here today, but let me highlight five important aspects of the employment environment in the United States.\n\nFirst, there is a huge amount of movement within the labor pool. An estimated 17 million people change their employment status each month. That is more than 11 percent of the total labor force. What I'm calling \"movement\" includes people finding jobs; people separating from jobs because they quit, are fired, or are laid off; people entering or reentering the labor market to look for a job; and people leaving the labor market for some other activity.\n\nSecond, being employed takes different forms—full time, part time, temporary, contract worker. Approximately 115 million people currently hold full-time jobs. That's 7 million fewer than before the recession. There are about 28 million people with part-time jobs. That's 3 million more than before the recession. Some part-time workers are satisfied with their status, while some are working part time but really want a full-time job. There are considerably more in this underemployed category—called \"part time for economic reasons\"—than before the recession.\n\nA third aspect is the decline in the rate of participation. Participation in the labor force has been falling since the early 2000s. Some of the decline is attributable to factors that are independent of the current economic situation. One ongoing participation trend relates to young adults. This cohort is pursuing postsecondary education and not entering the work force as early as in the past.\n\nThe largest such factor is demographic—an aging population. An obvious point: older people are more likely to exit the labor market into retirement. The first group of baby boomers is now reaching traditional retirement age. Partially offsetting what would seem to be an inevitable trend is a tendency of older workers to remain attached to the labor market longer than earlier cohorts. The participation rate of older workers in fact has been rising steadily over the last two decades. This reflects factors such as improved health and the need to build, or restore, retirement savings. So, there is a trend within a trend, so to speak. The trend is not one direction only.\n\nWhile some of the drop in participation reflects longer-term trends, some of it is certainly attributable to recent economic conditions. For example, just over 1 million more individuals than before the recession indicate that they are willing and able to work but are not actively searching. If you are not looking, you are not part of the unemployment calculation. It is likely a large share of these individuals considered \"marginally attached\" to the labor force will return to the labor market when conditions improve.\n\nThis discussion highlights that movements in labor force participation can occur for benign reasons, like population aging, and not-so-benign reasons, like a rise in the number of marginally attached workers. Labor force participation can move the unemployment rate both up and down. It is sometimes difficult to interpret changes in the unemployment rate as unambiguously good or bad.\n\nFourth, there are meaningful variations in the performance of labor markets across regions and sub-markets within regions. It's important, I believe, to consider whether weak employment conditions are widespread or concentrated in a few regional labor markets reflecting idiosyncratic local circumstances. Neither North Dakota nor Michigan is representative of the nation overall.\n\nA fifth aspect of the employment picture relates to generating new jobs. Job creation and job destruction are occurring continuously and, to an extent, go hand in hand. Research shows that new and early-stage businesses account for a significant share of jobs created. At the same time, a high fraction of early-stage businesses do not survive beyond five years. When we think about job creation in our society, we should think, at least in part, of impermanent jobs that disappear due to business failure and that are replaced by jobs in other, often newer, entrepreneurial ventures, many of which also fail in time. The reality is one of continuous churn.\n\nWe would like to have more and better information on the formation of new businesses and the jobs they create. The statistical tools in this area leave something to be desired. We do, however, have good and reasonably current information on job openings and job postings of a broad cross-section of businesses including both mature and early-stage firms.\n\nI hope this commentary gives you a sense of how complex and dynamic the country's employment market truly is. There is much we don't know about the labor market. Not all important trends are captured well in the data. The data are prone to normal measurement error and revision. In my view, reliance on a single statistic to judge the health of the labor market may not be sufficient.\n\nIn support of this opinion, let me contrast recent official job growth numbers with the official unemployment rate. Total monthly employment gains at the national level in the first quarter of this year averaged 225,000. That pace slowed in the second quarter to a monthly average of 67,000. Although job growth moved higher in the third quarter, the month-to-month progression from July to September showed a decline. Job growth has hardly begun to build positive momentum.\n\nMeanwhile, the unemployment numbers are showing a somewhat different picture. Nationally, the unemployment rate changed little during the first half of 2012. From January through July, the unemployment rate hovered between 8.1 percent and 8.3 percent. By September, the rate had fallen half a percentage point from 8.3 percent as of July to 7.8 percent a month ago.\n\nFor policy purposes, I think it's appropriate to be cautious about relying on a single indicator of labor market trends—for example, the unemployment rate—to determine whether the condition of \"substantial improvement\" has been met. The official national unemployment rate published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics is the most prominent statistic in the mind of the general public. As a policymaker, I want to have confidence that a decline of this headline number is reinforced by other indicators and evidence of broad labor market improvement in its many dimensions. The challenge my FOMC colleagues and I will face is communicating in simple and trackable terms what this phrase \"substantial improvement\" means while respecting the complex reality of many moving parts.\n\nA working concept of \"substantial improvement\"\nRemember that at the beginning of my remarks I characterized my thinking on the meaning of \"substantial improvement\" as a work in progress. In that spirit, let me share a qualitative framework for defining \"substantial improvement.\"\n\nThe starting point certainly should be the headline unemployment rate and the payroll jobs number. The interpretation of movements in these two statistics would be enriched and reinforced by a review of additional data elements.\n\nHere are examples of what I would look for:\n\nFirst, I would look for lower unemployment rates that are driven by increased flows of job seekers into employment. I would not interpret discouraged workers dropping out of the labor force as a sign of improvement, even if the unemployment rate falls as a consequence.\n\nConversely, I'd like to see growing public confidence in the labor market as measured by increased movement of people from out-of-the labor-force status into the labor force—that is, growing labor force participation. I would interpret a reduction in the number of marginally attached workers as a sign of improvement, even if the unemployment rate goes temporarily higher.\n\nThird, I'd look for employment gains that are associated with reductions in underemployment. I would interpret a pickup in job growth less positively if it is associated with increases in part-time jobs for people who seek full-time work.\n\nFinally, I'd like to see signs that improvements in all these indicators are gaining momentum and are sustainable. A framework for assessing labor market conditions needs to include forward indicators of labor market health, such as falling claims for unemployment insurance.\n\nClose\nTo sum up, the FOMC continues to marshal an aggressive attack on the serious employment challenges that beset the nation. The Committee has conditioned any further monetary stimulus on improvement—substantial improvement—in labor market prospects. In my view, it's desirable to put more definition around the term \"substantial improvement\" since so much rides on the Committee's assessment of that economic milestone.\n\nIn closing, I again want to express my admiration for what's been accomplished here in Chattanooga. Back in 1969, CBS news anchor Walter Cronkite called Chattanooga the dirtiest city around. Today you are aptly known as the \"scenic city.\" While achieving this visible transformation, you have transformed the economy of the city in so many fundamental ways. This afternoon, I'm taking a tour of the Volkswagen plant to see firsthand evidence of what you have done.\n\nThanks for having me here.",

            "highlights": "Atlanta Fed President and CEO Dennis Lockhart speaks to the Atlanta Institute of Internal Auditors on the U.S. economic outlook and monetary policy on September 21, 2012.",
            "content": "Introduction\nThank you for the opportunity to talk to you today about the economic outlook and the stance of monetary policy.\n\nJust a little over a week has passed since the last meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, where the decision was made to launch a new program of large-scale asset purchases, often called QE3, for the third round of quantitative easing. There was more to the policy action than just a program of purchases of mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Forward guidance about the duration of ultra-low interest rates was revised, and there were other communication innovations, as reflected in the official statement that followed the meeting.\n\nToday I plan to provide a before-and-after perspective on the committee's action of last week. This is an opportune time to explain why I supported the policy decision and to share my personal views about why action was called for and what it can be expected to accomplish.\n\nI want to emphasize that these are my personal views that may not be shared by my colleagues on the FOMC or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nState of the economy\nLet me start with a summary of the current economic situation and the outlook that prevailed going into last week's meeting.\n\nThe national economy has been on a roughly 2 percent growth trend for most of the recovery. The recovery officially began in June 2009, so the economy has been expanding for more than three years. There have been quarters of faster than 2 percent growth and quarters that fell short of that pace. But when I step back and try to discern the basic economic narrative of the last three years, I conclude that the underlying trend has been one of very sluggish growth with occasional, short-lived periods of acceleration off that trend. Given the severity and breadth of the financial shock that precipitated the recession of 2008 and 2009, I don't think it's surprising that growth has been slow in comparison with earlier post-recession recoveries.\n\nFor most of the first half of this year, I held to a view on the medium-term outlook that predicted continuing growth at a modest pace, a gradual decline in unemployment, and inflation staying close to the FOMC's 2 percent target. Recent data have called even this modest growth scenario into question. Data for the first three quarters of the year suggest slowing momentum under the 2 percent trend, and, importantly, a slowing of progress in bringing down the high rate of unemployment.\n\nToo much can be made of one month's data releases. At the Atlanta Fed, we are always trying to tease out the noteworthy signals from the accompanying noise. However, the accumulation of data through August suggested a slowdown from the already anemic pace of growth and a stagnating labor market.\n\nThe FOMC conducts the business of monetary policy under two mandates from Congress. The committee is charged with promoting low and stable prices—a low rate of inflation—and maximum employment. In January of this year, the committee formalized an inflation target of 2 percent. The record of inflation—judged against a number of inflation indicators and measures of inflation expectations—has hewed closely to this target and continues to do so.\n\nThe record of employment gains has been less comfortable. Taking a two-year view, the trend rate of gains in employment has been roughly 150,000 per month. This pace would be sufficient, at current levels of participation in the workforce, to sustain a steady, gradual reduction of the unemployment rate. Over the past six months, however, jobs growth has averaged only 97,000 net new jobs per month. At 8.1 percent in August, the rate of civilian unemployment has essentially shown no clear downward trend since the beginning of the year.\n\nI've been describing the national picture. Let me bring this into sharper relief for you by summarizing conditions closer to home in the Southeast.\n\nThere are anomalous pockets of strength in our region—industries and geographies that defy the national trends. For example, the auto assembly plants across the Southeast have been very busy, reflecting the strength of light vehicle sales nationally. Louisiana and the Gulf Coast have been bolstered by the strength of the energy sector. Residential real estate markets in Florida, particularly South Florida, that were hard hit in the recession have shown signs of turnaround.\n\nTo generalize, though, the economy of the Southeast has been growing but has lagged to some extent behind the national economy. The recession cut deeper into economic activity and employment in our region, and the road back has been longer.\n\nHere in Georgia, total employment fell by more than 340,000 in the recession. About one-third of the jobs lost have been restored. The state's unemployment rate stands at 9.3 percent, more than a percentage point above the national figure and double what it was before the recession.\n\nThe hiring slowdown—both national and regional—can be attributed to a number of factors, including some that could well be transitory. My colleagues and I talk to a lot of employers across the Southeast. Many business contacts say that the economy is not getting much better, but also not a lot worse. They cite various uncertainties that cause them to assume a very cautious posture as regards bringing on new employees. These include the outcome of the election, the fiscal cliff and other federal fiscal matters, Europe, and health care costs. Many business people also cite weak sales expectations in this environment of slow growth.\n\nThere has been a vigorous debate in economist and policymaker circles around the question of whether the main impediments to job creation are structural in nature or attributable to weak demand. The distinction between structural weakness and weakness related to slow demand growth is not all that clear cut. For my purposes, the essential issue is whether the problem of slow employment growth is amenable to a monetary policy treatment or not. That is the heart of the debate, and this debate continues. Unquestionably, the country's employment situation is complex, with many factors at work to produce the static condition we now seem to face. But I have been persuaded that the problem is, to a significant enough extent, one of weak growth that can be ameliorated by prudent monetary policy actions. A stronger overall pace of recovery is central to improvement in the labor market. As I approached the FOMC meeting of last week, I concluded that there was indeed a call to action falling out of the discouraging conditions of slowing growth and still-high unemployment with meager recent progress in bringing it down.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that the drop of the official unemployment rate from 8.3 percent in July to 8.1 percent in August was due, in large part, to an increase in the number of people who were previously unemployed dropping out of the workforce.\n\nThe dynamics of today's labor market are complex and not fully understood, even by those who have brought the greatest expertise to bear on analyzing the problems. We have the unemployed, the long-term unemployed, the underemployed (including part time seeking full time), temporaries preferring full-time permanent employment, and discouraged workers who are no longer looking.\n\nThe FOMC's decision last week\nAs the FOMC meeting of September 12 and 13 approached, I concluded that, although open to debate, further monetary policy support was justified. For me the policy question was what tools in combination have the greatest chance of producing real results in terms of faster growth and employment gains while preserving price stability.\n\nLet me do a review of the key elements of last week's policy move and put this in the context of the cumulative monetary accommodation deployed so far to support recovery.\n\nTo support recovery, the FOMC has held the policy rate—the federal funds rate—at a range of zero to 25 basis points since December 2008. In August of last year, the committee provided guidance to the effect that this low rate would likely be maintained until mid-2013. In January, the Committee revised this guidance to at least the latter months of 2014. In last week's meeting, the guidance was revised to at least through mid-2015.\n\nIn the statement that followed the meeting, the committee reinforced and clarified the rate guidance by explaining that the low federal funds rate policy will likely remain in force even after the economy shows signs of picking up, provided the inflation outlook remains benign.\n\nWith the policy rate effectively at the zero lower bound for better than three-and-a-half years, additional monetary accommodation has been applied through the use of balance sheet tools. At the end of 2007, the Fed's balance sheet stood at around $900 billion, made up of mostly Treasury securities on the asset side. Today, the balance sheet is about $2.9 trillion. The growth of the balance sheet resulted from emergency credit facilities put in place during the financial crisis of 2008, later replaced and augmented by two rounds of large-scale asset purchases, or quantitative easing. These rounds of quantitative easing involved purchases of Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities. In January of this year, the committee supplemented the earlier balance sheet actions (QE1 and QE2) with a maturity extension program. This program was designed to be largely neutral in its effect on the scale of the balance sheet and bank reserves. Its intent was to shift out the average maturity of Treasury holdings through purchases of longer-term Treasuries and sales of shorter-term Treasuries. This has put downward pressure on long-dated Treasury rates and on longer term interest rates in general.\n\nLast week, the Committee decided to continue the already existing maturity extension program through year's end. This program will increase the Federal Reserve's holdings of longer term Treasuries by about $45 billion per month.\n\nIn addition, the committee decided to initiate a new program of purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities at the pace of $40 billion per month. The extent of purchases was not defined and was left conditional on the state of the economy, particularly employment.\n\nThe policy statement along with comments of Chairman Bernanke in his postmeeting press conference emphasized that further policy actions, possibly in the form of additional asset purchases, will be decided on the basis of the extent of improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions over the coming months. As always, the outlook for inflation will also be a critical consideration.\n\nIn my view, a holistic evaluation of employment conditions is necessary because the unemployment rate, taken alone, may not be a reliable indicator of progress. The unemployment rate can fall for both good and not-so-good reasons and may rise for what amount to good reasons.\n\nAll together, the rate guidance, asset purchase, and communications policy actions taken last week represented a forceful attempt to improve the outlook for the economy.\n\nI supported the package of policy measures because I believe together they will help. The necessary natural healing from the large disruption of the financial crisis will certainly be supported, and likely accelerated, by the stance of policy with the new features introduced last week.\n\nLet me explain how I think the purchase of mortgage-backed securities will help. I think the initiation of a program of MBS purchases is well-timed given recent improvement in the housing market. Sales activity has picked up in many markets, and it appears that the recent increase in purchases is being driven primarily by mortgage-financed buyers for owner occupancy rather than cash investors. House prices are beginning to rise in many markets. Multi-family housing development continues to be a favored sector of commercial real estate. New single-family permitting and home building have picked up somewhat.\n\nHere in the Southeast, it's clear that one of the main reasons the downturn was deeper than for the country overall is the reliance on in-migration and residential housing development as an economic engine. We are now seeing some signs of life in the housing sector in Atlanta, in Georgia, and across the Southeast generally.\n\nBy maintaining downward pressure on mortgage rates and by encouraging growth of mortgage-financed purchase activity, sales activity in the Southeast and nationwide should accelerate, and upward pressure on home prices should contribute to consumer confidence. The policy action should have positive sector-specific effects with spillover to general conditions. An improving housing sector will help calm one headwind that has impeded a stronger recovery.\n\nAnd I don't entirely rule out the weakening of other headwinds. If Congress deals effectively with the fiscal cliff threat, and if the uncertainty associated with the European debt crisis dissipates further, the outlook could be considerably more favorable in a few months' time.\n\nClosing\nAs I said earlier, the incoming data, on balance, had deteriorated to the point that I thought additional policy action was warranted. The core rationale of my support was to better assure that the economy remains on a growth trajectory sufficient to steadily, if gradually, reduce the rate of national joblessness. I am not expecting miracles.\n\nI think the action recently taken by the committee has improved the country's economic prospects by reducing the potential downside apparent in the incoming data. In this sense, the policy action was a preventative. But I expect policy will do more than just prevent backsliding.\n\nHowever, to be effective, the measures taken last week must work their way through multiple steps to have the desired effects. They must lower interest rates, raise asset prices, and reduce policy uncertainty. These intermediate results must increase the confidence of consumers and businesses. That must lead to a heightened inclination to spend, invest, and take risk. And these actions must result in more economic activity, rising demand, and ultimately hiring.\n\nLast week the FOMC adopted a package of strong measures to further support the recovery. To repeat, low rates will be needed through at least mid-2015 even if the recovery quickens ahead of this date. MBS purchases will continue until we see a better employment situation. If we do not see improvement, more action may be taken. And inflation will be monitored closely and kept near 2 percent. Speaking for myself, I hope the resolve of the FOMC is clear.\n\n",

            "highlights": "Atlanta Fed President and CEO Dennis Lockhart speaks at the Future of Workforce Development conference at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City on September 20, 2012.",
            "content": "Welcome\nIt's my pleasure to welcome you to the second day of the conference on \"The Future of Workforce Development.\" The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta is very pleased to be collaborating with our cosponsor, the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, to organize the conference and come together with you to discuss this important topic.\n\nIntroduction\nTo begin, let me refer back to President Esther George's remarks yesterday. She explained why workforce development is important to the work of the Federal Reserve. Like President George, I come at this topic from the perspective of someone involved in macroeconomic policy, with a mandate to promote full employment. The state of employment here and now and the immediate outlook for jobs is front of mind for me and my colleagues. The concern about employment markets was evident in the statement that explained the policy action taken at last week's Federal Open Market Committee (or FOMC) meeting.\n\nThe August jobs report released earlier this month made evident that the state of U.S. labor markets is far from satisfactory. I know your jobs are made more challenging as a result of the current economic environment. But workforce development has a deeper and longer-term character and will continue to be important to overall economic health even after the current problem of high unemployment is solved.\n\nSo today I'd like to focus my remarks on some longer-term trends in the nature of work in the economy. These trends bear on the future of the human capital development infrastructure in our country. Workforce development is, of course, a critical element of this infrastructure.\n\nCurrent economic conditions cannot be totally ignored in this discussion, but, as I said, I want to concentrate on the continuing challenges that were present prior to the last five years and that will remain even when conditions return to a more normal state. I will make some observations that draw on feedback collected in the Federal Reserve's own forums of workforce development professionals, including many of you.\n\nMy broad theme will be the need for greater adaptability and alignment of stakeholders in the workforce development arena. It's obvious that workers themselves are stakeholders. Workers will need to evolve and renew their skills—both hard and soft skills—to keep pace with a changing workplace. One of the directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta runs an outplacement services firm. He speaks of the need for workers to think of themselves as lessors of their skills over their work lives. His point is workers need to take responsibility for maintenance of their skills and make ongoing investments in the acquisition of new skills.\n\nMore relevant to this conference is the need for greater adaptability and alignment among the various organizations and professionals who occupy the central space in the nation's formal system of human capital development.\n\nKey observations\nI'll build this point on observations drawn from a recent extensive review of labor market trends by MIT economists Daron Acemoglu and David Autor. You also heard related research presented in yesterday's sessions.\n\nFirst, the returns to higher education have increased substantially over the past three decades. This is well known, even if questioned very recently. In the early 1980s, the average wage earned by a college-educated worker was about 50 percent higher than that received by a worker with just a high school education. By 2008, that premium had almost doubled. In the last decade especially, most of the gains from higher education have been concentrated in those earning a graduate degree.\n\nIt's conceivable the widening wage gap between those with a high school diploma or less and those with a college degree or more could be happening in an environment where all incomes are rising. This wouldn't be so bad, but this is not the case. The rising relative return on education in part reflects the fact that the average wage of workers with less than a college degree has stagnated over the last 20 or so years.\n\nRising inequality across education groups has been accompanied by rising inequality within education groups. Increasingly, it's recognized that education level is not synonymous with skill. This is a second observation.\n\nIn today's labor market, the skills that matter most for job finding and job keeping, as well as wage growth, encompass abilities like critical thinking and analytical skills. This is to say the ability to perform nonrepetitive tasks that cannot be automated, cannot be easily replaced by technology, or cannot be transferred to remote locations (including foreign locations) is in greatest demand and best rewarded. Increasingly, education level alone is not a sufficient marker for this type of skill.\n\nThe advice to \"get an education\" is still sound. But labor markets have shifted decidedly in the direction of rewarding the skills necessary for nonrepetitive tasks that require the application of judgment. The word \"judgment\" here can be thought of as indicating a range of skills such as analytical skills, problem-solving skills, critical-thinking skills, and the like. I would argue that the stakes have risen for educators in their role as workforce developers. But certainly, all players in the human capital development community need to adapt to this reality.\n\nInstitutional infrastructure for human capital development\nLet me take a higher level view and comment on this more encompassing notion of human capital development.\n\nIn my view, there are four key institutional factors that influence success in the process of human capital development.\n\nThe first is solid general economic fundamentals supported by prudent and effective macroeconomic policies. The Fed obviously has a role in this.\n\nSecond is a strong basic educational system from pre-K through grade 12. Attention to early childhood development in the years before kindergarten is relatively new but increasingly treated as essential. Beyond that lies our higher education system, of course, including the spectrum of community, vocational, and technical colleges as well as postgraduate professional schools.\n\nThird is vibrant support for economic development at the local level.\n\nAnd fourth is a flexible and dynamic system of workforce development.\n\nGetting the first two success factors right (solid economic fundamentals and a strong educational system) is far from straightforward, but they are relatively easy to grasp conceptually. So, given limited time, I will expand on economic development as contrasted with workforce development, the subject of this gathering.\n\nIn the simplest terms, economic development is about jobs for people. Workforce development is about people for the jobs. The distinction is about the starting point.\n\nEconomic development has historically focused on recruiting domestic and international relocations and major capital investments of existing firms that bring jobs. At the national level, this can amount to just a shuffling of jobs—not what I would call true job creation. Whether domestic or international, it's a zero-sum game.\n\nOver the last 15 or more years, the practice of economic development has expanded to areas such as university technology transfer and the commercialization of research, business incubation and entrepreneurial ecosystem development, and tourism product development. These efforts come closer, in my view, to confronting the challenge of organic job generation. Recent research shows that a high proportion of new jobs comes from new-business formation—start-ups and early-stage businesses.\n\nThrough such economic development efforts, demand for labor is created. Economic development strategies embrace the development of a competitive workforce from the resident population as well as the attraction to a region of new talent as critical complementary components.\n\nThe field of workforce development, as I perceive it, starts with people and their skills. The field aims to sustainably and productively engage people in the labor market. Workforce development has both economic and social ends.\n\nIt strikes me there are a number of variations on the theme of workforce development—and, consequently, a host of players. These include organizations that develop an existing workforce's skills to meet the immediate needs of a new employer, parties that act as a conduit between employers and job candidates, and those who target a specific population that has chronically struggled to find employment. An example would be high school dropouts and students at risk of dropping out.\n\nEveryone professionally involved in the broad goal of human capital development is influenced by changes in labor markets. But those of you in the field of workforce development are directly impacted by changing work requirements and labor demand, and few are as directly confronted with the need for flexibility and adaptability. When there are big changes in the nature of work, workforce development professionals are on the hot seat.\n\nNotes from recent round tables\nIn the past year, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, as well as several other Federal Reserve Banks, have hosted more than 30 round tables around the country with various players in the workforce development system.\n\nIn these interactions with you in the workforce development community, we heard a common theme: there is a need for better coordination among employers, economic developers, and the workforce development community. And there is a need for better alignment of the goals and activities of players in the human capital development space broadly.\n\nWe frequently heard there is a troubling mismatch between the needs of employers and the education and training offered both by workforce development agencies and education systems.\n\nThis lack of alignment takes many forms, apparently.\n\nWe heard complaints that many education providers do not effectively engage employers and fail to develop curricula that help students acquire the skills and aptitudes relevant to today's workplace.\n\nEmployers complain they are often not invited to the table when economic development plans are hatched.\n\nThe strategies employed by various workforce development system players are often disjointed and sometimes contradictory—that is, having opposite aims.\n\nPractitioners in the different realms of human capital development belong to different professional associations. Few local or national events bring them all together.\n\nPerhaps the most biting observation we heard in our round tables was about the ones missing in action. While almost every community has established a workforce development group, nearly all had a critical partner (employers, curriculum designers, or technical colleges) either absent or ineffective.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Board and several Reserve Banks, including Atlanta and Kansas City, will be releasing a summary report and findings in October on these forums. We hope the report will make a serious contribution. And we will continue to look for ways we can be effectively engaged.\n\nClose\nRegardless of the perspective each of us brings to this conference, we are all struggling with the current situation. Nonetheless, we're gathered here to tackle longer-term questions concerned with preparing a competitive and resilient workforce by improving the workforce development system. I don't presume that the observations I've shared with you today offer any startling new insights, let alone solutions. Instead, they are intended to be thoughts of an outsider observing a complicated system that will greatly influence the future of the economy.\n\nThe point of this conference is to bring multiple actors into a single room to share the best of what works and to explore the challenges that lie ahead. To this end, I am looking forward to today's sessions.\n\nIn this morning's first panel, you'll hear more about the requirements of tomorrow's workforce. Later in the day, speakers will share insights on workforce development program evaluation, including the Georgia Works program in my home state, which allows qualified unemployment insurance recipients the opportunity to train with a potential employer.\n\nLater today, Rolando Montoya, provost from Miami-Dade College, along with others will talk about how workforce developers in the education system are working in concert with economic developers and employers to fulfill specific demands of actual workplaces.\n\nAnd, finally, we'll hear closing remarks by Carol Tomé, executive vice president of corporate services and chief financial officer at Home Depot (and chair of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta). Carol will share insights on Home Depot University and Home Depot's needs for a ready workforce.\n\nI will be joining you for the remainder of the program and expect to learn a lot. I thank you for taking the time to engage in this most vital conversation.",

            "highlights": "Atlanta Fed President and CEO Dennis Lockhart speaks to the Latin American Chamber of Commerce and the World Affairs Council in Atlanta on the economic ties between Latin America and the United States on August 21, 2012.",
            "content": "Thanks to the Latin American Chamber of Commerce and the World Affairs Council of Atlanta for the opportunity to speak about the state of economic relations between the United States and Latin America. Thanks also to Georgia Power for providing this outstanding venue.\n\nLet me begin by saying that the Atlanta Fed has a strong connection to Latin America. Our supervision and regulation team oversees branches and subsidiaries of a number of Latin American banks in our district, particularly in Miami.\n\nOur research department monitors the economic performance of the economies of the region, and our economists interact with colleagues including central bank officials in Latin America. Last October, for instance, our chief economist and I attended a conference sponsored by the Banco Central de Chile and later visited the central bank of Brazil. I will relate impressions from that trip in a moment.\n\nThe Atlanta Fed leads the retail payments operations of the Federal Reserve System. Our FedGlobal ACH service executes small ticket money transfers from U.S. banks to banks in some 35 countries, including 12 in Latin America. Our first international partner was the central bank of Mexico. Through our Directo a México program, we help Mexican authorities reach underserved and unbanked consumer markets. In addition, our community and economic development team does outreach work here with immigrants from Latin America.\n\nFinally, and very significantly, our international cash operation in Miami sends and receives U.S. dollar banknotes working with Latin American central banks and commercial banks in the region. More later on this, too.\n\nAll of these programs are under the umbrella of our Americas Center initiative, headed by Stephen Kay. I also have a deep personal interest in the region, where I had many business ties in my previous career.\n\nThe title of this speech is \"The U.S. Economic Outlook and Implications for Latin America,\" but I would like to expand the idea of my talk to include the experience of Latin America and implications for the United States. I think the world can learn much from the path taken by many Latin American countries since the 1980s.\n\nThere has been great progress economically in recent years in Latin America. As these economies have stabilized and matured, the economic ties between the United States and Latin America have grown. It is my view that the policy reforms and the resulting transformations we've seen in the economies of the region contain important lessons for the rest of the world.\n\nLatin America, 1980s and now\nI'll begin by looking back at the 1980s, the so-called \"lost decade\" in Latin America, and contrast the region's economies then to today. The 1980s was a time of economic turmoil, with low growth, high inflation, and financial crises—more specifically, sovereign debt crises. It's quite a different picture today. The region is now far more stable. Most countries of the region now pursue economic policies resulting in higher growth and price stability. Democratic governance is the norm.\n\nIn the 1980s, Latin America's real GDP growth averaged around 2 percent. From 2004 through 2011, annual GDP growth averaged 4.5 percent. And during the recent global financial crisis, the region's economies proved resilient, with a relatively shallow decline followed by a rapid recovery.\n\nBy the 1980s, many countries had spent years pursuing protectionist import-substitution industrial policies that essentially closed their countries to global markets. Today, we see far more open economies, with countries reaping the gains from trading in global markets.\n\nYou may recall that during the '80s, inflation was endemic in the region. Inflation got to 132 percent in Mexico in 1987 and more than 3,000 percent in Argentina in 1989. We can contrast that to the relative price stability that we see today, with a region-wide consumer price inflation averaging 5.5 percent a year over the past five years. Inflation targeting is a common practice, and many of the region's central banks have achieved a high degree of credibility.\n\nAs I said, the 1980s was also a period of debt crises, particularly external debt crises involving obligations to foreign banks. The external imbalances were born of deep fiscal problems. In the 1980s, governments ran large budget deficits, and public debt relative to GDP soared. Governments relied on foreign dollar-denominated financing at a time when governments could not issue debt in their own currencies. International reserves covered less than a fifth of total foreign debt.\n\nToday, it is a different story. Most countries in the region have moved toward fiscal balance, debt levels are far lower, local currency capital markets are deeper, and some governments are able to sell local currency-denominated securities to foreign investors. The ratio of international reserves to total foreign debt rose to about 70 percent last year, approximately five times the average in the 1980s.\n\nPersonal recollections\nI have personal recollections from the '80s. For calendar year 1987, I was in charge of Citicorp's efforts to organize a debt-for-equity swap program involving a number of \"restructuring countries\" (as they were called) in Latin America. These countries included Mexico, Chile, Argentina, and Brazil. The idea of a debt-equity swap was that a government would allow and facilitate the exchange of its sovereign or private external debt for shareholdings in domestic firms and assets. In effect, the debt would be the currency with which a lender could buy stock in a local company. After such a transaction, some of the country's external debt would be extinguished.\n\nIn some countries of Latin America, this program was politically unpopular. There was resistance to what opponents of the scheme considered handing over the patrimony of the country at a bargain price.\n\nFor this brief period—1987—I was immersed in the policy debates and politics of sovereign debt restructuring. Restructuring is the end-of-the-road measure undertaken when a country and its government are severely overextended. I came away from this experience with two broad observations:\n\nFirst, nations control their destinies by implementing and sustaining good policies. External factors beyond a country's control can deliver shocks to an economy, but for the most part, domestic policy decisions determine a country's economic fate.\n\nAnd second, the world's capital markets \"vote,\" in effect, every day on a country's policies. Sovereignty does not mean a government can dictate terms to the world. Policymakers are compelled to respect the power and opinion of investors.\n\nTies between the United States and Latin America\nIn the wake of the lost decade, Latin American policymakers, generally speaking, have pursued more prudent macroeconomic and fiscal policies and opened their economies to global capital markets and trade.\n\nThis policy transformation has made possible a considerable strengthening of economic ties between the United States and Latin America.\n\nTrade between the United States and Latin America has grown rapidly. About a fifth of U.S. imports now come from Latin America, up from around 15 percent in the 1980s. And the share of U.S. exports going to Latin America has risen considerably, from an average of 15 percent of all U.S. exports in the '80s to nearly 25 percent.\n\nIn the southeastern United States, a significant portion of merchandise exports go to Latin America. Around half of merchandise exports from Florida and Mississippi are bound for Latin America, around a third of exports from Louisiana, and about a fifth of exports from Georgia, Tennessee, and Alabama.\n\nLast year, the flow of U.S. direct investment in Latin America rose to $84.5 billion, and direct investment from Latin America into the United States was $18.4 billion.\n\nI mentioned earlier the movement of U.S. dollar cash we manage in the Atlanta Fed branch in Miami. In 2011, we shipped $1.7 billion in U.S. currency to Brazil, with the primary demand coming from tourists planning to travel to the United States. Spending by Brazilians in Florida has made quite an impression on their hosts. Florida Trend magazine named Brazil as \"Floridian of the Year\" in 2011, acknowledging the 1.5 million Brazilians who visited Florida, second only to the number of Canadian visitors to Florida. Brazilians also represented 12 percent of foreign buyers of real estate in South Florida last year, second only to Venezuelans.\n\nWe also see growing cash transactions with Panama, where the canal is being expanded to accommodate ships that are nearly three times larger than current vessels transiting the canal. Rail, port, and distribution facilities throughout the United States are being upgraded to handle larger vessels and more cargo that will result from the canal expansion.\n\nAnd one more point about how the north-south relationship in our hemisphere has changed: in the 1980s, most Latin American economies were reliant on foreign capital. Today, many countries are capital exporters. Brazil is the fourth largest holder of U.S. Treasury Securities, with more than $200 billion in Treasuries as of June 2012, after China, Japan, and the major oil exporters as a group.\n\nTrade, capital flows, and decoupling\nNot long ago it was fashionable to talk of the decoupling of certain emerging market economies from advanced economies. The notion was that major countries like Brazil are sufficiently independent economically to be unaffected by developments in advanced economies—the United States and Europe, for example.\n\nThere is some reality in this claim. During and since the financial crisis of 2008 and the recession in this country that followed, Latin America demonstrated impressive resilience. There was some contagion, but on balance Latin America came through this period without severe downside effects. In percentage terms, real GDP contraction in Latin America in 2009 was less than half of that in advanced economies. And the following year's recovery was much stronger. For many countries in South America, the economic output fell for only two quarters.\n\nAt the same time, several countries of Latin America have been on the receiving end of sizeable capital flows that have brought unique challenges. When I visited Chile and Brazil last fall, I heard a lot about the volatility of portfolio investment capital flows that swing with the appetite of global investors for emerging market risk and risk in general.\n\nEconomists and central bankers expressed a lot of concern about how to manage their monetary affairs in an environment characterized by strong capital inflows that drive their exchange rate higher and fuel credit expansion that in turn causes a boom in asset prices. Then these forces can come to sudden stops followed by a reversal of capital flows, falling asset prices, and credit contraction because of shrinking collateral for loans. My central bank colleagues from Latin America did not talk of decoupling. Rather, they described their challenge of avoiding a boom-bust cycle as a result of hot money flows in a risk on-risk off world.\n\nThe export trade of Latin America is also affected by demand conditions here in the United States and the rest of the world. Beyond direct exports to the United States, we have seen how in recent years South American commodity exports to emerging Asia have soared. Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Peru are the leading exporters of commodities to emerging Asia, and China is now Brazil's top trading partner. The boom has contributed to strong economic growth in the exporting countries, but as global growth has slowed, so has demand for these commodity exports, and commodity prices have fallen.\n\nMost Latin American countries, through openness to capital flows and trade, are more and more integrated into the global economy. This is, on balance, a good thing, but it brings policy challenges in their pursuit of macroeconomic stability and consistent growth.\n\nConclusion\nLet me recap. The Latin American story—in the simplest terms—goes something like this: Latin America got into trouble in the '80s because of bad policy decisions. The region suffered what some have called a lost decade. Since then, the governments of most Latin countries have pursued sound policies, and as a result these countries have progressed economically and their economies continue to perform rather well.\n\nThis history suggests to me there exist certain basic realities—behaving almost like physics—that cannot be long ignored or avoided. Consistent and sustained good economic performance needs a foundation of sound fundamentals. These fundamentals include good fiscal management—especially debt management—and monetary policy that supports growth while delivering control of inflation. Add to these the maintenance of an open economy that accepts and benefits from trade and capital flows from the rest of the world.\n\nIt is my sense that the countries of Latin America have mostly learned these lessons.\n\nI don't believe the United States or other mature economies are immune to these realities—these physics, so to speak. The U.S. economy has been in a technical recovery since the summer of 2009. The recovery to date has seen weak growth and persistently high unemployment. By any number of measures, the strength of the recovery has been and remains disappointing.\n\nSome commentators have warned that the United States, along with Europe and Japan, could be experiencing our own lost decade. Just last week, an article in the Financial Times argued the world is halfway there. Friday's New York Times ran an article referring to Europe's lost decade. I will leave it to economic historians to arrive at a verdict on this question, but certainly our current expansion is not on the track we would wish.\n\nReal personal income (excluding government transfer payments) is still 1.5 percent below what it was before the recession in late 2007.\n\nAs of July, there are more than 4½ million fewer payroll jobs than in November of 2007. Most of these job losses were in the private sector. The share of unemployed workers who have been out of a job for more than 27 weeks has fluctuated between 40 and 50 percent over the entire course of the recovery.\n\nI think this condition can be attributed, at least in part, to fundamental imbalances that have not yet been corrected, a situation that presents formidable challenges for monetary policymakers. There is a risk to monetary policy being employed too aggressively and without effect to address economic problems that can be resolved only by fiscal reforms that involve making tough choices about the allocation of public resources. Monetary policy can exert a powerful positive influence on an economy, but as Chairman Bernanke has pointed out, monetary policy is not a panacea.\n\nWe should applaud sound policy decisions and effective policy implementation where we see it. Again, I commend many of the governments and central banks of Latin America for having chosen this path.",

            "content": "Thanks for inviting me. As I begin, I want to recognize a few folks who have a Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta connection: Jerry Host of Trustmark National Bank has been serving on our New Orleans Branch board of directors since 2008, and Dave Dennis of Gulfport served on our New Orleans board from 2001 to 2007. Our directors, who are like Jerry and Dave from throughout the Southeast, provide the Atlanta Fed with important on-the-ground views of what's happening in the economy, offering insights and texture beyond what we get from looking just at data.\n\nI am pleased to be back in Mississippi and to have the opportunity to speak to the Mississippi Economic Council, a group that addresses the bigger issues facing your state's economy. Sometimes trends in the national economy are mirrored at the state or municipal level, but sometimes not. Each jurisdiction has its own unique circumstances and conditions. What I can do as a Federal Reserve official is provide a national perspective on the economy in hopes my input will contribute constructively to your deliberations here in Mississippi about what to do to improve economic outcomes for your citizens. That's what I plan to do today.\n\nMore specifically, in my remarks today I will discuss the appropriate policy response to an apparent slowing of the economy and a weakening of the outlook for growth and employment gains. In this discussion, I'll walk you through a more layered recitation of the issues at play in the debate about whether the Fed should apply more monetary stimulus. I will be sharing my personal views. They may not be shared by my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe policy juncture\nThe national economy has been in recovery—that is, expanding—for three years. The pace of expansion has been far from uniform. There have been episodes of accelerating growth and episodes of slowing. With each apparent change of the pace of activity, policymakers as well as business planners, government planners, and forward-looking consumers had to ask whether the new trend is likely to be transitory or persistent. And in each episode of slowing, those of us involved in monetary policy formulation have to consider whether to take more action to try to improve future outcomes.\n\nWe are in such a moment now, and it is a challenging situation. Let me give you my personal sense of how we got to this juncture. My colleagues and I at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta began the year expecting pretty solid gross domestic product (GDP) growth of between 2.5 percent and 3 percent. We expected gradual but steady progress in reducing unemployment, and we expected moderate inflation around the target of 2 percent.\n\nAs our Reserve Bank was preparing for the FOMC meeting in late April, data in hand showed several months of strong employment growth and an economy that appeared on track to grow at around 3 percent in the first quarter of the year. The economic picture was reasonably encouraging at that point.\n\nOf course, with more data available and better-informed hindsight, we now know that economic performance in the first quarter was soft in terms of GDP growth. The most recent estimate of first-quarter GDP growth is 1.9 percent. And after enjoying healthy job growth in the first three months of the year, employment gains have slowed dramatically in the second quarter and were much weaker than expected.\n\nSo, the incoming data have disappointed over the course of the first two quarters of the year. Also, our contacts on the ground in the economy seemed to have changed their tune. Optimism and rising confidence earlier in the year have shifted to a more cautious mindset.\n\nIn addition, as the year has unfolded, my colleagues and I at the Atlanta Fed have recalibrated our risk evaluation. While not fully factored into our baseline outlook, we're acknowledging darker possibilities. Risks associated with developments in Europe, the so-called fiscal cliff here in the United States, and a global economic slowdown have weighed more heavily on our outlook.\n\nIn reaction to all this, we recently downgraded our official forecast to one of weaker growth and slower progress on unemployment. This was the perspective I took to the June FOMC meeting.\n\nWe were not alone. All 19 FOMC participants submit forecasts for GDP growth, inflation, and employment four times each year. The central tendency for 2012 GDP growth dropped from a range of 2.4 to 2.9 percent in April to a range of 1.9 to 2.4 percent in June. In my view, this was a rather abrupt and material adjustment to the outlook.\n\nIn recognition of this change of outlook, the FOMC decided last month to extend the so-called Operation Twist program until the end of 2012. This program is aimed at putting downward pressure on long-term interest rates. This is accomplished by purchasing additional longer maturity Treasury notes while simultaneously selling short-term Treasury bills with the effect of moving out the average maturity of the Fed's portfolio. I supported this decision.\n\nKey questions\nIt's possible another policy decision looms. My colleagues and I on the FOMC may confront a decision on whether or not to respond more aggressively to the economy's apparent weakness.\n\nAt the risk of oversimplification, there are in broad terms two schools of thought related to this issue of further aggressive monetary stimulus in the near term. One point of view is the outlook as-is calls for further policy action now or before too long. A second point of view is that further aggressive monetary stimulus—while definitely an option that cannot be dismissed—should be held in reserve to respond to a sharp further deterioration in the outlook.\n\nBefore taking a position on this two-sided question, it's my view that one has to wrestle with three sub-issues.\n\nOutput gap\nThe first relates to the size of the output gap, as it is called. The output gap is a measure of how far the level of GDP is from its potential. The conventional view is that the potential of the economy grows at a more or less steady pace through time, driven by growth in the labor force, productivity, and capital investment. Deviations from potential are undesirable because they signal that the economy's resources are not being fully utilized or at least not utilized in the most effective way. In the conventional view, the most important thing about an output gap is the presumption that it can be closed by economic policies that stimulate spending in the economy. These policies could involve, for example, expansionary government spending and reduced taxes, or the maintenance of very low interest rates by the central bank.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) regularly publishes one popular estimate of the output gap in the United States. To give you a reference point, they estimate the gap today is 5.5 percent. That is, the level of U.S. GDP is 5.5 percent below its potential. Five-and-a-half percent is a very large number, and it has changed little over the past two years. The bulk of the June projections for GDP growth reported by FOMC participants, including my own, imply very little progress in moving GDP toward potential in the foreseeable future. In any event, a quick return to what the CBO would calculate as the potential level of GDP is just not happening.\n\nAn output gap that persists over several years without narrowing is unprecedented in the post-Great Depression era.\n\nIt's been argued that the conventional estimate of potential GDP overstates the true capacity of the U.S. economy. Potential GDP, according to this alternative view, has been overstated as a result of distortions created during the precrisis bubble years and has fallen in the aftermath of the crisis and recession to a level that is permanently lower. If this is the accurate view, the output gap would be much smaller than 5.5 percent and might even approach zero.\n\nYou can appreciate, I'm sure, how these different views of underlying economic reality would set the stage for vigorous debate about the proper policy course. If the true output gap is near 5.5 percent, there is ample reason to do something with the policy levers that are available. But if the output gap is actually close to zero, policy stimulus will be counterproductive and could do harm in the longer run.\n\nSize of the Fed's balance sheet\nOne potential source of harm relates to the size of the Fed's balance sheet and its possible consequences. This is the second sub-issue. The balance sheet of the Federal Reserve has more than tripled since the financial crisis in 2008. It's widely viewed that the size of the balance sheet is far beyond \"normal\" and will have to be scaled back as monetary policy is normalized.\n\nEveryone who has studied basic macroeconomics learned that an outsized monetary base, as part of a scaled-up balance sheet, should raise concern about future inflation. This apprehension would obviously be raised further by any future policy action that would expand the size of the balance sheet.\n\nThere is an opposing view that, while not dismissing the eventual need to downsize the balance sheet, argues that the risk is quite manageable. When policy normalization begins, the FOMC should be able to control the expansion of money and credit through adjustments of policy rates. Very importantly, Congress gave the Fed the power to pay interest on excess reserves in 2008. The FOMC, it is argued, will have the ability to push up interest rates by lifting the interest on excess reserves rate, thereby countering credit expansion and money expansion, if that is required.\n\nEffectiveness of the transmission mechanism\nYou might accept the argument that the potential benefits of more monetary policy stimulus are significant because the output gap is large. And you might concede that the costs of further stimulus are minimal because the risks associated with a large balance sheet are manageable. But there is still a third relevant sub-issue: Are the policy tools available to the Fed likely to be effective in improving the performance of the economy? Will further monetary stimulus work? Will it make a difference?\n\nI frequently hear the opinion that further Fed stimulus won't accomplish much. Interest rates are already very low; there is no shortage of liquidity; and anyway, many borrowers cannot get access to credit or don't require it as they continue to reduce their debt levels. By way of example, a homeowner who is underwater on his or her mortgage is unable to refinance at any interest rate. More generally, the argument goes, for any number of reasons, both consumers and businesses would not be very responsive to changes in interest rates, at least to the rate levels monetary policy might be able to deliver.\n\nThis argument speaks to the current condition of the credit system in the country. Monetary policy impulses are mostly transmitted to the economy through credit channels, and this mechanism is still in a state of repair, it is claimed.\n\nHere are the arguments against that view:\n\nFirst, if the economy is just not that responsive to lower interest rates at the moment, policymakers ought to push harder on policy levers—harder than would be necessary in more normal times. Some recent homeowner programs have tried to eliminate barriers to refinancing and have helped. For example, I hear from bankers that the second version of the Home Affordable Refinancing Program, or HARP II, appears to be quite successful in helping homeowners who are saddled with negative equity and mortgage rates well above the current market rates.\n\nAnd, it is argued, higher interest rates would worsen the situation. To say that the benefit of driving rates lower is limited is not the same as saying that there would be no damage if rates were to drift higher. Monetary policy can be effective in offsetting upward pressure on rates.\n\nWhere I come out on these questions\nThrough this two-handed discussion, I hope I have conveyed the sense that reasonable people can consider the issues I have laid out and come to different conclusions. That said, I think the stakes in the policy discussion around the FOMC table today are very high. Elevated levels of joblessness have been very persistent and the burdens of the very weak job market have been particularly harsh for the segments of our population where job attachment is already most tenuous—the young, minorities, and those at lower income levels. And to make a broader point, I am concerned that the already significant long-term jobless problem may harden into something more structural.\n\nThe question that the members of the FOMC confront is whether there is more that can be done to address the related challenges of slower GDP growth and tepid job creation. So, to wind up, let me give you my take on the key questions underlying a decision to bring on more monetary stimulus.\n\nI think the output gap—the amount of slack in the economy—is neither as sizeable as the high-end estimates, nor is it zero. If there were no slack at all, 8.2 percent unemployment would represent full employment. If this were so, the economy would have undergone profound structural change over the last five years. As I weigh the findings of research by Federal Reserve economists and others, I do not think a compelling case has yet been made that structural adjustment has played a dominant role in slowing growth and progress against unemployment.\n\nIf, on the other hand, slack in the economy were close to the high estimates, we should have seen more and more persistent downward pressure on prices and wages than has, in fact, been the case. Deciding on the extent of the output gap is not straightforward. I believe the truth is in the gray middle.\n\nOn the risk associated with the balance sheet: in my judgment, some further use of the balance sheet to promote continued recovery and/or financial stability brings with it manageable risks. I think reversal of the cumulative balance sheet scale and maturity structure can be accomplished in an orderly manner. But the step of additional balance sheet expansion should be undertaken very judiciously. Such a step would take us further into uncharted territory.\n\nOn the likely effectiveness of further monetary stimulus—a policy that would necessarily be brought to bear at least in part through credit channels—I think we should have modest expectations about what further action can accomplish. I do not think this means monetary policy is impotent or has reached its limit. But I don't see more quantitative easing or similar policy action as a miracle cure, especially absent fixes in policy areas outside the central bank's purview.\n\nSo, as one policymaker, here's my situation: my support for the current stance of policy rests on a forecast that sees a step-up of output and employment growth by year-end and into 2013. If the economy continues on the track indicated by the most recent incoming data and information, that forecast will become untenable, as will the policy premises underlying it. So, as I said at the outset, this is a challenging juncture for policymaking.",

            "content": "It's a pleasure to be back in South Florida at the Broward Workshop. This is the second time I've spoken to this group. My hat goes off to the Broward Workshop because you bring together leaders from Broward County's major businesses to focus on important community issues. In most communities, little happens unless the business community gets on board and takes the lead.\n\nCommunity-based businesspeople also play an important role in helping the Federal Reserve get an on-the-ground view of what's really happening in the economy at any given point in time. We're interested in whether or not businesses are making investments, building staff, seeing stronger sales, or passing through price increases. Sometimes we can extrapolate this regional and local input to the national economy. And sometimes not, but it's always helpful.\n\nOver the years, Broward Workshop members have served on the Atlanta Fed's Miami Branch board of directors, a group that helps us at the Atlanta Fed get the economic and business intelligence I just described. Workshop members who have served on our board include Walter Banks, Keith Cobb, and Tom Shea. Currently, Mike Jackson serves on the board. Thanks to each of you.\n\nOur board members are accustomed to how we think about and structure a discussion of the economy. Today, I want to walk you through a pretty conventional treatment of current economic concerns. I'll start with some local flavor—Florida and South Florida. I'll then provide my views on the state of and outlook for the national economy. I'll comment on the headwinds holding back stronger growth and the key risks to the outlook. And I'll close with a few points on the Fed's monetary policy, particularly the question I engage every few weeks before Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings—is current policy appropriate to the outlook and risks?\n\nAs you listen, please understand that these are my views and may not be shared by my colleagues on the FOMC or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nState of Florida and Broward County\nI would describe the pace of the ongoing economic recovery in United States as moderate—and that's been true in Florida as well.\n\nWhile the economy of Florida continues to recover at a pace not too different from that of the United States overall, one difference is that Florida experienced a deeper recession than most of the rest of the country. For example, Florida's unemployment rate increased more than 7 percentage points between 2007 and 2010, peaking at 11.4 percent. In contrast, the average rate for the nation as a whole increased about 5.5 percentage points to a peak of just over 10 percent.\n\nConditions in Florida have been improving since 2009, but progress has remained relatively slow. The state's unemployment rate is down about 2.5 percentage points from its 2010 peak. Closer to home, the unemployment rate in the greater Fort Lauderdale area continues to decline, having reached 7.6 percent in April compared to a peak of 9.6 percent in 2010.\n\nThe economy in South Florida has seen a resurgence in foreign spending, primarily on real estate and tourism. Our contacts in the real estate sector have noted for some time that international investors, mainly from Canada, Europe, and South America, have been active buyers of this area's distressed residential real estate assets.\n\nOn the tourism side, international visitor spending has been supported by rapid growth in South American visitors. Looking ahead, our travel and tourism contacts expect this sector to show solid performance for the remainder of 2012. That said, we also hear anxiety about the impact of a slowdown in global economic activity on bookings this summer and into the future. I'll discuss this risk in a moment.\n\nThe national economy\nThe national picture evokes a similarly mixed and cautious reaction to the flow of data and world news.\n\nComing off a reasonably strong fourth quarter of 2011, the indicators of economic strength so far in 2012 have been underwhelming. First-quarter gross domestic product growth was recently revised to 1.9 percent. The May employment report, combined with downward revisions to the March and April jobs statistics, was clearly a disappointment. There remains some question about the degree of weather-related payback from the robust job growth earlier in the year. Losses in construction jobs, for example, were unexpectedly large in May. But it is nearly impossible to escape the conclusion that we are replaying in some manner the spring-summer slowdowns of the past two years.\n\nThe economy remains in recovery but, as the disappointing employment numbers illustrate, the economy is working against some strong headwinds.\n\nFirst, key sectors of the economy are still deleveraging. This is true of the household and financial sectors. In the household sector for example, while consumer credit is expanding, overall consumer debt (including mortgage-related debt) is declining and the debt-service-to-income ratio is shrinking. Overall, deleveraging is arguably a fundamental improvement for the long term as financial institutions and households return their balance sheets to health. However, over the medium term, deleveraging is not conducive to spirited growth.\n\nSecond, the housing sector remains weak even while showing signs of stabilization and improvement. Home prices—more than house building—influence the health of the broad economy through their effect on consumer attitudes. Home prices in many markets appear to be stabilizing, but there remains a sizable inventory of unsold homes that is likely to work against a sustained firming or upturn in home values.\n\nAt the same time, the government sector overall—including, importantly, state and local government—continues to contract. A shift of relative weight in the economy of the public and private sectors requires significant adjustments. Labor and other resources have to be reallocated to other areas of the economy. These adjustments take time and also limit the pace at which the economy can reasonably be expected to expand.\n\nFinally, there continues to be what I'll call an \"uncertainty drag\" on confidence and economic activity. While the makeup of the array of uncertainties has moved over time and the intensity of restraining effect has modulated, it's clear that uncertainty is holding back hiring and capital expansion plans of U.S. businesses.\n\nAs a result of these various headwinds, I expect the recovery process to be slow and drawn out. I think the most reasonable expectation is moderate growth, a slow and possibly halting decline of unemployment, with inflation staying close to the FOMC's 2 percent target. I do not see this narrative changing much to the upside over the medium term.\n\nLet me describe the key elements of this baseline outlook.\n\nThe modest recovery and associated slow jobs growth is keeping income growth subdued, and vice versa. These conditions are likely, in my view, to restrain consumer, or retail, spending. Consumer spending has been running a little stronger than income growth over the past year, supported by a drop in the rate of personal savings. This is not healthy for the longer term. Without a marked acceleration in household income growth (which, again, is not in my baseline projection), consumer spending growth will likely be held in check.\n\nExport growth has been strong over the recovery, and U.S. manufacturers in particular have benefited from growth of exports to emerging economies. The slowdown in Europe has resulted in some cooling of overall export growth and a slowing in U.S. manufacturing. Our trade imbalance—with imports exceeding exports by a good measure—could well be exacerbated by the recent appreciation of the dollar on the export side and the relative strength of the U.S. economy as a driver of imports.\n\nAs I already mentioned, the decline in government spending has been a net drag over most of the past three years and is likely to be a slightly negative factor, or worse, over the medium term.\n\nThese are the key factors that are influencing my baseline forecast. Forecasting is a dynamic exercise. We continually re-evaluate key assumptions and risks that both affect the outlook (that is, are in the forecast in some measure) and pose potentially high-impact contingencies not in the baseline forecast.\n\nIt is my sense that material risks to the economic outlook are gathering, so it is worthwhile to spend some time talking about risks in some detail.\n\nRisks to the outlook\nIn my view, there is an array of serious concerns, but I'll emphasize four key potential sources of downside risk. They are the behavior of home prices, the effect of sharp federal fiscal adjustment, financial instability along with recession in Europe, and a slowdown in emerging market economies.\n\nFor our Atlanta Fed forecast, we assume that home prices will hold steady, a view supported by recent readings from a variety of home price indicators like the Case-Shiller and the CoreLogic indexes.\n\nI've already cited the housing sector as a headwind. It's also a risk in that a large further drop in home values could undermine my outlook for the economy.\n\nNext, without congressional action, current law calls for increases in taxes and reductions in federal spending to begin on January 1, 2013. Estimates of the seriousness of the so-called \"fiscal cliff\" vary, but most indicate that the immediate (that is, 2013) impact on the economy would be negative and large.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO), for example, estimates that without congressional action, mandated spending cuts and tax increases would cut the federal deficit by 4 percent or more of GDP. The CBO notes that this could be large enough to push the U.S. economy into recession during the first half of 2013.\n\nMy baseline projection assumes that, while some amount of federal fiscal restraint on growth is likely, the phase-in of tax and spending actions will occur more gradually, mitigating the \"cliff\" effects just described.\n\nLet me turn to the risk posed by the situation in Europe. I am giving more weight and higher probability to a negative influence on our economy coming from Europe than I did as recently as the last FOMC meeting in late April, so I'd like to spend a little time today developing this scenario in more detail.\n\nFirst, the euro area as a whole is in or near recession, as I mentioned earlier. Southern Europe is contracting sharply. Of the larger euro area economies, only Germany appears to be showing much resilience. A more severe euro area recession will negatively impact the U.S. economy through the export channel.\n\nExports of goods to the euro currency area in 2011 totaled around $200 billion, about 13 percent of the total dollar value of U.S. goods exports. More broadly, exports to the European Union totaled about 18 percent of U.S. goods exports. A mild European recession, which is what I expect, would slow but not derail the U.S. economic recovery.\n\nWhile the trade channel with Europe is important, the greater concern, in my view, relates to the European financial system, in particular the risk of an event that might trigger a widespread seizing up of global debt markets. Financial stress in Europe increased measurably after the failure to form a government following the last Greek elections. With increased fears that Greece may leave the euro area, deposit flight from Greek banks reportedly has surged. Sovereign debt spreads and credit default swap cost-of-protection have increased in Greece, Portugal, Spain, Italy, and Ireland.\n\nU.S. financial institutions have been taking steps to limit their direct European financial exposure. Banks have moved to limit their direct exposure to peripheral European sovereign debt but still maintain exposure to European banks through complex counterparty relationships, including their participation in the credit default swap market. Also, exposures of money market mutual funds to unsecured European debt have been declining in recent months, especially longer-dated (greater than 30 days) unsecured placements with European banks.\n\nReduction of direct exposures within our domestic financial system can only go so far to insulate the U.S. economy from spillover in the event of financial sector instability in Europe, in my view. The global financial system is too integrated, too networked to expect that problems could be isolated to Europe. Arguably, in the current risk-on, risk-off environment, U.S. financial markets have also experienced the effects of European risk in equity markets.\n\nAnother connected global risk is the apparent slowdown occurring in a number of large emerging economies—notably in the economies of China, India, and Brazil. Our recent export strength is substantially related to strong economic performance in emerging market economies. A growth slowdown in emerging economies would aggravate the effects of the European slowdown by further limiting the role of exports in the U.S. recovery.\n\nI should add that, although the intensity of concern has receded somewhat, the risk of conflict related to Iranian nuclear proliferation in the Middle East has not gone away. Sudden developments would likely be felt in oil markets. Research has connected the onset of recessionary conditions in our economy with spikes in oil prices.\n\nStance of monetary policy\nTo close the circle, let me tie my view on the outlook and risks to monetary policy. In thinking about the array of headwinds and risks out there, I can say my base case outlook for the economy incorporates some impact of downside forces on the economy. That said, the full potential impacts of a downside scenario related to Europe, a global economic slowdown, or some other externally-sourced shock are not factored into the outlook.\n\nIn the context of the outlook I just described, policy remains accommodative and supportive of the ongoing recovery whose essence is summarized in my baseline forecast. The key elements of current policy are an interest rate policy designed to keep borrowing rates at very low levels, a stable Federal Reserve balance sheet whose average maturity has been extended as a result of so-called Operation Twist, and a communication policy that I think goes a long way in helping the public form expectations about interest rates, inflation, and the intent of policy in general.\n\nI view this policy stance as appropriate for the outlook I depicted. However, as the employment report of last Friday illustrates, there continues to be a halting and tenuous character to the recovery.\n\nLooking ahead, my viewpoint as regards further policy measures considers two possibilities. Should it become clear that something resembling my baseline scenario of continued, though modest, growth is no longer realistic, further monetary actions to support the recovery will certainly need to be considered.\n\nIn addition, the situation we face requires that the FOMC maintain a state of readiness to respond to financial or economic instability should the need arise. I am confident that the committee retains the capacity to act and the tools to promote stability.\n\nImportantly, the economy itself is in a better condition to withstand threats to stability than it was at the time of the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009. I still think it is prudent to acknowledge a degree of fragility, but in its fundamentals, the U.S. economy has made substantial progress toward resilience.",

            "content": "I want to thank the Institute of Regulation & Risk, North Asia for the opportunity to participate in the discussion here this evening. Coming here as a Federal Reserve official rounds out my personal history of visits to Japan. I first traveled here as a tourist on my honeymoon. I later traveled back several times as a private-sector banker. I am now here as a central banker and member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). That thought triggers my usual disclaimer—my remarks represent my personal views only. My views may not be shared by my Federal Reserve and FOMC colleagues.\n\nWe're in a time of slow recovery in my country and recession or very weak growth along with serious fiscal and banking strains in Europe. So it's appropriate that the organizers of this event have presented me with the following question: What more can be done? They have prefaced this question with another: Are there limits to what monetary policy can accomplish?\n\nQuestion of monetary policy limits\n Let me first tackle this question of the limits of monetary policy.\n\nThe limits of monetary policy in curing the economic ills that beset advanced economies is a frequent topic these days. This is because—and I speak now more from a U.S. perspective—a lot has been done, yet progress has been quite slow.\n\nThe policy interest rate has been at the zero bound since December 2008. We've aggressively expanded the scale of the Fed's balance sheet. Other central banks have grown their balance sheets as well. In these circumstances, it's natural to ask if monetary policy has reached its practical limits in promoting recovery.\n\nThe limits of monetary policy might be considered from three angles. First, in very general terms, one might ask if there are inherent limits to what monetary policy can achieve, and are these inherent limits now more obvious? By inherent limits I mean constraints on the scope of effectiveness of monetary policy in solving economic problems in almost all circumstances. For example, as powerful as monetary policy can be, one might argue that it is powerless to cure deep structural problems such as fiscal imbalances or trade imbalances resulting from a lack of competitiveness.\n\nA second perspective on limits might reference statutory or self-imposed limits that central banks observe. These might encompass limits on how far the central bank can or should go in addressing what are fiscal concerns. Monetary policymakers have tried to avoid interventions that put taxpayers at risk of loss. And central bankers have been wary of trying to compensate for policy constraints in other domains of economic and social policy such as workforce development, tax policy, or currency policy.\n\nAnd finally, the question of the limits of monetary policy could deal with the more immediate and pragmatic consideration of the real or expected effectiveness of current policy and available policy options given the prevailing circumstances in the economy.\n\nEach of these three perspectives has relevance in today's policy context in the United States, but it is this last dimension of the limits of policy that I want to explore in my remarks this evening. The economic conditions of these past few years have required resourcefulness on the part of monetary authorities and evoked unconventional policy actions. Central banks, the Fed included, may have to devise ways to respond to unique circumstances in the future. But for now—based on recent experience—policy actions seem to fall under three headings. They are interest rate policies, balance sheet actions, and communications directed at markets and the public.\n\nEmploying three tool sets\n The FOMC has employed all three tool sets to address the varied circumstances it faced over the last four years.\n\nAs you may remember, the Federal Reserve implemented a series of extraordinary emergency lending measures in the wake of the Lehman Brothers and AIG failures in September 2008. By the end of that year, the target for the federal funds rate had been lowered to its effective lower bound range of 0 to 25 basis points.\n\nLooking back, 2009 represented the year of transition from acute crisis to recovery. Over the course of 2009, the Federal Reserve wound down most of its emergency lending facilities and transitioned to the current mode of conducting monetary policy operations. That approach relies substantially on balance sheet changes. The FOMC has been unable to resort to its familiar short-term interest rate instrument to provide further stimulus to the economy.\n\nThe first stages of this new phase involved large-scale asset purchases. These large-scale asset purchase (LSAP) programs are popularly known as QE1 and QE2. This terminology reflects a tendency of referring to policies that have a large impact on central bank balance sheets as \"quantitative easing.\"\n\nI believe that the motivations of the two policy actions were more distinct than the QE1 and QE2 labels suggest.\n\nThe first large-scale asset purchase program—so-called QE1—was put in motion by the FOMC in March 2009. The FOMC decided to purchase a total of $200 billion of agency debt, $300 billion of Treasury securities, and $1.25 trillion of mortgage-backed securities issued by the federal housing agencies. Eventually the Fed completed all but the direct agency purchases.\n\nIn my view, these purchase programs played an important role in the transition away from the emergency lending facilities created earlier in the crisis. The emergency credit facilities worked well to stem the downward spiral of the immediate post-Lehman period. Financial markets began the process of repair during the first half of 2009 but were still suffering from relatively serious liquidity pressures. The QE1 operation sustained the liquidity support that had been previously provided by lending through the emergency facilities.\n\nBecause asset purchases largely replaced emergency loans made during the crisis, the net increase in the Fed's balance sheet was relatively modest. In this sense, the quantitative easing label is misleading. The intent and effect of the policy was not to inject a new and sizable quantity of reserves into the economy. Rather, the effect was to sustain liquidity in still struggling and fragile financial markets, particularly those related to residential real estate. For that reason, I prefer the term \"credit easing\" to describe this policy action.\n\nI view QE2 differently. The FOMC formally announced QE2 in November 2010, with its decision to purchase $600 billion in longer-term Treasury securities. However, the policy was signaled in an important speech from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke in August of that year. The circumstances at the time were dominated by a falling trend in measured inflation, weakening inflation expectations, and rising probabilities of outright deflation. Each of these developments was effectively reversed as the expectations for QE2 took root, expectations that were ultimately validated by FOMC action.\n\nUnlike QE1, QE2 did materially expand the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. In my view, this distinction is important. The intent and effect of the two rounds of asset purchases were different. QE1 served to maintain liquidity at a time when financial markets were exceptionally unsettled. In contrast, QE2 was a more traditional monetary action to preserve price stability.\n\nThe latest phase of policy actions involves further balance sheet operations and enhanced and expanded communication.\n\nIn August of last year, the FOMC replaced its existing forward guidance on interest rates. Prior to that date, the language indicated only that interest rates were likely to remain at exceptionally low levels for an extended period. This language was replaced in August with more explicit guidance that spelled out the meaning of \"extended period.\" Specifically, at that time the FOMC indicated its expectation that economic conditions would warrant very low interest rates at least through mid-2013. Subsequently, that guidance was updated to late 2014.\n\nIn September of last year, the FOMC announced its Maturity Extension Program (MEP), often referred to as \"Operation Twist.\" By next month, this program will have increased the Fed's holdings of longer-term securities by $600 billion matched by equivalent sales of shorter-term securities. At the same time the FOMC announced the MEP, the committee stated its intention to maintain the size of its mortgage-backed securities (MBS) portfolio by reinvesting the proceeds of maturing MBS securities.\n\nIn terms of intent and effect, I think of the explicit forward guidance and the MEP in similar terms. We have entered a phase of the recovery in which sustained monetary accommodation is warranted in order to preserve and advance what is still modest progress on employment and economic growth. Importantly, this modest progress is occurring in the context of what, for me, is acceptable performance with respect to our price stability mandate. Actions that reinforce the maintenance of policy accommodation are appropriate. It is through that lens that I view the MEP and explicit forward guidance on policy rates.\n\nLet me summarize this brief tour of postcrisis monetary policy. I view the sequence of nontraditional monetary policy actions as tailored responses to the particular needs of the economy and financial system at the time they were implemented. My conclusion is that by and large policy actions have been appropriate to the diagnosis of circumstances at the time. And in my assessment they have worked pretty well.\n\nToday's economy\n Circumstances today in the United States call for continued measured efforts to quicken the pace of recovery and shrink unemployment, while keeping inflation controlled and close to the FOMC's official target of 2 percent. Those efforts for the time being should fall in the realm of communications. Current economic data continue to be a mix of positives and negatives. Consumer activity is continuing to grow, and manufacturing is expanding. At the same time, we've seen a recent slowdown in business investment, and the pace of job creation has weakened.\n\nMy economic outlook calls for only modest growth over the next few years.\n\nThe modest recovery and associated slow job growth is keeping wage growth subdued and inflation expectations reasonably well-anchored. As a result, my outlook for inflation remains steady at around 2 percent over the forecast horizon.\n\nThere are larger-than-normal risks to my outlook, however. Chief among them is the potential for broad spillover from Europe to the U.S. and global economy resulting from financial system disruption as well as further economic slowdown.\n\nFor this reason in particular, I currently judge the risks to the U.S. outlook as tilted modestly to the downside.\n\nCentral bank communications\n To repeat my earlier assertion, I think use of the tool of refined communication is an appropriate incremental policy action.\n\nIt's useful, I think, to conduct a thought experiment about central bank communication. Let's consider what constitutes perfect communication. I would argue that communication approaches perfection when the broad, attentive public understands how the monetary authority is going to behave. Put differently, there would be near-perfect certainty about the monetary authority's reaction function under all circumstances.\n\nIn this imagined world, consumers, businesses, savers, and investors can make appropriate adjustments to their decisions and behaviors as each indication of the economy's trajectory becomes known. They can do so because they have certainty about what the policy reality will be. In this world, communication promotes the efficient functioning of financial markets. Risk premiums come down and rates are lower than they otherwise would have been. Both markets and individuals can be confident policy surprises won't complicate outcomes. And with that confidence and certainty, the mutually reinforcing roles of economic agents and policymakers become tightly synchronized in a causal loop.\n\nIn my view, working toward this end is the right undertaking of the FOMC at this moment, even if it is not fully achievable. The FOMC should continue to clarify its strategy for the medium and long term so that the public can discern how the committee arrives at decisions. In that vein, effective communication that results in the public knowing the extent of uncertainty policymakers face also helps.\n\nInstitutional constraints of central banks can have a significant influence on how far a central bank can go in perfecting communication. The FOMC, for example, is made up currently of 12 voting members with another seven of the Reserve Bank presidents participating without a formal vote at any given point in time. The differences of perspective around the table are substantial. I would argue that the FOMC was designed to achieve a consensus on the monetary policy decision if not the supporting analysis. Put more simply, achieving consensus around a decision is a lot easier than arriving at a consensus forecast or a uniform position on how policy should react to hypothetical future developments. Still, I believe the FOMC should continue to work on improving communication methods. At the moment, it is a work in progress.\n\nIn closing, I have reframed to some extent the original question of what more can be done around the point that policy actions must be matched to circumstances. The challenge policymakers face is judging appropriateness of a tool for circumstances. As popular as it might be in some quarters to rule out further LSAPs (QE3, as it is known), I do not think this option can be taken off the table. QE3 will work under the right circumstances. But I don't believe such circumstances prevail at this time.\n\nThank you.",

            "content": "I'm pleased to be here today, to be part of the University of California Santa Barbara Economic Forecast Project. This is an opportunity to assess where the U.S. economy is now, and where it could be heading.\n\nI'm first up among my Federal Reserve colleagues in this panel discussion, and I'd like to center my brief remarks on what's called the Fed's dual mandate. These are my views and may not be shared by my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nIn its monetary policy responsibilities, the Fed is tasked with promoting stable prices and maximum employment. Controlling inflation and promoting maximum employment are generally complementary. There may be short-term tradeoffs between the two goals, but not long-term ones. When circumstances arise where these goals are in conflict, the FOMC follows a balanced approach in promoting the two.\n\nA two-objective mandate is not standard among central banks around the world. In Canada, for example, the sole focus of the central bank is on inflation. The same holds true for the European Central Bank. But even central banks with a single mandate still talk about a well-balanced approach to policy. Virtually all central banks have the broad goal of supporting healthy economic growth in the context of price stability.\n\nA view of inflation\nThe FOMC judges that inflation at an annual rate of 2 percent is consistent over the longer run with the price stability part of our statutory mandate. This has been formal policy since January. The 2 percent target is important in that it is now an explicit objective to be achieved over the long term. In my interpretation of the objective, the committee should be expected to navigate close to 2 percent over time while pursuing that objective within an approach described as flexible inflation targeting. Some flexibility around the 2 percent target recognizes that it's the continuing trend that's important. Monthly price data can be noisy, and because monetary policy acts with a considerable lag, there is little we can do about the present or near term.\n\nWith that background, I'll now characterize the current situation as regards the inflation aspect of the FOMC's mandate.\n\nRecent readings on retail prices are a little elevated due to a run-up in gasoline prices earlier in the year. Higher energy costs appear to have caused a modest acceleration in other prices. Various core inflation measures have been trending just a shade above 2 percent over the past three months, but these trends are not expected to persist. Most forecasts of inflation—my own included—project the annual trend in prices to move back toward the 2 percent inflation rate over the course of the year.\n\nRetail prices are the end product of a large number of influences, so the state of inflation is best determined by synthesizing a number of indicators. The research staff at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta regularly monitors 30 key indicators of price behavior. The Atlanta Fed makes this information readily available to the public with what we call our Inflation Dashboard, which can be found on our website.\n\nWe also track inflation expectations of the public. Inflation expectations are both a major influence on the medium-term inflation outlook and an active force in the achievement of price stability.\n\nMost measures show that the current inflation expectations of households, investors, and businesses remain reasonably well-anchored and aligned with that 2 percent objective. The Atlanta Fed's Survey of Business Inflation Expectations is one data point confirming this claim. Last month our survey indicated that a broad cross section of 165 Southeast businesses anticipated costs to rise 2.1 percent over the next 12 months.\n\nThere are risks, of course, but I believe the threats to price stability are reasonably contained at present. Though not expected, a further rise in oil prices could provoke sustained upward pressure on prices more generally. But balanced against this risk is the persistence of considerable slack in the economy, especially labor market slack evidenced by the level of unemployment.\n\nA look at the employment situation\n So let me now turn to the state of employment, the FOMC's second statutory objective.\n\nSince the end of the recession, employment has grown at a pace similar to that seen in the last recovery, but from a deeper bottom. That growth seems now to be broadly distributed across industries, with a few exceptions, the government sector and residential construction being obvious examples. The headline measure of the unemployment rate was 8.2 percent in March, down by almost a full percentage point since last summer. But the unemployment rate is still well above its prerecession level of around 5 percent. Tomorrow we'll get a reading on the labor market for April.\n\nEmployment market dynamics are complicated, but I'll try to break down the employment situation into demand and supply side influences and effects.\n\nOn the demand side, many businesses that existed five years ago are gone, and with their disappearance many jobs were permanently lost. Some amount of job destruction from business failures is a normal occurrence, but many new businesses that would have been established in less stressed times and that would have replaced the lost jobs were not born. Start-ups have been fewer because of a weak economy and difficulty getting financing. Also, many businesses that weathered the recession made deep and apparently permanent cuts in their workforce, at least in the ratio of workers to a given level of output. In the short run, the productivity gains by individual firms mean that increasing sales don't result in the same increase in hiring as in the past. In many instances, businesses have invested in technology that eliminated the need for certain types of jobs, and the skills these firms now demand may be quite different than in the past.\n\nI hear a lot of anecdotal accounts of businesses having difficulty finding qualified workers. It is hard to assess how much of that difficulty reflects a change over the last few years in the mix of skills required, or how much employer frustration can be tied just to temporary frictions that normally occur when matching workers with job openings. The seemingly relentless drive on the part of firms for productivity gains has been motivating labor-substituting capital investment, but it is not clear to what extent this will hold back demand for additional workers as the economy continues to expand.\n\nOn the supply side, the recent decline in the unemployment rate is partly attributable to a decline in the share of the working age population actively engaged in the labor market. To be sure, natural demographic forces are at work here as a larger share of the workforce reaches normal retirement age. It's also argued that some of the decline may reflect discouragement of job seekers about wage and employment prospects. Participation is at its lowest level since the 1980s.\n\nAll things considered, I think the relatively modest economic expansion that has followed the recession—an extremely deep recession—is the primary factor restraining job growth. The Fed's already done a lot to support the recovery. Whether additional monetary policy actions should be used at this time to try to speed things up has to be balanced against the risks to the Fed's price stability objective that could accompany an overestimating of the amount of economic slack—particularly labor market slack.\n\nOne of my Atlanta Fed colleagues describes the employment situation as \"messy\" because the data do not speak loudly and clearly about what the reality is. Even getting good data is challenging. And, further, full employment is not a fixed number. It moves over time and can be affected by many demographic and social factors as well as the impact of human capital policies in the areas of education and training.\n\nQuestions for policymakers\n As policymakers, my colleagues on the panel and I have to grapple with the messiness of labor market reality while balancing the two objectives of the committee's dual mandate. Speaking for myself, as I have prepared for recent FOMC deliberations, I've had to engage these questions:\n\nI'll stop here and leave these questions in the air as a teaser. These are critical questions, and I hope we can address these and other issues in the panel discussion that follows.",

            "content": "I want to add my welcome to this conference and the Atlanta Fed. This conference is hosted by our Supervision and Regulation division, and most of you in attendance are bankers.\n\nToday I will connect thoughts on the banking system—informed by my interaction with our senior supervision people—with thoughts on the current effectiveness of monetary policy, particularly the transmission of monetary stimulus through the credit channel. I will begin with a brief discussion of the current economic situation and the outlook. I will conclude with comments on what I consider to be the central question regarding the appropriateness of today's policy posture for the economic circumstances we face.\n\nI will be sharing my personal views. I do not speak for the Federal Reserve System, and my views may not be shared by my colleagues.\n\nThe economy today\nJohn Silvia did a thorough job this morning of surveying the economy in some detail. Let me, therefore, touch on some highlights.\n\nThe economy is gaining strength. Most recent data and indicators have been positive. Anecdotal accounts we hear have been mostly upbeat. Consumer and business confidence seem to be accumulating.\n\nThat said, the economic recovery is now 32 months old and in some ways is still getting its legs. By that I mean while growth is proceeding at a moderate pace, the question of sustainability continues to hang in the air. The economy is generating jobs, and unemployment has come down. Still, there remain significant levels of unused and underutilized resources in the economy, especially human resources. The economy remains far from its optimal condition.\n\nGrowth in the current quarter appears to be tracking a little lower than in the fourth quarter. Real GDP for this quarter is currently projected by economists to rise around 2 percent annualized.\n\nThe housing market is still a mix of positives and negatives. Sales are improving and new residential construction activity is positive again. But the housing market is rising from an exceptionally low level and home prices are still declining.\n\nBusiness spending on equipment has lost some momentum in recent months. Tuesday's durable goods orders report was a disappointment.\n\nThe most evident softness in the incoming numbers comes from cutbacks in government spending, which declined in the fourth quarter for the sixth consecutive quarter.\n\nInflation, in my view, appears to be tracking along a path that is consistent with my interpretation of price stability. And inflation expectations appear stable. But gasoline prices are on the rise again, and cost pressures—both positive and negative—warrant a watchful eye for any shift in the underlying overall inflation trend.\n\nLooking ahead to 2012, I expect full year growth in the 2.5 percent to 3 percent range, assuming no significant adverse shocks. This performance would be significantly better than the 1.6 percent pace of 2011.\n\nMonetary policy\nMy reading of the situation is that the economic challenges we face are still formidable. Monetary policy support remains an important and necessary contributor to the ongoing recovery.\n\nAs you know, the federal funds rate has been targeted at just above zero since late 2008. If this level is maintained through 2014 as the FOMC has projected, the extraordinary low-rate environment will have prevailed for close to six years.\n\nExpansion of the Fed's balance sheet has also contributed to the accommodative stance of monetary policy. After two rounds of large-scale asset purchases (known popularly as QE1 and QE2), the size of the Fed's balance sheet has held at around $3 trillion. The Fed's recent maturity extension program (called \"Operation Twist\" by some) was launched last fall and is designed to put pressure on longer-term interest rates without growing the balance sheet further. These components of policy remain in place.\n\nLast August, a novel communications component was added to policy. The Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) post-meeting statement gave definition to the previous \"extended period\" guidance regarding future federal funds rate actions. The FOMC stated an expectation that the policy rate would remain near zero at least through mid-2013. The committee recently revised this guidance to the latter part of 2014. Of course, that stance is conditional on how the economy performs. Also, the committee took the important step of announcing a formal inflation target of 2 percent as a means of anchoring inflation expectations. To avoid misinterpretation, the committee buttressed the inflation target with a statement stressing the FOMC's balanced approach to its dual mandate.\n\nHow low rates are supposed to work\nThe current stance of monetary policy, in my view, is a sober response to the reality of economic conditions, both actual and projected. At the risk of telling you what you already know well, let me recite the textbook version of some ways a policy of low interest rates can influence economic activity.\n\nLower interest rates increase the amount of credit demanded in the economy. When met by an elastic supply of credit, spending increases.\n\nFor housing markets, lower rates generate higher housing demand and, with increased demand, higher house prices.\n\nLower rates may free up household cash flow for spending by lowering mortgage costs either by variable-rate resets or refinancing of fixed-rate mortgages.\n\nLower rates can also increase demand for a variety of financial assets, boosting their prices.\n\nImpaired transmission mechanism\nAs I said a moment ago, the almost-zero fed funds rate policy has been in effect since December 2008. Yet the pace of recovery has been very inconsistent, and the periods of stronger growth have been sporadic. Why is that?\n\nWell, one frequently heard explanation is that the transmission mechanism of monetary policy is—choose your adjective—broken, clogged, impaired. I think this view has much validity. I recently heard the analogy of a clogged drain in a kitchen sink. The speaker posed the question of whether the Fed should push on the blockage by running the water more intensely or instead put on a rubber glove, reach down, and pull the stuff out. Even the normally technical discussions of monetary policy can have a \"yuck\" factor from time to time.\n\nLike so many widely cited and potentially facile explanations for why things aren't going as they should, this one deserves deeper inspection. Let me give you my take on what \"impaired transmission mechanism\" means and what the reality is at this juncture.\n\nFirst, it means low rates aren't stimulating much in the way of credit growth. It means some bankable loan demand is not being met in spite of ample liquidity. And it means final demand for goods and services remains subdued and the added employment that growing final demand ought to generate is slow to materialize.\n\nThe state of the banking system is central to this picture. There are a number of reasons familiar to everyone in this room why credit flows via banks have been weak. They can be categorized under two headings: demand and supply.\n\nHere are some factors that have restrained the demand for bank credit.\n\nLarger businesses are flush with cash as a result of strong cash flow generation. Corporations have aggressively controlled costs and exploited productivity gains. All this has added up to relatively weak commercial and industrial loan demand.\n\nSmaller businesses haven't yet seen much revenue growth and remain cautious about borrowing given their perceived growth prospects. In addition, collateral values supporting small business borrowing haven't recovered, in many cases.\n\nHouseholds continue the process of deleveraging, and, as a consequence, consumer loan demand, broadly defined, has been soft. While there have been pockets of growth like auto loans, most categories have been pretty feeble. There are a number of reasons, including fear of job loss, lack of income growth to cover debt service, lost home equity value, repair of personal balance sheets, and impaired credit scores.\n\nAnd as for the supply of bank credit, here are some factors that you bankers have been living.\n\nLong story short, low funding costs and abundant bank reserves produced by monetary policy still have not resulted in significant, broad-based loan growth. Still, as you are aware, we are starting to see some movement in the right direction. New data from the FDIC show that as of the end of 2011, U.S. banks are issuing loans at the fastest rate in about four years. But it's too early to claim victory for lending.\n\nAt the same time, the functioning of credit capital markets has not been fully restored. While bond markets and securitization for auto loans and credit card receivables are functioning, the mortgage market is still impaired. This impairment limits the stimulative effect of lower rates and lengthens the timeline for clearing out the inventory of homes in the foreclosure process.\n\nI think it can be argued that because of the interplay of demand and supply factors, the interest rate sensitivity of the U.S. economy has been dampened.\n\nThe debate swirling around policy\nThe question of the moment, in light of a weak transmission mechanism for monetary policy, is what to do? There are serious people making well-reasoned arguments on all sides of this question.\n\nOne line of argument is that monetary policy should push harder to compensate for the weakened transmission mechanism. Since the policy rate is effectively at zero, this view would contemplate more bond purchases (or quantitative easing).\n\nA second line of argument asserts that further easing involves an element of futility or even potential harm. I will take a moment to develop this idea. Some have argued, for example, that pushing harder to increase aggregate demand would not be a good thing because the economy's potential level of output is actually lower than conventional estimates suggest. Accelerating demand, then, is more likely to compromise the Fed's price stability mandate than to improve the prospects for lower unemployment.\n\nAnother argument is that the elements of recent policy designed to suppress long-term rates challenge long-term lenders and investors, including life insurance companies and pension funds. With respect to the banking channel, what could be a six-year period of very low rates poses a risk-management challenge. The argument goes, with short-term rates close to zero, banks may see their exposure to interest rate risk as outsized. This potential interest rate risk could cause banks to grow loan activity more slowly—or, it is argued, meager yields will just spur imprudent risk.\n\nAs a policymaker, I weigh these divergent views and the policy stances they suggest by asking what policy balance will promote the most robust sustainable growth and the healthiest overall employment markets in the context of price stability. This, in my mind, is the question that policymakers must return to in all circumstances.\n\nMy view of appropriate policy\nSo let me wrap up this afternoon by telling you how I come out on this question at the moment. Given the circumstances of the economy, which I described earlier as still striving to get its legs, I continue to think the benefits of the low rate policy outweigh the costs.\n\nI take seriously the risks of holding to this policy. But I think a realistic assessment of the challenges associated with closing the employment gap calls for sustained extraordinary support for what is, like it or not, a gradual process. At the same time, I'm cautious about doing more involving expansion of the Fed's balance sheet. Precisely because I see the transmission mechanism of monetary policy through credit channels as constricted, I have my doubts that the gains from such a policy action taken in the near term would outweigh the longer-term potential costs, including the risk to the Fed's medium-term inflation outlook.",

            "content": "I'm sure you know it's Valentine's Day. You'll be amused to hear that the Fed has been the subject of Valentine flirtations over the past few days on, of all places, Twitter. The flurry of posts is pretty clever, and uses economic and monetary policy language to craft Valentine messages. Here are a few of my favorites: \"I'd like to borrow you overnight and hold you to maturity,\" \"You're a systemic risk to my heart,\" and \"Hey girl, you're the only number in my beige book.\" The tweets came from folks as varied as former government policymakers, journalists, and even our own staff at the Atlanta Fed. One of our posts read \"Being with you hikes my pulse by several basis points.\"\n\nSince it's Valentine's Day, let me start the serious part of my remarks with this observation. If I were thinking of the national economy as a love interest, I'd say she's been rather frisky lately, but I'm wary of being jilted. It's happened before and my heart was broken. Now let me revert to type. I'm going to talk about the economy in the language you expect.\n\nThe recent economic news has been positive on balance. This evening I want to put this improved picture in context and explain how I'm mentally processing the improving data. I'll address a timely question: is better news a sign the recovery is getting real traction, or is the economy likely to disappoint us as the year unfolds? I will also offer my interpretation of recent FOMC policy pronouncements.\n\nI must emphasize that I will be presenting my personal views. My views may not be shared by my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nRecent positive developments\nAs I said, the news has been positive on balance. The most obvious signs of improvement have come in the labor market. According to the latest Bureau of Labor Statistics report, payroll employment increased by 243,000 jobs in January. Over the past five months, job gains have averaged more than 180,000 per month.\n\nOver these months, the unemployment rate has fallen by just over three-quarters of a percentage point. The current unemployment rate of 8.3 percent is the lowest it's been since February 2009.\n\nConsistent with a strengthening labor market, growth in household sector income—which was anemic for the last year as a whole—posted a surprisingly strong gain in December. This is a positive sign because a pickup in income growth is almost certainly necessary to sustain growth in consumer spending in 2012.\n\nThe business sector is showing positive signs as well. Surveys by the Institute of Supply Management in January show continuing confidence among manufacturers and a strong uptick for other types of businesses, reflected in their service sector survey.\n\nAlso, we're starting to see the beginnings of credit expansion, which has been basically flat for quite a while. The Federal Reserve's just-released quarterly survey of lending conditions (known as the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices) indicates strengthening loan demand, especially in commercial and industrial lending, as well as in credit card and auto loans.\n\nNot all the recent economic news has been uniformly positive, but the balance of incoming data has been rather upbeat. This gives me confidence in the view that economic growth in 2012 will be noticeably better than in 2011.\n\nWe've been here before\nBut such a projection of year-over-year improvement should seem familiar. You might recall that GDP growth in 2010, the first full year of the recovery, exceeded 3 percent before falling off to less than 2 percent last year. The economy has had a fickle character in this recovery.\n\nIn the first four months of last year, the payroll measure of employment growth averaged over 200,000 jobs per month. But then came a late-spring/summer \"swoon\" during which that payroll number never exceeded 100,000. From April to August, the unemployment rate stopped declining, and the economy grew at an anemic pace.\n\nSo what should we make of the recent good news? Are recent improvements in the incoming data a sign the economy is gaining traction?\n\nI'm pretty confident it is. There's always a caveat, however, and the caveat is \"in the absence of shocks.\" The story of 2011 was one of shocks. There was a run-up in oil prices as a result of the Arab Spring. Commodity prices also rose rapidly for a variety of reasons. The earthquake and tsunami in Japan and the floods in Thailand disrupted global supply chains. The European debt crisis and the U.S. debt ceiling impasse shook confidence.\n\nSignificant unanticipated developments are part of economic life, but barring shocks, we at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta expect 2.5 to 3 percent growth for 2012.\n\nWorking through adjustments\nThis relatively optimistic outlook may strike you as being at odds with the latest statement of the FOMC. After the meeting of January 24, the committee announced it \"anticipates that economic conditions…are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate at least through late 2014.\"\n\nI supported, and continue to support, that statement.\n\nLet me explain my thought process. As I said, I expect the economy to return to a better growth trajectory than what we saw in 2011. But I also foresee a slow and arduous return to full capacity, including full use of the nation's human capital. To get there, the economy must labor through a variety of adjustments that will simply take time. In my view, the task combines elimination of considerable slack in the economy with engineering a foundation of solid fundamentals.\n\nSome required adjustments derive directly from the boom and bust of the housing market. I'll comment on two such adjustments.\n\nFirst, many homeowners saw their wealth shrink as house prices fell and found a new, much diminished level. House prices are likely to grow slowly over time, at best. Many forecasters believe house values are likely to remain flat or even decline in the next several years. Homeowners who previously had a lot of their net worth in residential real estate have to rebuild their wealth by saving and paying down debt.\n\nSecond, for many years before the recession, start-up business activity relied on home equity as a major source of financing. The subdued outlook for house values is likely to impede access to this source of funding for entrepreneurs. A new model for funding startups, which are key to job growth, has to evolve.\n\nMore broadly, business and consumer borrowers are adjusting to the reality of stricter bank lending standards. Even with an improving economy, I think it is highly unlikely banks will revert to the lending standards that prevailed in the heady days of 2003 through 2007. One implication is that potential homeowners, for example, will have to save more and consume less to accumulate savings for higher down payments.\n\nAnd beyond the housing sector, the government sector will almost certainly continue to contract. Ultimately, the resources released from the public sector have to be absorbed by private sector activity, but the adjustment process will be neither fast nor painless.\n\nAll this is to say that we are in the process of adjusting to new economic realities. Such adjustments take time. Therefore, I think the reality of where the economy is and what lies ahead justifies the 2014 policy statement.\n\nI would also emphasize that it's a conditional statement. It's based on a best estimate of the path the economy is on. It is not a commitment to maintain a near-zero federal funds rate without consideration of how conditions on the ground are evolving.\n\nHere's how I think you should interpret the 2014 guidance: the Fed's policy rate will likely stay at rock bottom at least through 2014 if the economic story goes as projected. If it doesn't, the time horizon could change.\n\nPerspective on the inflation target\nA key aspect of that economic story is inflation. In the last FOMC meeting, the committee approved a statement of longer-run goals and policy strategy.\n\nIn that statement, the committee formally announced a longer-run target for inflation of 2 percent. Technically, it's 2 percent annual growth in the price index for personal consumption expenditures. Though the Fed's inflation objective has been widely understood to be in the neighborhood of 2 percent for some time, the announcement is the first official and explicit articulation of how the FOMC defines its mandate to preserve price stability.\n\nThe 2 percent inflation target is an aid to understanding how the FOMC will react to developments in the economy within an overarching approach that can be called \"flexible inflation targeting.\"\n\nThe word \"flexible\" describes and qualifies the committee's exercise of judgment in reaction to adverse developments. The word \"flexible\" also reflects the principle that it is not always feasible or desirable to hit the target in the short run. Short-lived shocks to the economy can temporarily move measured inflation well away from the 2 percent target.\n\nConsider last year's energy and commodity price increases. Those cost pressures pushed up inflation in the early part of the year. Then, as expected, their influence dissipated as the year progressed.\n\nHad the FOMC tightened monetary policy early last year in response to the inflation threat, we might have compromised progress on growth and employment to no particular benefit with respect to our inflation mandate.\n\nFormalizing an inflation target should serve to further anchor the public's inflation expectations. That is the hope and intent. If you the public have confidence that we policymakers are serious and committed to price stability over the longer run, the FOMC may have some flexibility in dealing with developments in the shorter run.\n\nThe statement of longer-run goals and policy strategy also espouses a balanced approach to the FOMC's dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment. To paraphrase the relevant text of the statement, the two objectives are generally complementary over the longer horizon. However, when the objectives conflict, the FOMC will take a balanced approach to promoting them. Early last year, as I mentioned, we saw the unfortunate confluence of rising inflation and an unemployment rate that was too high.\n\nThe FOMC had to make a decision about how to respond to the fact that both inflation and unemployment were above the levels that would be satisfactory over the longer run. The decision was to maintain an accommodative policy stance designed to support growth and greater employment. That decision was made because inflation expectations appeared to be well-anchored and it was reasonable to expect that inflation would return to a path consistent with the objective of 2 percent. That, in fact, has happened.\n\nIf Fed policymakers had not expected the elevated rate of inflation to decline naturally as cost pressures eased, the committee would have had to reassess its judgment of the speed at which monetary policy should be trying to reduce the rate of unemployment.\n\nAs I see it, this is a recent, real-world example of a balanced approach in action. It illustrates the idea of flexible inflation targeting.\n\nAn explicit longer-run target for inflation is part of a broader communications strategy. Better and fuller communications is a policy tool. This tool now includes both dated rate guidance and an inflation target over the longer run. Both of these expectations influencers should help consumers, businesses, and financial markets anticipate the path of interest rates.\n\nBy providing guidance on interest rate policy, the FOMC can eliminate some of the guesswork between the private sector and the central bank. In current circumstances, this should in itself lower interest rates below where they might otherwise be.\n\nAnd by helping private decision makers predict the path of interest rates, our enhanced communications should help lenders and investors decide how to best allocate their resources.\n\nCurrent policy stance is appropriate\nTo wind up, the recent economic news has been encouraging, but in my view we haven't seen enough sustained improvement to be sure it will last. I think the current policy stance is appropriate for an outlook of steady, moderate growth with gradual employment gains. I do not see this accommodative policy compromising the objective of 2 percent inflation.\n\nAt the moment, I favor a policymaking posture I'd call \"vigilant restraint.\" I am prepared to be somewhat patient and watch how the situation develops.\n\nLet me assure you I'll be vigilant. Another of the Valentine's Day tweets I mentioned at the beginning sums it up nicely. This one says \"It's the economy, Cupid.\"\n\nHappy Valentine's Day.",

But come with me on an experiment our Fed economists like to call a \"counterfactual.\" There's one aspect of our economic lives where we have a lot of certainty and confidence. To understand this assertion better, take yourself back to early this morning. When you woke up, did you think about your employees' paychecks being deposited into their bank accounts on time? Did you worry about your business's cash management function and whether your treasurer was getting the best return on monies coming in that don't have to go out for a while or even until tomorrow? At a personal level, were you afraid your bank hadn't made the automatic payment on your mortgage so that you wouldn't face a late fee?\n\nChances are you didn't think about any of those things when you woke up. And you shouldn't have, because every one of those scenarios involves the nation's payments system—a key piece of the bedrock of your business, your life, and our economy. You take it for granted, because it works well. A smoothly running payments system is important to you and your business, but typically it's not something you have to give a lot of time or thought to—at least not until now.\n\nToday, I'd like to talk a little bit about this less well-known aspect of our economy, whose good performance has benefited us all as both consumers and in our professional roles as managers who must get bills paid on time and who need to count on our customers and clients paying us on time.\n\nMy basic story is this. The excellent U.S. payments system is undergoing some significant changes—some good, some that pose new risks, and some that could turn out to be for the bad. I want to assure you that the Federal Reserve is doing its part to maintain all the good things about the payments system while encouraging innovation and improvement. We're working to identify and guide the industry to manage the risks that come with rapid changes. Our goal now, as always, is to foster a market-based payments system that is safe, fast, efficient, and broadly accessible.\n\nBut ultimately it will be up to you as the business users of payments services to become more aware of these changes, the risks they might pose, and the advantages they might bring. It's also up to you to let your payments provider know what your business's needs are and ultimately to make the best decisions for your own organization.\n\nSo let me start with a brief history and description of the U.S. payments system. Then I'll talk about the changes afoot and how the Fed is addressing them. I'll end by outlining what you need to be thinking about.\n\nOverview of the U.S. payments system \n While cash is still a common payment method for consumers and business— especially for retailers—for decades, the primary ways that organizations make and receive payments have been by check, wire transfer, and the Automated Clearing House (ACH) system. The Fed plays a major role in each of these, as well as in cash. We do so, in part, as a provider of payments services to stay current with the market and to serve as a catalyst for greater efficiency, reliability, or accessibility when the infrastructure is not there for the market to lead such change. In fact, much of my own career has focused on what we call the retail payments system—checks and ACH—and in the past decade I've been intimately involved in changes that are occurring in these payments mechanisms.\n\nChecks: We can count on the Fed and private check processors that clear checks to do so very quickly and at par—or, in other words, at full face value. That was not always the case, though. When the Fed was founded, two in five banks were nonpar. That meant they imposed an \"exchange fee\" to pay checks submitted to them for collection by banks outside their local trading area. It effectively made the check worth less than its face value, introducing considerable uncertainty into any business transaction that involved that type of payment.\n\nThe Fed began offering check services when Reserve Banks were established in 1914 because Congress wanted to solve that dysfunctional payments system practice.\n\nFedwire was the world's first real-time gross settlement system, set up in 1918. Fedwire transfers large dollar payments among Federal Reserve offices, depository institutions, and federal government agencies. That means you can make near-real-time payments, which can help your business more effectively manage cash flow.\n\nAutomated Clearing House, or ACH: The Fed helped establish ACH in the early 1970s, and the Atlanta Fed played a leadership role. ACH provides an electronic alternative more efficient than checks for some transactions. The U.S. Treasury was also a catalyst, working to move Social Security and tax payments more efficiently. The focus in the early days of ACH was on recurring transactions—for example, mortgage and utility payments as well as payrolls. In the last decade, however, ACH has become a rail for one-time payments as well, with significant growth happening in web-initiated payments.\n\nCheck 21: Fast forward to the year 2003 and a huge change in the payments system: something we call Check 21. In the wake of 9/11, it became clear that relying on paper-based check clearing was no longer acceptable. On 9/11 and in the days immediately following, the movement of paper checks between financial institutions came to a virtual standstill, as airplanes were grounded and truck transportation reached its limits. At that time, tens of millions of checks written in the U.S. each day were physically transported overnight among Federal Reserve offices and commercial banks using an extensive network of air and truck transportation. Things had to change [to move these items] much faster.\n\nCheck imaging, enabling electronic processing of checks, had been in use but on a small scale. In addition to building the necessary IT infrastructure [to support widespread check imaging], the Fed helped to draft a new law, approved by Congress in late 2003, which took effect a year later. The law gave banks the option to change their paper check processing system into one that's almost fully automated. Virtually all of them did. A substitute check or electronic image can be presented to the paying bank. Now, you can still pay by check, but almost all paper checks are truncated and move through the banking system electronically, making them faster, more efficient, and more reliable. That can benefit your business.\n\nIt also affected ours. For example, the building we're in used to be one of 46 check processing centers. On an average night, this branch handled about three-and-a-half million items. Now, across the entire Fed system, there's just one processing facility, which handles only 15,000 paper items each night. The change took six years, and that part of our business went from 5,500 employees down to 500.\n\nAt the start of the twenty-first century, just under 42 billion paper checks were processed. Looking at the decade in three-year stretches, that number came down to 37 billion…then 30½…then 24½, according to the 2010 Federal Reserve Retail Payments Study.\n\nNowadays, you don't even need to go to the bank to deposit a check. Take a picture of it with your iPhone, send it out, and you're good to go. Quite a big change, and there are some big reasons for that trend to continue. Of course, part of that change occurred because Americans are writing fewer checks as alternative payment instruments like ACH and debit cards have become more accepted and new payment instruments have emerged. In fact, chances are there's a debit card in your wallet right now, and you're using it regularly.\n\nAt the start of the twenty-first century, there were just over 8 billion debit card transactions a year. Once again, looking at the decade in three-year stretches, that number soared to more than 15½ billion, 25 billion, then almost 40 billion.\n\nThe drivers of change\n So now let's look at the changes afoot that I mentioned earlier. There are at least three, and possibly four, significant drivers in the marketplace that are transforming the way payments happen.\n\nThe first and most familiar driver of this transformation is new technologies. Computers, mobile phones, and powerful data networks let us send and receive payments in new ways. Accessing our savings via a mobile device or a card enables payments and related data to move farther and faster than we could have imagined a decade ago.\n\nDriver number two—and associated with the new technology—is the emergence of new, nonbank players in the payments business. PayPal might be the most widely known example of this trend, but there is an explosion of new payments service providers that capitalize on the newest technologies. Some sell their services through banks. Some provide payments services that go around traditional bank-to-bank payments channels.\n\nThe third driver of change is globalization. Business is becoming more global—something that's well known to the residents of Jacksonville, with its massive port and growing international airport. To support the globalization of the economy, the payments system must evolve to support the complexity of cross-border relationships.\n\nA fourth driver is still in the wings. As we look ahead, the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau [CFPB] will have broad power in financial services, and it appears that consumer protection is likely to play a major role in shaping emerging payments methods.\n\nSecurity challenges \n Traditionally at the Fed, we've looked to manage financial risk in the payments system by accelerating the collection of payments. However, new risks are emerging through the electronic vehicles used to accomplish faster clearing.\n\nSome of these [include] software hackers, identity theft, denial of service attacks, and data breaches at financial or other institutions. These emerging and growing cyber threats make it tough for end users to know how secure the payment service provider's network is.\n\nNew players \n Historically, the movement of payments was accomplished largely by financial institutions or their agents. As I mentioned, advances in technology have brought new players to the payments space. In many cases, these players have fostered innovations which hold great promise. In others, these players have introduced new risks to the system with little direct risk to themselves. The payments system is only as strong as its weakest link. As users of the systems, it's important for all of you to fully understand the types of organizations you are using to serve as your payments providers.\n\nRegulatory challenge—Dodd-Frank \nThe Dodd-Frank regulatory reform act is imposing many fundamental changes on our financial system, in response to the financial crisis we experienced. While not a major focus of the act, several provisions affect the payments system and the Fed's role in it.\n\nWell known is the Durbin Amendment requiring the Fed to set interchange fees that banks charge their customers. Those have now been set, but consumers [and] the retail and banking industries are all still working out how they respond to changes in cost structure. The act also establishes a role for the Fed in regulating financial utilities, the big interchange networks and institutions.\n\nAnd Dodd Frank created the CFPB, which has broad authority to require fairness and transparency in payments that touch consumers.\n\nAll these changes will demand more of you as business (and nonprofit and educational) originators and receivers of payments to figure out how to reposition you own institution's transactions. I'm in no position to provide an answer to all of you or even to one of you.\n\nACH services grow, too\n Meanwhile, remember that growing debit card [usage]? For ACH, it's much the same type of story. Starting again at the beginning of the century, and going in three-year-intervals over the decade, you can see the trend clearly. In the year 2000, there were just over 6 billion ACH transactions, then almost 10 billion, then more than 14½ billion, then just over 19 billion.\n\nIt's easy to see why this is happening.\n\nACH is a fast, easy, and secure way to move payments of all kinds. It can help you manage cash flow, at low cost. ACH is also data rich. It not only provides a means for exchanging value, it can also include information related to the payment. This information can be used to drive efficiencies in areas like the accounts payable or receivable functions that support payments in your organization. And the Fed is working to make that better. We're innovating, working on speed and reach of our payments, retooling our systems with modern technology. Better, faster, more efficient, farther reach—that's the bottom line.\n\nConclusion (and why you should care)\n In closing, I hope I've shed a little light on an aspect of our economy that has been working very well for a long time, and why that's been so. I also have some action steps for you and your business.\n\nFirst, now is the time for you to develop a future vision about how you make payments. What are your needs here? What works for you and your business? I'm guessing they're the same things the Fed wants: better, faster, more efficient, less fraud, farther reach.\n\nSecond, work with your financial institutions to let them know what you need from a payments perspective. Would you benefit from faster, maybe even intraday settlement of transactions, or does early notification of what is settling when meet your needs? Do you prefer to push credit payments from your account to the receivers or are you supportive of having trading partners push debits to you? There are no right or wrong answers here, and different circumstances may cause you to employ multiple approaches. The message is simply to think about how the payments system can help you achieve your goals and to work with your payment provider.\n\nWe at the Fed will work with financial institutions and other players to improve the system in ways that will meet your needs. With more payments being moved electronically, consider the impact to you and your business if you could not clear payments for a week. The Fed stands ready to carry out our broad public service role, but it's through your dialogue with your financial institutions that we at the Fed connect with you as a consumer or a business executive.",

            "content": "The current economic recovery is two-and-a-half years old this month. After the deep recession and financial crisis, two-and-a-half years of economic growth sounds pretty good. But this recovery has felt like a roller coaster ride, with many ups, downs, and unexpected turns from quarter to quarter. In 2011, the economy absorbed some shocks and surprises that made for another such year. Economic performance in a recovery is never going to follow a completely linear path.\n\nToday, I'll review the story of 2011, and discuss where the economy stands as we enter the new year. I'll also offer a progress report on some of the economy's key fundamentals. I'll lay out the outlook for 2012, as I see it, and close by discussing the stance of monetary policy at this juncture.\n\nAs always, my comments are my views only and might not be shared by my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System or on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nReview of 2011\n First, let's take a brief look at how 2011 played out. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth during the year was quite slow, but with each successive quarter, growth accelerated somewhat. It appears that growth in the fourth quarter was relatively strong, continuing that acceleration trend. (I say \"appears\" because the numbers aren't yet in.)\n\nRemember that the economy was hit with shocks early in the year from many directions, including weather events and other natural disasters. The earthquake and tsunami in Japan and disastrous tornadoes here in the Southeast are just two examples.\n\nGrowth of consumer spending, which absorbs about two-thirds of U.S. GDP, suffered a midyear dip, falling from a growth rate of 2.1 percent in the first quarter to around 0.7 percent in the second. Consumer activity grew somewhat faster in the third quarter and appears to have picked up even more in the last three months of the year.\n\nThe inflation story played out as many economists, including most of my Fed colleagues, expected. Early last year, commodity prices rose considerably as global demand increased. The stronger commodity demand came particularly from developing economies. In addition, because of the so-called Arab Spring, oil supplies were disrupted and prices spiked. These rising commodity costs drove inflation readings higher as, in some instances, they were passed along to intermediate and end users. As commodity price pressures eased, headline inflation settled back into a more acceptable range, and longer-term inflation expectations held steady throughout the year.\n\nThe employment picture continued to be a major concern in 2011, especially considering the high levels of long-term unemployment. That said, job creation picked up in the second half of the year and, as you know, Friday's jobs report was encouraging.\n\nThe beneficiaries of this job creation and re-employment were disproportionately older, college-educated men. The recession was dubbed the \"mancession\" because men took the brunt of job loss.\n\nSo, that, in brief, is the story of the past year.\n\nFundamentals of the economy \n There is a deeper, multi-year story to be told about the repair and restructuring of foundational elements underpinning economic performance. I'd like now to give a progress report on certain of the economy's fundamentals. I will comment on five.\n\nThe first of these is the condition of household finances. The financial health of households and consumers is better, broadly speaking, but not yet rosy-cheeked. The process of achieving full health will take longer. Consumer spending is in the long run driven by income growth and wealth. For quite a number of years, consumers believed house price appreciation could be counted on as a source of individual wealth accumulation. And consumers believed that income growth would continue more or less uninterrupted. As a consequence, households were highly leveraged as the recession hit. Consumer debt levels have since improved, admittedly in part because of charge-offs and foreclosures, but also thanks to higher saving rates and less inclination and ability to take on new debt.\n\nHowever, the apparent stronger consumption at year-end was associated with falling savings rates, compensating for stagnating income growth. I question whether this consumer spending momentum will be sustained without a pickup in income growth.\n\nA second fundamental is business finances, which are in a healthy state, especially for larger companies. Corporate balance sheets are liquid, and much deleveraging has been accomplished. Businesses have worked hard to increase productivity and cut costs. As a result, even with overall demand growth still modest, large businesses are profitable and in a position to sustain decent results. Business investment was relatively strong in 2011, but much of that spending continued to be focused on productivity enhancements rather than on aggressive expansion.\n\nSmaller firms are generally not in such solid shape. I would argue that, in some respects, large businesses and small businesses have been on different tracks through the recovery.\n\nA third fundamental is the state of the banking and financial system. Since 2008, the banking sector has improved its capital position and worked down nonperforming assets. Risk management processes have been enhanced. Banks are mostly very liquid and in a much better position to grow their lending as loan demand increases. Capital markets—securitization markets, for example—have recovered substantially from their earlier impaired state, but they have not reached pre-crisis volumes.\n\nOverall, much progress has been made but the financial system is not yet back to full strength. We can't really have a healthy economy without a strong banking and financial sector.\n\nA fourth fundamental is public sector finances. Public sector finances have been under great strain and continue to be stressed.\n\nState and local governments have been aggressive to get current spending under control, but often at a painful cost in terms of services and jobs. Also, state and local governments continue to face serious challenges related to long-term pension obligations.\n\nAt the federal level, spending and revenues are still far out of balance. To finance those deficits, federal debt is rising. The Congressional Budget Office now estimates that, under some circumstances, debt held by the public could reach 82 percent of GDP by the end of 2021. That would be higher than any year since 1948. In the studied opinion of some analysts, national debt at that level would approach a tipping point and become a serious drag on growth.\n\nGovernment finances are not on a sustainable path and continue to be a weak element in the overall economic picture.\n\nFinally, I'll call out new business formation as a fifth fundamental. Here's why it's a fundamental: new and young businesses are an important source of jobs. Start-ups account for about 10 percent of firms but generate almost 20 percent of new jobs each year on average. Admittedly, many start-ups fail quickly, but research shows that those that survive tend to grow quite rapidly relative to more mature firms.\n\nBecause of the obvious concern about jobs, my colleagues at the Atlanta Fed have been studying the recent record of new business creation, relying on data on establishment creation. A new establishment is a new place of business, including start-ups as well as new stores or production facilities of large, existing businesses. Starting in 2007, the rate of new establishment creation dropped appreciably and has been slow to recover. At the same time, there appears to be something of a secular trend, dating from the late '90s, of a progressive decline in the number of employees at new establishments. In short, new businesses employ fewer people.\n\nMore research is called for, but we think we could be looking at a double whammy of sorts—a cyclical decline in new business formation combined with a longer-term trend of fewer jobs per new business.\n\nUncertainty\n I selected these fundamentals for comment because I think they are shapers of the recovery to date and the economy's prospects going forward. Let me add a parenthetical on the subject of uncertainty.\n\nUncertainty is a nebulous factor. Definition and measurement of uncertainty are elusive. Uncertainty is not as concrete and measurable a fundamental as business balance sheets or public finance, but it's affecting the behavior of consumers and businesses nonetheless. Most of the evidence I've seen for the effect of uncertainty comes from anecdotal comments. These comments reflect on a variety of concerns that are fueling risk aversion. Beyond lots of angst about the direction of the macroeconomy, concerns in 2011 included regulation, taxes, health care costs, and Europe.\n\nThere is, however, a growing body of work in the economics profession trying to measure uncertainty, and correlate it to actual spending by firms and consumers. For example, economists at Stanford University and the University of Chicago have built an index based on economic, tax, and forecast uncertainties. Last year, this index reached its highest level since the mid-1980s. The economists concluded that this level of uncertainty has been a significant drag on the expansion. You already knew that.\n\nEuropean situation\n The uncertainty related to the European sovereign debt crisis was a very significant factor in 2011 and will continue to be with us in one way or another in 2012. A number of economists believe Europe is in or entering a recession. A recessionary Europe will have a direct negative impact on U.S. exports and tourism. The more serious and disruptive impact, in my view, could come through financial market channels. Direct exposure of U.S. financial institutions to European banks and sovereigns has been worked down, but rapid-fire developments could give rise to severe market turbulence and contagion. And even absent dramatic developments, there is the ongoing psychological impact on the confidence of actors in the United States, as was the case in 2011.\n\nAlthough policymakers here cannot do much to influence European developments, the Federal Reserve has been doing what it can to protect the U.S. economy. Recently, to ease strains in dollar funding markets in Europe, the Fed extended and took other measures affecting so-called swap lines with several other central banks. A swap line—as the term suggests—is an arrangement in which two central banks temporarily exchange quantities of their currencies. When a swap line is used, the foreign central bank lends dollars directly to financial institutions in its jurisdiction. This reduces funding pressures on those institutions and helps them avoid having to purge dollar assets from their portfolios. A forced sale of dollar assets in Europe could drive up interest rates for U.S. businesses and consumers and crimp the flow of credit that is sustaining the recovery and job growth.\n\nOutlook for 2012\n This brings me to the outlook for 2012. Europe is the biggest wild card for the coming year. Also, the rising tensions in the Persian Gulf and the jumpiness of oil market prices cannot be ignored.\n\nIf there are no surprises from Europe or elsewhere, we at the Atlanta Fed are expecting modest GDP growth for the year in the range of 2.5 to 3 percent, but we will not be surprised to see some retrenchment of consumer activity as well as exports and inventory accumulation in the first quarter as compared to the last quarter of 2011.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, inflation has come down since the first quarter of 2011. Inflationary pressures did turn out to be transitory, as many of us argued. We see inflation continuing to perform in an acceptable range in the coming year.\n\nFrom its peak of 10.1 percent, the level of measured unemployment has fallen to 8.5 percent. We expect this progress will continue but at a slow pace.\n\nSo, overall, the Atlanta Fed's outlook anticipates a moderate pace of improvement but real progress on most fronts. This relatively slow pace of recovery is consistent with the narrative laid out by economists Kenneth Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart. Their thesis, in a nutshell, is that following severe financial crises, it takes a number of years for an economy to return to full health. This view seems to be proving out.\n\nThe stance of monetary policy\n The outlook of the Atlanta Fed assumes the continuation of a supportive monetary policy. So, let me discuss that aspect of the picture. Over the last four years, the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, has taken a number of steps to contain the recession and to help the U.S. economy recover. The FOMC lowered the policy interest rate effectively to zero. The FOMC undertook two rounds of large-scale asset purchases, known as quantitative easing. In August, the committee announced a conditional commitment to keep the federal funds rate in the 0 to 25 basis point range at least through the middle of 2013. In September, the committee decided to push out the average maturity of the central bank's portfolio of Treasury securities. This has been dubbed Operation Twist, and it was designed to put further downward pressure on longer-term interest rates.\n\nThe FOMC has done a lot with monetary policy, and the economy is in a better place. The economy has made progress, but it remains far from full health. So, it's shaping up to be another challenging year for charting monetary policy. Speaking for myself only, steady even if unspectacular growth accompanied by inflation in the neighborhood of 2 percent justifies some reluctance to change, in either direction, the FOMC's accommodative policy. At the same time, I think slow progress toward full employment justifies continuing consideration of whether more can and should be done. So for me as a policymaker, now is not a time to lock into a rigid position.\n\nTo conclude, I am encouraged by the better performance of the economy, including progress on fundamentals, and I expect more progress in the year ahead.",

The half-life of recollection of a graduation speaker's message is typically a few hours.\n\nSuch is the burden I happily carry today. I accept the challenge to say something that you degree candidates (soon to be graduates) will actually remember—something that might make a difference in your lives after Georgia State.\n\nIt would be easier if I had a lot of time and could go on and on until, by random luck, I say something that sticks with you. With unlimited time I would be like the proverbial monkeys with typewriters who, given enough chances, might type a line of Shakespeare. \"To be or not to be, that is the garumphnokonk.\" That monkey almost hit on something great.\n\nUnfortunately for me (not you), I've been asked to be brief. I have about 10 minutes (and I've already burned one of them). A time limit imposes a certain discipline on a graduation speaker.\n\nI have about enough time to make one substantive point, to give one piece of serious advice or hard-earned wisdom. I've been thinking a lot over the last few weeks about what that one point should be. Yesterday I decided. My message won't bring you to your feet or move you to storm the ramparts of injustice. But it is a serious point, I assure you.\n\nLet me prepare you. By way of preamble, I suggest you think of yourselves as making a rather profound transition as you walk out of this hall today. At that moment, you will assume some measure of individual responsibility—along with millions of others in our society—for our collective destiny. Welcome to the community of the responsible.\n\nThis is not to suggest that you have been irresponsible up to now. I'm just saying that graduation from the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies at Georgia State University conveys a step up in duty to protect and contribute to the common good.\n\nBe financially responsible\n  So here's my message to you today: be financially responsible. Do your very best to be financially responsible wherever you have influence. Assume responsibility—formal or informal—for sensible financial stewardship of any and all entities you associate with. That so-called \"entity\" may be just you and your family. Or it may be an institution of great scale with national or global reach.\n\nI'll explain what I mean by \"financially responsible\" first with some context. Today, we as a society are beset with serious problems that, at their source, are the fallout of irresponsible, or at least naïve, financial management.\n\nThis is true at the level of the individual citizen, some private-sector and nonprofit-sector organizations, and government at the municipal, state, and federal levels.\n\nMany individuals my age are approaching retirement age without sufficient savings. Some, certainly not all, but some homeowners have experienced the pain of foreclosure and loss of their homes because they did not understand they were taking on mortgage debt they couldn't handle. Financial institutions have failed because of dangerous concentrations in a single-asset category. Georgia, for example, has been the epicenter of bank failures in the United States over recent years because of its banks' lending exposure to real estate. The Atlanta Fed and other supervisors have acknowledged we could have done more as watchdogs, but first-order responsibility rests with the principals of those banks.\n\nIn the public sector, municipal and state governments are facing mounting pension obligations in coming years that may prove to be underfunded. And, at the federal level, an unsustainable budget deficit and debt trends portend deep cuts and painful adjustments in the coming years. I could go on.\n\nAct before problems get out of hand\n  To be an agent of financial responsibility, I urge you to educate yourself, engage reality, and act before problems get out of hand.\n\nHere's my plea as you join the \"community of the responsible\": make financial responsibility a bedrock principle by which you live and work. Develop a grasp of sound financial fundamentals. Apply this knowledge in your personal affairs as well as your professional and civic activities. Even if it's not your job, pay attention to and care about the financial health and resilience of your employer. Engage the same questions in the other institutions that matter to you—civic associations and clubs, your local hospital, your alma mater, your church, synagogue, or mosque.\n\nYou heard me a moment ago urge action before problems get out of hand. There has been too much \"kicking the can down the road,\" as they say, leaving problems for those who follow, for later generations. Sadly, in some current matters, you are the later generation. Financial problems won't go away if we ignore them. Sooner or later, financial reality will exact its tribute.\n\nWork toward resiliency\n  I will close by expanding on the word \"resilience.\" Resilience, to my mind, is the capacity to absorb a financial body blow, to survive a bad spell, to withstand severe financial stress and come out the other side. Resilience is the product of sensible policies that conform to sound fundamental principles—live within means, avoid excessive leverage, diversify risk, build up a cushion for unexpected problems or sheer bad luck.\n\nFinancial resilience and profligacy are antithetical. I had a good friend once who liked to quote his dear, profligate mother. She often said, \"Spend, spend. God will send.\" Maybe, but I wouldn't count on it.\n\nI feel privileged to be the one to get in a last word with you before you cross this stage and receive your diplomas. Thanks for listening.",

            "content": "University of Georgia Terry College of Business\n2012 Economic Outlook\nAtlanta, Ga.\nNov. 29, 2011\n\nAs a central banker, I am both a consumer and producer of economic forecasts. My experience with forecasts over the last almost five years inclines me to skepticism and humility, depending on which role I'm in. Today I want to speak from both perspectives.\n\nFirst, I will provide what you came for—a view on what's ahead in 2012. True to the conference's billing, I'll give you my views on the national outlook.\n\nI'd also like to share some thoughts on my perspective as a consumer of forecasts and make the case for their value even when, as so often happens, they are wrong.\n\nAnd to go further, I'd like to draw a contrast between the forecasts of private, independent analysts and the forecasts I compute and submit quarterly as a participant in the official forecasting exercise conducted by the Federal Open Market Committee, the FOMC. It's the difference between a detached observer making assumptions about policy over a forecast horizon versus a policy maker responsible for outcomes of policy objectives over that time horizon. More on this distinction a little later.\n\nI must emphasize, as I always do, that I will be sharing my personal views and opinions. My colleagues on the FOMC or in the Federal Reserve System may not agree with me.\n\nCurrent economic situation\n I'll start with a summary of the current economic situation. Growth has picked up from earlier in the year. Inflation appears to be settling into a range that I consider consistent with the FOMC's price stability mandate. The economy is producing jobs on a net basis, just not at a pace and volume sufficient to materially reduce the unacceptably high rate of unemployment.\n\nThird quarter real gross domestic product (GDP) growth was initially measured at 2.5 percent and recently revised down to 2 percent. The composition of the third quarter number revealed a significant and widely unexpected drop in inventory accumulation, offset in part by a larger-than-anticipated rise in exports.\n\nThis composition of third quarter GDP may bode well for the fourth quarter. It suggests we entered the fourth quarter with leaner inventories and that demand from our trading partners has held firm.\n\nAnalysts, including my staff at the Atlanta Fed, predict fourth quarter growth slightly above the third quarter. I think growth of 2.5 to 3 percent (annualized) is a reasonable expectation for the last quarter of the year, given the data currently in hand.\n\nThe factors contributing to the current growth picture can be categorized as drivers, more or less neutral factors, and drags on growth.\n\nCurrent drivers—that is, components growing faster than overall GDP—include capital goods spending, consumer purchases of autos, and exports. Retail spending in general as well as construction activity are mostly neutral factors, growing about even with the pace of GDP growth. The most significant drag on current GDP growth is government spending at all levels.\n\nInflation moderated in the third quarter, in large part as the influence of gasoline and other commodity costs retreated from earlier in the year. Other cost pressures, including labor compensation, remain subdued, and inflation expectations are holding steady. In other words, the underlying sources that drive inflation appear to be in check.\n\n2012 outlook\n My baseline forecast for 2012 builds on the picture I've just painted of the second half of 2011. I'm expecting continued moderate growth, decently behaved inflation, continuing net job creation, but slow progress on unemployment.\n\nYou will note I used the word \"baseline.\" I need to emphasize that at this juncture I perceive considerable downside risk to this baseline forecast. The most prominent source of risk is Europe.\n\nI think it can be argued that in recent weeks the European sovereign debt crisis has entered a new phase, and as a result the financial markets are jittery.\n\nOur own fiscal challenges at the federal level constitute a significant risk as well. In my view, the disappointing failure of the so-called supercommittee to chart a credible path to fiscal balance adds to the pall of uncertainty and weak confidence that holds back more robust recovery.\n\nOther drags on growth and headwinds deserve mention. These factors include the weakness of the housing sector with its effect on consumer spending, related household sector deleveraging, a commercial real estate sector that is still restructuring, and weak credit expansion in a financial system still under repair.\n\nIn my view none of these individually rivals the potential for spillover from adverse developments in Europe. We often speak of the channels through which shocks propagate and affect outcomes. Let me comment on the channels through which the real economy in the United States could be hurt by developments in Europe.\n\nA recession in Europe would hit U.S. exports. Broadly speaking, the region is our third largest trading partner. But, in my view, the financial channel carries the greater potential of significant disruption to the already slowly recovering U.S. economy. I'm concerned about risk associated with the financial sector not so much because of direct exposure of U.S. financial institutions to sovereigns or even the most exposed European banks, but rather the more nebulous prospect of market turbulence and contagion.\n\nSo let me summarize my outlook as follows: the U.S. economy will continue to grow at a moderate pace in 2012. Unemployment will come down slowly. Inflation will stay in acceptable bounds. But this storyline involves considerable vulnerability to disruptions from European developments as well as deteriorating confidence born of our own fiscal challenges.\n\nThe value of forecasts, even if wrong\n Now that I'm out on a personal outlook limb, let me turn to the perspective of consumer of forecasts. There are numerous well-traveled jokes about economic forecasters, typically involving unfavorable comparisons to astrologers, weathermen, and promoters of superstition.\n\nThis has not been a year that has enhanced the reputation of the economic forecasting field. In January, the consensus full-year 2011 GDP forecast of the Blue Chip panel of economists was over 3 percent. As of the beginning of this month, that number had fallen to under 2 percent. Similarly, the midpoint of the FOMC's consensus full-year 2011 GDP projections was near 3 percent as late as June but had also fallen below 2 percent by the beginning of this month.\n\nThese may sound like big misses, but they are actually well within the range of typical forecast errors.\n\nWith such a record you may wonder why forecasters, the Fed included, don't do a better job. To answer this question, let me suggest three reasons why forecasts may be off.\n\nWhile it's relatively trivial in my view, the first reason involves missing the timing of economic activity. An example of that was mentioned earlier when I explained that GDP for the third quarter had been revised down while the fourth quarter is expected to compensate.\n\nA second reason that forecasts miss the mark is, in everyday language, stuff happens.\n\nTo be a little more precise, unforeseen developments are a fact of life. In my view, the energy and commodity shocks early in the year had a significant impact on growth in the first half of 2011. The tsunami-related supply disruptions, though temporary, were an exacerbating factor. In fact, a lot of shocks or disruptions are quite temporary and don't cause one to rethink the narrative about where the economy is likely going.\n\nChanging narratives \n Which brings me to the third reason why economic prognostications go off track: we, as forecasters, simply get the bigger story wrong.\n\nWhat I mean by getting the bigger story wrong is failing to understand the fundamentals at work in the economy.\n\nThere is perhaps no better example of this problem of recognizing the fundamentals than the early debate over the expected shape of the recovery that began over two years ago. Some forecasters expected relatively rapid growth in the first years of post-recession expansion, citing the post-war pattern of sharp recoveries following deep recessions. Others, influenced by the now well-known research on financial crises by economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff, argued that the correct historical comparison suggested a much slower pace of recovery.\n\nIt is now fairly clear that the Reinhart-Rogoff thesis is the appropriate one. But it is worth emphasizing that those in the Reinhart-Rogoff camp did not possess more or better data, or that those who had predicted a \"V-shaped\" recovery were ignorant of history. In the end, forecasters had to make an informed guesstimate of which fundamentals were truly in place. It has only been with the passage of time that a clearer picture has emerged.\n\nA longer-term economic forecast essentially derives from a narrative about economic fundamentals: whether there are major imbalances that will trigger painful corrections in the future, whether there are major drags on growth and what those are, what factors are driving growth, and whether those growth dynamics are sustainable.\n\nA persistent string of misses in the same direction may be a signal that the underlying fundamentals on which forecasts are based need to be rethought. Careful examination of the source of forecast errors can lead to a better understanding of those fundamentals, with an obvious payoff in terms of better decision making. This is why I said in my introduction that forecasts can have value even if they're wrong.\n\nNow I'd like to revert back to the perspective of producer of forecasts. Specifically I'd like to comment on the economic projections published four times a year by the FOMC and how the forecasting exercise they represent differs in a fundamental way from the practice of private forecasting.\n\nThe instruction given to each FOMC participant is to submit a forecast that will be compiled into a \"Summary of Economic Projections\" (SEP). As a participant I am asked to embed an assumption of \"appropriate monetary policy,\" which is defined as each policy maker's view of the future path of policy most likely to ensure the Fed achieves its dual objectives of maximum employment and stable prices. It is this appropriate monetary policy assumption that creates the distinction between private forecasts and those generated in the SEP exercise.\n\nI would argue that a Fed monetary policy maker's forecast—mine, for instance—is not so much what he or she predicts is going to happen from the point of view of a detached observer. Rather, it's a projected path to a state of the economy approaching some set of policy objectives.\n\nThe starting point for private forecasters is normally a policy assumption on the basis of which they then make a forecast. The starting point for a policy maker is an outlook that calls for an appropriate policy posture of either staying the course or making an adjustment, sometimes even a complete reversal. You can think of the distinction in terms of \"which came first, the chicken or the egg?\" But in this case, substitute \"which came first, the policy or the forecast?\"\n\nI'm explaining this rather arcane distinction so you understand what accompanies the outlook I just presented to you today. Implicitly accompanying my outlook was a personal view of what constitutes appropriate monetary policy aimed at achieving the policy objectives mandated by Congress. Our mandates, to repeat, are to promote the goals of price stability and maximum employment.\n\nAppropriate monetary policy at present\n Now I'll be explicit. At this time my notion of \"appropriate monetary policy\" is one of holding steady the current policy rate (federal funds rate) of zero to 25 basis points and the balance sheet steady at current scale. I supported efforts to put pressure on longer-term interest rates for the modest additional stimulus that might produce. That said, I am skeptical that further asset purchases will produce much gain in terms of increased economic activity. I don't believe further bond purchasing by the Fed is a potent policy option given the set of circumstances we currently face. But that is not to say that such a policy action would not be powerful and appropriate in other circumstances, and I don't think any option should be taken off the table.\n\nI'll end with this thought: even though forecasts of private sector analysts and those done by the Fed are different exercises, ideally there should not be a wide divide between the two. If the Fed is effective with its communication with the public there should be substantial alignment. Enhancing our communication with you, the public, is therefore to my mind a worthy priority. I hope these remarks have served that purpose.",

            "content": "Conference on Small Business and\n  Entrepreneurship during an Economic Recovery\n  Washington, D.C.\nNov. 10, 2011\n\nThanks for joining us this morning. We covered a lot of good ground in this conference yesterday. Now it falls to me to kick off the second day.\n\nI welcomed the idea of a conference on \"small business and entrepreneurship\" because in that title I saw the opportunity for the meeting to address two somewhat distinct but interrelated, or overlapping, claims.\n\nFirst, in low- and moderate-income communities, small businesses anchor neighborhoods and generate positive social benefits.\n\nSecond, it is claimed that small businesses account for a great deal of private sector employment and new jobs.\n\nI've been thinking quite a lot about the jobs crisis the country is experiencing and the role of small business in a solution.\n\nIn my time this morning, I'd like to take a close look at the connection between small businesses and job creation, the second of the two claims.\n\nIn regard to this connection, we often hear these days that the small business sector doesn't have enough access to capital, and if only the banks would lend more money, jobs would be created. I'd like to look more deeply into this assertion and try to understand the underlying commercial reality.\n\nSo this is my general topic this morning: small business, job creation, bank financing. I am a former banker. I hope to add value to this conference by going into some depth on the subject of how banks actually lend to small businesses with a particular focus on business start-ups.\n\nIt's axiomatic that almost all start-ups are small businesses. It turns out that research shows that, with regard to job creation, it's new businesses that make the most difference in creating jobs, rather than small businesses broadly defined. The Kauffman Foundation supported research that came to this conclusion. So to narrow the focus even further, my specific topic today is start-ups, job creation, and bank financing.\n\nThe small business sector\nLet me put start-ups, or new business formation, in the full context of the small business sector. The small business sector is extremely heterogeneous. Among the conventional criteria for classifying a business as small are number of employees, revenues, assets, number of establishments, and sometimes legal structure. Unfortunately, no single metric provides a definition that's adequate for all purposes. I'm told a report to Congress in the 1970s cited more than 700 different possible definitions of a small business. The most commonly applied metric is number of employees, with cuts of 500 or fewer and 50 or fewer.\n\nI know many of you in the audience are familiar with this picture, but let me quickly review some high-level information. On an employment basis, the vast majority of business enterprises in the United States are small—even smaller than 50 employees. According to the Census Bureau's 2008 Statistics of U.S. Businesses, there are about 21 million nonemployer businesses in the country. Most are self-employed individuals operating very small unincorporated businesses, which may or may not be the owners' principal source of income. These are important sources of employment for the owners, but clearly are not strong creators of jobs for others. Of the slightly fewer than 6 million businesses that do have paid employees, almost 80 percent have fewer than 10 employees.\n\nFor the purpose of talking about start-ups and their impact on job creation, let me suggest a more qualitative categorization. I think we can put new businesses into two buckets: scalable-growth businesses versus inherently small-scale firms. The former have been referred to in a Kauffman Foundation study as \"gazelles.\" The latter have sometimes been called \"mom-and-pops.\" Inherently small-scale firms often populate highly fragmented businesses like restaurants, dry cleaners, boutique retail stores, and beauty salons. Occasionally, one of these inherently small-scale businesses surprises even the owner by growing beyond expectations. And occasionally, the business concept is unique enough to be franchised and thereby grow to substantial scale. Every once in a while a hamburger joint in San Bernadino, Calif., becomes McDonald's. But mostly the businesspeople who launch these small-scale enterprises start with the intention of remaining relatively small.\n\nIn contrast, the entrepreneurs behind scalable-growth businesses hope their companies will become large. They may expect that success will bring the opportunity to go public or sell to a larger company.\n\nWithin the category of small business start-ups, scalable start-ups and scaling young businesses are drivers of job creation. What makes them scalable is that these new firms address large potential markets, offer products and services with positive-scale economies, or have a business model that's replicable. Of course, many intended scalable-growth businesses fizzle out and fail. The DeLorean Motor Company—intended to rival GM—quickly disappeared (and then found its name recently resurrected).\n\nBusiness births and deaths\nAs I hope what I've just said points out, there is a tremendous churn of new business formation, failure, and disappearance. In a dynamic economy like that in the United States, businesses start and cease operations all the time for any number of reasons.\n\nData from the U.S. Census Bureau show that the rate of establishment formation, and I'll use this as a proxy for business formation, averaged about 12 percent a year over the period 1992 to 2005. Exit rates averaged about two percentage points lower during this period, so the total number of establishments grew over time. A closer look at business mortality shows that about 20 percent of establishments failed in their first year. About half failed within the first five years.\n\nThe data here are not perfect, but I think they are reliably suggestive of an economy that is constantly and vigorously creating new businesses and jobs while at the same time destroying other businesses and jobs. It's the balance of these that makes for positive or discouraging labor market conditions. Without a continuous flow of new business formation, the U.S. economy would be always shedding jobs. And many of the jobs created by business start-ups are impermanent because of the high failure rate.\n\nWe know that the rate of business failures grew sharply during the last recession. More troubling, though, is that the rate of new business formation fell sharply during the recession and seems to have been slow to recover. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of new establishments decreased from a peak of about 870,000 a year in 2006 to 700,000 in 2009, and was 720,000 in 2010.\n\nSo, in broad strokes, here's the picture: virtually all start-ups start small. Whether they're so-called \"mom-and-pops\" or \"gazelles,\" they create some jobs at inception. Inherently small enterprises either fail or sustain operations, but tend to level off in terms of employment. The growth businesses ramp up creating initial employment. They may fail in time, or they may grow to what is still small scale and level off, or they may break out and grow to large scale.\n\nA 2010 Kauffman Foundation study shows that just 1 percent of employer businesses—those growing the fastest—generate roughly 40 percent of new jobs in a given year. Three-quarters of those businesses are less than five years old.\n\nRole of banks in start-up financing\nThe takeaway point is this: if we want to grow jobs, one place we should look is to start-ups and young businesses, especially scalable-growth businesses that often set out to commercialize innovation. Scalable start-ups need capital. So what is the role of banks in providing start-ups with this needed capital?\n\nCommercial banks play a significant, but not dominant, role in start-up financing. The information is a little dated, but according to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2007 Survey of Business Owners, 19 percent of employer firms said that a business loan from a bank was a source of start-up or acquisition capital, 11 percent cited using credit cards, and 8 percent used home equity loans.\n\nDespite the not insignificant role of banks, it turns out that the most commonly used source of start-up financial capital was personal savings—used by 62 percent of respondent firms.\n\nIn April of this year my colleague Federal Reserve Governor Elizabeth Duke spoke on small business credit availability. In her talk, she cited the Federal Reserve's 2010 Survey of Consumer Finances, which—despite its name—had some information on sources of funding to start, acquire, or expand closely held businesses. Referencing this survey, she pointed out that the most frequently used source of start-up finance was personal savings and assets.\n\nWhen a bank does make a loan specifically to finance a start-up, the bank—regardless of its size—rarely backs the business per se, or the entrepreneur based on his or her good standing, without recourse to a so-called \"second way out.\" Banks usually require an independent source of repayment, which typically means collateral unrelated to the business that can be readily liquidated, or a guarantor of independent means.\n\nThe most prevalent form of hard collateral is real property. Start-up entrepreneurs often hear, \"If you'll put up your house, we'll lend to your new business.\" Real estate related to the business—to the extent the entrepreneur needs such and actually owns it—can be problematic as collateral because its value may be a function of the business cash flow it helps generate. In such a case, the banker's primary source of repayment and second way out are not independent of each other.\n\nOther sources of financing\nBanks have pulled back their direct lending to finance business start-ups in recent years. For example, the Atlanta Fed's poll of small business credit conditions in the Southeast found that businesses less than six years old were much less likely to have used a loan from a bank when they started their businesses than were older firms, and more likely to have relied on personal savings.\n\nBeyond personal savings, owners of new and young businesses rely on their  personal credit to start up. Sources of personal bank credit for starting a business include home equity loans and credit cards. So the fall in residential real estate values since 2007 is a plausible explanation for some of the drop-off in new business formation during and since the recession. Budding entrepreneurs have less equity in their homes to back a home equity line of credit. Both credit limits and outstanding balances on home equity lines of credit have continued to decline since 2007. According to CoreLogic, at the end of June this year, almost 23 percent of residential properties with a mortgage were in a negative equity position, and in some locations that percentage was much higher.\n\nPersonal credit card revolving debt has also been a source of start-up and early-stage financing. Personal credit cards are a form of unsecured credit and are granted on the basis of assessments of repayment risk factors such as personal credit history and income. Again, the bank is not backing the business idea per se. According to the New York Fed's Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit, both the number of credit card accounts and account limits have increased modestly in 2011, but they remain well below pre-recession levels as credit card delinquency remains elevated.\n\nSome banks—but a minority—have specialized asset-based lending (ABL) units that enable them to use the business assets—receivables, inventory, and equipment—as collateral. But because ABL is a specialized lending business requiring significant infrastructure and systems investment, many banks are not geared up to do this kind of lending. ABL requires detailed and frequent monitoring of collateral positions and specialized expertise. Such lending techniques have historically been the province of nonbank finance companies that fund themselves in wholesale markets and are not depositories like banks and credit unions. The wholesale funding model of finance companies came under severe stress during the financial crisis and its aftermath.\n\nThe economics of the ABL business require substantial scale to absorb the cost of intense collateral monitoring.  Many community banks cannot afford the investment in ABL infrastructure and specialized lending personnel. In any event, business asset-based loans and lines of credit are rarely available to raw start-ups that are not yet proven or established businesses. This is because predictable and reliable cash flow is always the preferred and happy way that loans get repaid.\n\nMy point here is that banks are not natural financial backers of a new business idea based on the perceived merits of the idea or the assets generated by the business in the early period of operation. This has been the reality for quite some time. The data showing the incidence of failure among start-ups reinforce this point, I think. The more reasonable domain of banks is loans of moderate risk to more established businesses that can demonstrate a track record. Because banks make loans using mostly depositors' money, they have to be right in their credit decisions virtually all the time.\n\nSo how then are we to get capital to start-ups and early-stage enterprises in the interest of job creation? What parties are appropriate and geared up to take the risk financing start-ups?\n\nAs I've already mentioned, personal savings and money from friends and family have been very important sources of start-up financing.\n\nIn addition, high-potential start-ups can also look to venture capital firms and angel financing. Business incubators are increasingly playing the role of organizers and coordinators of angel networks. A recent development has been the use of social media to mobilize start-up investment, aggregating smaller dollar investments.\n\nMore start-up activity needed\nTaken together, this is not a wholly satisfying answer. Capital formation for scalable start-ups and early-stage businesses—including debt capital—is both a free market and public policy challenge. The volume of activity is immense, the targets of investment are small, the risk of loss is high, and the market—so to speak—is atomized, decentralized, and not highly organized.\n\nWe know the start-up sector is important, and it is sputtering. We need more activity in this area of the economy. It is tempting to look at the commercial banking sector as a fix. I think that is too narrow a view. My purpose today was simply to lay out the commercial reality of this challenge, as I see it. I think a practical grasp of commercial reality—including the role of banks—is a necessary starting point for generating ideas that will be helpful.",

            "content": "CFA Society of East Tennessee\nChattanooga, Tenn.\n\nOctober 18, 2011\n\nI want to thank the East Tennessee chapter of the CFA Society for inviting me to speak this evening. I always start with a disclaimer, so let me get that out of the way up front. These are my personal views and not necessarily those of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve or on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nEach Reserve Bank has quite a lot of resources devoted to preparation for a regional president's participation on the FOMC, where monetary policy is made. Our work at the Atlanta Fed in support of monetary policy involves a number of tasks. These include tracking data, running econometric models, reading the analysis of others, and talking to economic actors like you. From all this information, we construct and continuously adjust a narrative that tries to explain where the economy is and where it's going.\n\nI'm not going to say much on policy this evening. Rather, I want to spend some time reviewing the economic story of 2011, as the year built to today's situation, in an effort to provide perspective on what you're hearing about the economy. Everyone in the world of economics is pretty much privy to the same data. Yet, in interpreting signals from the data, serious observers can arrive at quite divergent views on the state and direction of the economy. Today, serious predictions for the next 15 months range from forecasts of impending recession to an outlook for slow but improving growth. Among those holding the no-recession view, there are a variety of opinions on how vulnerable the economy is to negative shocks. Notably absent are predictions of growth rates consistent with, for example, a rapid pickup in job creation.\n\nI won't test your attention span by reciting the ups and downs of every important data element measured in the economy over the last nine months. But I do want to provide enough of a timeline to convey the movements and swings we've seen over the year by looking at three cuts of the information. They are, first, the objective economic conditions on the ground; second, the direction—better or worse—of the data; and, third, the degree of surprise versus expectations as economic indicators came in.\n\nWhy consider how the numbers came in relative to expectations? Because expectations, particularly at this juncture, can influence how our economic fortunes actually play out. A week ago, in an interview following his winning the Nobel Prize in economics, Thomas Sargent, who is an adviser for the Atlanta Fed's Center for Quantitative Economic Research, is quoted as saying, \"What's going to happen is going to depend partly on what you think is going to happen.\" Hold that thought.\n\nFirst quarter: Very little growth\n The basic story of the first half of this year was one of disappointment versus expectations. At the beginning of the year, the consensus forecast had gross domestic product (GDP) growth for 2011 in the range of 3 to 4 percent. Though the Atlanta Fed's forecast was at the lower end of that range, we generally shared the view that the recovery was firmly established.\n\nBut as first quarter data came in, they did not live up to expectations. The forecast was revised down, and we now know the economy is estimated to have grown at a meager 0.4 percent in the first quarter.\n\nThe oil and commodity price shocks early in the year, along with severe weather events, seemed to provide an explanation for the negative surprises to first quarter growth. You can add some impact from the March 11 tsunami tragedy in Japan, but most of that impact was felt later.\n\nA pretty clear picture of just how bad the first quarter was became apparent toward the end of the second quarter, when the FOMC met in late June. At that point, notwithstanding weakness in the early months of the year, the widely held outlook was that growth would rebound in the second half. Many anticipated that the effects of the price and disaster shocks would quickly dissipate.\n\nSecond quarter: Rethinking our position\n Now let's move on to the second quarter. As data on the second quarter came in, many forecasters, including us, were surprised that the data were on the downside of what were already modest expectations for the quarter.\n\nLet me mention parenthetically that, given the complexity and dynamism of the economy, forecasting is fraught with errors and misses. One of my colleagues says the only thing he can forecast with certainty is that his forecast will be wrong. It's when forecasts are persistently wrong in the same direction, and by a substantial measure, that you worry you've missed the real story.\n\nAs the summer progressed, the data surprises were unrelenting and on the negative side of expectations.\n\nBy the time of the early August FOMC meeting it was clear to my Atlanta Fed colleagues and me that we had to rethink our position. The momentum of the economy looked a lot weaker than was our assessment earlier in the summer.\n\nA lot of worrisome stuff was piling up. For one thing, revised data revealed that the weak first quarter was one of a succession of progressively slowing quarters and not merely the result of one-time events.\n\nFurther, the weakness in growth seemed to be more broad-based than earlier price and disaster shocks could account for.\n\nAdd to this information that in late summer there were, in rapid order, a number of blows to confidence. In addition to the GDP revisions, there was the debt-ceiling battle, the S&P downgrade of the U.S. credit rating, Hurricane Irene and the storm damage on the East Coast, stock market volatility, and an initial report of zero job growth in August. And very prominently, the European debt crisis seemed to worsen, which again raised the possibility of spillover into the U.S. financial system and economy. All this worked to change views about the underlying fundamentals of the U.S. and global economies. As a consequence, growth estimates for the second half of the year and into 2012 were marked down substantially by most forecasters.\n\nThird quarter: Gradually improving economy\n The somewhat overlooked story of the period since the end of August is that much of the incoming data have exceeded most forecasters' low expectations. For the third quarter at least, it appears that downgrades of growth forecasts have been too pessimistic.\n\nAdmittedly, the economic environment today is characterized by heightened uncertainty. That uncertainty itself can act like a negative shock to the economy if investment and consumption decisions come to be driven by worst-case scenarios of extremely sluggish growth, at best, with a very good chance of sliding back into recession.\n\nMy view is that this worst-case scenario is less likely than it appeared to be a couple of months ago. I don't expect a double-dip recession, at least in the absence of a significant negative shock. I think recent positive surprises in the data should give pause. I think it's too early to draw fatalistic conclusions about the course of the economy. As I see it, recent data and anecdotal reports are signaling a gradually improving economy, and I think this point needs to be recognized. In support of this view, I'll paint a picture from our working with the data. We at the Atlanta Fed regularly monitor the data series that directly enter into the GDP calculation, along with important other series, including employment. We compare these data elements to Bloomberg's published consensus expectations for each. In the months leading up to July, the downside surprises in the data dominated. In August and September, upside and downside surprises were roughly equal. But in October, the surprises have generally been to the upside. Importantly, these surprises to the upside exceeded expectations by a significant measure. I've concluded an unqualified narrative of a downward trend is unjustified.\n\nRisks and growth\n There is certainly downside risk to this picture. While there are a number of risk factors, in my view, the two most prominent at the moment are financial instability from developments in Europe and further loss of confidence if the so-called congressional \"supercommittee\" here in the United States fails to reach agreement—that is, if the supercommittee is unable to arrive at a credible and sufficient fiscal rebalancing plan, leaving the fallback to mandatory cuts as the only resort.\n\nThese risks aside, most private sector forecasters envision growth in 2012 approaching 2.5 percent. In the opinion of many economists, that 2.5 percent approximates the steady-state growth rate of the economy's potential. This rate would certainly be an improvement over 2011 as a whole. The problem is without growth measurably better than 2.5 percent, little progress will be made in absorbing slack in the economy—above all, labor market slack.\n\nCan the economy do much better than 2.5 percent in the coming quarters? There are a number of reasons to be cautious about predicting anything stronger than about 2.5 percent. For one, there is the Reinhart-Rogoff thesis that economies recover very slowly following severe financial crises. There is the prospect of fiscal drag continuing at the state and local level along with the anticipation of sizeable federal government spending cuts. There is the ongoing trend of household deleveraging. And there is the weight of lower house values on consumers' spending. All this gives the economy a fragile feel.\n\nLet me now return to the theme of uncertainty. Many have observed that we are living in a world of \"Knightian uncertainty.\" That's a term named after University of Chicago economist Frank Knight, who examined and distinguished between risk and uncertainty. The world he described is one where the environment is not just risky, but one in which risk is difficult to quantify. In such an environment, circumstances feel unfamiliar and historical precedent provides little guidance. There is, in such circumstances, acute uncertainty about the fundamentals of the economy. This uncertainty compounds the difficulty of estimating the likelihood of outcomes, a task that is challenging in the best of times. I think this idea captures the feel of current circumstances, and may well be a large part of the explanation for the disappointing performance of the current recovery.\n\nGlass half full?\n So, in closing, I would offer the following thought with all appropriate tentativeness and caveats. If the European situation is stabilized and put on a believable resolution path, and if the supercommittee delivers a believable fiscal plan accepted by Congress, these two developments would go a long way toward clearing the air and energizing economic activity.\n\nIn the meantime, I would simply point out that recent economic data are mostly directionally positive and have mostly exceeded expectations. Tom Sargent's quote bears repeating for emphasis: \"What's going to happen is going to depend partly on what you think is going to happen.\" A cautious mindset in the current environment is certainly warranted. But as the numbers over the last couple of months demonstrate, outcomes better than consensus expectations can happen. Let's not talk ourselves into believing that enduring weakness or recession is inevitable.",

            "content": "World Affairs Council of Jacksonville\nJacksonville, Fla.\nSeptember 27, 2011\n\nGood afternoon. Today is September 27. We are about to wrap up the third quarter of what has been, so far, a disappointing year.\n\nWe've had an especially bumpy ride over the last week, with events buffeting the markets and the economy. I'd like to use this opportunity to step back and take stock.\n\nI'm going to give you an overview of the economic situation today, focusing on three indicators of economic performance—growth, labor, and inflation. And I will comment on the risks as I see them.\n\nLast week, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decided to undertake something called a maturity extension program. This policy action has been dubbed Operation Twist by commentators, a reprise of the 1961 strategy originally named after singer Chubby Checker's hit song of the same year, \"The Twist.\" When asked about that last week, Checker summed up the development by saying \"The Twist has always meant money for everybody.\" Chubby must be a monetarist.\n\nWhatever you call the Fed's latest policy, it's meant to put downward pressure on long-term interest rates and help make broader financial conditions more supportive of growth. I'll explain how it will be implemented, and more importantly, what the policy is intended to accomplish for the American consumer and business person. I'll also comment on what we can expect from this policy in terms of overall economic impact.\n\nAs always, my comments are my views only and might not be shared by my colleagues on the FOMC or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nNow let's look at where the economy is today and the outlook.\n\nThe economy today\nOverall, the economy is growing slowly and my outlook is for modest improvement through the remainder of the year and 2012.\n\nMy base case forecast calls for gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the 1 to 2 percent range for this year, moving up to a range of 2 to 3 percent next year. In full disclosure, this forecast is lower than my staff and I projected at the beginning of the summer. Following official revisions to earlier growth estimates and because of weaker-than-expected incoming data more recently, we revised down our growth forecast. Most forecasters have done the same.\n\nThis base case growth forecast assumes some of the forces that have been holding back the recovery will prove transitory. For instance, the effects of negative shocks that held back growth earlier this year—like the earthquake and tsunami in Japan and the rapid rise of oil prices—are dissipating.\n\nAlso, there are some restorative processes at work that should contribute to improved economic performance. For instance, while many households face serious financial problems, overall the financial health of households has been improving over the last two years. At the same time, the banking system is in better condition, and financing constraints for businesses have eased to some extent. My outlook for modest improvement rests on the assumption the economy will not be hit by another major shock such as another large oil price spike or severe financial instability caused by a significant worsening of conditions in Europe. The European debt crisis looms as the biggest threat at the moment, in my opinion.\n\nIn addition to monitoring economic growth indicators, I've been closely following developments in labor markets, which continue to present a complicated and vexing challenge.\n\nIn terms of job creation, we appear to be treading water. Basically, the weak pace of growth in output since the end of the recession has translated to only modest net job creation. Modest gains in the private sector have been partially offset by ongoing losses in the public sector.\n\nAs a result, there has been little progress in bringing down the high rate of unemployment. As of August, official unemployment stood at 9.1 percent, essentially the same level it was at the beginning of the year. The unemployment rate would be even higher if it weren't for the fact that some people are dropping out of the labor market completely.\n\nI think it's most realistic to expect only a gradual improvement in the unemployment rate, consistent with the subdued growth trajectory for output and spending.\n\nAs for inflation, the recent numbers have been higher than desired and higher than expected. The August Consumer Price Index had prices rising at an annualized rate of 4.6 percent. Obviously, a rate of inflation this high would be unacceptable if it were to continue for a long period of time.\n\nI do expect the rate of inflation will fall back over the next few months, which is the assumption in my baseline forecast. Among the causes, the prices of most commodities, including oil, have eased from their recent highs. Further, the painfully high unemployment rate is consistent with considerable slack or excess capacity in the economy, which tends to constrain wage growth. You are familiar with the term wage-price spiral. I don't see any prospect of such a development in the foreseeable future, as long as unemployment remains high, and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored. Measures of longer-term inflation expectations remain within acceptable bounds. These factors should combine to put downward pressure on inflation over the coming months.\n\nTo sum up, in the absence of a shock, I don't see a recurrence of economic contraction. That said, we are in a period of greater risk and uncertainty. The reason I refer to our base case or baseline forecast is because other, more adverse, scenarios are plausible.\n\nPersonal views entering the last FOMC meeting\nI went into last week's FOMC meeting grappling with a complicated picture. I am just one participant in FOMC meetings—I can't speak for others.\n\nAs background, let me remind you that Congress has given the FOMC two mandates—maximum employment and price stability.\n\nI was concerned by not only the persistence of high unemployment but also the complicated internal dynamics of the current labor market. To me, it is not clear to what degree structural factors are impeding the filling of job vacancies. And with some 43 percent of the unemployed out of work for more than six months, it is not clear to what extent the long-term unemployed are becoming a class of permanently unemployed, creating a problem resembling the so-called structural unemployment of some European countries. Further, it is not clear why participation in the labor force continues to fall. Finally, it is not clear what level of unemployment should be considered the natural or equilibrium rate under current circumstances.\n\nI was also concerned by the trend and complexion of inflation data. Inflation has trended higher for a longer period than I expected. That trend is true for both headline and various measures of core inflation (which I use to gauge the broad, underlying trend in prices beyond the month-to-month volatility). Going into last week's FOMC meeting, I had several questions on my mind regarding inflation and prices. For instance, will factors that caused the spurt of inflation early in the year really prove transitory? How long will the pass-through of higher costs continue before businesses lose pricing power in a weak economy? And what accounts for the quite broad-based price movements measured in recent core inflation readings, and what signal should we take from these movements?\n\nI accept the premise that there is no tradeoff in the long run between the two policy objectives expressed in the FOMC's dual mandate. The best environment for achieving and sustaining full employment is one of price stability. However, it's plausible (and again, these are my personal views) that the forces shaping economic performance at the moment create some tension between these two objectives. The formulation of monetary policy currently requires an assumption about whether and how far accommodative policy can push down unemployment as well as an assumption about whether we're dealing with transitory or more persistent price pressures.\n\nThese were my concerns going into the meeting and represented, in my thinking, the context for last week's decision making.\n\nThe FOMC's decision\nAs you are aware, the committee decided to undertake what's called a maturity extension program. Let me explain what that is. Over a period of about nine months the Fed will sell $400 billion of our current holdings of Treasury securities with maturities of three years or less. While we're selling short-maturity Treasuries, we will buy an equal amount of longer-maturity securities—those with maturities of six to 30 years.\n\nThe intent of this program is to put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and help ease financial conditions broadly.\n\nAlso, at the last meeting the FOMC decided to reinvest the principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) into an equal amount of new agency mortgage-backed securities. The word \"agency\" refers to the government backers of mortgage loans, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The move is aimed at supporting mortgage markets and, by extension, the housing sector. Buying for reinvestment should lower the yield of mortgage-backed securities, which in turn should help bring down mortgage rates. In my view, this strategy is designed to work in conjunction with downward pressure on longer-term Treasury rates resulting from the maturity extension program.\n\nWhat \"Operation Twist\" should mean for consumers and businesses\n More generally, the decision to undertake a program of maturity extension is an attempt to achieve a further easing of financial conditions. Let me take a second and spell out what is meant by the somewhat abstract phrase \"easing of financial conditions.\" Essentially, it means lower interest rates—a lower cost of borrowing—across the whole spectrum of loan maturities involved in financing consumer and private sector activity. In the case of maturity extension, it means lower rates for medium- and longer-term maturities. It also means lower spreads between the rates consumers and businesses pay for loans, as well as bonds issued by larger businesses, versus the rate the U.S. Treasury pays for an equivalent period. For the typical American consumer and business, it means borrowing should be cheaper. It means purchases you might finance and pay for in monthly installments should be more affordable. It means, for some people, refinancing your mortgage may make a lot of sense, and the money saved by lowering your mortgage payments can go into your pocket for whatever use. And for a business, it means some investments—for example, in new equipment—may be a little more financially justifiable.\n\nThe Fed's maturity extension program and additional mortgage-backed securities purchases are meant to further ease financial conditions ceteris paribus, other things being equal. Of course, other things almost certainly will not stay equal, and other factors will influence what really happens to rates and spreads as policy intent encounters the real world.\n\nRealistic expectations for these policies\nThese are things that should happen as a result of the FOMC's action of last week. However, a number of commentators have questioned how much positive effect can result because of what is perceived to be the \"impaired transmission mechanism\" through which monetary policy operates at present.\n\nLet me put this in plain English. Monetary policy mostly works through the lowering or raising of interest rates. It can also work through a shift in the composition of financial assets held by the public. An example would be a shift from low-yielding, more secure assets to those that offer a higher potential return but with higher risk. Monetary policy makes this happen by changing the composition of the central bank's own balance sheet.\n\nThose who argue monetary policy transmission is impaired assert that lower interest rates won't stimulate much new activity because many consumers are still deleveraging (that is, paying down debt). As for business, many larger businesses already have lots of cash. Also, banks are keeping a lot of their liquidity on the sidelines. Loan demand is weak in this soft economy, and stricter credit standards mean fewer potential borrowers qualify. There are other reasons cited in support of this view, but you get the idea.\n\nI share the view that the transmission mechanism for monetary policy remains somewhat impaired, and for this reason I am not expecting large gains from the Fed's most recent action. I think it's realistic to expect modest positive impact from this program.\n\nIn my view, the maturity extension program along with the MBS purchases represents a measured, incremental attempt to add more support to the recovery. It's not a fix for everything that ails the economy, but it should help.\n\nMonetary policy actions in total\nIn this vein, I think the recent decisions to adjust the composition of the Fed's securities holdings should be seen as augmenting a total stance of policy intended to promote recovery and facilitate necessary adjustment. In my view, this policy action is not just one more thing tried in a series of stand-alone attempted remedies for the weak economy. Instead, I believe the potential of the latest policy actions should be assessed on a composite basis together with elements of policy already in place, which include previous large-scale asset purchase programs, a conditional commitment to keep the federal funds rate in the 0 to 25 basis point range at least through mid-2013, and maintaining the overall size of the Fed's balance sheet. The power and sufficiency of these efforts should not be evaluated individually but as a cumulative total policy of support and accommodation.\n\nI'll end with this thought—again, my personal view. The decisions of last week's FOMC meeting should be taken neither as signaling further action on the part of the Fed nor conveying that \"we're done.\" The direction of policy going forward will depend on how economic circumstances and the outlook evolve from here.\n\nAs I said earlier, I expect the pace of the recovery to build, albeit modestly, and this will bring a gradual reduction in unemployment. I think disinflationary pressures will cause inflation to moderate to more acceptable levels.\n\n",

            "content": "Greater Lafayette Chamber of Commerce\nLafayette, La.\nAugust 31, 2011\n\nThe country is in the ninth quarter of a disappointing and frustrating recovery. We at the Fed were hopeful of (and many private forecasters envisioned) a modest version of a classic bounce back after a recession. Yet, over the past four quarters for which there are growth measurements, the economy has grown at only a 1.6 percent pace. If the economy's potential for growth is a pace of 2.5 percent, as many economists believe, then slack in our economy is rising even though we are technically in recovery.\n\nThe unimpressive recovery is evident in the U.S. labor market. In July, the national unemployment rate stood at 9.1 percent—a percentage point below its peak, but three-tenths higher than it was last March.\n\nThis sluggishness has been blamed on a variety of temporary and more persistent headwinds. That's the term often used to describe forces that are impeding growth. Since the recession ended and expansion resumed, certain underlying \"structural\" (or more long-term) headwinds have been recognized, but these factors were taken as reasons postrecession growth would clock in at a moderate rate in the range of 3 to 4 percent per annum instead of a much more robust rate typical of a rebound from deep recession.\n\nVery recently—with the incoming data of the last few weeks—awareness of and attention to the deeper long-term impediments to growth have become more acute. There is rising concern the U.S. economy may be facing a longer period of very slow growth because of more intractable structural forces in play. These deeper impediments to growth imply structural adjustments in the economy that may take years to accomplish before the economy achieves full and well-balanced health.\n\nIn my view, there are three likely protracted and interconnected adjustment processes of significance. They are 1) deleveraging (that is, the reduction of total debt levels in our economy), 2) fiscal adjustment, and 3) financial system repair. In addition, the accumulating pressure of an aging population will affect labor force participation and output potential.\n\nIn my remarks today, I want to focus particularly on the first of these—deleveraging, the process of debt reduction by households and businesses. I will review how this process of deleveraging has affected the economic recovery to date. I will offer a forecast for the remainder of 2011 and 2012. And I will share my views on the role of monetary policy in the context of growing concern that we're facing the prospect of a long period of slow growth.\n\nAs always, these are my personal views and may not be shared by my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nBefore I get into a discussion of the outlook in light of the ongoing process of deleveraging, let me pose what I think is a key economic outlook question, and that is how well can we expect the economy to perform (we can call this cyclical performance) while these profound structural currents run their course?\n\nSo now let me review the state of the economy at this juncture and the near-term outlook.\n\nEconomic outlook\nTo repeat, after a severe financial crisis and a recession, the economy began to grow again two years ago. The recovery has been uneven. Initially, growth came back strongly, boosted by inventory rebuilding and strengthening private sector activity. Last summer, however, the recovery started to weaken and has slowed markedly this year. Temporary factors, such as spiking commodity prices and supply chain disruptions related to Japan's natural disaster, held back economic activity earlier this year. But the slowdown cannot be explained by those factors alone. Over the past few quarters, the recovery has lost dynamism, and downside risks to growth have risen notably.\n\nConsumer spending, which accounts for approximately 70 percent of total demand, grew very modestly in the first half of the year. Higher cost of living and the weak labor market are likely to have discouraged consumers from increasing expenditures. The consumer spending numbers for July were a bit higher than expectations, but still not at a level that would make for a robust recovery.\n\nThe depressed state of the housing market has also discouraged consumption. The stream of foreclosures is contributing to a high inventory of homes for sale and keeping downward pressure on home prices.\n\nSlow improvement in the labor market has been particularly disappointing. Job growth remains too low to bring down the unemployment rate, which remains above 9 percent. People in all age groups continue to leave the labor force, and the employment-to-population ratio is now at its lowest level in over 25 years.\n\nIn response to a slew of weaker-than-anticipated data, most forecasters, including the Atlanta Fed, have revised down gross domestic product (GDP) projections for this year and next.\n\nAlthough the overall picture has worsened, there remain pockets of strength in the economy. Business investment is growing, in part supported by low financing costs. Export growth also remains solid as economic expansion continues in our major trading partners.\n\nPositive news is coming from the oil and gas industry, especially here in Louisiana. Business contacts in the region have been reporting an influx of fabrication work and backlogs in orders for pipelines, supply boats, and drilling equipment. In Lafayette, employment in the energy sector has increased, providing a big boost to the local economy.\n\nOn a national level, the negative effects of the unusual forces that restrained the economy in the first half of this year have diminished. For example, auto production that was disrupted by shortages of supply parts from Japan has bounced back. Also, inflationary pressures seem to be in check as prices of many commodities have come off their peaks.\n\nWhile the risks have increased, I do not expect a recession. In my view, there is sufficient fundamental strength in the economy for a modest cyclical recovery to proceed while the process of necessary structural adjustments moves along. I believe the unemployment rate will come down very gradually over time.\n\nNow I am going to talk about one of the major structural adjustments that is holding back the recovery—deleveraging. Deleveraging is a process of reducing the debt burden of a household, a business, or a government. It has proved to be a potent force that has reduced the economy's ability to heal quickly after the last financial crisis and the ensuing recession.\n\nBackground on deleveraging\nDebt is not in and of itself a bad thing. Debt supports economic growth by allowing households, businesses, and governments to smooth their spending and investment over time. Borrowing and lending can help facilitate the allocation of capital to productive uses in the economy. But high debt levels can also result in lower economic growth, a point that Stephen Cecchetti, of the Bank for International Settlements, made in a paper presented at the Kansas City Fed's symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo., last week.\n\nRelative to the size of the U.S. economy measured in terms of GDP, the total domestic debt of nonfinancial sectors of the economy reached 248 percent in 2009, increasing by almost 75 percentage points over the previous decade alone.\n\nSo let's take stock of how we got to this point. Much of the growth in debt over the last decade was in the form of real estate debt of households. During the 1990s the amount of outstanding mortgage debt of households was relatively stable at around 45 percent of GDP, but from 2000 to 2007 household mortgage debt increased to almost 75 percent of GDP.\n\nAs long as home prices were rising, the increasing debt burden of households was not particularly problematic. But the level of household debt turned into a drag on the economy once home values began to drop. According to the Case-Shiller price index, home values have declined by over 30 percent since their peak in 2006.\n\nDeleveraging across sectors\nDeclining home values along with rising unemployment set in motion a process of deleveraging by the household sector. Household deleveraging has occurred mostly through a combination of increased savings, debt repayment, and also debt forgiveness. At the same time, there has generally been less access to credit for households as a result of stricter underwriting standards. The inability to qualify for home equity loans and other forms of credit has slowed the pace at which new debt is taken on by households replacing paid-down debt. The effect is to reduce their debt burden over time. From its peak in 2009, total household debt has declined to around 90 percent of GDP (the lowest level since 2005), and the household savings rate has risen to about 5 percent.\n\nDebt in the nonfinancial business sector also increased over the last decade, reaching an historical high of 79 percent of GDP in 2009. By the first quarter of 2011 nonfinancial business debt had declined to about 73 percent of GDP. To give you a point of reference, nonfinancial business sector debt becomes a drag on economic growth after it increases to above 90 percent of GDP, according to Stephen Cecchetti's estimates.\n\nIn contrast to reductions in debt by households and businesses, government debt has surged, increasing from about 50 percent of GDP prior to the recession to around 80 percent in the first quarter of this year.\n\nDeleveraging going forward\nFor the economy as a whole, debt relative to GDP has barely changed.\n\nWhile the private sector—households and businesses—has made notable progress in lowering its debt burden, discussions of how to reduce public debt have only just begun. The government still needs to introduce major policy changes to put public debt on a sustainable path. Demographic trends, which I referenced earlier, will make public debt reduction even more challenging.\n\nIt is necessary that the process of deleveraging plays itself out, which may take several more years. When economies are deleveraging they cannot grow as rapidly as they might otherwise. It is obvious that as consumers reduce spending they divert more of their incomes to paying off debt. This shift in consumer behavior increases the amount of capital available for financing investment. But higher rates of business investment are not likely to fully offset weakness in consumer spending for some time, as businesses continue to grapple with uncertainties about the future.\n\nAs I said, rebalancing simply takes time. A 2010 report by McKinsey surveyed 32 international periods of deleveraging following financial crises and found that, on average, the duration of these episodes was about six and a half years. U.S. debt to GDP peaked in the first quarter of 2009. By that standard we are much closer to the beginning than the end of our deleveraging process.\n\nRole of monetary policy\nTo my mind, it's becoming increasingly clear the challenge we policymakers face is balancing appropriate policy responses for the near to medium term with what's needed for the longer term. In other words, we must continue to help the economy achieve a healthy enough cyclical recovery, especially with unemployment high and consumer spending lackluster. At the same time, we must recognize the longer-term need for directionally opposite structural adjustments, including deleveraging.\n\nTo support the recovery, low interest rates and ample liquidity help to encourage spending by consumers and businesses. Because this is an aim of policy in the near term, Fed economists, like those in the private sector, watch with intense interest the monthly data on consumption and surveys of consumer confidence. But at the same time, there's broad acknowledgement that policy must support the long-term rebalancing required to sustain our economic health. Finding the right path through these seemingly conflicting pressures is challenging.\n\nThe situation brings to mind a quotation from F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1936 article titled \"The Crack Up.\" He said \"the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function.\" In a way, that's the test we policymakers must step up to in balancing short- and longer-term needs.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, I would characterize the stance of monetary policy at this time as accommodative. As you know, the FOMC stated after its last meeting the intention to keep the policy rate at near zero for two more years. Also, the current policy is to maintain the Fed's balance sheet scale for the foreseeable future. I support this position.\n\nGiven the weak data we've seen recently and considering the rising concern about chronic slow growth or worse, I don't think any policy option can be ruled out at the moment. However, it is important that monetary policy not be seen as a panacea. The kinds of structural adjustments I've been discussing today take time, and I am acutely aware that pushing beyond what monetary policy can plausibly deliver runs the risk of creating new distortions and imbalances.\n\nWe may find, as economic circumstances evolve, that policy adjustments are required. In more adverse scenarios, further policy accommodation might be called for. But as of today, I am comfortable with the current stance of policy, especially considering the tensions policy must navigate between the short and long term and between recovery and the need for longer-term structural adjustments.",

            "content": "Rotary Club of Florence and the Greater Shoals/Sheffield Rotary Club\nFlorence, Ala.\nAugust 15, 2011\n\nI appreciate the opportunity to speak with you, and I want to thank former Atlanta Fed director Simpson Russell for inviting me. Business leaders in northwest Alabama, like Simpson, have a long tradition of public service on the Atlanta Fed's head office and branch boards of directors. I also want to thank Macke Mauldin, who is currently a director at the Atlanta Fed's Birmingham Branch, as well as former Birmingham Branch and Atlanta Fed Board Chair Larkin Martin. And while I'm recognizing people, I want to make sure that you all meet Lesley McClure, the Atlanta Fed's new regional executive for Alabama, who is based in Birmingham.\n\nThe views about on-the-ground business conditions from directors and other contacts, including Lesley's contacts, provide particularly important insights during periods of economic uncertainty. And that's where we find ourselves today.\n\nRecent developments have been troubling and confusing. I imagine you have a lot of questions.\n\nSo, in my talk today I will survey the current situation as I see it and try to paint a coherent picture of reality. I'll do that by structuring my remarks as a sequence of top-of-mind questions that are most pertinent to current economic circumstances and the outlook from today. After my formal remarks, I will welcome your further questions.\n\nIn my view, the top questions of the day are these:\n One: What's causing the current financial market volatility?\n Two: What does this financial market volatility mean for the real economy?\n Three: What's the outlook? Is there a risk of recession? Is there inflation risk?\n Four: Is current Fed policy appropriate for the circumstances? In this vein, I know that many people have questions about the rationale for last Tuesday's statement that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) anticipates keeping the policy rate at current levels until mid-2013.\n Five: What are the Fed's policy options if more action is needed? Put another way, is the Fed out of bullets?\n\nAs always, I'm presenting my personal views. These views may not be shared by my colleagues on the FOMC or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nFinancial market volatility \n So, to the first question—what's behind the recent financial market volatility?\n\nIn recent weeks, we've seen a lot of volatility principally in the equity markets with spillover into some debt markets.\n\nAs evidence of this volatility, the VIX—an option index based on the volatility of the S&P 500 and sometimes called the \"fear index\"—has more than doubled since the end of July and is at the highest level seen since early 2009. At the same time, long-term Treasury yields have fallen sharply, despite the S&P downgrade of U.S. Treasuries.\n\nI believe the root causes of this volatility are the increasing recognition of an economic slowdown in the United  States and Europe, a generalized reaction to the downgrade of the United  States' credit rating, and concerns about European sovereign debt, particularly Italy's, and market concern about a downgrade of France's debt rating.\n\nThere has been escalating concern about the condition of specific banks in Europe that have high exposure to Italy and other peripheral countries.\n\nAs a result, markets globally have been exceptionally jittery and share prices have been swinging on each piece of news and each day's developments in both Europe and the U.S. economy.\n\nThe real economy\n It's natural then to ask what does this financial market volatility mean for the real economy—for Main Street?\n\nIn spite of the equity market volatility, it's hard to say that overall financial conditions have tightened for Main  Street. The cost of credit remains low, and bankers tell me they are very eager to lend.\n\nThere is no lack of liquidity in the banking system. There has been, however, some stress in the money market mutual fund world, mostly before the debt ceiling was raised. This stress was related to uncertainty regarding defaults on Treasury securities.\n\nWe have seen longer-term Treasury rates decline in recent days because there are very large capital flows in and out of risky assets. Money managers are shifting between \"risk on\" and \"risk off\" positions.\n\nWhen the impulse is to take risk off, there is nowhere to go as deep and liquid as the U.S. Treasury securities market. Flows into Treasuries have pushed longer-term rates to very low levels, closing at 2.24 percent for the 10-year Treasury last Friday. Ironically, the safe asset when you want to take risk off is U.S. Treasury securities, which were just downgraded (but still AA+, of course).\n\nBank stocks have been especially hard hit by the equity sell-off. The hit to bank stocks appears to be caused more by concerns raised by the general economic slowdown and matters specific to individual banks as opposed to concerns about funding more generally. We have not seen a renewal of solvency concerns here in the United States.\n\nCredit is a principal channel by which economic shocks are propagated through the real economy. (Also, credit is the principal channel through which Fed policy is transmitted to the real economy.) If, as I suggested, recent market volatility has not impaired the credit channel, what is the risk that it could still do so or that it could damage the economy through other means?\n\nI'm most concerned about the effect of the wild stock market on consumer spending. Volatility alone could have a negative impact on consumer psychology at a time of already weakening spending. Last Friday, it was reported that the University of Michigan's Survey of Consumer Sentiment fell sharply in early August to its lowest level in more than 30 years. Furthermore, if the loss of stock market value persists, the effect from the loss of investment value could combine with the loss of value in home prices to discourage consumers more and longer.\n\nThe outlook for the economy and inflation\n It's been an eventful two weeks, to say the least. Let's now look ahead. The $64,000 question is what's the outlook from here? Is there a risk of recession? And, what about inflation risk?\n\nWhether we're seeing a temporary soft patch in an otherwise gradually improving growth picture or a deeper and more persistent slowdown, most of the arriving economic data lately have caused forecasters to write down their projections. Also, and importantly, the Bureau of Economic Analysis in the Department of Commerce has revised earlier economic growth numbers. These revisions paint a different picture of the depth of the recession and the relative strength of the recovery.\n\nAt the Atlanta Fed, we have revised down our near and intermediate gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecast, but we are holding to the view that the economy will continue to grow at a very modest pace. In other words, we do not expect the onset of outright contraction—a recession—but I have to say the risk of recession is higher than we perceived a month or two ago.\n\nAs I look ahead, I continue to expect positive effects as the unusual forces that restrained the economy in the first half of this year peter out. Some of these will be in auto manufacturing and assembly, which should rebound as the supply chain disruptions caused by the Japanese earthquake and tsunami are eliminated.\n\nAdd to that business investment in equipment and software, which should continue to be relatively strong even if business people have pulled back investing to some degree because of greater uncertainty.\n\nAlso, the U.S. energy sector is active again. Demand for coal is high, firms are investing and hiring to explore and develop shale gas, and demand for alternative energy sources is strong.\n\nTourism has been very strong this summer. Hotel and cruise bookings and attendance at theme parks and resort venues have been very good.\n\nThese are just four examples. A somewhat darker outlook has intruded on the consciousness of the market and the public in recent days. But, as I said, I believe there are identifiable sectoral sources of strength that will serve to counter forces of weakness in the second half of this year and into 2012.\n\nThat said, it stands to reason that at a lower growth rate, the economy is closer to the threshold of contraction. As growth expectations have been revised down, economists have evoked the image of \"stall speed.\" Indeed, economic history suggests that the probability of recession increases markedly at GDP growth rates below 2 percent.\n\nEconomic stall speed is a metaphorical description. The basic idea is that there may be a growth rate that is too slow to be sustainable. If, for example, the economy does not grow at least at the rate of its potential, the rising amount of unused resources will eventually destabilize the economy.\n\nOf course, metaphors to describe economic phenomena should be employed with care. The idea of stall speed is based more on a statistical regularity than on a deep theory explaining why slow growth is likely to foreshadow a downturn. Slow growth doesn't lock in a recession. In fact, some recent data we have on hand—retail sales and initial unemployment claims, for example—seem to contradict the direst predictions.\n\nLet me comment on prices. I am comfortable that inflation is following the pattern that we at the Atlanta Fed envisioned earlier in the year during the period of rapidly rising commodity prices. We expected that the inflationary pressures would subside as the year progressed, and this seems to be occurring.\n\nAt present, growth appears to be a bigger problem than inflation. With only modest growth, gaining ground on the unemployment problem is challenging. Private sector job creation, while positive, remains anemic at a time of shrinking public sector employment. In July, the U.S. economy added 117,000 jobs after adding only 46,000 jobs in June. While job growth is positive, it has only been strong enough to nudge down the unemployment rate a bit to a still quite elevated 9.1 percent.\n\nComplicating the employment picture is the trend in labor force participation. Labor force participation has fallen more than two percentage points since the onset of the recession—an unprecedented exit of workers from the labor market. This trend is continuing and is difficult to explain.\n\nOne plausible explanation is that idled workers are dropping out after long-term unemployment. The average unemployed worker has been jobless for almost 10 months, and a large share of unemployed workers have been out of work for an exceptionally long period of time. The longer that workers are idle, the more difficult it is for them to assimilate back into the economy. But this is still conjecture. The labor force participation question is representative of many open questions related to the job market and employment.\n\nFed policy\n So let me now turn to the policy implications of the picture I've painted.\n\nMonetary policy needs to be very supportive of growth as the recovery seeks to regain its footing. Conditional on stable inflation expectations, I believe maintaining the current low interest rate environment is the right posture for the time being.\n\nAt our meeting last week, the FOMC indicated that, given current projections for GDP growth, employment, and inflation, the 0 to 25 basis points range for the federal funds rate will likely be in place through mid-2013. (The federal funds rate is the target interest rate set by the FOMC that banks charge each other to hold reserves. It also is the policy rate that influences the level of interest rates across the maturity spectrum.) Every FOMC participant speaks for himself or herself, but in my view this guidance is based on a particular view of future economic conditions. Should those conditions materially change, the timing of any policy decisions would have to change accordingly.\n\nThe FOMC has not been explicit about the likely timing of changes in the size of the Federal Reserve's now-large balance sheet. But it makes sense to me that policies related to the overall size and composition of assets on the balance sheet should align with explicit rate policies.\n\nNot every economic problem we face has a monetary policy fix. That is the reason I have said repeatedly that the hurdle to justify additional monetary policy stimulus should be high. But the events of the last several weeks are a reminder that circumstances can quickly arise that may call for additional monetary actions.\n\nPolicy options\n If additional actions are required, I can assure you the Federal Reserve is not out of bullets. If the anemic growth in the first half of this year is a soft patch in an ongoing, moderately paced recovery, additional monetary stimulus is probably of limited marginal value. But saying this is not the same thing as saying that monetary policy would be ineffective if conditions deteriorate. Expansion of the balance sheet or changes in the composition of the Fed's asset portfolio are available, in my view. These could be quite effective, particularly if done in sufficient size, in the event that the economy retreats back into contractionary territory.\n\nIt should also be emphasized that the Federal Reserve, as the central bank, has ample tools to deal with any reemergence of acute financial or liquidity strains in dollar funding markets here and abroad. Given the interconnectedness of global markets, it is in the best interest of the U.S. economy to quell liquidity strains in dollar markets when they arise.\n\nI'm currently cautious about further monetary action. As I see it, we do not yet have enough information to conclude the economy won't resume a healthier pace of growth. I still maintain that a resumption of growth is the most likely case. But if that assessment proves to be wrong, I believe we do have tools to address whatever circumstances arise.\n\nDon't jump to conclusions\n As recently as two weeks ago, there was a widely held view that the U.S. economy was in a soft patch with a good chance of turning up in the second half of 2011. The rapid-fire developments of the last several days, along with some troubling data releases, have shaken confidence. People are worried. Investors, Main Street businessmen and women, and consumers are wondering which way things will tip. The public—and for that matter, policymakers—are operating in a fog of uncertainty that is thicker than normal.\n\nMy final point is a simple one. At this juncture, we should not jump to conclusions. A clearer picture of economic reality will be revealed in time as immediate uncertainties dissipate. It's premature, in my view, to declare these important questions relating to our economic future settled.\n\nThank you very much. I would now be happy to take your further questions and comments.",

            "content": "University of Georgia Summer Commencement Ceremony\nAthens, Georgia\nAugust 6, 2011\n\nThank you for the honor of addressing the summer graduating class of the University of Georgia on this special day. My words are for you soon-to-be graduates.\n\nI have no illusions. Most of you can't wait for me to finish. You are eager, I know, to bask in the praise and pride of your families and friends here today, and deservedly so.\n\nI'm sure, too, that many of you can't wait for my remarks to end so you can receive your diploma and then summon the words to thank your parents, siblings, and all who supported you and share in your achievement.\n\nI also have no illusions about how long you will remember my remarks here today. It is the fate of graduation speakers that what we have to say is remembered maybe for a few days, normally more like a few hours.\n\nOver the years I figure I've attended 30 to 40 graduations. And from all those occasions I remember really only one graduation speech. That speech was delivered by a student at a New England college maybe 10 years ago. Yes, a student, no less. What do they know?\n\nLearning from NASCAR\nThe young man who spoke for his class that day said the most important thing he'd learned while at college was not at the college itself, but while attending NASCAR races down South during his college's dead week.\n\nHe explained that after each NASCAR race the winning driver is interviewed and he (or Danica Patrick, maybe, though she wasn't racing back then) invariably launches into technical mumbo-jumbo about his car. He comments on how loose or tight his car was during the race, wheel camber, carburetor intake, and the like. He talks about what his pit crew did. He talks about other cars by number (\"number 16 made his move in lap 32\"). And all this is delivered—usually—at a fast clip in a deep Southern accent that is hard for a New England college student to understand.\n\nThe young graduation speaker said he had learned one very important lesson from NASCAR drivers. And, that is, always speak so others understand.\n\nThat's what I'm going to try to do today.\n\nYou can relax. I'm not going to talk about the economy. (This is meant to be a happy occasion, after all.) Instead I'll offer just a few words of advice.\n\nI've observed over my career that there is a tendency to speak fast and use big words in the early years. This is to prove that you're smart. Then, in the second half of your career, you learn to speak slowly using simple words hoping that everyone thinks you're wise. I hope you'll think what you hear today imparts some hard-earned wisdom.\n\nThree pieces of advice\nI can't think of anything more suitable to say to you than what I said to my daughter—my only child—when she finished her education and set out in life.\n\nFirst, I said your life is a canvas. Paint your own unique self-portrait. Don't follow crowds or fashion in your life journey. Don't do what everyone else does. I encouraged her to take some risks. Venture into unknown territory. And, above all, live an interesting life.\n\nSometimes your richest experiences will be associated with difficult circumstances and trying times. In my case, I was evacuated from Lebanon during the civil war, left Iran and came to Atlanta during the Iranian revolution, was in New York on 9/11, and joined the Federal Reserve in 2007 only to usher in the worst financial crisis and deepest recession in the last 50 years. I've lived my own advice—an interesting life.\n\nSecond, I said to her…stay true to your own dreams and passions. This is hard. Life will try to make you compromise your dreams and passions. Life will present daunting obstacles, agonizing trade-offs, and tempting diversions.\n\nAnd certainly your goals and dreams will morph, to some extent, as you move through life. Some dreams may have to adjust to changes in the world, but don't let sober reality empty your tank of aspiration, ambition, idealism, and purpose. I am sure inside each of you quietly reside some lifelong goals of what you want to achieve and how you want to live your life. Don't abandon these.\n\nThird, I urged on her an attitude toward work, an approach to every job she would hold, and that is…improve what you touch.\n\nSome years ago I was a professor at Georgetown University. Teaching was on my lifetime bucket list, and I was lucky enough to get my chance. I taught in a graduate program where the students were quite good, and thought quite a lot of themselves. To say the least, they had high expectations of the work they would do in their first jobs and over their careers.\n\nSome of these students were quick to dismiss a particular job opportunity as below them, or worse, boring. I felt I had to offer this observation: there are no boring jobs if you set out to improve whatever you touch.\n\nI have found it inspiring over the years—even in the early years of my career—to think in terms of my legacy in each job and organization. I tried at the outset of each experience to imagine what I would leave behind when it was over. I believe that even within the rules and procedures of an organization, or the explicit directions of a boss, there is scope for setting your own agenda to put your own imprint on the work.\n\nIn time most of you will have the great privilege of doing important work. Your work will give meaning to your life and be a big part of your identity. Respect your work. It is one of life's blessings.\n\nThat's all I have to say today. It's my ardent hope that when you are out there fighting life's battles, in some moment of frustration, exasperation, or—God forbid—even desperation, you'll remember that guy from the Fed who spoke at your college graduation and said these things.\n\nBe your own unique self.\n\nStay true to your dreams.\n\nImprove whatever you touch.",

            "content": "Third Annual Rocky Mountain Economic Summit\nJackson Hole, Wyo.\nJuly 29, 2011\n\nSome data for the first half of the year have once again raised questions about the strength and durability of the economic recovery. The lack of recent progress in bringing down unemployment has provoked a debate in economic circles about the extent of structural factors holding back hiring. The measured economic weakness combined with falling confidence and heightened uncertainty is feeding concern about the deeper character of the country's economic problems. Just what is the nature of this economic situation we are dealing with?\n\nToday I want to share some necessarily tentative thoughts about this question. At the moment, I'm in wait-and-see mode. I'm not ready to make a call, but I will outline the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank's diagnosis of the situation, how we are framing the question I just posed, and implications for monetary policy.\n\nAs always, I will be discussing my personal views. They may not be shared by my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nRecent economic performance\nTo repeat, incoming data on the economy have been disappointing, on balance, relative to expectations.\n\nThe expectation at the beginning of the year was for carryover of the relatively solid fourth quarter into 2011. This expectation was undermined to some extent by weather events, the spike in gasoline prices, and the effects of the Japanese tsunami.\n\nAt the end of the first quarter, the expectation was that the effects of the one-off factors I just mentioned would be transitory and that a stepped-up improvement in the economy would begin in the second quarter.\n\nThe advance estimate of the second quarter gross domestic product (GDP) growth released this morning was much lower than the consensus view among economists just three months ago. (GDP growth was substantially revised down for the first quarter of this year as well.) Weaker than previously expected growth in the second quarter has caused a significant write-down of the full year GDP growth estimate by most forecasters. Overall, it appears that the economy is experiencing a pretty broad-based slowdown. In spite of this, corporate profits and cash accumulation remain strong because corporations have positioned themselves to perform well in a weak or even mildly weakening environment.\n\nIndicators of inflation began to reflate last fall, evidenced mostly by a sharp rise in commodity prices, including oil. However, a firming of price pressures more generally was fairly evident.\n\nThe period of elevated inflation has lasted longer than expected even with the retreat of some key commodity prices, especially oil. There were hints of easing price pressure in the June headline consumer price report. But the broadening of the phenomenon of rising prices within a number of inflation measures suggests an ongoing pass-through of commodity and import costs as well as a more receptive general environment for price increases.\n\nThat said, inflation expectations seem to support the proposition of temporary price pressures. Short-term inflation expectations are significantly higher than they were a few months ago, but longer-term expectations appear to remain well-anchored.\n\nThe level of unemployment has been stuck around 9 percent or a little higher for the first half of the year. Notwithstanding three months of encouraging job creation numbers from February through April, the overall labor market situation has been static. The most recent employment report reflecting June's data has triggered some amount of angst regarding the true nature of the economy we're dealing with.\n\nEmerging debate—what kind of recovery are we in? \nMy staff and I have recently been pondering the following questions: Are we experiencing a temporary slowdown—a soft patch—on a recovery path that should return to a rate of 3 to 4 percent GDP growth? Or, instead, are we dealing with an inherently slower pace of economic growth that, because of some combination of persistent economic headwinds and deeper structural adjustment requirements, has the potential to be of much longer duration and more intractable?\n\nI detect an emerging debate on this basic question among close observers of the economy.\n\nIn thinking about this question, our Reserve Bank has used the long-term trend rate of growth as a point of reference. Our estimate of the long-run trend rate of growth—also called the long-term sustainable rate of growth—is 2.5 percent. This is essentially the central tendency of the FOMC's longer-term growth projection.\n\nThe debate isn't so much about this trend, but about whether the economy will approach it from above, after some quarters of faster growth, or below, with a much slower recovery. The former means we make up for lost ground in the foreseeable future; the latter means we don't. Which world are we in?\n\nApproaching trend growth from above is a more mainstream perspective. The economy by almost every metric has significant slack that would ordinarily be absorbed. Consequently, a traditional economic forecast would build in a period of growth above trend following a recession so as to eventually take the slack out of the economic system.\n\nWhen I say \"traditional forecast\" I am referencing the historical experience of some quarters of above-trend growth after recessions. It's a fair generalization to say that in the decades after the Second World War, recessions have regularly been followed by periods of above potential growth in GDP. The implication is that resource slack was eliminated during the course of every postwar expansion, though the length of time required to accomplish this has varied across business cycles.\n\nApproaching the trend rate from below is something quite different. Converging to the trend rate from quarterly or annual GDP growth rates under 2.5 percent could amount to a very long fight against economic problems and imbalances.\n\nAnd growing only at the trend rate during a recovery may very well prevent reemploying and redeploying the resources that were idled over the course of the recession.\n\nTo elaborate, based on historical experience, an economy growing in the neighborhood of 2.5 percent would tend to be associated with net new jobs growth of a little less than 100,000 per month. In our current circumstances, this will likely not be enough to produce a meaningful decline in the rate of unemployment. This shirt-sleeve computation makes clear what can be at stake—a recovery that approaches potential from below hints at substantial and persistent misallocation of national resources, notably labor resources.\n\nCase for the \"from below\" thesis\nWhile at present I do not see much risk of another outright recession, I don't think we can dismiss the possibility that we're in a persistent slow-growth recovery, with all the challenges this presents.\n\nHere's the case for this viewpoint: first, economies are very slow to recover after a recession caused by a severe financial shock. This is the thesis put forward by Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff in their work on recoveries following financial crises.\n\nMore generally, this view holds that we're dealing with problems that are more structural in character than cyclical. Foremost among these hindrances, in my view, is the need for fundamental fiscal rebalancing that will take several years. Also included is a banking and financial system that, although much healthier, still must go through a lot of structural change in the way of consolidation, adaptation to intensified regulation, and adjustment of business models. Another hindrance, the removal of which will take time, is the depressed state of the housing market, including house values. Improvement of the housing sector is likely to involve reform of national housing policy, a political issue that may not be addressed in the near term.\n\nRelated to house values is the shock incurred by households and the likelihood of continuing deleveraging, perhaps for quite a long time, with the weakness this suggests for consumer activity.\n\nFinally, this view holds that there are real structural aspects of the high unemployment we're experiencing.\n\nArgument for the \"from above\" thesis\nThe more mainstream view of the world we're in is that of a temporary slowdown to be followed by above trend growth. This view is based on the argument that there have been some very unusual developments in the first half of the year that either won't reoccur or that have generated the adjustments necessary to weaken their effect going forward. Key among these one-time shocks is the rise in oil prices and gasoline resulting from the loss of Libyan production and the higher risk premium tied to the potential for supply interruption in the Middle East. Another shock was the greater-than-initially-anticipated supply chain disruption caused by the Japanese earthquake and tsunami. A third factor contributing to a slowdown is the uncertainty associated with the debt ceiling in the United States and the debt crisis in Europe.\n\nIn this view, the assumption is that the effects of these one-off developments will be short-lived.\n\nThere are also a number of strong positive forces that should continue adding to the strength of the recovery. For example, exports and business investment in equipment and software are likely to remain major contributors to growth. Economic expansion in our major trading partners remains relatively strong. U.S. exporters should benefit from sustained foreign demand. Nearly half of U.S. exports are sold in emerging markets, which are expected to continue outperforming advanced economies. Meanwhile, low borrowing costs, ample cash, and continued search for efficiency gains are likely to support business investment.\n\nAs temporary negative influences recede and positive forces gather strength, the all-important factor of confidence should build, with the result that consumer spending strengthens and joblessness declines.\n\nSo there you have two views of the economic world we're in. I realize the real world isn't this binary, but my staff and I have found the \"from below versus from above\" thought process a useful device.\n\nMy base case forecast is consistent with this latter view of the recovery. I am expecting greater strength in the second half of 2011 and into 2012, accompanied by inflation numbers that converge to around 2 percent. But, as I said, I don't dismiss the possibility that we're in the alternative, more problematic world I described of low and slow growth improving only very gradually. At this juncture, I think we have to wait and see what the incoming data indicate.\n\nDecision framework\nAn obvious question is, what evidence would push me to switch to the \"from below\" narrative?\n\nI don't believe conclusive evidence will come together in the very near term. It's entirely possible the headwinds that affected the first half of 2011 will exert a drag on the economy further into the year. Such an outcome could still be consistent with the more optimistic characterization of the economy even if the timing of an eventual resumption of above trend growth is off. It's also entirely possible that ambiguity will persist for some time.\n\nBut to try to put some time limit on indecision, I think a continuing flow of weak numbers through the third quarter and into the fourth will call for a serious reconsideration of the situation. The weight of cumulative data could point to a different order of problem—that is, different than just a passing slowdown—if indicators show continued weakness much past year's end.\n\nIt also needs to be said that the relatively optimistic base case forecast has been conditioned on the assumption of no new shock effects—that is to say, there will not be another oil price shock, the European debt situation will be contained, and we will get to the other side of the U.S. debt limit matter without serious downside developments.\n\nPolicy implications of the two diagnoses\nIf we're in a temporary slow period of a recovery that will shortly return to faster growth, as my base case forecast suggests, I would favor a stance of monetary policy that maintains current policy accommodation at least until it's clear the labor market is improving again and growth indicators show sustained improvement. This assumes well-behaved inflation, of course.\n\nI think patience with the current policy is appropriate for this forecast even if the ramp-up in growth takes somewhat longer than expected.\n\nThough this baseline forecast could call for keeping the current highly accommodative policy in place for some time, on balance I think steps toward normalization of policy are more likely than additional steps in the direction of easing.\n\nIf, however, I come to conclude that we're in a world that portends a long period of very weak growth, high unemployment, and painful structural adjustment, the much-anticipated policy normalization may have to be rethought. The FOMC, in my view, may have to define a supportive policy stance that will be held in place for quite a long period while letting what are essentially nonmonetary policy fixes do their work. Among the nonmonetary fixes are policies to address labor market gaps and fiscal rebalancing implemented over a number of years.\n\nIf the more optimistic forecast I've outlined comes true, I expect conditions to develop that will support an argument in favor of policy normalization certainly by the end of 2012. If, however, we're facing prospects of long and persistent weakness, I favor keeping all options open.\n\nStill expect strong second half\nI am not yet ready to shift away from the more optimistic outlook I presented. I feel it's premature to abandon the expectation of a stronger second half that will bring renewed gradual progress on unemployment and a leveling out of inflation pressures. I'm not resigned to the view that we are dealing with economic problems that are more persistent and intractable than I thought.\n\nI support a wait-and-see approach because, at the moment, we cannot tell with enough certainty whether the economy is likely to approach its long-term trend rate of growth from above or below. I need some more time before making that call.\n\n",

            "content": "Charlotte Economics Club\n Charlotte, N.C.\n June 7, 2011\n\nI have to express some frustration with this economy. Like you, I'm sure, I've wanted the recovery to come along steadily and decisively. Instead we've gotten inconsistency, hesitancy, unevenness. A word I've used recently is halting.\n\nToday I want to talk with you about the current economic situation and outlook and the right monetary policy mix for the situation we're facing. And I will put my support behind a further communications enhancement that I think could help assure that the recovery continues. I'm going to call for an explicitly declared inflation target.\n\nBut first, let me say I'm honored to be here in Charlotte today speaking to such a well-informed audience. I first came to Charlotte in the late 1970s. The city was then a regional banking center and one of the southern hubs of the textile industry. Had someone in those days hit me with the prediction that Charlotte would become one of the nation's top two or three banking centers, I would have been a bit dubious. Indeed, that's what has happened. You are proud, I'm sure, of Charlotte's exceptional standing among the country's business capitals, and rightfully so.\n\nI don't need to tell you the Federal Reserve is on the ground here in Charlotte. Fed offices around the country are putting increasing emphasis on economic intelligence from the trenches. In my Fed district, we have feet on the ground in six cities. I know the Charlotte Branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond makes use of contacts in this city—including many of you in this room. In that regard, I want to acknowledge Charlotte Regional Executive Matt Martin, who is a member of this club.\n\nFinally, by way of preliminary comments, let me emphasize today's remarks are my personal views. They may not be shared by Matt and his boss, Jeff Lacker in Richmond, or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or within the Federal Reserve system overall.\n\nA quick review of two years of recovery\n The recovery is now about two years old. It's a good time to take stock and review how the economic story since the summer of 2009 has unfolded. Rather than cite all the statistics, I'll just characterize the strength and direction of three broad aspects—growth, unemployment (with it, job creation), and inflation.\n\nThe growth story began pretty strong in the last two quarters of 2009. The strength carried over into early 2010. The economy slumped in the middle quarters of last year, but then picked up in the final quarter. The first quarter of this year was a disappointment. The expectations of most economists that the solid year-end rate of growth would carry over and build in 2011 have not materialized. As this year's data have been reported, private forecasters have steadily revised down their 2011 growth predictions.\n\nA few months after the recovery officially began in the summer of 2009, unemployment peaked above 10 percent. Significant improvement in the labor market has been slow to come. Since the beginning of 2010 the unemployment rate is down a percentage point from its peak, but if you were to chart it, you'd show most of the progress occurred from November of last year through January of this year. Since then, the unemployment rate has leveled off. Looking at employment from the job creation perspective, last Friday's employment report was clearly disappointing. Job creation was well off the 200,000-plus number we estimate is needed to make significant progress on unemployment.\n\nPrices have also presented a confounding picture. As economic weakness developed in the middle months of last year, disinflationary trends persisted. Alarmingly, measures of inflation expectations slumped, and concern about deflation rose. The FOMC reacted with a second round of large-scale asset purchases, commonly known as QE2. Headline inflation has reversed course rather sharply over the last few months. Core inflation measures have risen fairly sharply as well. The speed of the reversal of price behavior has been swift, and there has been a lot of concern expressed recently about the risk of persistent inflation.\n\nWhat are we to make of the vacillating character of the postrecession and postcrisis expansion? What to make of the two-steps-forward, one-step-back experience of the last two years?\n\nRecoveries rarely play out smoothly. Economic fluctuations are to be expected in a dynamic economy like ours, even in the absence of externally originated shocks and scares, of which there have been several. There's the on-again, off-again, and now on-again sovereign debt saga in Europe. There are the momentous events in North Africa and the Middle East with their effect on oil prices. And there are the earthquake and tsunami in Japan that have disrupted supply chains, especially in the important auto manufacturing sector.\n\nAdd to these a number of domestic factors—some regional, some national—such as the oil spill, certain weather events, the continuing severe weakness of the housing sector, and our own version of fiscal uncertainty.\n\nInflation dialogue\n So, to repeat, the fluctuating nature of economic performance is not really a surprise. The numbers will bounce around a bit from month to month and quarter to quarter. Recent disappointing incoming data are not a reason to panic, in my view. In fact, the economy has shown pretty impressive resilience through a litany of what are hardly ordinary and predictable developments.\n\nStill I'm troubled by what you might describe as a lack of conviction in this economy. As I step back and take stock of today's economic situation and the path ahead, I conclude that certain underlying fundamentals will greatly influence the country's economic performance over the coming quarters and years. I would emphasize three fundamentals that I believe will be formative. I'll put these in affirmative terms. They are 1) the restored health of the financial—especially banking—sector, 2) stabilized public sector fiscal underpinnings at all levels of government, and 3) sustained low and stable inflation.\n\nThe Federal Reserve shares supervisory responsibility over banks and now other financial firms, and so has a big influence on the first of these fundamentals. But it is the third—low and stable inflation—where the central bank bears near-exclusive responsibility and, ultimately, control. I'd like to devote the remainder of my remarks to the question of how the Fed conducts the dialogue with the public about inflation.\n\nThere is an interval of roughly six or seven weeks between FOMC meetings. During that time, my colleagues and I must take on board the limited amount of incoming data and make any adjustments to our working forecast for the economy as the basis for our recommendation on policy action. The process is as much art as science. This dynamic is certainly true of price data, which are exceptionally volatile.\n\nConsider the retail price numbers since last November. Annualized, the overall consumer price index (CPI) is up over 5 percent, well above the Federal Reserve's longer-term de facto objective of 2 percent or a little less.\n\nLately I've been wrestling with this question: How should the behavior of the CPI over the past six months inform my outlook? More precisely, are we still on the inflation path that eventually delivers price stability?\n\nOver very long horizons, and also during periods of dramatic change, most price statistics are nearly equally informative. But in the short term, the various price measures can give very different assessments of the inflation environment. And it isn't always clear which measures you should trust and which to ignore. In real time, the best we can do, I think, is to estimate inflation from a wide collection of statistics.\n\nThere seems to be a lot of controversy lately about one particular statistic, the so-called \"core\" inflation measure, which subtracts food and energy goods from overall prices.\n\nThe concept of core inflation is part of the policy discussion, not because it is an objective of monetary policy but because it is often an informative statistic. The objective of policy in the end has to be defined in terms real people experience—that is overall, or headline, inflation. This is because any inflation objective that does not include all of the relevant consumer prices can confuse and frustrate the public.\n\nBut, at the same time, saying nothing about the behavior of the \"core\" measures does not solve the communications problem faced by central banks. There are times when central banks ought to look through the volatility of certain elements in headline inflation.\n\nHere's the essence of the debate: Are the recent outsized increases in headline inflation the best signals of the inflation trend going forward? Or are other statistics—like core inflation or measures of inflation expectations—yielding a truer picture of what lies ahead?\n\nThe answer matters a lot. And it certainly weighs heavily on my thinking. I would not hesitate to support an exit from our current policy stance if I believed that the headline inflation number of the past six months is really indicative of the underlying trend inflation rate. I don't believe this to be the case. And I am wary of tightening monetary policy in the face of quite ambiguous economic circumstances unless doing so is absolutely necessary to meet the FOMC's price stability mandate.\n\nStill, I acknowledge that the language we use to explain our forecasts of inflation can, at times like these, get in the way of effectively communicating our ultimate inflation objective. One way to deal with this tension (an approach employed by many central banks around the world) is to set an explicit numerical objective for inflation, also known as an inflation target. I support the FOMC doing this.\n\nInflation target principles\n The specifics of an inflation target would need to be worked out by FOMC participants. But let me offer a few general thoughts about what would make for an effective inflation target.\n\nFirst, it would be stated in terms of some measure of overall, or headline, inflation.\n\nSecond, the target must be achievable over a realistic timeframe. That time horizon should be short enough to serve the real interests of the public and short enough to serve as a verifiable check on central bank performance.\n\nBut since monetary policy actions do not have an impact on the economy instantaneously, the time horizon should be long enough for the objective to be realized at an acceptable cost. I also accept that there will be times we must allow short-run deviations from the targeted rate of headline inflation, and the stated objective should be constructed with this in mind.\n\nI do not think the establishment of an inflation target would produce much change in how the Federal Reserve conducts policy. We have been pursuing policies with an eye toward 2 percent or slightly less headline inflation at least since we began publicly reporting our longer-term inflation forecasts.\n\nAnd I don't see an appropriately constructed inflation target as being in conflict with the FOMC's mandate to support employment. Low and stable inflation over a medium-term horizon is fundamental to my way of thinking, and in the absence of solid fundamentals, job creation will be inhibited. Now is a good time to reaffirm in explicit terms the central bank's commitment to delivering its piece of the package of fundamentals needed to assure a durable and lasting recovery.",

            "highlights": "Atlanta Fed President and CEO Dennis Lockhart speaks about the economic outlook and the role of communication in monetary policy before the Media Financial Management Association, Media Finance Focus 2011, Atlanta, Ga., May 15, 2011",
            "content": "Media Financial Management Association\nMedia Finance Focus 2011\nAtlanta, Ga.\nMay 15, 2011\n\nI want to welcome you to Atlanta, a city that has made a contribution to the world of communication and media over the years and gained economically as a result. You may know that Henry Grady, famous editor of the Atlanta Journal Constitution, was an enthusiastic advocate and promoter of the New South following the Civil War. Ted Turner developed his vision of a worldwide cable news network here in Atlanta.\n\nCommunications media have been an arena for innovators and visionaries, including those who foresaw the power of words on paper, of voices over radio airwaves, and moving pictures on televisions. Today our world integrates all those channels with digital and social media aimed at engaging audiences in new ways.\n\nCentral banks seem always to face formidable communications challenges, and certainly that is the case for the Federal Reserve in these times. In addition to conveying what is sometimes dense content on monetary policy and regulation, the Fed must adapt to both an evolving mix of media and the public's increasing expectation of transparency and accountability.\n\nAs regards monetary policy, Federal Reserve communication plays two critical roles as I see it. First, central banks have to inform the public about the state of the economy, the economic outlook, and the intent of policy choices made.\n\nSecond, communication is itself a policy tool. The implementation of policy is an interactive process in engaging the public and markets.\n\nToday in my remarks, I will first discuss the economic outlook. Then, with this outlook in mind, I will discuss the role of communication as a policy tool. An aspect of the current context is the implementation, at some point, of an exit strategy. By exit I mean an unwinding of the extraordinary interest rate and asset purchase policies put in place to counter the recent recession and promote a sustained recovery.\n\nAs always, I am expressing my own views that may not be shared by my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nEconomy and outlook \nFor nearly two years, the U.S. economy has been recovering from the deep and protracted recession brought on by the financial crisis and the housing market collapse.\n\nThe cadence of the recovery has been halting. After a few quarters of postrecession bounce-back, economic growth decelerated notably last summer. It then came back strongly in the last few months of 2010, but it appears that once again the expansion slowed in the first quarter of this year.\n\nA number of shocks have affected this recovery, including the recent run-up in oil and other commodity prices. The economy has shown resilience in absorbing these various shocks, but they at times held back the pace of the recovery.\n\nAlthough measured growth of gross domestic product (GDP) was relatively weak in the first quarter, private demand seems to have sustained its solid growth pace. Consumer spending continued to grow in the first quarter, even as gasoline prices jumped. Business investment in equipment and software grew at a double-digit rate. Exports also posted healthy gains. Anecdotal feedback from many of our business contacts in the Southeast also suggests the economy was stronger than the first quarter's preliminary GDP number suggests.\n\nI expect GDP growth for the rest of this year and over the next couple of years to be in the range of 3 to 4 percent annually. I expect growth of consumer and business spending to be sustained, reflecting increased confidence in the durability of the recovery. Robust economic growth of some of our major trading partners should boost exports. The manufacturing sector is likely to contribute significantly to growth, as domestic and foreign demand for U.S.-made goods increases.\n\nUnfortunately, recovery has been too slow so far to reduce unemployment meaningfully. Over the next two years, I expect a gradual decline in unemployment. At the gradual pace I'm expecting, it could take up to three years to get employment back to prerecession levels.\n\nLet me now address inflation. Since last fall and until very recently, commodity prices were on a very strong upswing. Most of these input cost increases were absorbed somewhere along the production chain, but some rises in commodity prices were passed through to retail prices, notably gasoline and food.\n\nPrices of many commodities, including oil, have either leveled off or declined recently. Many analysts have begun to speculate that this softening in commodity prices might be reflected in consumer prices later this year.\n\nIt's the Federal Reserve's responsibility to ensure that short-run increases in the rate of headline consumer inflation do not turn into a persistent inflationary trend over the medium and longer term. Confidence in the Fed's ability to deliver on this responsibility is closely tied to the inflation expectations of households, businesses, and investors. At the moment, longer-term measures of inflation expectations are reasonably stable. I anticipate that over the next two years, inflation will converge to the Fed's de facto inflation objective of 2 percent or a bit less.\n\nThis fairly optimistic outlook—continued expansion with moderate inflation—is subject to several risks.\n\nAt the top of my list of risks at the moment would be a further decline in home prices, a renewed run-up in oil prices, and the possibility that sustained elevated headline inflation could dislodge inflation expectations.\n\nBut assuming my optimistic outlook narrative plays out over the course of this year and next, policy will be in transition, in all likelihood. Federal Reserve policy actions and the communications that accompany policy changes will play an important role in sustaining a balanced and durable expansion with the low and stable rates of inflation the public has come to expect. So let me now turn to the subject of communication.\n\nFederal Reserve communications \nAs I mentioned earlier, communication is integral to the monetary policy process, both here in the United States and elsewhere.\n\nCommunication can help shape public and market understanding and expectations about the objectives of monetary policy, the monetary policy strategy, the economic outlook, and the prospect of future policy changes. The better that financial markets and the public understand what the Fed is trying to accomplish in the medium and long term, the more effective monetary policy ought to be. Clear and cogent communication that serves to keep participants in the economy well-informed creates a positive, interactive dynamic between the Fed and businesses, consumers, and financial markets. In short, saying is part of doing.\n\nCommunication is also a primary channel through which policymakers achieve transparency and accountability to the public for their decision making. Real outcomes of policy decisions in the economy are the ultimate test, of course, of both policy and the communication surrounding it. Accountability for results builds from effective communication.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has an ample number of communication tools. They include postmeeting statements on policy actions, meeting minutes, testimony, publications, Chairman Bernanke's press conferences (just recently initiated), and, increasingly, the use of social media. And Fed officials are frequently out talking to a wide variety of public groups—as I am today—discussing the reasoning behind policy decisions and how those decisions are expected to affect the economy.\n\nOf course, talk can be cheap. For policy to work best, the public must have confidence that Fed officials will follow through on our words with appropriate policy actions. Talk plus action producing intended results creates confidence. And public confidence is an active ingredient in effective policy action.\n\nDespite the multiple communications channels and methods that the FOMC uses, I know there are many who still maintain that monetary policy lacks transparency. One current complaint is that the FOMC has not been forthcoming about the hows, whys, and whens of changes in the direction of policy.\n\nTo some extent, that's true, in my opinion, and there's a good reason. The reason is the uncertainty already noted about the course of economic growth, employment, financial conditions, and inflation. Central banks conduct monetary policy against a backdrop of imperfect knowledge about the overall economy and the shocks that could affect the economy's path. Policymakers must be able to respond to future developments that cannot be predicted. Conveying a false precision does not increase confidence about economic outcomes, and it ultimately damages future credibility. Very specific pronouncements about the course of policy may feel like greater transparency, but the opposite is the case if commitment to that course is not credible.\n\nCurrent communication challenge—the exit strategy \nThe Fed has its share of immediate and tangible communication challenges in the current circumstances. In my view, a particularly big challenge lies ahead as we contemplate when, and how, we exit today's accommodative policy.\n\nAt some point, the committee will have to begin removing monetary accommodation. This will be a major transition point for policy and, arguably, one of the great communications challenges our central bank has faced.\n\nI'm of the view that formally communicating as a committee about an imminent change in policy will actually start the process of changing the policy. In other words, talking about doing actually begins the process of doing. As a case in point, last summer Chairman Bernanke spoke in an August 27 speech about the potential need to purchase additional long-term securities. After his comments, markets began to price in this move, which was ultimately not effected until after the November 3 FOMC meeting. I think a similar approach might be used for exit. In other words, the first step toward implementation of an exit strategy could start with communication, recognizing that what the FOMC says has real economic impact.\n\nEven if they are a bit premature in my view, questions are already arising about the specifics of the Fed's exit strategy. When will the Fed signal the start of raising interest rates by removing the \"extended period\" language in its postmeeting statement? When will interest rates actually rise? When and how will the Fed start reversing QE2? What will be the pace of actions along the exit path? Will the path be predetermined and explicit or flexible in order to deal with contingencies? In short, the questions are when, how, how fast, and how fixed?\n\nIt's clear from some media commentary that there's some amount of frustration that specific answers to these questions are not yet available. Occasionally, I hear or read that the absence of details about the FOMC's exit strategy represents a lack of central bank transparency or accountability—or, what may be worse, that the FOMC lacks a framework for addressing these questions.\n\nThe existence of these views represents a communication challenge in itself. I'd like to make two points in response. First, it is in the nature of policymaking in an uncertain environment that a central bank has to employ some amount of ambiguity in the forward guidance it gives the public. That ambiguity should not be confused with a lack of transparency or the failure of policymakers to come up with a coherent framework for making decisions. Second, uncertainty evokes divergent thinking among policymakers about the operational details of a policy-implementation plan, even when there is broad agreement about the desired outcomes of policy actions. Expressing these divergent ideas on the part of policymakers in advance of committee deliberations can cause some confusion, but I see this as a necessary and healthy process of pursuing the aim of transparency while working as a true committee of independent thinkers toward an eventual policy decision.\n\nIf you are a careful reader of the financial press, you probably have noticed that some of my colleagues have already begun to weigh in on the details of exit. I will not do so today, but I think it would be a mistake to assume that these public conversations on exit are much more than an open discussion of the options the central bank should consider.\n\nCommunications of individual policymakers \nEach participant in the FOMC enjoys a great deal of freedom to express his or her views publically. I feel this independence carries with it the overriding obligation to keep in focus the aim of contributing to the effectiveness of policy. Further, I feel it's my obligation to tell the public what I think. At the same time, it's my obligation to give an honest assessment of the consensus view of the FOMC (the committee) even if I disagree. And it's my obligation to respect the committee process.\n\nIn my public comments, I try to stay within boundaries drawn by certain self-imposed guidelines. I speak only for myself, not for the Federal Reserve or the FOMC. Only the chairman speaks for the system or the committee.\n\nBecause I genuinely value the discussions and contributions of my colleagues at the FOMC table, I try not to front run the committee by speaking about a matter that I know will be on the next agenda. Likewise, I try not to \"send in my vote,\" so to speak, before the meeting by committing to a position directly in advance of a meeting.\n\nTo conclude, I have a rather optimistic outlook for continued expansion with moderate inflation and unemployment declining gradually. Once the expansion becomes more clearly sustainable, it will be appropriate to begin the process of normalization of interest rate policy and the Fed's balance sheet. The exact timing remains to be determined by the FOMC. I am confident that the committee will provide guidance when we have enough certainty that the guidance will provide more signal than noise to financial markets and the public.",

            "content": "National Funding Association\nCouncil for Quality Growth\nAtlanta, Ga.\n \tMay 11, 2011\n\nThank you for asking me to speak here today. The name of your organization conveys that all of you care about economic growth in our community and, I'm sure, beyond. The organization's name adds a qualifier, \"quality.\" This qualifier acknowledges that you recognize that growth—whether at the local, regional, or national level—can be more or less grounded in sound fundamentals, more or less sustainable, and more or less broad based and good for everyone.\n\nSo, what is the quality of the economic recovery that has been under way nationally now for more than seven quarters?\n\nTo answer that I will review the current state of the national economy and outlook. And I will comment on the key drags and risks that could throw the economy off track.\n\nA sober assessment of the situation must give some attention to two areas of economic activity that are very important to metropolitan Atlanta. They are housing and commercial real estate. Neither is in the best of health at the moment.\n\nSo, a second question: can we have quality growth—a good and sustainable recovery—while these two sectors suffer? I will try to answer that question as well.\n\nAs usual, I am expressing my own views, which may not be shared by my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe economy and outlook\n Over the last seven quarters, economic growth as measured by real (that is, inflation-adjusted) gross domestic product (GDP) has averaged 2.8 percent per quarter at an annual rate. In normal times such a modest pace would be quite acceptable. But given the depth of the recession and a loss of 8 million jobs, this recovery has thus far been too slow to substantially reduce unemployment.\n\nThe cadence of the recovery has been halting. The second half of 2009 was quite strong followed by a softer, but still strong, first quarter of 2010. Then the economy decelerated markedly in the second and third quarters of 2010 only to come back a bit stronger in the final quarter of last year. Following a relatively robust end to 2010, however, the preliminary numbers for the first quarter of 2011 showed somewhat disappointing GDP growth of 1.8 percent.\n\nUps and downs in quarterly growth are, in fact, normal. In the current recovery, the U.S. economy has been buffeted by a number of significant shocks. Last year there was the scare of the European sovereign debt crisis. This year there's been the run-up of commodity prices, particularly oil prices translating to higher gasoline prices at the pump. The economy has shown resilience in absorbing such shocks, but they have at times held back the pace of the recovery.\n\nDespite the relatively weak start to this year, private sector spending appears to have been reasonably solid in the first quarter. Real personal consumption expenditures grew at a 2.7 percent annualized rate, even as gasoline prices jumped. Business investment in equipment and software expanded by 12 percent, actually accelerating compared to the fourth quarter. Exports of goods also posted quite healthy gains. Anecdotal input from many of our business contacts in the Southeast also suggests the economy was stronger than the GDP number suggests.\n\nLast Friday's job report showed an encouraging increase in payrolls in April as well as upward revisions to the previous two months. Employment growth of the magnitude we have seen so far this year is encouraging but will still only slowly bring down unemployment in the near term. As I look ahead, I expect that the rate of job creation will evidence continuous progress in reducing joblessness.\n\nI expect GDP growth the rest of this year and over the next couple of years in the range of 3 percent to 4 percent annually. As I noted earlier, this is a relatively modest rate of growth given the depth of the recession and still high level of unemployment.\n\nWhy the relatively modest pace of the recovery? Economic history shows that recoveries after a financial crisis tend to be quite slow. A financial crisis damages the credit circuitry of the economy, and repair simply takes time. Financial rebalancing results in a healthier economy in the long term but acts as a drag on economic expansion in the short term.\n\nI also expect a continuing gradual decline of unemployment to a base level that is a bit higher than prerecession levels. At the gradual pace I'm expecting, it could take up to three years to get employment back to prerecession levels.\n\nLet me turn to inflation. Higher food and energy prices have pushed up headline consumer inflation. The increase in inflation this year appears to reflect pressures that were largely the result of growing global demand and some supply-side or geopolitical shocks. The inflationary impact of some supply shocks is likely to be temporary. In fact, prices of several commodities have either leveled off or declined recently.\n\nThe latest run-up in the prices of commodities has been a drag on the economy. Consumers and businesses have had to devote a larger share of their budgets to food and gasoline, reducing spending on other goods and services.\n\nIt's the Federal Reserve's responsibility to ensure that short-run increases in the rate of headline consumer inflation do not turn into a persistent inflationary trend over the medium and longer term. Confidence in the Fed's ability to deliver on this responsibility is closely tied to the inflation expectations of households, businesses, and investors. At the moment, longer-term measures of inflation expectations are reasonably stable. I anticipate that over the next two years inflation will converge to the Fed's de facto inflation objective of 2 percent or a bit less.\n\nThis fairly optimistic outlook—continued expansion with moderate inflation—is subject to several downside risks. Key risks include, for example, a further spike in oil prices and intensified fiscal stresses both here and in Europe.\n\nAnother key risk is a further deterioration in the real estate sector. Given the importance of this sector to the U.S. economy and the Atlanta region, I would like to devote my remaining time to developments in residential and commercial real estate.\n\nResidential real estate\n The residential real estate market remains depressed. In my baseline forecast, the housing sector will contribute only modestly at best to economic growth this year and next.\n\nThe housing sector impacts economic growth in two basic ways—one direct and one indirect. The direct effect primarily comes through the construction of new homes and production of building materials and household products. Indirectly, the housing sector contributes to growth through its effect on household balance sheets, which can influence consumer spending. Another indirect effect relates to banks' balance sheets and the health of the financial system.\n\nTo assess how direct and indirect effects will play out, let me provide some perspective on the state of the residential sector.\n\nHome sales have not shown any clear trend of improvement since the end of the recession, except for a short pick-up during the period of the federal tax credit last year. From the peak five years ago, sales of existing homes are down nearly 50 percent and are close to the 1998 level. New home sales have fallen almost 80 percent from the peak and are at levels not seen since these data were first collected in the early 1960s.\n\n Why such weak sales? There are several explanations. Tougher underwriting standards have shrunk the pool of potential homebuyers. Entry-level homebuyers, who typically have the weakest credit histories, continue to experience the most difficulty in obtaining mortgage financing. And anecdotal information suggests this could be a longer-term issue. At the same time, many potential move-up buyers are blocked because they're either underwater in their current mortgage or don't have enough equity to meet the down payment requirements for a new mortgage. The real estate analytics firm CoreLogic estimates that about 23 percent of residential mortgages are underwater.\n\nOn the supply side, existing home inventory levels remain elevated, in part due to the great number of distressed properties on the market. These include bank-owned properties and properties where the loan is in default or the property is in the process of foreclosure.\n\nAccording to the firm Lender Processing Services, as of March, 3.7 percent of mortgages were in foreclosure and 7 percent of homeowners weren't current on their loans. Delinquencies have been declining since early 2010 but remain high. Defaults and foreclosures are likely to remain elevated for some time.\n\nIn contrast to the supply of existing homes, the inventory of new homes is near a historical low due to the sharp reduction in new housing construction since the downturn began.This reduction in construction is clearly evident in Atlanta. High unemployment and a large decline in migration to the region have severely affected demand for new homes here.\n\nBecause of the factors I've discussed, I do not expect significant new residential construction nationally. Thus, it's unlikely that residential real estate will directly contribute much to GDP growth this year or next.\n\nI mentioned earlier that the housing sector also has indirect impacts on the economy. In particular, the direction of home prices is important for the economy because changes in home prices affect the health of both household and bank balance sheets.\n\nS&P/Case-Shiller data show that home prices are down more than 30 percent from their peak. While prices appeared to stabilize in 2009 and 2010, today prices appear to be under renewed pressure from the increasing supply of distressed properties that are selling at a deep discount.\n\nBased on CoreLogic calculations, price discounts on distressed properties rose from an average of 26 percent in 2008 to 37 percent by the end of last year. In addition, the percentage of distressed sales in the market, according to CoreLogic, reached a high of 28 percent at the end of 2010. Some estimates are even higher.\n\nDeclines in home prices have also created problems for banks. As home prices continue to drop, banks further mark down the balance sheet valuation of their assets. Smaller banks, whose lending was disproportionally concentrated in real estate, are likely to be affected the most, which can impair capacity to lend.\n\nSome economic forecasters in the Blue Chip survey are more optimistic than I am. Among these forecasters, there's about a half a percentage point difference between the more optimistic and the less optimistic as regards 2012 GDP growth. One source of the difference is their relative views of how soft the direct impact of the housing sector will be. The indirect influence of the housing sector on consumer activity and bank lending would almost certainly aggravate housing's impact on growth. As I said, my forecast for residential construction puts me among the less optimistic.\n\nCommercial real estate\n Let me now briefly discuss the situation in the commercial real estate sector. Commercial real estate (CRE) encompasses property types such as office, retail, hotel, and warehouse as well as multifamily residential.\n\nThe downturn in commercial real estate lagged the single-family housing market and the broader economy in the recent recession. While home prices peaked in 2006, commercial real estate prices rose until early 2008. They then declined more rapidly and by a larger magnitude than did single-family home prices. The price index published by Moody's with the firm Real Commercial Property is now down about 45 percent from its peak.\n\nThe weakness of the CRE sector exerts a drag on the broader economy primarily through lower construction activity. But an indirect effect is felt through the banking channel. In particular and similar to the residential sector, the concentration of troubled commercial property loans in the banking system, especially in smaller banks, can impede lending.\n\nThere are hopeful signs that the CRE market is stabilizing. Improvement, however, has been uneven across property classes and submarkets. The multifamily (including apartments) sector has fared better than others—not surprising given the reduction in home ownership. By contrast, the retail segment has not recovered.\n\nThe Atlanta CRE market has been very slow to improve. Similar to national trends, apartment occupancy rates have risen but are still well below national levels. Weak job creation and employment growth are constraining demand for office space. Atlanta office vacancy rates remained above 20 percent in the first quarter, according to CB Richard Ellis.\n\nOverall, slow employment growth appears to be the primary factor limiting demand for commercial space. But the weakness in the CRE market, in my view, does not present as much risk to the outlook as the single-family residential sector does.\n\nA high-quality recovery? \n In closing I want to circle back to the questions I posed at the outset. First, what is the quality of the recovery? At the beginning of my remarks, I hinted at a definition of quality for the purpose of venturing an answer to this question. A high-quality recovery, in my mind, has sound underpinnings in the sense that economic fundamentals are improving as expansion proceeds. Said differently, a high-quality recovery is one where major imbalances are being alleviated and economic resilience is accumulating. A high-quality recovery is sustainable, durable, and broad based. With such a recovery, the rate of unemployment should be shrinking materially.\n\nBy this definition, I would argue the current recovery is demonstrating clear evidence of improving quality. The recovery has been sustained now for over 22 months. Employment is now growing at a meaningful pace. There is evidence of improved economic performance across a variety of sectors—manufacturing, exports, business investment, and many components of the service economy. The savings rate is higher, and both households and business firms are deleveraging. Large corporations are cash rich, and their outlook is increasingly positive. The banking system is mending and better positioned to provide credit, the lifeblood of the economy.\n\nVery importantly, the country's fiscal imbalances are now on the radar screens of public officials. I think hope is justifiably rising that the nation will come to grips with our unsustainable fiscal situation.\n\nOverall, I think the case can be made that the recovery under way is meeting some of the tests of quality. I understand, however, that it doesn't feel that way to all of us. The recovery is a work in process.\n\nThe second question was: can we have high-quality growth while the residential real estate and commercial real estate sectors continue to be so weak? Not completely, in my opinion. The recovery will progress, but it will not be robust until we work through the economy's serious imbalances, including those in the real estate sector.\n\nAs I look ahead, I think the most reasonable assumption is that improvement of the real estate sector will lag an otherwise improving economy. But I am encouraged by the fact that the economy is increasingly on firmer footing.",

Atlanta Fed President and CEO Dennis Lockhart addresses the national convention of the National Funding Association about the role of risk lending in the U.S. economy.",
            "content": "But in my view, the endgame is smarter and not just tighter regulation. I believe we regulators must continue to raise our game. Our examiners have to be able on a consistent basis to evaluate loans in terms of associated risk controls and systems. Examiners must be able to distinguish between calculated risk taking and poor underwriting. And examiners need to validate the risk-reward calculus that goes into the pricing of levels of risk in loan structures.\n\nSmart regulation is essential if a significant proportion of risk lending is to remain within the banking system. I believe it's important that this be the case. As a result of Dodd-Frank, the Federal Reserve now has more explicit responsibility for financial system stability and the monitoring of systemic risk. To carry out this responsibility, we need visibility into major areas of activity, and in my view the lending businesses falling within my definition of risk lending qualify. The credit financing of the entrepreneurial sector should not become a so-called \"dark pool.\"\n\nThat said, the social usefulness of commercial credit organizations outside the regulatory net should be acknowledged. Some types of deals—particularly those with novel or speculative sources of repayment—will just be hard for many banks to do at any scale.\n\nThe historic solution to the too-risky-for-the-bank problem has been to concentrate certain lending activities in a finance company under a bank holding company remote from the bank and government-guaranteed deposits. In my mind, this approach still requires that the activity does not pose undue risk to the total organization. The activity should also conform to what the top leadership of the institution can understand and supervisors can effectively evaluate.\n\nChallenges for banks and nonbanks\nBoth banks and nonbanks (that is, finance companies and funds) face challenges in the current environment. Let me emphasize two areas of challenge, one most relevant to banks and one for nonbanks.\n\nFirst, for banks, higher risk loans ought to be booked on balance sheets that can afford the exposure. At the moment this is a constraint for a number of bank lenders who are working down excessive concentrations in distressed or problematic asset classes.\n\nOver the past few decades many banks of all sizes gravitated to real estate lending in various forms and allowed their commercial and industrial lending capability to atrophy.\n\nMany banks are now repositioning their lending away from concentration in real estate lending. Banks entering new lines of business will face the challenge of convincing both regulators and shareholders that their new lending strategies are sound. That means having human capital with the necessary skill sets and adequate infrastructure to manage the risks.\n\nAs banks diversify lending activities, I think we regulators will have to continue to refine our ability to assess the soundness of a variety of forms of lending. Over my banking career, I had experience at both ends of the spectrum of lending strategies—that is, unsecured lending to very strong credits as well as collateral-secured and tightly controlled lending to weaker credits with good collateral. In my view there are legitimate bank lending businesses all along this spectrum.\n\nSome of my personal experience was in an independent, nonbank finance company. The second challenge I see relates to this business model. Nondepositories face substantial market discipline. In nonbanks, to satisfy funding markets, asset strategies and liability strategies have to fit together in a congruent structure. Clear and convincing explanation of portfolio and funding strategies to the capital markets is a continuous requirement, especially in a period with \"black swans\" still fresh in memory.\n\nImportance of risk lending\nThe financial crisis of 2008 and the resulting deep recession have brought profound financial reform. The Dodd-Frank Act defines the lending landscape for much of the credit industry. As necessary reforms are implemented, I think all concerned must take into account the importance of risk lending to the nation's economic fortunes. American society has a strong interest in promoting entrepreneurial activity for the allied benefits of growth and job creation. As a class, the borrowers you finance—the entrepreneurs, the risk takers, the value creators—are quite likely to be a key element of the country's long-term economic revitalization.",

            "highlights": "Atlanta Fed President and CEO Dennis Lockhart speaks about U.S. manufacturing at the Knoxville Economics Club, Knoxville Economics Forum in Knoxville, Tenn. on April 8, 2011.",
            "content": "Manufacturing sector defined \n  For level-setting  purposes, I'll define what manufacturing encompasses in the U.S. economy.  The  sector encompasses a great number of industries and activities, from raw steel production  to motor vehicle assembly to water bottling and  oyster shucking. Yes, even light processing of products of nature like water  and oysters is considered manufacturing. The Department of Commerce has 473  classifications under manufacturing.\n\nThe  manufacturing sector includes establishments such as factories, plants, and mills.  Think of establishments as individual sites where manufacturing activity  occurs. A company may have multiple sites. There are approximately 340,000  manufacturing establishments in the United States. These establishments produce  goods through mechanical, physical, or chemical transformation of various  materials, both raw materials and already-manufactured goods. These are  transformed into both semi-finished and finished goods.\n\nA number  of industries—a good example is the auto industry—employ the supply-chain model,  whereby lead companies do final assembly as well as product design, brand  management, and distribution. Feeding the assembly line are tiers of suppliers  who manufacture components. Manufacturers of components, in turn, rely on their  producers and suppliers of raw materials.\n\nProfile  of U.S. manufacturing\n  Manufacturing  output represents about 11 percent of the U.S. economy in real GDP terms. It  may surprise you that this percentage has been relatively constant for several  decades.\n\nA lot has been written about the growing demand for  Chinese-made goods, and China's manufacturing sector is expanding rapidly.  Despite China's rapid growth, the United States remains the world's largest  manufacturer. According to U.N. data, the United States accounts for one-fifth  of global manufacturing output in real terms. That share has held largely  constant for the past 20 years.\n\nThe United States' high share of global  manufacturing output reflects to a significant extent the size of the U.S.  economy and domestic demand. Although U.S. exports have grown rapidly, the  United States is not the world's largest goods exporter. China and Germany  export more manufactured goods than the United States.\n\nIn the current recovery, manufacturing production  has grown faster than total GDP. But while GDP has already reached prerecession  levels, manufacturing output is still about 10 percent lower than three years  ago because of its outsized decline during the recession.\n\nPerformance within the manufacturing sector has varied  widely across industries during the recession and afterwards. Some industries,  such as apparel, were in secular decline for many years. Domestic apparel  manufacturing was hit hard by the recession and has benefited little from the  recovery. Other industries have experienced cyclical swings. Metals production,  for example, contracted and then expanded largely in sync with the economy. And  a few industries, notably the computer and electronic products industry, rose strongly  for many years and slowed only briefly during the recession. Computer and  electronic products output is already 20 percent higher than before the  recession.\n\nManufacturing  as source of employment\n  Coming back to the long view, while manufacturing output  through the years maintained its share of total GDP, manufacturing's share of  jobs has steadily declined. In the 1950s, almost one in three payroll jobs was  in manufacturing. Today that number is less than one in 10.\n\nIn terms of absolute employment levels, the number  of manufacturing jobs fell by almost five million over the last decade and  currently stands at around 11.6 million after remaining relatively stable  during the 1980s and 1990s. In contrast, manufacturing output over this period  has grown at about the same pace as the overall economy. Obviously, increasing  production combined with stable or falling employment is only possible if  productivity is rising.\n\nOutput per worker has increased faster on average in  manufacturing than in the overall economy. In many cases, productivity gains in  manufacturing have been the result of automation and robotization. In other  cases, productivity gains have been realized by reconfiguring production  processes, including the offshoring of more labor-intensive, early-stage  component production to locations where labor is cheaper.\n\nHigher productivity has translated into higher wages. Although employment in the  manufacturing sector is much lower than 20 years ago, manufacturing wages  remain higher than average wages and have been growing faster. Currently, the average  weekly wage in the manufacturing sector is nearly $200 dollars higher than the  average for all private industries—double the premium of 20 years earlier. This  increased wage premium reflects the changed mix of jobs and relatively higher  skill requirements in the manufacturing sector today.\n\nI want to summarize manufacturing in very basic  terms: its output level is up; output share is steady; employment is down; productivity  is up and, therefore, wages are up. That's the manufacturing story in a few  words.\n\nI am aware there is a lot of angst about the  manufacturing sector. In part this is driven by the fact that the sector is no  longer the generator of jobs it once was. Realistically, the future of the  manufacturing sector depends on its ability to change and reinvent itself in  response to global competitive pressures. So far, the sector has done this  pretty successfully. In my view, to paraphrase Mark Twain, reports of the  demise of U.S. manufacturing have been greatly exaggerated.\n\nInflation  picture and monetary policy \n  Now I'd like to come back to the subject of  inflation, which is mostly not a story connected to manufacturing. As I've said  before, my expectation is that commodity price increases that are now  translating into accelerating headline inflation will be transitory. In support  of this claim, I'll make three points.\n\nFirst, these increases have been driven by global  pressures in markets for food commodities, energy, and other commodities. These  pressures are largely the result of supply-and-demand factors, some of which  are one-off in nature.\n\nSecond, inflation indices are made up of a wide  spectrum of goods and services that don't uniformly have these commodities as  inputs. Roughly two-thirds of consumer spending is on services, which are not  materials-intensive.\n\nAnd, third, to the extent that some goods and  services have these commodity inputs, the pass-through to ultimate consumer  prices is limited.\n\nHistorically, prices for industrial commodities have  tended to exert a relatively small effect on most consumer prices. Even when  commodity prices rise at double-digit rates, prices of most intermediate and  final goods usually increase considerably less. In the short term, producers tend  to absorb some of the cost increases because of competitive pressures. Over  time, in the face of higher input costs, manufacturers also shift to lower-cost  production methods in order to maintain price competitiveness. In addition, for  most goods, materials costs are small relative to other costs.\n\nLooking ahead, this is not to say there will be no  pass-through effect on inflation. The point is the effect is likely to be muted.\n\nIt is, of course, the Federal Reserve's  responsibility to ensure that temporary ups and downs in the rate of headline  consumer inflation do not turn into a persistent inflationary trend. In my  view, the objective is growth in overall consumer prices at an annual rate of  about 2 percent. And I think the relevant period for judging success is a  medium-term period of three or four years.\n\nA key factor influencing price stability is the  inflation expectations of the public and investors. My colleagues and I are  watching various measures of long-term inflation expectations for signs that  public sentiment about longer-term inflation trends is shifting. At the moment,  with longer-term inflation expectations remaining stable—and predicting that  commodity price growth will stabilize—my view is that current monetary policy  is appropriate.\n\nMy view  of the future permits a degree of patience as regards monetary policy. There is  still a halting and fragile quality to the economy. I think the process of  restoration of full economic strength with higher employment continues to  require support. That said, planning for an eventual change of course is  completely appropriate as long as public discussion about planning  deliberations and the plan itself don't create premature expectations of  tightening.",

            "content": "The  International Economic Forum of the Americas\n  Palm Beach Strategic Forum\n  West Palm Beach, Fla.\n  April 4, 2011\n\nThe conference organizers suggested a number of questions we could address in our remarks. The gist of these questions is 1) What has changed after the recession and the financial crisis? and 2) What is new?\n\nThis is a pretty big canvas on which to paint for a mere 10 minutes. My stock-in-trade is an economic outlook speech, but today I will exploit the opportunity presented by these questions by stepping back and trying to discern the broader historical themes of the \"before and after\" of the recent recession and financial crisis. These themes are likely to at least partially define the environment for business in coming years.\n\nI almost always begin formal remarks with a disclaimer. It goes like this: my remarks today are my personal views and may not be shared by my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee and in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Great Moderation\n Here is the basic thrust of my argument today: over the last quarter century, American economic history can be divided into three periods. A long period leading up to the recession that began in 2007 has been called the Great Moderation. The recession itself was the most severe downturn we have experienced since the Great Depression. For that reason, it has been called the Great Recession—not a depression, but still very ugly. I would like to suggest that the period we are now in—beyond being a recovery from recession—can be thought of as the Great Rebalancing. This phrase has been used to describe the adjustment process underway in Britain. I believe it's also appropriate to the United States.\n\nHistorical periods are more easily labeled with hindsight and, obviously, the story is not yet told. Take this discussion, therefore, as a device to frame some of the big economic issues as we look ahead.\n\nDuring the Great Moderation, from about 1984 to 2007, the volatility of output growth and the level of inflation declined markedly. There were two recessions during this period, but both were relatively shallow and short-lived.\n\nThe Great Moderation was a period of sustained growth and low unemployment. Lower and more stable inflation created the conditions for the improved functioning of financial markets and made planning easier for both businesses and households.\n\nEconomists have attributed the Great Moderation to a variety of factors. These factors include better macroeconomic policy (including monetary policy), various structural changes in the economy, and some good fortune as well.\n\nHowever, the seeming stability brought on by the Great Moderation masked growing imbalances and excesses as time went on. The household savings rate, for example, steadily declined. Consumers took on a lot of debt, especially mortgage-related debt. Asset prices—notably house prices—increased much faster than their historical average.\n\nRising domestic imbalances were growing in tandem with global imbalances. These imbalances were manifested in large current account deficits that began to build in the late 1990s. Surpluses abroad resulted in outsized capital flows to the United States that lowered the cost of borrowing, encouraged leveraging, and increased returns on many assets.\n\nToward the end, investors began to assume that past hefty gains guaranteed future results and took on more and more risk. But in 2007, the Great Moderation came to an end.\n\nThe Great Recession\n The Great Recession that followed was the deepest and most prolonged of the 13 recessions since the Great Depression. The financial crisis brought the country close to financial collapse. It caused more than 8 million job losses and brought a painful level of unemployment and underemployment that persists today.\n\nThe Great Recession lasted seven quarters and turned to recovery in the summer of 2009. Since then, the economy has expanded for seven quarters, as of last Thursday (the end of the first quarter). With each quarter, the recovery is increasingly well established.\n\nHowever, underlying the recovery there remain serious imbalances that have not been corrected. Work on correcting these has only recently begun. This is a very familiar story to all of you, I know.\n\nThe Great Rebalancing\n In my introduction, I mentioned what I called the Great Rebalancing. Today, I see three rebalancing processes now underway. They are 1) the rebalancing of consumption and savings, 2) fiscal rebalancing, and 3) regulatory rebalancing in the financial sector.\n\nLet me elaborate a bit more on the forces that I think will define this period of rebalancing.\n\nFirst, the deleveraging of the household sector is rather well advanced and continuing. Households are repairing their balance sheets by reducing debt and rebuilding savings. The savings rate has hovered around 6 percent for many months now, more than triple the level that prevailed at the end of the Great Moderation. Consumer spending has been growing more slowly relative to income than it did before the recession. I expect that this more measured consumption behavior is likely to persist.\n\nA less consumption-dependent economy will help rebalance the country's external accounts—the trade and current accounts. It's unlikely and even undesirable that there be a drastic shift away from consumption, so less American consumption will not fix the global imbalances. But a stronger savings and investment economy here and its mirror image—a less consumption-driven economy—should temper the dangerous tensions that are characteristic of international imbalances.\n\nStronger savings by U.S. consumers won't be enough to correct our external imbalance without significant reduction of the country's public borrowing.\n\nThe public sector in the United States must stabilize its finances and reverse the accumulation of debt that has accelerated in recent years. This process of public sector deleveraging—an element of fiscal rebalancing—is mostly ahead of us.\n\nSpending cuts have begun at all government levels, and some improvement in revenues is now being reported. The extent of cuts is being discussed, quite literally, as we speak.\n\nPublic pension reform is a necessary element of fiscal correction. Again, this is mostly ahead of us. In the private sector, the process of migration from a defined-benefit world to a defined-contribution world is well underway. And observed from a very high level, I think there is evidence of a broad shift of some of the burden for providing for one's retirement from a combination of government and employer to the individual. The context is, of course, the baby boomer retirement wave that is just beginning, with those born in 1946 now reaching 65 years of age.\n\nThe third major domain of rebalancing, in my view, is bank and financial system regulation. We are in a period of re-regulation. In many ways, this re-regulation is a natural reaction to the financial crisis and constitutes a commitment to the public to prevent a recurrence.\n\nSome of this re-regulation is wholly new—especially in the financial sector. As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, a new dimension of financial oversight is in the early stages of implementation. This oversight is variously called \"macroprudential supervision\" or \"systemic risk oversight.\" The intent is to identify and preemptively neutralize sources of systemic risk and eliminate the too-big-to-fail problem.\n\nIn banking and a number of other industries, many contacts across the Southeast region of the country are increasingly giving voice to claims that this re-regulation is overreaching and potentially destructive. I frequently hear—across a range of industries—that the growing cost of compliance will drive out investment and hiring. As a current banking supervisor who has a background in the private sector, I see both sides of this concern. Let me just say that, to maximize the economy's potential, I believe that in the coming years we need to strike the right balance in all regulated sectors.\n\nI see rebalancing of certain fundamentals that underpin the country's economic performance and prospects as a prerequisite of long-term growth and full employment. I'm confident that the Fed, through its monetary and regulatory policies, is helping to shape and support conditions that allow these rebalancing processes to proceed.\n\nOur hosts here today asked, what has changed? What is new? I would like to think some profound changes are underway that, once the perspective of hindsight has been achieved, might appropriately be dubbed the Great Rebalancing.",

            "content": "Bonita/Estero Market Pulse Conference\nFt. Myers, Fla.\nMarch 25, 2011\n\nToday I will talk about the state of the national economy. Since we are only a few days away from March 31, my talk today will amount to a stocktaking of the economy at the close of the first quarter of 2011.\n\nIt's important for me to emphasize that I am speaking for myself only. My views may not be shared by my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\nLet me set the scene by profiling our national economy.\n\nThe U.S. economy is the largest economy on the globe as measured by output or gross domestic product (GDP). The economy's size is about $13 trillion, or about a quarter of the global economy.\n\nJust recently, at the end of 2010, the economy recovered in GDP terms all ground lost since the start of the recession, which officially began in the fourth quarter of 2007 and ended in the summer of 2009.\n\nThe U.S. economy is a major exporter. In 2010, total U.S. exports were $1.7 trillion. The United States ranks first among countries in terms of gross exports when you include service exports.\n\nThe labor market, or workforce, of the U.S. economy is made up of approximately 153 million participants. Of this number, around 14 million are out of work and another 8 million in round numbers are working part time while looking for full-time work. The official unemployment rate has fallen rather dramatically, from over 10 percent in October 2009, to its current rate of 8.9 percent. This is not all positive. The recent drop to 8.9 percent involved many people leaving the workforce, presumably because they were discouraged about prospects for employment.\n\nThere are a couple of ways to break down the American economy into constituent parts. One way is to look at the economy through a spending lens. This shows that the private sector represents about 80 percent of GDP, while government, or the public sector, accounts for the remainder.\n\nAnother spending approach is household versus business and other. About 70 percent of total spending is household or personal consumption. Clearly, the economy is very dependent on consumer sentiment and consumer finance for large-ticket expenditures. I'll come back to this point in a moment.\n\nDimensions of economic change\nOur economy is constantly changing and evolving. Change occurs across four principal dimensions and on different timelines.\n\nDemographic changes occur gradually. Trends like the coming retirement of baby boomers, for example, exert a profound influence on what gets produced and consumed.\n\nThe industrial composition of the economy can shift on a shorter timeline. The bursting of the housing bubble in 2007 resulted in a big drop in homebuilding and construction employment. Meanwhile, health care and education continued to grow.\n\nRelative geographic strength can ebb and flow with industry conditions. For example, the Southeast—including Florida—is lagging other regions because before the recession, the Southeast was more dependent on construction activity, which is currently quite depressed.\n\nAnd the job composition of the economy is continuously adjusting to the makeup of sectoral, industrial, and geographic movement.\n\nThe point is the economy is never static. Also, the economy is never static from the point of view of growth or its opposite, contraction. The recent recession began in the fourth quarter of 2007 and ran for seven quarters. Recovery began in the summer of 2009, and, including the first quarter of this year, the economy has been expanding for seven quarters.\n\nAt any given time there are conditions that hold back growth. Call these headwinds. And there are favorable forces that push the economy forward and contribute to growth. Call these tailwinds. Economic conditions can be both domestic and global.\n\nIn taking stock of the economy at this juncture—the end of March 2011—I'm going to survey the headwinds and tailwinds currently in force. These are the primary factors I see shaping the outlook for the near and medium terms.\n\nLet me say in advance that the meteorological metaphor of tailwinds and headwinds is useful only up to a point. In economics, winds don't blow totally in one direction or another. Winds blow in both directions and produce a net effect either helping or holding back expansion.\n\nAs an organizing device, I will talk first about tailwinds and then headwinds and under each I'll comment on consumer spending, business investment, and a third rubric that includes things like exports and government spending.\n\nTailwinds\nConsumer spending increased last year after two years of declines. Consumer spending continues to grow both as cause and effect of improving economic conditions. There are a number of tailwinds bolstering consumer activity.\n\nHousehold finances have improved substantially. Personal net worth has increased as equity prices have rebounded. By the end of last year consumers had recouped nearly half of the massive wealth losses brought on by the recession and the financial crisis. Consumer debt, including mortgages and credit cards, fell in 2010 for the second consecutive year. Consumer debt levels have declined as people paid down their debts and banks wrote off bad loans. As a result, at year-end 2010, the portion of personal income going to debt payments reached the lowest level in a decade. All this is putting consumers in a better position to increase spending.\n\nConsumer credit availability has improved somewhat. Auto loan securitization has been robust and lending terms have improved. This has helped auto sales, which increased significantly over the past year and were up nearly 30 percent in February from a year ago.\n\nEmployment has been growing gradually and incomes have been rising. Private payrolls have been increasing since February of last year. As a result, aggregate income—which includes wages but also other sources of income—has grown in line with the recovering economy.\n\nI want to make another point about employment growth, but this is a bit more speculative. In 2009, in pursuit of increased efficiency, businesses cut payrolls and met production needs with a smaller workforce. In contrast, over the past year, the scope for big efficiency or productivity gains seems to have narrowed. Going forward, meeting production goals in response to growing demand may more and more require hiring additional workers. Expanded employment should, in turn, provide a further boost to total income, consumer confidence, and spending.\n\nBusiness spending and investment also demonstrate tailwinds. Investment in equipment and software has been rather strong, although much of this capital spending has up to now been aimed at productivity enhancement or necessary replacement and maintenance, not growth.\n\nCorporate profits have recovered to pre-recession levels, thanks partly to efficiency gains achieved. The financial position of businesses—generally speaking—has strengthened, and firms are better positioned for growth.\n\nCredit markets and banks are healthier, and business access to credit is improving for most company categories. This improvement has allowed companies to refinance their debt and lower debt service costs.\n\nLarge corporations are cash rich. U.S. businesses have nearly $2 trillion in cash (and cash equivalents) that has not yet been deployed. With rising confidence, I would expect businesses to start making use of that liquidity by increasing investment and boosting hiring.\n\nOne more tailwind: foreign growth has increased demand for U.S. exports, especially for manufactured goods. Demand from major emerging economies has been favoring U.S.-made high-value-added goods, such as computers, aircraft, and communications equipment. Last year, the export sector made its largest proportional contribution to GDP growth since 1946.\n\nHeadwinds\nLet me now turn to headwinds. And again I'll start with the consumer sector. Consumers see a yellow light, not a green light. Measures of consumer confidence remain well below levels typical for a growing economy.\n\nDespite the improvements I mentioned, U.S. households are still burdened by a \"wealth gap,\" by which I mean a substantial shortfall from the wealth levels that existed prior to the recession.\n\nHome prices remain under pressure. Nationally, home prices have dropped more than 30 percent since 2006 and continue to decline in certain markets. These declines are holding back repair of household balance sheets. More than one-fifth of U.S. households with mortgages owe more on their homes than those homes are worth, adding to the financial vulnerability of consumers and their caution about spending.\n\nIncreases in the cost of gasoline and food are forcing adjustments in household budgets. Since last August, the cost of groceries is up about 2.5 percent, and gasoline costs are up about 25 percent. Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that over the past six months, the rising cost of groceries and gasoline has added just over $50 a month to the average household's expenses. Tighter budgets can mean less spending on more discretionary items.\n\nForeign developments can influence consumer attitudes. Uncertainty breeds caution, and consumers have been reminded in recent weeks that we live in an uncertain world. I am referring, of course, to the earthquake and tsunami in Japan and unrest in the Middle East and North Africa.\n\nBusinesses are also feeling some headwinds, so let me comment on these.\n\nThe banking system and credit markets, while much stronger, are not fully back to health. Credit is available for most segments, but lenders remain conservative and are very carefully moving to relax the risk-averse stance they assumed in reaction to the recession.\n\nNew business formation is constrained by tight credit. Early-stage businesses—a major source of jobs—are often financed in ways other than direct loans. Continuing difficulties getting home equity loans—related to lower home values, of course—and tighter credit card availability are holding back some entrepreneurs.\n\nCommercial real estate continues to be a stressed sector. Nonresidential private construction has plunged over the past two years and is unlikely to bounce back any time soon.\n\nUncertainty is still a restraining factor for businesses. Global uncertainty has loomed large in recent weeks. The unrest in the Middle East and North Africa, which I commented on a moment ago, has raised worries about availability of oil supplies and higher energy and petroleum-based input costs. The natural disaster in Japan has shaken financial markets and raised concerns about supply chain disruption. And uncertainty persists about the resolution of sovereign debt problems in Europe.\n\nThe political process associated with continuing federal budget resolutions and the debt limit is also an uncertainty factor at the moment. The federal government has been funded based on a series of temporary spending measures since September 2010 instead of an annual budget. The latest continuing resolution has been passed to fund the government until early April. Meanwhile, the debt limit is likely to be reached between mid-April and the end of May.\n\nNecessary fiscal compromises will unavoidably result in spending cuts. Fiscal adjustment at the federal, state, and municipal levels of government represents a direct headwind to economic growth. Government spending cutbacks at all levels need to be offset by private demand. This year and next, the government sector is likely to be in contractionary mode for the first time since 1994.\n\nGrowth outlook and inflation\nWeighing all these economic tailwinds and headwinds, I come to a net positive outlook for the economy for the rest of 2011 and 2012. Notwithstanding headwinds and risks, a self-reinforcing virtuous circle of final demand is increasingly becoming established. Our base case forecast at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta sees continuation of the storyline of moderate growth, gradually declining unemployment, and the settling of price movements around an inflation rate that is consistent with the Federal Reserve's price stability objective.\n\nI know inflation is on everyone's mind at the moment, so I would like to address that concern directly. In the past several months, consumer prices have been growing at a rate that would not be acceptable if sustained for very long. This price growth has been largely a result of outsized increases in food and energy prices, but even so-called core measures of inflation rose at a higher-than-desirable pace in February. In light of these developments, I will offer three observations.\n\nFirst, inflation pressures associated with rising commodity prices will dissipate if, as currently expected, the rate of growth in these prices slows. Let me emphasize that this is not a prediction that the prices of gasoline or groceries will actually fall. These higher costs are a result of real growth in emerging economies, developments in the Middle East and North Africa, and the fallout from natural disasters around the world, be they droughts, floods, or earthquakes and tsunamis. The pain of having to allocate a larger share of your income to driving your car or preparing dinner may well persist. I'm distinguishing here between the rate of inflation and the level of prices.\n\nSecond, contrary to popular opinion, Federal Reserve officials do actually eat and fill up their gas tanks. The FOMC's mandate, as I see it, is to control the inflation rate we all experience—so-called headline inflation. In other words, I interpret the Fed's price stability mandate as requiring the FOMC to manage the growth rate in the average of all prices, including food and energy.\n\nThird, it's our job to control that headline inflation over the course of time. It's not feasible to exert such control day-to-day or month-to-month or even quarter-to-quarter. But monetary policy can control the rate of overall inflation over the medium term. In operational terms, I think growth in overall consumer prices around 2 percent per year through a period shorter than the proverbial \"long term,\" say, a medium-term period of three or four years, is consistent with the Fed's price stability mandate.\n\nWhile short-term measures of inflation have moved up rather strongly in the last few months, I hold to the view that this trajectory will not persist. I continue to see the Federal Reserve's inflation objective I just outlined as attainable.\n\nThat said, like my colleagues on the FOMC, I continuously monitor performance against our price stability objective. This involves monitoring not just inflation today but importantly the course of inflation expectations, whether derived from simple surveys or pulled from financial market prices. I am prepared to support a change of policy if evidence accumulates that the low and stable inflation objective is at risk.\n\nFor now, however, I remain satisfied that the current stance of monetary policy is appropriately calibrated to the current and projected state of the economy and supportive of both the employment and price stability objectives.",

            "highlights": "Atlanta Fed President and CEO Dennis Lockhart speaks about the economy at the 2011  National Association for Business Economics Economic Policy Conference in Arlington, Va., on March 7, 2011.",
            "content": "2011 NABE Economic Policy Conference\n Arlington, Va.\nMarch 7, 2011\n\nThank you for the opportunity to address this group of eminent economists.\n\nToday I will offer my views on the current state of the economy and the outlook. I will comment on the appropriateness of the current stance of monetary policy for this outlook and the range of plausible scenarios around my base case outlook. And I will discuss policy at a strategic level, offering my thoughts on a policy framework for the near and medium term.\n\nI know you are aware of my need to issue a disclaimer. I am not speaking for the Federal Reserve or the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). My remarks today reflect my personal thinking, and my views may not be shared by my colleagues on the FOMC or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nToday is likely the last day you will hear from FOMC policymakers for a few days. FOMC participants generally refrain from speaking publicly about the macroeconomic outlook and near-term monetary policy the week before meetings—and our next meeting is a week from tomorrow. Since you might say I'm getting in a last word here, I also want to emphasize that I have a few more work days ahead of me involving data review and collecting the opinions of my staff, directors, and business contacts. All this will be to finalize a point of view that I will take to the committee next week. I don't go to the committee with a rigid position, and I find my views are influenced by the rigorous discussion at the table. So take that as a second caveat.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that my staff and I don't rely exclusively on the data to form our opinions. Because the Sixth Federal Reserve District is a pretty significant portion of the national economy and resembles the nation overall in industry composition, we go to great lengths to generate grassroots economic intelligence that supplements our analysis of the incoming data.\n\nState and direction of the economy\n  My assessment of the state of the economy and the outlook is pretty mainstream. In terms of gross domestic product (GDP) growth, the economy is demonstrating moderate strength, and the pace of growth is accelerating somewhat.\n\nThe private spending components of GDP are trending positively. Personal consumption overall is growing briskly even while the savings rate continues at a healthy level and households continue to deleverage. Retail sales excluding autos are growing at a solid pace, just a little below total retail sales including autos. And, importantly, consumer confidence appears to be gaining strength.\n\nIndustrial activity has been strong in recent months. Industrial purchasing managers reported accelerating activity in February. The proportion of managers reporting improved orders is at its highest level in more than six years. Anecdotal accounts of manufacturers in the Southeast confirm this picture.\n\nBusiness investment on equipment and software, a bright spot for most of last year, slowed in the fourth quarter. But January orders for core capital goods were consistent with forecasts for another year of solid growth in business spending\n\nExports, which expanded strongly in the fourth quarter, should also be a significant contributor to final demand in 2011.\n\nThe housing sector remains a soft part of an otherwise encouraging picture. House sales are still recovering and house inventories, although down from the peak relative to sales, remain elevated. Prices of homes were still falling at year end and may still be seeking a bottom. Residential construction picked up a little in January but remains very weak.\n\nIn sizing up the likelihood of sustained growth, it's useful, I think, to compare early 2011 with early 2010. It is true that GDP growth was slower at the end of 2010 than at the end of 2009 and will likely be somewhat slower in the first quarter of this year than it was at the beginning of last year. Despite that, I have more confidence in the fundamental strength of the economy than I did a year ago.\n\nA year ago, the handoff between public-sector stimulus and private demand did not occur as smoothly as anticipated, and some of the growth in the early part of last year was clearly borrowed from later in the year. In addition, the GDP statistics at the end of 2009 and beginning of 2010 were dominated by changes in inventories. In contrast, as 2010 ended, changes in inventories arithmetically exerted a significant drag on GDP growth. Unlike the beginning of last year, recent GDP growth has been dominated by strong growth in private final demand. The stronger growth in consumption and investment by households and businesses along with the stronger demand for exports give me more confidence in the sustainability of economic activity than I had at this time last year.\n\nInflation outlook\n  My views on inflation also fall in what I would argue is the central tendency of economists and professional forecasters, but on this element of the economic picture there's more divergence of opinion.\n\nHere is the inflation situation as I see it. There has been some acceleration of headline consumer inflation over the past three months, mostly coming from food and energy prices. Core inflation has also firmed. This firming is not undesired. It puts the recent inflation trend in a zone—around 2 percent or a little less—that most Fed policymakers consider in line with our congressional mandate for price stability and maximum employment. Policymakers generally don't like to see inflation dipping too close to the zone of deflation—that is, generally declining prices and wages.\n\nToday, in reaction to the rise in headline inflation, there is considerable public concern that this recent rise just represents chapter one and that consumer inflation will accelerate from here. I don't expect this to happen.\n\nProducer price inflation is on the minds of many in the business community. Throughout the fall we weren't hearing business contacts claim much, if any, pricing power. Now, however, we're hearing some of our business contacts express conviction they can push through price increases and plan to try to do so over the course of the year. That said, my sense is there is still concern that demand is fragile and pricing power too limited for most markets to take extensive price increases.\n\nTo recap, one can't help but notice rising inflation anxiety among the business community as well as consumers based on recent experience with highly visible and highly publicized commodity prices. So far, this anxiety has not translated to a loosening of the moorings of inflation expectations. Readings of the Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) market, for instance, indicate that longer-term inflation expectations are holding steady. But my concern is that broad inflation worries—even if in reaction to what are probably temporary relative price movements—could shift and cut loose inflation expectations. It goes without saying that we policymakers must watch indications of expectations very carefully and be on guard for an approaching inflection point.\n\nIn my opinion, central to the question of the potential for price action becoming broad inflation is the behavior of wages. I remember the early eighties well. I was in a management role in a bank then, and in my organization we were moving salaries around 10 percent a year to retain our people. Wage accommodation of rising prices has the effect of institutionalizing and embedding inflation. However, I do not see widespread wage pressures developing any time soon in the current circumstances of upwards of 20 million people either out of work or working part-time for economic reasons.\n\nEmployment outlook\n  As you know, inflation is one part of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate. Employment is the second element of the mandate.\n\nCertainly, Friday's jobs report was encouraging, particularly considering that the January report had so much noise. But, in my opinion, it is premature to declare a jobs recovery firmly established. I continue to hold to the view that achieving something close to full employment will take some time. I spoke in Tallahassee, Fla., a few days ago on the nature of the unemployment problem. If my base case view of the future plays out, accumulating demand will favorably affect demand-sensitive job generation. But I also think there will remain what I called a harder nut of unemployment that will come down only gradually.\n\nOutlook summary and risks\n  So to summarize my outlook, I expect a sustained pace of growth in the range of 3 to 4 percent, inflation firming to a trend rate around 2 percent, and gradual employment growth. As I said, this is a pretty mainstream view of the future.\n\nWhere my views might depart from the mainstream to some extent is on the question of the range of plausible economic scenarios from this juncture. In thinking about an appropriate and balanced policy for at least the near term, it seems to me a critical question is whether the range of plausible scenarios is narrowing (that is, is certainty growing) or widening (that is, is uncertainty growing). My view is the range has widened—not dramatically, but somewhat. For some time, my list of headwinds and risks has encompassed European sovereign debt, our own federal, state and municipal fiscal challenges, house prices, and commercial real estate. My sense of the balance of risks has shifted with the addition of unrest in the Middle East and North Africa.\n\nI began my banking career in the Middle East in the seventies and spent more than six years in the region, so I have some instinctive predispositions as I watch events unfold. Chief among these is an appreciation of how complex and unpredictable the situation is.\n\nI also constantly remind myself that seemingly distant developments can connect via unforeseen linkages and compound a shock or downside trend. Nonetheless, my base case forecast sees continuing improvement but with concern about growth downsides and price upsides.\n\nQuestions on large-scale asset purchases\n  With the information I have today, my first inclination is to be very cautious about extending asset purchases after June. Given the emergence of new risks, however, I prefer a posture of flexibility as regards policy options. As we have seen, conditions can change rapidly, so I will continue to evaluate the incoming information as much as possible with fresh eyes as I approach each meeting and each decision.\n\nI'd like to add that I am not one to naysay the contribution of the second round of large-scale asset purchases (LSAP2) in getting the economy to its encouraging current position. I supported the decision to undertake LSAP2. I viewed it as largely a defensive measure to avert a double dip, take any deflation prospects off the table, and reverse the direction of what were at the time falling inflation expectations. It's hard to claim causation, but I think the policy has helped achieve a favorable positioning of the economy for sustained expansion.\n\nA framework for near-term policy decisions\n  Let me now offer some thoughts on a framework for policy decisions in the near to medium term. As background, I'll explain the technical rationale of my Reserve Bank in supporting the scope of LSAP2 last November.\n\nThrough the summer and into the fall of last year, our internal forecasts at the Atlanta Fed were calling into question whether the policy stance at the time assured progress toward the committee's growth and price stability objectives. In more normal times, these circumstances would have prompted a cut in the FOMC's target for the federal funds rate. This approach would be (would have been) the prescription of the so-called Taylor rule which relates policy rate moves to forecast \"misses\" on the Fed's sustainable growth and stable inflation objectives.\n\nCutting the policy rate is obviously not feasible when the federal funds rate is already as low as it can effectively go. We did, of course, have in hand the experience of LSAP1 and at least some evidence of how those purchases affected longer-term market rates. The research suggested a $600 billion purchase program would equate to about a 75-basis-point reduction in the federal funds rate. Such a policy move was, to me, an appropriate response to the clear weakening of forecasted progress toward the FOMC's objectives.\n\nI want to highlight the analogous character in practical effect of traditional monetary policy using interest rates and the less familiar asset-purchase tools we have employed since the federal funds rate hit its lower bound. Though some have argued otherwise, I believe the FOMC hasoperated for at least a decade with a consistent and fairly well understood rules-based framework. It is within this framework that I think about the desirability of both LSAP3 and the inevitable exit to a less accommodative policy stance.\n\nExit strategy\n  A year ago, the exit plan was a focus of much discussion, but a soft patch in the middle of the year put it on the backburner. Even though I personally am not expecting an immediate need to implement an exit, I think it's fully appropriate to revisit the implementation assumptions and tools readiness. As I contemplate an exit, two basic and obvious questions come to mind—when will it be appropriate to undertake an exit, and how to implement the exit.\n\nJudgments regarding when to change the direction of policy are difficult, and much of our thought and energy are devoted to getting it right. But by employing a forward-looking Taylor-rule framework, when to exit is not a particularly bewildering problem conceptually. Upside surprises in GDP growth, employment growth, and inflation would certainly argue for implementing exit strategies sooner rather than later.\n\nIt would be nice if we were to find ourselves in circumstances in which the large build-up in the Federal Reserve's balance sheet could be unwound passively over time. Passive unwinding would be accomplished as the securities of the first and second asset-purchase programs mature. It would be nice, but I think it highly unlikely such circumstances will prevail. In balance-sheet terms, it would resemble something like the current policy posture for several years.\n\nSince I think passive unwinding is probably not feasible, we will have to decide when to actively implement an exit strategy. And though the answer to when to do this is clear in concept, it is not straightforward in practice. Lags in the effects of monetary policy mean that action generally needs to be taken in advance of definitive changes in the path of economic activity and prices. That is why the policy framework I am describing emphasizes a forward-looking rule-like construct to which the FOMC would simply react.\n\nForward-looking indicators\nForward-looking rules necessarily depend on forecasts, which by nature are shaped with a somewhat cloudy crystal ball. My staff and I in Atlanta will be watching for signs that, stated in positive terms, our growth projections are remaining on track and we see consistent progress in the area of employment growth and falling unemployment. And, first and foremost, we will be looking for signs of price pressures that are likely to build in the absence of some tightening up of monetary conditions.\n\nWhat will those signs be, particularly with respect to inflation? We will certainly continue to monitor the usual forward-looking indicators. Among these indicators, my staff and I especially watch the more refined measures of core inflation. For example, we'll monitor the median or trimmed-mean measures that have been shown to be better predictors of headline inflation over medium-term horizons. We will certainly want to look at measures of inflation expectations, particularly those based on market \"bets,\" such as forward breakeven rates derived from TIPS yields. And we will certainly continue to monitor the measures of basic cost structures that businesses confront, such as movements in labor costs adjusted for productivity growth.\n\nBut we have started thinking a bit out of the box as well. At the Atlanta Fed, we have begun monitoring a so-called \"sticky-price\" index, derived from subsets of consumer prices that change relatively infrequently. The idea is businesses that only periodically change prices have a big incentive to make pricing decisions that incorporate their best guesses of how prices will move until their next opportunity to adjust prices again. Like TIPS-based measures, the sticky-price index gives us a measure of inflation expectations derived from people making real decisions in markets. Unlike TIPS-based measures, the sticky-price index focuses on signals from the product markets that we ultimately care about.\n\nAs to how to exit, there has been a great deal of work on the tools for the exit strategy since the beginning of last year, and those preparations have been well documented in FOMC minutes and other Fed communications. Briefly, the implementation of the exit strategy would involve a combination, in some order, of increases in the federal funds rate target (supported by increases in the interest rate paid on excess bank reserves), the \"locking up\" of reserve balances through term deposit arrangements with banks and open market reverse repurchase operations, and outright sales of assets currently held by the Federal Reserve banks. It's the right time to review and refresh those plans, particularly now that we are in the latter stages of LSAP2, but I think that the general approach remains workable.\n\nAggregates and money measures\n  Finally, as an element of a framework for the near term, I want to push the notion of a renewed focus on monetary and credit aggregates. The anxiety about the large size of the Fed's balance sheet revolves around fear that reserves currently idle on bank balance sheets will suddenly come off the sidelines. If those balances get in the game faster than the economy can absorb them, there might be serious inflationary consequences.\n\nPractically speaking, I find it hard to imagine circumstances in which the credit channel would heat up so fast and in such volume that broad money creation would get away from the Fed's capability to drain liquidity. But precautionary monitoring is certainly warranted.\n\nIn recent history, there has not been much attention put on monetary aggregates. I would argue this is not because economists and policymakers have abandoned belief in the fundamental long-run relationship between money and inflation. Instead, monetary measures have not factored into policy discussions for quite some time because fluctuations in money multipliers and velocity made broad measurement elusive. Financial innovation has been such a force that forecasting methodology based on the money-price level growth connection came to be viewed as unreliable for policymaking.\n\nIt's worth remembering, however, that it was Paul Volcker's return to a focus on money growth that led the way to defeating the Great Inflation. The Volcker Fed's success set the stage for an extended period of controlled inflation approaching three decades.\n\nA closing thought: Volcker took extraordinary measures in response to extraordinary times. He was able to do so because the bedrock principle of central bank independence in the formulation of monetary policy was respected. The eventual unwinding of the necessary, but historically unprecedented, monetary accommodation of the last three years combined with the requirements of fiscal adjustment make for new and quite extraordinary circumstances. Fed independence on monetary policy remains an essential feature of sound economic policymaking now as before.",

            "content": "Economics Club of Florida\n Tallahassee, Fla.\nMarch 3, 2011\n\nThank you for that introduction. John Kurowski sent me an e-mail last week with information about your president, Larry Snowden. It's an honor to address an organization led by a man of General Snowden's stature.\n\nAlthough a long time ago, General Snowden remembers, I'm sure, his basic officer training at The Basic School in Quantico, Va., where he was taught the technique of the \"sitrep,\" or situation report. A sitrep is a battlefield assessment of all the relevant factors that a unit commander must consider at that precise moment in pursuit of a mission—terrain, protected areas, weather, enemy positions, and the like.\n\nToday I will start by providing an abbreviated sitrep of the nation's economic situation as I see it. The Federal Reserve has a two-part mission, commonly known as the Fed's dual mandate. The Fed's mission is to achieve price stability and maximize employment. Both present challenges at the moment, but in my view the more vexing of the two is employment.\n\nI will devote the balance of my remarks to the problem of unemployment. By going a little deeper than normal into the data, I hope to give you a more complete sense of the challenges involved in returning the country to full employment.\n\nAs I always do, I must emphasize that the views I will express are my personal thoughts and may not reflect the views of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or within the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe economy\n The economy ended 2010 with moderate strength. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth was a little faster in the fourth quarter versus the third—2.8 percent annualized GDP growth, up from 2.6 percent in the third quarter. Recent data suggest that this modest strength has carried over into the first quarter of 2011 and the economy is gaining some momentum. Manufacturing output continued to climb in January, growth of residential construction accelerated, and consumer spending appears to be improving.\n\nMost economists think this picture will continue. The consensus baseline forecast for the next one to two years is a sustained moderate pace of growth in a range of 3 percent to 4 percent, inflation that returns to a trend of around 2 percent, and gradual shrinking of unemployment. My own forecast—that of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta—is broadly in line with this outlook.\n\nAs the membership of an economics club can appreciate, economic forecasting is not a total confidence undertaking, so we commonly try to lay out a range of possible scenarios and identify the upside and downside risk factors that could throw the economy off the baseline trajectory.\n\nNot many weeks ago I was ready to say—as regards growth prospects—that I could be pleasantly surprised to the upside. The economy might grow faster than my assumed moderate pace, with unemployment coming down more quickly. I still hold to the view that I could be pleasantly surprised but with a touch more caution.\n\nMy sense of the balance of risks has been shifting with world news. For example, the unrest across the Middle East and North Africa has affected oil prices. At this juncture it's unclear whether the unrest and political instability will spread and intensify, driving global oil prices even higher. Yesterday, the spot price for West Texas Intermediate crude closed at $102 per barrel, up from $85 just a few weeks ago.\n\nThe range of plausible scenarios is widening. A sober assessment of prospects for continued economic progress has to factor in not only the risk of a sustained oil shock but also risks associated with fiscal policies and politics both here and in Europe.\n\nI'm sure inflation concerns are on your mind, so let me address that subject. Food and energy account for 23 percent of an average consumer's expenditures. Some prices within these components have recently moved up steeply. My reading of the evidence is that these increases are driven primarily by the combination of supply disruptions in global markets and rapid economic growth of major developing countries. Rising global commodity prices appear to have pushed near-term inflation expectations higher, according to the University of Michigan survey of consumers. An upward drift in longer-term inflation expectations would be an unwelcome development.\n\nI'm well aware confidence is being tested by inflation commentary that points to commodities, imports, and the energy ingredient in many products and services. However, longer-term expectations in the same University of Michigan survey have remained quite stable. This stability suggests there remains confidence that the inflationary impacts of recent movements in commodity prices will be temporary. My staff and I know we must remain vigilant in looking for any uptick in broad-based inflation that could unanchor longer-term expectations.\n\nState of the labor market\nAs I mentioned earlier, I want to spend the bulk of my time talking about the unemployment situation. Let me put current unemployment in context. The economy has been in recovery since the summer of 2009. By the end of last year economic output as measured by GDP had reached prerecession levels. But while the economy is now producing more than three years ago, it is doing so with almost 8 million fewer workers. The recovery has brought little relief to the labor market.\n\nOver the course of the recession, the unemployment rate doubled to 10.1 percent. Even though job losses were not spread evenly across geography, industries, and generations, it's accurate to say the effects were broad and deep. While pain was widespread, some groups were especially hard hit. The rate of unemployment rose substantially more for males, for those with a high school diploma or less, and for construction workers.\n\nAlthough the economy is no longer in recession and we have experienced more than six quarters of economic growth, employment is lagging other economic indicators. In January, the unemployment rate was 9 percent, with 14 million unemployed people actively looking for jobs. An additional 8 million people who wanted a full-time job were working part time—double the number prior to the recession. So well over 20 million people have an unsatisfactory work arrangement.\n\nWhile unemployment remains high, the overall demand for workers is gradually improving. Employment has increased by almost a million on net over the last year, and the pace of job growth is picking up. Also, the large volume of announced layoffs that plagued the economy in 2008 and 2009 has declined, at least through January.\n\nAs a consequence, the unemployment rate dropped eight-tenths of a percentage point from November to January (although people leaving the labor force played a part.) And the four-week moving average of first-time claims for unemployment insurance is trending lower. Tomorrow, we will get a reading on employment data for February. Expectations are for a solid gain in employment, but it will be difficult to interpret these data because of the potential rebound effects from the severe weather in January. Separating signal from noise has been difficult recently.\n\nJust as job losses were uneven in the recession, job growth in the recovery has not been evenly distributed across demographic categories. Take, for example, educational attainment. Employment is increasing for people with a college degree, while those with a high school degree or less are still losing jobs.\n\nEmployment recovery has also been uneven when industries are compared. For example, the construction industry and information services such as publishing, broadcasting, and telecommunications experienced heavy employment losses in the recession. These areas continue to lose jobs, on net. Other industries, for instance automobile manufacturing, have seen a return to job growth. A few industries, notably health care, increased employment during the recession and continue to add to payrolls in the recovery.\n\nThe deep recession and the slow employment recovery have created a very worrying problem, long-term unemployment. Those out of work are staying out of work longer, on average. The average unemployed person has been jobless for about eight months, and half of the unemployed have been looking for work for more than 20 weeks. This situation could have lasting negative effects. Research shows that long-term unemployment reduces lifetime earnings and lowers financial stability in retirement. It also has been shown to adversely affect people's health and their children's potential for success.\n\nStructural factors\n Let me now talk about underlying causes of slow employment recovery. Economists, analysts, and various commentators have cited a variety of factors that may be holding back job growth and contributing to long-term unemployment. Some experts believe these factors include some that are structural in nature. On the supply side, skill mismatch, reduced geographic mobility, and effects of extended unemployment insurance are three frequently cited structural explanations.\n\nSkill mismatch exists when work skills of job seekers do not match the requirements of jobs that are available. For example, a construction worker is unlikely to have the particular skills needed in the health care industry. When skill mismatch occurs, an unemployed person may need to first acquire new skills to get a job. It's surmised that the recession created some skill mismatch in the labor market.\n\nFed researchers recently looked at this proposition. They found that the extent of the mismatch is not materially different from what we saw in past. Anecdotal accounts from contacts here in Florida point to both classic skill mismatch and job redesign that requires higher skill levels and greater versatility. In my view, there is some elevated skill mismatch in the economy but mismatches alone cannot fully explain the unusual persistence of high unemployment in this recovery.\n\nHouse-lock is cited as an impediment to geographic mobility. The phenomenon of house-lock is related to the state of the residential real estate market. Currently many people owe more on their homes than their homes are worth. It's claimed that job seekers don't accept jobs available in other geographic locations because of the difficulty or cost of selling their homes. Studies have not been able to find convincing evidence that unemployment is high because of reduced geographic mobility. In fact, migration across the United States has been declining since the 1980s, but the decline did not increase in the last three years.\n\nAs you know, unemployment insurance benefits have been extended to unprecedented long durations. It is argued that these benefits give job searchers the ability to hold out longer for a good job and may in some cases reduce the intensity of job search. According to this view, extended benefits act as a disincentive to accept an offered job, especially if the job pays less than the one lost. I have heard anecdotal accounts of this disincentive effect. Some research estimates that long-term unemployment insurance has added anywhere between 0.4 and 1.7 percentage points to the measured unemployment rate. So for this particular explanation there does appear to be some measurable effect.\n\nOther impediments to job creation\n Those are supply-side explanations. On the demand side, it's been argued that credit constraints affecting small businesses are holding back hiring. Banks are blamed for this situation and so are regulators. Getting credit at an affordable cost was a challenge during the recession. But credit conditions for established small businesses have been steadily improving for some time now. Recent surveys suggest that most small businesses are cautious about hiring more because of slow sales growth rather than lack of access to credit.\n\nFurthermore, a recent National Bureau of Economic Research study showed that job creation is more correlated to young businesses than the broad class of small businesses. Start-ups and young businesses are often financed in ways other than direct business loans. Difficulties getting home equity loans and other personal credit appear to have reduced formation of new businesses.\n\nStrong productivity growth is another much-discussed potential impediment to hiring. Stated simply, increases in productivity allow businesses to support a given level of sales with fewer people. In the longer term, rising productivity expands the economy's output, which in turn generates jobs. But in the short run, productivity investment can be the enemy of employment growth.\n\nProductivity growth was unusually high during the recession and in the early stages of the recovery, limiting the need for additional workers. Recently, however, productivity growth has slowed below the pace of business sales. If this trend continues, the need to hire additional workers will increase.\n\nFinally, in recent months, reluctance to hire has been attributed to heightened uncertainty, a common theme among my business contacts. A few weeks ago I argued that uncertainty has abated somewhat with the improving economy, the resolution of the November elections, the extension of tax cuts, and the apparent containment of the European sovereign debt crisis. I said that before Tunisia and before the fiscal struggle in Congress gathered steam. The restraining influence of uncertainty persists, to some extent.\n\nRole of monetary policy\n In my reading of the available information and research, the slow recovery of employment cannot be simply pinned on one or two causes. It's a multifaceted problem. I do not see one big factor that, if successfully addressed by policy, would rapidly bring the down the rate of unemployment. There is a lot we don't know. Forces at work are complex. Measurements are often imprecise. Not having all the answers clearly adds to the Fed's challenge of calibrating monetary policy.\n\nCertainly sustained recovery and the accompanying rising demand will be a real help, if not a cure. I expect employment to grow if the economic momentum apparent today continues.\n\nBut I also expect a harder nut of unemployment to remain that will take time to work down. I don't think it's realistic to expect a reflexive bounce back to prerecession employment levels as a result of the anticipated modest pickup of growth. We haven't seen such a bounce back so far in the almost seven quarters of recovery.\n\nThe economy has evolved and moved on, to a significant extent, as a result of productivity gains and shifts of industry composition. Getting some of the unemployed back to work will call for human adjustments that take time—adjustments such as adapting skills to new work, new skills acquisition, relocations, and resetting of expectations as regards income.\n\nThe rise of employer demand for workers is also likely to be unhurried. After the trauma of the recession and financial crisis, it's understandable that the confidence needed to spur new business formation and new establishments—the confidence that will unleash the \"animal spirits\" of entrepreneurs and risk takers—will accumulate steadily, but not just snap back.\n\nFor a number of reasons, it's probable that the achievable longer-run sustainable unemployment rate is a bit higher than before the recession. Estimates vary among economists. At the Atlanta Fed, we currently see the longer-term sustainable rate of unemployment around 5.5 percent. I believe structural factors may be adding an additional 1 to 1.5 percentage points to this rate.\n\nWith unemployment currently at 9 percent, monetary policy certainly has a potential role to play in addressing this difference—the gap between 9 percent and 6.5 to 7 percent. In my view, shaping favorable macroeconomic conditions for demand-sensitive employment growth—consistent with price stability—is the appropriate role. Monetary policy can contribute, but it shouldn't be expected to eliminate all the factors holding back employment growth.",

            "content": "Calhoun County Chamber of Commerce\n Anniston, Ala.\n February 8, 2011\n\nI think of Anniston as Main Street America. Main Street is justifiably concerned today about the sustainability of the modest recovery that's been under way now for six quarters, the persistence of high unemployment, and the specter of inflation. These concerns, in combination with appropriate worry over the fiscal track the country is on, make for a heavy weight of apprehension holding back business investment, hiring, consumption, to some extent, and—taken together—the growth rate of the economy.\n\nToday I want to give you my assessment of our current economic circumstances with some recent historical context. I will comment briefly on three principal indicators of economic health: growth, employment, and inflation. And because movements of commodity and other \"headline\" prices seem to be creating the impression in the popular consciousness of a growing inflation problem, I would like to give particular attention today to inflation.\n\nAs is always the case, today I am speaking for myself only. My views may not be shared by my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve.\n\nEconomic outlook\n First, let me comment on the state of the economy. Economic conditions continue to improve. The economy first began to recover in the summer of 2009 and by the end of last year had reached its prerecession level of activity.\n\nThe recovery has been fitful. Economic growth rebounded strongly in the first few quarters after the recession. Growth was propelled by a combination of inventory adjustments, increase in exports, and the satisfaction of deferred demand on the part of businesses and consumers that had been put on hold during the recession. Government stimulus, such as the \"cash-for-clunkers\" program, also supported growth.\n\nIn the spring of last year, the recovery began to lose speed. Disappointing economic numbers and the emergence of problems with European sovereign debt brought out fears that the economy might fall back into recession. Also, inflation continued to drift lower, raising the prospect of tipping into a deflationary dynamic.\n\nIn the middle months of last year, weakening growth, ongoing disinflation, and falling inflation expectations prompted the Federal Reserve to begin a second round of large-scale asset purchases. The FOMC announced a policy decision on November 3 to purchase a further $600 billion of Treasury notes by the end of the second quarter of 2011. The possibility of this policy move was signaled at the end of August in a speech made by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke. Over the last months of the year, in anticipation of the policy move, the probability of deflation, as measured by Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) began to decline, fears of a double-dip recession started to fade, and equity prices resumed their climb.\n\nThe economy steadily gathered momentum through the fall and ended the year on an upbeat note. Unexpectedly robust consumer spending pushed up growth of gross domestic product (GDP) to an annual rate of 3.2 percent in the fourth quarter, and I believe much of that strength has carried over into 2011. I expect that this moderate rate of growth will be sustained as the year progresses.\n\nImprovement in the labor market has lagged broader economic recovery. While the rate of joblessness dipped lower in December and January, unemployment, at 9 percent, is still high, and the pace of job growth has been frustratingly slow. A number of factors are restraining job creation, including improving but still relatively modest growth in overall demand, slower business formation, and productivity enhancements in the workplace that have altered the need for workers. Businesses remain cautious about adding to their payrolls given the still tenuous nature of the recovery and the still high degree of uncertainty they face. I expect the unemployment rate to fall over the coming years, but I think it unlikely that jobs growth this year will be strong enough to generate quick improvement.\n\nInflation\n So what about inflation? I'll start with what the data tell us. The retail price measures jumped at year end as the price of gasoline rose. But looking beyond the rise in gasoline prices, consumer price increases remained exceptionally modest. In fact, about 25 percent of the consumer's market basket as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) showed declines in December.\n\nA similar pattern is evident at the producer level, where industrial commodities prices were elevated during the fourth quarter. But excluding energy, upward price pressures at the producer level were less evident in the data.\n\nIn the most recent FOMC statement, following the January meeting, the committee acknowledged the rise of commodity prices, but stated that \"measures of underlying inflation have been trending downward.\"\n\nYet inflation anxiety is rising. There seems to be a disconnect between what the Fed is saying and what people are experiencing when they fill up their gas tanks or read about rising food prices around the world. Over the last couple of weeks I've taken note of newspaper headlines. Here's a sampling: In USA Today, \"Prices starting to creep higher\"; in the Wall Street Journal, \"Cost inflation puts a wrench into the works\" and \"Inflation fears replace other market worries\"; in Fortune magazine, \"How inflation is turning breakfast into a luxury item\"; and just last Friday in the Journal, \"Bernanke denies that Fed is stoking inflation.\" Are the Fed and the public on different planets?\n\nCertainly not. But I do think in the swirl of official statements and public discourse we may be talking about different things. To my way of thinking, the term \"inflation\" is misused in describing rising prices in narrow expenditure categories (for example, food inflation). Nonetheless, recent price news has encroached on the public consciousness with the effect that any price rise of an important consumption item is often taken as signaling inflation.\n\nI think it would be helpful, therefore, to remind ourselves of three basic points about inflation and a central bank's obligation to deliver price stability. They are\n\nFirst: The rate of inflation encompasses all prices. It is the practical equivalent of the weakening of the domestic purchasing power of our money.\n\nSecond: Inflation is to be distinguished from the cost of living. While central banks, and only central banks, can control the domestic purchasing power of our money, central banks are largely powerless to prevent fluctuations in the cost of living.\n\nThird: The primary economic cost of inflation is that it increases the risk associated with long term planning and decision making.\n\nLet me elaborate on these points.\n\nLet's review what inflation is and is not. Inflation affects all prices. Inflation is not the rise of individual prices or the rise of categories of prices.\n\nI want to contrast inflation to the cost of living. In casual language, we often interpret a rise in the cost of living as inflation. They are not the same thing. Cost-of-living increases are a result of increases in individual prices relative to other prices and especially relative to income. These relative price movements reflect supply and demand conditions and idiosyncratic influences in the various markets for goods and services. If some component of a household's cost-of-living basket goes up in price, the higher cost of living is not ipso facto inflation.\n\nIn principle, the central bank could respond to the impact of rising costs in particular markets, but only by exerting downward pressure on the dollar price of all goods and services. Monetary policy is a blunt instrument without the capacity to systematically influence prices in targeted markets. Because monetary policy affects the value of the dollar across the board, the targeted item would still be expensive relative to income and relative to everything else.\n\nHere's my second point: The Fed, like every other central bank, is powerless to prevent fluctuations in the cost of living and increases of individual prices. We do not produce oil. Nor do we grow food or provide health care. We cannot prevent the next oil shock, or drought, or a strike somewhere —events that cause prices of certain goods to rise and change your cost of living.\n\nSo monetary policy is not about preventing relative price adjustments dictated by market forces. It is about controlling the broad direction and pace of change of all prices across the economy.\n\nIf monetary policy cannot reliably control the cost of living, what is the point? The point is bringing some certainty to planning and long term decision making of individuals and institutions. This is my third basic point. The benefit of price stability—low and stable long-term inflation—is that it reduces the risk associated with longer-term decision-making and avoids the drag on the economy that uncertainty creates.\n\nUncertainty about the long-term trend of inflation imposes a cost in the form of lower investment, misallocation of resources, redistribution of wealth, and other distortions. These distortions can be quite profound over time.\n\nIn the late 1980s I spent a year of frequent trips to South America. I remember a conversation with a Brazilian executive about the impact of hyperinflation on his country. He said that in hyperinflation , the first thought of a business manager each morning is what to do that day to his or her prices. He said that over time the hyperinflationary conditions bred a generation of people in business who were financially adroit, but few operations managers. In other words, the whole country was made up of people who knew how to manipulate their prices to stay alive and ahead of inflation, but few who knew how to run things.\n\nMeasurement of inflation\n To achieve price stability, policymakers must detect inflation in its early stages before it is firmly established, especially in the psychology of consumers and businesses. This early detection is a challenge because inflation is not easily measured in the short term with any precision. No single price statistic enjoys a sufficient vantage point from which to assess inflation in the short term. With imperfect tools, inflation is more easily monitored than precisely measured.\n\nAlmost exactly 100 years ago, the economist Irving Fisher, who laid out many of the foundational ideas about money and inflation, likened measuring inflation or the purchasing power of money to tracking a swarm of bees. The swarm is going in a certain direction, while the bees have their own individual movements within the swarm.\n\nHow to measure the direction of the swarm? In the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's monitoring of inflation, we track a large number of indices and evaluate their internal dynamics. We look at both \"headline\" and \"core\" measures of several indices to help us see through the specific influences of volatile food and energy prices. We study various \"trimmed mean\" price compilations to assess underlying price behavior beyond the traditional \"core\" statistics. We watch so-called sticky prices that businesses tend to change only infrequently as well as a large number of commodity and asset prices to get a sense of price behavior that may be especially forward looking. And we look at indicators that determine costs of both consumer price baskets and producer or business cost input baskets. We also talk to a lot of people in various walks of life across the Southeast and get grass-roots information on prices and costs. Admittedly, much of this touches on narrow price behavior, but collectively this input provides color and nuance to the data. Using the many methods and tools, we \"triangulate\" to an estimate of current and projected inflation trends.\n\nWhat we're searching for is the underlying inflation trend (the direction of the swarm) that the FOMC statement talks about and which we want to control. And since an exact fix on the state of inflation is elusive in the short run, the best policy approach, in my opinion, is to pursue a low, but positive rate of inflation over the longer term. As a policymaker, I think of the desirable level of inflation as high enough to provide a cushion of safety against the risk of tipping into deflation but low enough to be largely irrelevant—not a consideration—in long-term decision making. For me, this number is around 2 percent.\n\nStaying focused on broad inflation\n Notwithstanding the energy-driven jump in prices in December, underlying inflation is currently below the level that I would define as price stability. My current projection shows underlying inflation gradually rising over the next few years, putting us back into a range consistent with the 2 percent target by 2013. Key to the realization of this inflation forecast is that inflation expectations of the public remain well anchored. And for this to happen, the public has to have a good appreciation of what the central bank is trying to achieve and have adequate faith that we will achieve it.\n\nIn these remarks I have made a distinction between rising prices and a rising cost of living versus inflation. It's a fair question—is this a distinction without a practical difference? Not at all. The distinction is real and important for all of us to grasp. The distinction ought not to be lost on the general public because to understand the intent of current policy, to form reasonable expectations, and to make sound decisions for the long term, the attention should be mostly on the full picture of inflation and the long-term purchasing power of our money. As a policymaker, I watch prices—that is, the behavior of highly evident and prominent prices we all take note of. I am also interested in movements in the cost of living that the great majority of households experience. But I am focused most intently on broad inflation because I believe long-term stable prices to be fundamental to a healthy and growing economy. For the moment, inflation, properly defined, is tame, in my view. And the rise of individual prices does not signal incipient inflation.",

            "content": "Miami Dade College\n  Miami, Fla.\n  January 31, 2011\n\nThank you for the opportunity to speak at Miami Dade College. I'm looking forward to answering your questions. I'd like to begin by briefly discussing the role of the Federal Reserve System in the U.S. economy and my view of the current economic situation. After these remarks, I will take your questions.\n\nThe Federal Reserve System\nThe Federal Reserve System—commonly known as the Fed—is the central bank of the United States. The Fed sets monetary policy, regulates and supervises certain financial institutions, and plays a major role in operating the U.S. payments system. As it carries out these three functions, the Fed also helps to contain systemic risks in the financial markets and stabilize the nation's financial system.\n\nThe Fed was established in December 1913 by Congress. The Federal Reserve is charged by Congress to pursue a dual mandate—to promote the two coequal objectives of maximum employment and price stability.\n\nThe Fed has a decentralized structure. It consists of a Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks and their branches, and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The decentralized structure enhances the independence of the Fed, which allows the Federal Reserve to pursue its objectives free from short-term political pressure that may not be in the long-term best interests of the nation's economy. This structure also adds to the transparency of the Federal Reserve System and gives voice to people all over the country.\n\nThe Atlanta Fed covers the Sixth Federal Reserve District and, like other Reserve Banks, plays an important part in all the major functions of the Fed. The Sixth District includes Alabama, Florida, and Georgia, and parts of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Tennessee.\n\nAs part of the monetary policy-setting process, we at the Atlanta Fed gather economic intelligence from around our district. I estimate that we get input from about 1,000 citizens on ground-level economic conditions and the impact of monetary policy. Given that the Southeast economy is an excellent economic proxy for the whole country, this anecdotal information has relevance to correctly gauging economic conditions in the nation overall.\n\nHow accurately the Federal Reserve gauges the path of the nation's economy and devises policies to influence that path significantly affects the economic and employment world Americans live in.\n\nEconomic update\nLet me give you my view of the current conditions in the national economy. As I discuss the economy today, I should add that I am speaking for myself—my views may not be shared by my colleagues on the FOMC or in the Federal Reserve.\n\nThere are certainly differences in the state of the economy at the local level across the country. For example, the economy here in south Florida was and continues to be affected by the deep downturn in the residential real estate sector. On a more positive note, south Florida is a prime tourist destination, and that aspect of the local economy has improved recently.\n\nOn the national level, the pace of economic growth is picking up, and I believe much of the strength in the fourth quarter of last year has carried over into 2011. The moderate pace of economic expansion seems to have momentum, and I believe it should prove sustainable as the year progresses.\n\nConfidence appears to be growing. According to the Conference Board, consumer confidence rose sharply in January. Business confidence is also building. Business leaders remain cautious regarding investment and hiring, but in my contacts with businesspeople across a range of industries I hear more optimism than I heard even a few weeks ago. I believe that as businesses become more assured that growth will continue and their revenues will grow, they will increase investment and hiring.\n\nThere are risk factors that I think bear careful watching. The sovereign debt problems in Europe could become more severe and spill over to negatively affect our economy through a number of channels. The weakness of the U.S. housing sector—particularly house prices—could reemerge as a major drag on consumer spending over and above the direct effect of slow construction activity. States and municipalities remain under intense fiscal pressure, and many will have to continue to reduce expenditures to avoid default on their debt obligations or downgrades of their debt ratings. These factors are risks to the improving outlook.\n\nEmployment is growing very slowly and is lagging behind the improvement in the broad economy. To an extent, this lag is normal. After recessions, other conditions get better before jobs return. In the current recovery, unemployment has hung up at high levels, currently 9.4 percent. A number of factors are restraining job growth, including the moderate pace of economic growth, slower business formation, and productivity enhancements in the workplace that have altered the need for workers. There are a number of other contributing factors to the weak recovery in employment. For those of you with some time remaining before graduation, I believe the employment situation will improve for you.\n\nInflation is currently measured at lower-than-desired rates. A few months ago, fear of deflation was justified, but recently this concern has abated and the rate of inflation seems to have stabilized. Concern about inflation is rising because of higher gasoline prices and higher commodity prices, including food commodities. We are hearing stories that businesses incurring higher input costs may try to pass them through to retail prices. Higher input costs have not, however, translated to broad inflation of consumer goods and services. And, importantly, longer-term inflation expectations have stabilized in a healthy range. Through 2011 and 2012, I expect gradual firming of underlying inflation pressures from current very low levels to healthier levels.\n\nThere are definitely hopeful signs of sustained recovery in 2011. That said, I believe it is a bit early to declare victory, and, to be sure, employment is nowhere near acceptable levels. Progress is real, but fitful, and support of accommodative Fed policy is still required, in my view. The appropriate outlook at this juncture is one of cautious optimism, avoiding overstatement of the likely speed of improvement.\n\nWith this, I will conclude my remarks, and I look forward to your questions.",

            "content": "Rotary Club of Atlanta\nAtlanta, Ga.\nJanuary 10, 2011\n\nNote: Inclement weather has forced the cancellation of Dennis Lockhart's delivery of this speech. Below is the text of his planned remarks.\n\nIn the early 1980s, when I was a banker here in Atlanta, I was invited by the then president of the Atlanta Fed, Bill Ford, to a one-on-one lunch at the old Fed building on Marietta  Street. This was long before I had any idea of becoming a central banker and serving on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). I was pretty young at the time and a little nervous about the lunch.\n\nAs I recall this lunch with my predecessor, we chatted about the situation in the banking industry, particularly the then hot topic of interstate banking. Toward the end of the lunch—trying to come up with an intelligent question for a Federal Reserve Bank president—I asked, What is it like to formulate monetary policy?\n\nHe responded with an interesting metaphor. He said conducting monetary policy is often like flying an airplane in difficult conditions. You don't have much visibility, so you must fly using instruments. You have a wide array of instruments in front of you, but at any given time half the instruments are giving inaccurate readings. And you don't know which half.\n\nHe was talking about policy formulation, and that's not really my focus today. But it's such a great metaphor that I will put it to another use. I think the metaphor of a plane flying into weather is apt for an economy that is recovering but is constrained by forces that are slow to dissipate. We often talk of \"headwinds.\" Headwinds can be sectoral conditions in the economy that have broad effect, and headwinds can be structural in nature, by which I mean fundamental imbalances that are slow to correct.\n\nIn my remarks today, I'd like to provide an update on the progress of the recovery, my views on economic prospects for 2011, and a current evaluation of the most powerful headwinds affecting the pace of recovery.\n\nAs is always the case, I am speaking for myself—my views may not be shared by my colleagues on the FOMC or in the Federal Reserve.\n\nStatus of the recovery\nThe national economy stopped contracting and began recovering a year and a half ago. At year-end 2010, we'd seen six quarters of expansion and recovery. The ride has been bumpy. The economy enjoyed a steep ascent in the fourth quarter of 2009, and that strength continued through the first quarter of 2010. This strong growth of output was based, for the most part, on a combination of inventory rebuilding, a pickup in international trade, and the satisfaction of deferred demand on the part of businesses and individuals that had been put on hold during the recession. Government stimulus programs also contributed to growth.\n\nThen the economy hit an air pocket in the middle of 2010 as these forces played out and were not sufficiently replaced by sustained private demand. Importantly, though, the economy did not go into a nosedive as the year progressed. The third quarter of last year steadied to a modest rate of growth around 2.5 percent, which is in the range of the widely perceived long-term potential of the economy.\n\nWe won't have preliminary measures of fourth quarter growth until January 28. But monthly data on manufacturing, international trade, and consumer spending indicate that growth accelerated somewhat in the quarter just ended. Also, anecdotal input from some of our key contacts in the Southeast suggests that strong consumer spending at the end of last year exceeded the expectations of retailers, shippers, and mall owners.\n\nFriday's job report confirms the picture of an economy that is moving forward but at a modest pace. The rate of job creation is still below the level that will consistently bring down the unemployment rate, but the labor market is showing signs of improvement.\n\nWhen I spoke to you a year ago we were coming off a much stronger fourth quarter, but I did not believe that strength would be sustained. Year-end growth in 2010 does not appear to have been nearly as strong, but in my view the economy seems to have gained durable momentum as we begin 2011.\n\nAdditional purchases of Treasury securities \n The deceleration of growth in the middle of last year, along with worrying signs of disinflation and falling inflation expectations, prompted the FOMC in November to announce a $600 billion program of Treasury securities purchases.\n\nI made the decision to support that policy, and I remain comfortable with that decision. I saw these purchases as support for a shaky recovery and insurance against serious downsides. Since late August, when Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke discussed the policy at the Kansas City Fed's annual economic symposium, the S&P 500 index has risen about 20 percent, the probability of deflation as measured by Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities has declined markedly, and fears of a double-dip recession have faded. I won't claim that all those developments have been the direct result of the monetary policy actions, but I definitely believe policy has contributed to accumulating momentum and a better outlook.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's decision to implement additional purchases of Treasury securities has been unpopular with many people here in the United States and abroad. Domestic critics expressed fear of high inflation or even hyperinflation. However, various measures of inflation as well as inflation expectations continue to show little hint of a buildup of broad-based inflationary pressures.\n\nForeign criticism painted the policy as an intentional effort to debase the value of the dollar for trade advantage. Let me be clear—there is no monetary policy intent to influence the dollar exchange rate. Expectations of monetary policy easing initially put downward pressure on the dollar. But subsequent developments showed that there are many influences on our currency, and some of that depreciation has subsequently reversed. The most critical factor in maintaining the dollar's value is a strong economy with stable inflation.\n\nI have argued—as have others—that in a world where the U.S. economy still accounts for nearly a quarter of global output, it's in everyone's interest that the U.S. economy come back as quickly as possible. I believe monetary policy has helped in this regard.\n\nWhile things are looking better, I don't expect a quick fix. And this observation leads me to the subject of headwinds.\n\nI will focus on three powerful constraining forces in our economy. This is not an exhaustive list of every problem in the economy, but these forces are significant constraints, in my view.\n\nThe three headwinds are (1) the general psychology of uncertainty holding back consumer spending and business investment, (2) consumer spending and the interplay between household finances and the housing market, and (3) the ongoing process of credit market repair.\n\nUncertainty as a headwind\n Through last year, in numerous conversations with business contacts across the Southeast I heard a pretty consistent message—there's just a lot of uncertainty. First, there was the uncertain path of the economy in general. Then there was the regulatory scene, which included both financial system regulation and other regulatory issues—environmental, for instance. Uncertainty related to the impact of the new health care legislation was often cited as a bar to hiring.\n\nAnother big uncertainty was how the country's fiscal problems will be resolved through the political process. Related to that was uncertainty regarding extension of the Bush tax cuts. Also, starting in the second quarter, the European sovereign debt crisis raised the sense of fiscal and financial uncertainty once again at a global level.\n\nBoth Europe and the United States face profound public debt concerns. In this country, the challenge of budget balancing at the state and municipal level, together with the effect of state and municipal spending cuts, is a downside risk to an improving economy.\n\nThe drag of uncertainty on economic activity persists as we enter 2011. That said, I would argue that the pall of uncertainty has lifted somewhat, and improved visibility could encourage more business risk taking and consumer spending. The results of the November elections clarify which party will control the House and shape, in part, the national agenda. The extension of the Bush era tax cuts allows at least short-term expenditure planning. Passage of the Dodd-Frank Act eases some financial regulatory uncertainty as we move to the next phase of implementation and rule writing. And the accumulating strength of the economy has given us glimpses of clearer skies ahead.\n\nThe past year has brought progress in dispelling uncertainty, but much remains to be done.\n\nThe interplay between household finances and the housing market\n Now, I admit my argument that the headwind of uncertainty has abated somewhat is hard to quantify. On the second headwind—the housing sector's impact on household finance—I can provide more concrete evidence of intensity. And this headwind remains intense.\n\nThe housing market is still struggling to recover. In 2010, the homebuyer tax credit boosted home sales in the first half of the year. Subsequently, sales declined in the summer and were slow to rebound in the fall. From the peak five years ago, sales of existing homes fell almost 50 percent before rebounding slightly over the past few months. New home sales and housing starts are down nearly 80 percent from their peaks. Housing starts have been bouncing around the bottom for the past two years.\n\nThe magnitude of declines might give hope of a sharp bounce back, but I don't see that happening. In my view, home sales are likely to trend up only gradually as the economy continues to improve. On a little more positive note, home building nationally may be poised for some growth and should start to contribute positively to economic growth this year after five years of being a drag on the economy.\n\nThe path for home prices is less clear. Although they began to increase in early 2010, gains were later reversed, in line with slower sales. The consensus is for home prices to remain roughly flat this year, but some forecasters are predicting further, and in some cases substantial, declines.\n\nI see four major factors standing in the way of a clear turn in the housing market. These are stricter mortgage underwriting standards, foreclosures continuing at a high level, elevated inventories of unsold homes, and slow employment and income growth.\n\nThe direction of home prices will depend to a large degree on the future flow of foreclosures. There are currently about 5 million mortgages either in some stage of foreclosure or seriously delinquent. Nearly all of them may enter the market as distressed sales over the next year or two, adding to the already high inventory of homes on the market and putting downward pressure on prices and values.\n\nMoreover, about 22 percent of residential properties with mortgages are underwater—in other words, homeowners owe more on their mortgages than their homes are currently worth. So defaults and foreclosures could remain elevated for some time.\n\nFor many Americans, the loss of wealth associated with the fall of home prices has been a severe shock to household finances. This aspect of the headwind perhaps matters most for the broad economy. Starting in 2008, in reaction to the loss of wealth, households began to repair their balance sheets. Households have been actively deleveraging—that is, working down debt levels and saving more of their income. The savings rate has increased from a little over 1 percent in 2005 to more than 5 percent currently.\n\nConsumer debt as a percent of disposable income has declined markedly over the past three years after rising steadily since the 1980s. Most nonmortgage consumer debt reduction has been in credit card balances. As consumers have reduced their debt, the share of income used to service financial obligations has fallen sharply to the lowest level in a decade.\n\nConsumer action to reduce debt is not the whole deleveraging story. In the numbers, the decline in overall household indebtedness has been highly affected by bank write-offs. Also, banks' stricter underwriting requirements for new consumer debt have contributed to runoff.\n\nI expect the phenomenon of household deleveraging to continue.\n\nCredit market repair\n And this brings me to the third headwind, the condition of the banking system and credit markets more generally. Virtually all aspects of global credit markets were impaired, some quite severely, during the financial crisis. Because credit functions as fuel for economic activity and investment, the repair of credit markets is key to a solid recovery and longer-term economic growth.\n\nIn the interest of time, and because the topic is complex, I'll give you the sound-bite version based on a deeper analysis done by my staff.\n\nThe bottom line is that we are still experiencing a headwind as the process of credit market repair continues. The requirements of balance sheet repair hold back credit expansion.\n\nDuring 2009, total U.S. credit shrank for the first time since the 1940s. During 2010, financial institutions continued to deleverage. So did small businesses, while borrowing by corporations rebounded and, of course, the federal government debt continued to expand.\n\nConditions in the banking system today are mixed.\n\nOn the one hand, many banks have raised new capital, repaid government support, and seen the pace of write-offs come down.\n\nOn the other hand, the FDIC still lists 860 problem institutions, and more bank failures can be expected in 2011.\n\nIn the broader credit arena, corporate debt markets, both investment grade and high-yield, showed robust issuance and low spreads in 2010. That trend is likely to continue into 2011.\n\nSecuritization markets have made a comeback since their near shutdown during the crisis, but issuance is well below precrisis levels.\n\nOverall, credit markets have come a long way since the fall of 2008, but the credit system is not back to full health and must adapt to a new regulatory landscape. Nonetheless, I think the stage is set for some credit expansion in 2011.\n\n2011 outlook\n In my comments today, I have focused mainly on forces that I believe will restrain growth over the next year. I don't mean to leave you in too pessimistic a mood, so let me close with three important points that I hope will serve to balance the overall sense you take away from this talk.\n\nFirst, today's headwinds to a significant degree reflect structural adjustments that will, in the longer term, place the U.S. economy on a stronger footing. The preconditions for strong future growth are reduced uncertainty, improved consumer and household finances, and healthy credit markets.\n\nSecond, I believe the headwinds I have emphasized will restrain growth but not stop it. I fully expect growth in gross domestic product (GDP), in personal incomes, and in jobs to be better in 2011 than in 2010.\n\nFinally, I acknowledge the potential that economic performance this year could surprise me on the upside. Businesses, for example, are sitting on lots of cash. Cash accumulation is not something that can continue forever, particularly in the case of public companies. It may not take much weakening of headwinds to unleash some of the economic forces that thus far have been bottled up.",

            "highlights": "Atlanta Fed President and CEO Dennis Lockhart speaks about recent FOMC decisions to Alabama World Affairs Council in Montgomery, Ala., on November 16, 2010.",
            "content": "Alabama World Affairs Council\nMontgomery, Ala.\nNovember 16, 2010\n\nThank you for that introduction. It's a pleasure to be in Montgomery this evening and to address the Alabama World Affairs Council. I feel a kinship with your group. I am serving as the first chairman of Atlanta's new World Affairs Council.\n\nI took on this role because, in my view, every significant city needs a forum for building awareness and exchanging views on the major issues of the day. I appreciate your invitation to contribute to Montgomery's and Alabama's understanding of monetary policy and the conditions influencing the Federal Reserve's recent decisions.\n\nBefore I begin, let me state my usual disclaimer that the views I offer here are my own and do not necessarily represent the views of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nRecent FOMC decision\nAs you know, the FOMC made and announced a policy decision on November 3 to conduct further purchases of Treasury notes over the coming eight months, with these purchases accumulating to $600 billion.\n\nIn normal times, monetary policy is conducted by affecting short-term interest rates by purchasing and selling small quantities of Treasury debt in the open market. Now, short-term rates are at zero and are likely to stay exceptionally low into the foreseeable future, as reflected in the \"extended period\" language in the FOMC statements. As a consequence, small-scale open market purchases cannot drive short-term rates lower to provide stimulus. Instead, the Fed's approach to monetary policy has been larger-scale asset purchases.\n\nI supported the policy decision in the deliberations of the FOMC on November 2 and 3. This policy has come to be known as QE2. The QE stands for quantitative easing. I believe the term quantitative easing is best reserved for a policy that operates primarily through the expansion of bank reserves. To me, the Fed's current policy is more in the spirit of last year's large-scale asset purchase program.\n\nThis policy is designed to further improve financial conditions and thereby support a faster recovery, to reduce the potential of deflation, and to accelerate the eventual achievement of the Fed's two statutory mandates—maximum employment and price stability.\n\nThere are several ways that large-scale purchases of Treasury securities from the private sector can affect economic activity. For example, the sellers of Treasuries will have more funds available to buy goods and services. Or they may buy other assets like corporate bonds or shares. Doing so will tend to push up the prices of those assets, making the people who own them either directly, or through their investment funds, better off. And higher asset prices mean lower yields, which bring down the cost of borrowing for businesses and households and thus provides a further boost to spending.\n\nIn my opinion, the decision to purchase additional Treasury securities was not made in a black-and-white world. It was a policy decision made under considerable uncertainty—involving judgments in gray areas requiring sober weighing and careful weighting of risks and rewards, costs and benefits. Well-informed and rigorous thinking could lead one to come down on either side of this decision. In my view, every policy option before us had the potential of bringing serious challenges down the road that policymakers would later have to tackle. There were no riskless options.\n\nThe FOMC's decision to purchase additional assets has been controversial both here in the United States and abroad. As is often the case in controversial policy matters, there are varying characterizations of decision makers' intent and even different interpretations of key terms and concepts. Tonight I would like to give you my perspective on potential misunderstandings as I address the following four views that critics of the policy seem to hold: (1) The Fed is monetizing the federal debt; (2) the Fed is purposefully devaluing the dollar; (3) the policy is unconventional, with unknown risks, and may create serious unwanted inflation; and finally (4) this additional easing simply won't work.\n\nMonetizing federal debt\nLet me first address the issue of debt monetization, a practice that historically has resulted in higher inflation and, as a result, loss of wealth and savings by those who hold government bonds.\n\nA policy of monetizing debt would be most properly understood as a policy in which the Fed ties its purchases to new Treasury debt issues. The intent would be to enable the government to finance near-term deficits and/or eventually inflate away some of the nominal value of government debt. This is not the objective.\n\nIn my view, the current policy is resolutely designed to support the expansion of the economy and to maintain inflation near the FOMC's desired objective for price stability. I have every confidence the policy will revert to reducing the size of the Fed's holdings as those conditions are met.\n\nI feel it is particularly important for you, the public, to understand that the FOMC's purchase program is conditional and will be evaluated in light of developing economic conditions. When conditions warrant, these purchase operations will cease, and eventually sales will be instituted. And I am confident these decisions will be made independent of fiscal considerations.\n\nDollar devaluation\nIt has also been argued that the Fed's asset purchases have the intent—and also the effect—of devaluing the dollar. Ordinarily in my remarks I would defer to the U.S. Treasury Department on matters related to the dollar. That said, I don't think it is out of line to state clearly that, as I see it, there is no monetary policy intent to engineer specific values—or even a direction—for the dollar. In other words, this policy was not undertaken to prompt dollar depreciation.\n\nPrices of many types of assets are affected by monetary policy actions. The monetary transmission mechanism works by altering the relative price of various assets. The effectiveness of the policy will not hinge on dollar depreciation and, therefore, the price of the dollar in foreign exchange markets.\n\nFor those concerned about the dollar's value I believe it is important to stress that the most critical factor in maintaining the dollar's value is a strong economy with stable inflation. It is certainly true that the short-term effect of recent policy has put downward pressure on the dollar. But the purpose of the policy is to strengthen the U.S. economy, which is in the world's interest.\n\nSerious unwanted inflation and other risks\nA number of people have raised a third concern, namely, that this approach is new and unconventional and is fraught with risks that are going to harm the economy over the longer term.\n\nTrue, a large-scale asset purchase program is an unfamiliar policy in the sense that we are not targeting the federal funds rate. And I acknowledge there is uncertainty associated with this policy action as compared with fed funds rate targeting. Much of that uncertainty revolves around scale and lags—how large do the purchases need to be to have a noticeable effect? And how quickly will we discern that effect? In my mind, the perceived risks—particularly the risk of overshooting inflation—must be weighed against the risks that could be associated with a policy of inaction. Chief among those risks is a recessionary relapse possibly tipping into a long spell of deflation. Through the summer there were some signs of renewed disinflation, which could lead to deflationary expectations taking hold.\n\nI think it is important to stress that our experience in dealing with inflation versus deflation is not symmetric. In the event of a policy overshoot, inflation containment requires the implementation of the mostly familiar strategy of raising short-term interest rates. In the event of an undershoot, however, dealing with a deflationary spiral and the attendant real consequences would be far less familiar territory for policymakers.\n\nDoubts about the efficacy of large-scale asset purchases\nA final criticism levied against the asset purchase program is that it will fail to foster economic growth and price stability. That is to say, it won't work. I think it's important that we be measured in our expectations about how much further stimulus can accomplish in the current environment. I don't have outsized expectations. I see it as a precaution aimed at reducing or eliminating downsides. Further, in terms of near-term economic activity, I see the additional asset purchases as buttressing the ongoing effects of policies that have already been put in place. I expect it should have some incremental positive effect on overall demand. Also, it should reinforce, and accelerate somewhat, the growth momentum that is currently evident and, in my opinion, counter to some extent the strong headwinds the economy is facing.\n\nIn regard to price stability, this policy has already shown some signs of success by altering inflation expectations and reducing the risk of unwanted disinflation. To explain, inflation expectations extracted from Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS, spreads over like-duration Treasury securities were declining persistently over the course of late spring through summer. Following the August 27 Jackson Hole speech by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, these spreads have recovered to previous levels. In addition, according to analysis we've done at the Atlanta Fed, deflation probabilities reflected in TIPS have fallen from the high levels prior to the September FOMC meeting.\n\nManaging inflation expectations requires following through with policy actions consistent with stated objectives—in this case ensuring that inflation trends remain in a desired zone. The FOMC's November decision should be seen in that light.\n\nOutlook\nDuring the summer of this year—when the possibility of another round of large-scale asset purchases was first broached—the economy was arguably nearing a danger zone. At that juncture, the pulse of the economy was quite weak, having fallen off rather precipitously from earlier in the year, and the possibility of tipping into a deflationary dynamic was conceivable. Now, in my view, the economy is better positioned to definitively avoid the danger zone.\n\nAn unanticipated shock leading to a reversal is always possible, but absent such a development, the outlook is one of a deliberate pace of improvement. The potential for further disinflation turning into deflation is becoming more remote.\n\nI expect the recovery to strengthen in the coming year. Though growth is likely to be near or slightly above my assessment of its long-term trend, the pace is unlikely to be robust enough to rapidly return income and employment to prerecession levels. The recovery continues to be constrained by factors I earlier called headwinds. These include a cautious credit environment, ongoing deleveraging by businesses and households, a depressed housing market that has not yet stabilized, painful restructuring in the commercial real estate sector, and uncertainty related to government policies.\n\nThese headwinds are still with us, but we've made some progress. As the banking system continues to heal, banks have begun to ease lending standards for certain types of loans. Households and businesses have notably improved their balance sheets. The percent of household income going to service financial obligations has reached the lowest level in a decade as households reduced debt and credit usage. In the business sector, U.S. companies' cash holdings have risen to nearly $1 trillion.\n\nI give credit for some of the recent improvement to the anticipation of the policy action that was formally decided and announced on November 3. As the policy decision moves into the implementation phase, I see it as a modest, measured, and well-calibrated action program that can be adjusted as conditions evolve. Together with the policy stance that preceded it—that is, maintaining a large balance sheet and a very low policy interest rate—the $600 billion asset purchase program should serve to reinforce the progress we've seen in the economy and help ensure the conditions for continued and accelerating improvement.\n\nAt some point, as conditions develop, the purchase program will need to be reversed. I have full confidence the Fed has the tools to do this. So rest assured, should inflation begin to move above desired levels, I am confident the FOMC will work hard to keep it from getting away from us.",

            "content": "Conference on Employment and the Business Cycle\nAtlanta, Ga.\nNovember 11, 2010\n\nGood evening. I want to add my thanks to the presenters' and discussants' for your rigorous preparation for this conference.\n\nThis is the last formal event of your day. My task this evening is to make after-dinner remarks. Let me assure that I don't intend to compete with conclusions drawn from the excellent research presented here earlier today.\n\nRather, I will try to complement today's and tomorrow's presentations with observations from Main Street on the country's employment picture and the vexing problem of high unemployment. I must emphasize that the views I will express are my own and may not reflect the views of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or within the Federal Reserve.\n\nIn addition to doing formal analysis of data, we here at the Atlanta Fed talk to a lot of people in the Southeast to get their take on the economic questions of the moment. We classify this input as anecdotal, of course. Nonetheless, I give some weight to the anecdotal information we collect from across the region. As a policymaker, I find this information useful in fleshing out a real-time assessment of the economic situation. And what I hear often challenges our working assumptions. Tonight I will share some of these anecdotes to add a little yeast to today's and tomorrow's more studied assessments.\n\nI will lay out for you what we've been asking recently and the responses we are hearing. I'll do so in three major categories—obstacles to hiring, job skill issues, and possible longer-term employer-employee trends.\n\nCollection of anecdotal information\nI should begin by explaining how we go about gathering this type of economic intelligence. All the regional Reserve Banks, including the Atlanta Fed, collect anecdotal information from their business contacts.\n\nMore than two years ago the Atlanta Fed expanded this effort, launching an initiative called the Regional Economic Information Network, or REIN, to more fully leverage the Atlanta Fed's large geographic footprint in order to widen the scope of our economic intelligence-gathering efforts.\n\nWe believe the scale and scope of our district justifies some extrapolation to the overall national economy. The six states of the Sixth Federal Reserve District together represent about 13 percent of the national economy, and the industrial and employment composition of this region generally resembles the total U.S. economy.\n\nThe bank's Atlanta-based staff—along with regional executives who operate out of our five branches: Birmingham, Jacksonville, Miami, Nashville, and New Orleans—systematically collect current information and opinion on questions of relevance to monetary policy. Among many different types of groups, our staff regularly meet with the top firms in the region to get their take on current business conditions and the outlook. Many of these firms have operations that are national and international in scope, so what they tell us often offers a national perspective.\n\nAlso included in our network are our six boards of directors (one for the District as a whole and one for each of our branches) and an equal number of industry-specific advisory councils. The industries include agriculture, trade and transportation, travel and tourism, real estate, energy, small and emerging business, and labor, education and health. In addition, over the past year, we have conducted surveys of smaller firms to learn more about credit demand and availability, for example, on the part of small businesses.\n\nThe input we've received from these regional sources has been particularly useful in shaping our Reserve Bank's view about the outlook for recovery over the past year. At a high level, our outlook has been one of slow slog versus rapid recovery. The anecdotal input helped us avoid overreacting to the false momentum of the spring and what we now interpret as a transitory slowdown over the summer.\n\nQuestions we ask; responses we get\nAs I said earlier, we ask a lot of questions, but we take care in framing the questions and work at being consistent in our questioning methodology in each cycle between FOMC meetings. For example, since a key factor in hiring decisions at the firm level is the firm's top-line revenue prospects, we ask business executives questions like, What is your current outlook for business over the next six months, and how is this affecting your hiring plans?\n\nThe outlook can affect not only changes in employment levels but also the mix of skills and jobs a firm requires—especially when it works to reduce costs by increasing efficiency. To understand those dynamics we pose questions such as, How have you changed your staffing strategy with respect to the types of jobs and skills you require? We follow that with the question: Have you been able to improve the productivity of your workforce, and what does that mean for future staffing needs?\n\nIn the interval between FOMC meetings we are able to gather on average more than 500 responses to questions like these. Let me lay out for you what we've been asking recently and what we're hearing.\n\nObstacles to hiring\nTo start, we've been asking what you might call a fundamental question of interest to policymakers, and, that is, Are you hiring, or do you plan to be hiring in the near future? We are mostly getting \"no's\" to that question. But the more important question is the follow-up: If you are not planning to hire, why not?\n\nFew business contacts in our region expect sales to improve significantly in the near term. Most firms indicate that their outlook is one of slow and somewhat uneven improvement in the economy. This view translates into an emphasis on closely managing costs, especially human resource costs. Most contacts, not surprisingly, are very cautious about increasing their workforce in the near term.\n\nFurthermore, the majority of business contacts say that they have capacity to cover near-term sales growth with existing workers. The majority also note that, should sales outperform their forecast, they would first increase hours of their existing workforce, and many state they would then bring in part-time help or hire temporary workers.\n\nEven firms that have experienced stronger sales seem to be approaching hiring very cautiously. Most say that uncertainty about future revenue growth is driving this caution, and they are not likely to increase payrolls until the sales growth appears more sustained. All these responses feel normal coming out of a recession.\n\nHere's what doesn't feel normal. In addition to slow and uncertain revenue growth, contacts in this recovery are frequently citing a number of other factors that are impeding hiring. Prominent among these is the lack of clarity about the cost implications of the recent health care legislation. We've frequently heard strong comments to the effect of \"my company won't hire a single additional worker until we know what health insurance costs are going to be.\"\n\nMore generally, our contacts cite a litany of uncertainties as reason for a wait-and-see posture toward expansion-related spending and hiring. These include the longer-term fiscal plan at the federal level, the extension of the Bush tax cuts, and the effect of various regulatory proposals. I know it's difficult to disentangle these concerns from mere frustration about weak demand. But the restraining effects of policy uncertainties are repeated frequently and with great vehemence. In my opinion, a first priority is that government authorities bring clarity to matters central to business planning.\n\nJob skill issues\nAnother broad set of questions focuses on job skills.\n\nMany contacts confirm that they used the recession to achieve leaner staffing and to reorganize for greater productivity. We hear that much of the relatively strong investment in equipment and software coming out of the recession has been either for deferred maintenance or labor substitution.\n\nWe hear conflicting views on the permanency of earlier downsizing. In one breath business leaders say their companies will continue to \"do more with less.\" This stance sounds like a permanent shift in the way employers use their workforce. But we also hear that businesses recognize the limits of some efficiency gains—especially those gains that primarily involve making their existing staff work harder. On balance, a return to a prerecession configuration of a firm's labor force appears unlikely.\n\nThis observation brings us to the question of skills mix and skills mismatch. We hear across the board that there is strong demand for workers proficient in the use of information technology. This demand probably reflects a trend that has been under way for some time. We also hear of demands for skills that have increased as a result of adjustments made by businesses over the course of the recession and into the recovery. For example, changes in production processes have put a premium on versatility; employers want workers they can move among functions to balance shifting workloads.\n\nAt the moment, the majority of our contacts don't claim to have much difficulty finding hires with the skills they need since unemployment remains high across most occupations. Shortages have been limited mostly to certain occupations within industries such as health care, information technology, and trucking. I consider it an open question whether skill mismatches will prove to be a major obstacle to reducing unemployment as we move forward.\n\nLet me turn to the question of how the duration of unemployment spells relates to unemployment forecasts. We've asked our contacts about their preference for hiring currently employed workers versus unemployed workers—especially those who have been unemployed for a long time. On this question we've received mixed reports. Some businesses have expressed concern about a job candidate's length of unemployment and what unemployment might signal about a candidate's personal productivity. Balancing that, other employers tell us that they understand we are in an unprecedented situation because the severity of the recession has caused a dramatic and broad-based increase in long-term unemployment. We've concluded that whether the distressing increase in long-term unemployment will end up feeding on itself is another open question.\n\nLong-term trends in employment arrangements\nWhen the opportunity presents itself, I also query business contacts on the bigger question of whether profound changes are in process in employment arrangements in the country's economy. Here I'm referring to trends in the direction of less permanent, less direct, or less structured employer-employee relationships.\n\nSuch trends might capture the greater use of temporary and part-time workers, continuing outsourcing (that is, outsourcing within the United States), hiring for project-oriented work, having more employees engaged as sole-contractors, and the like. On this question, I don't hear much evidence that the recession accelerated these trends, and as usual the feedback is mixed and industry-specific. But it is very common to hear reports that businesses continue to pursue greater flexibility in their workforce arrangements in order to make labor a variable versus a fixed cost. It would be interesting to see if these employer efforts to reduce labor market rigidities—a theme in this conference—will be lasting or transitory.\n\nCombining anecdotes and analytics\nI hope these comments based on anecdotal inputs provide useful glimpses of today's complicated employment landscape and potential longer-term changes. What is needed is an analytical approach that is rich enough to account for the varied features of the labor market we observe and is useful to policymakers. I am confident that conferences like this one will contribute significantly to that objective.",

            "highlights": "Atlanta Fed President and CEO Dennis Lockhart delivers a speech about the economy and monetary policy at the Savannah Rotary Club, Savannah, Ga., on October 18, 2010.",
            "content": "Savannah Rotary Club\nSavannah, Ga.\nOctober 18, 2010\n\nSavannah is a city where insiders use the shorthand of initials—MGGE (Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil) and SCAD (Savannah College of Art and Design). Today I will talk about an economic policy issue that, similarly, has been reduced to shorthand: QE2. This is not the famous luxury ocean liner; QE stands for quantitative easing, and the \"2\" denotes a second round of this policy activity. QE2 is a policy option currently under consideration to support the sputtering economic recovery and deal with two of its by-products: high unemployment and low inflation that could spill over into deflation.\n\nThis policy option is the issue of the moment among Fed watchers. Commentators and market participants appear to have a high expectation that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will decide to go forward with another program of large-scale asset purchases (LSAP—another set of initials used officially in the recent past). The Fed used this policy tool starting at the end of 2008 until spring of 2010 when it purchased $1.25 trillion of mortgage-backed securities, $300 billion of Treasury securities and $175 billion of agency debt securities, creating fresh money in the process to make the purchases. These actions were taken to combat the recession at a point when there was no more scope for use of the Fed's more conventional policy tool, interest rate policy. The policy rate still remains at its zero lower bound and, for all practical purposes, cannot go lower. If something is to be done about the state of the economy, quantitative easing is the leading option.\n\nTo opt for more quantitative easing at this juncture is a big decision. Today I will walk you through the thicket of considerations that lead me, at this moment, to be sympathetic to more monetary stimulus in the near future. I take this view with a measure of tentativeness. Some more economic data will be posted before the next meetings of the FOMC in early November and mid December, and, as I always do, I would factor in the deliberations of the committee in the meeting before arriving at a final view.\n\nI must emphasize that the views I will express are my personal thoughts and may not reflect the views of my colleagues on the FOMC or within the Federal Reserve.\n\nState of the economy\n The recent performance of the economy has been disappointing. Growth has slowed from earlier in the year and unemployment remains high. After a period of disinflation last year and early this year, inflation has settled at a level considered by many to be unacceptably low.\n\nThis experience is worse than many had forecast. Over the past few months, a number of forecasters have written down their projections for the remainder of 2010 and 2011. A year ago, looking ahead to 2010 and 2011, our forecast at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta was less optimistic than those of many forecasters, so we have not revised down our outlook all that much. But overall it's fair to say the consensus outlook has deteriorated.\n\nThe Fed is mandated by Congress to pursue two policy goals—maximum possible employment and price stability (or put differently, the acceptable rate of inflation). The committee has the implicit responsibility of defining the rate of inflation that over the longer term constitutes price stability. In my view, that rate is around 2 percent.\n\nWith current inflation running at about 1 percent or a little higher and with official unemployment measured at 9.6 percent, it's clear that the economy is not where we want it to be. In my mind, the question is whether this situation is a call to immediate action.\n\nTo answer that question, I start with the outlook from today in the absence of further monetary stimulus. As a starting point, I expect final measures of third quarter GDP growth to be close to that in the second quarter which came in at 1.6 percent. My current forecast sees a modest increase in the rate of growth in the fourth quarter and further, but still modest, improvement in 2011. In this forecast, inflation remains low but with no further disinflation, and unemployment comes down very gradually.\n\nIn my thinking, the range of plausible divergence from this forecast is quite wide, and the risks are more to the downside. Very importantly—and this is a key point for me—the fact that growth is so sluggish and inflation so near zero presents the possibility of a deflationary situation developing, with very serious implications for employment. We want to avoid deflationary territory. Deflation can feed on itself, turning into a deflationary spiral. This possibility is by no means my base case expectation, but I don't think it can be blithely dismissed. For now it is a risk, not an actual developing feature of the economy.\n\nSo, again, my staff and I see the prospect of continued slow but gradually improving growth, with quite low but stable inflation and a positive but frustrating pace of job creation. We have to ask: Is this the best we can achieve?\n\nStructural or cyclical?\nWell, it's debatable, and it revolves around the question of whether the underlying problems of the economy—the obstacles to faster recovery—are mostly structural or mostly cyclical. These words can mean different things to different people and represent code words for an array of conditions. I think of structural obstacles as very slow and resistant to change and not responsive in the short term to monetary stimulus. I use the term cyclical to encompass aspects of the economy that are evolving on a shorter timeline that can be accelerated by policy action.\n\nThere are a number of features of the current economic situation that might be described as structural. Certain industries—homebuilding, for example—are likely to operate at a much lower unit volume for a long time, if not permanently. Well-informed opinion holds that the commercial real estate sector will take several years to work through the burden of property loan resolution. And the central debate focuses on the degree to which unemployment reflects structural impediments.\n\nIn my opinion, the evidence either way is not conclusive. My best assessment is some unemployment is structural in nature and some of it represents weak demand. That so-called natural rate of unemployment is probably now well above the very low level of joblessness we saw prior to the recession, but it is not the current rate of 9.6 percent. There is some labor resource slack that can be worked off with improved consumer demand and business investment. But there is little scope for monetary policy to have much effect on the mismatch between skills and jobs caused by industrial dislocations and the skill erosion that can be associated with long-term unemployment.\n\nAlthough not usually classified as a structural issue, uncertainty is a key factor constraining job growth and investment. I hear this refrain often from business contacts about the current environment. They cite the future of the economy itself as well as uncertainty related to employee health care cost, regulatory uncertainty, and fiscal and tax uncertainty. My contacts frequently make the point that much of this uncertainty cannot be dispelled by monetary policy.\n\nI do believe there is scope, at the margin, for further monetary stimulus to induce households and businesses to overcome their current spending caution, even while deleveraging. A quantitative easing program of scale should have the effect of making credit cheaper and, if successful in upgrading the outlook, more available as loan demand rises.\n\nThis comment on the potential and effect of lower interest rates raises a question: Through which channels or mechanisms would additional stimulus have its intended positive effect on the economy? There are a number of possible channels of influence. The credit channel is certainly one. Skeptics, however, point out that there is no lack of liquidity in the banking system. Today the Federal Reserve holds over $960 billion of excess reserves of banks on its balance sheet. This money is part of the monetary base but has not yet been transformed into broad stimulus in the real economy through bank lending.\n\nA second possible channel is called the portfolio balance effect. If the Fed buys a significant portion of available Treasury securities, for instance, investors may feel the need to migrate their holdings to other assets that carry more risk, such as corporate bonds and equities. The buying pressure in these asset classes could push up values and generally improve the atmosphere that supports risk taking and spending.\n\nA third channel is the dollar exchange rate and stimulus to net exports. Speculation about QE2 has already caused a drop in the dollar's value on exchange markets and contributed to the rising concern over competitive efforts among nations to influence the relative position of currencies. Sellers of the dollar are responding to the prospect of lower yields.\n\nPros and cons of QE2\n In this walk-through of considerations, pro and con, on the QE2 policy question before Fed policymakers, I could be accused of playing Hamlet. To cut through it all, let me summarize the case for and the case against, and then I'll express my personal opinion.\n\nProponents of QE2 might argue that not all the headwinds the economy faces are structural in nature and that further stimulus will raise demand. Purchases of Treasury securities will lower long-term interest rates (some of this effect on rates may already have been priced into the yield curve), and lower rates will generate some additional purchase and investment activity. And, yes, the portfolio balance effect and the export effect will raise the economy's boats. Taking a defensive perspective, proponents of QE2 argue that the risk of deflation is not negligible and this potentiality must be forestalled. Furthermore, patience with the high level of joblessness and underemployment runs the risk of weakening the fabric of the country if long-term unemployment erodes skills and creates a permanent class of unemployed. Finally, proponents may argue that the risks associated with an even larger Federal Reserve balance sheet—the challenge of a policy exit or unwinding as the economy improves—are acceptable. The exit tools are well advanced and scalable. So this is the case in favor.\n\nThe case against QE2 at this time goes like this: Further monetary stimulus will have limited effect. The financial system already has plenty of liquidity. Interest rates are very low, and lower mortgage rates, for example, won't generate a lot of new home buying given eligibility requirements. Further, the problems besetting the economy are not fundamentally amenable to a monetary policy solution. They will take time and depend more on getting clarity on the country's long-term fiscal path, taxes, and regulatory impact on businesses. Skeptics also argue that the Fed, by further expanding its balance sheet, incurs exit risk that could dislodge inflation expectations and lead to an unstable inflation situation. Finally, critics of this policy direction may argue that QE2 amounts to monetization of federal debt in another year of deficits exceeding $1 trillion. Accusations of monetization could undermine confidence in the dollar and American monetary policy with substantial long-term costs.\n\nIn my view, the decision is not clear cut. We policymakers have to weigh these arguments pro and con, potential costs versus benefits, and competing risks. As I said earlier, I am leaning in favor of additional monetary stimulus while acknowledging the longer-term risks the policy may present. At this juncture, and given the circumstances of sluggish growth and measured inflation that is too low, I give greater weight to the risk of further disinflation leading to deflation. In my mind, QE2 is a form of risk management—an insurance policy that is prudent to put in place at this time.\n\nMore explicit inflation objective\nI am also open to a move that I believe would strengthen the effect and compensate for potential risks of the policy action—that move is the adoption of a more explicit inflation objective by the committee. I believe doing so might serve as a further step to ensure the anchoring of public expectations about long-term inflation and the response of the FOMC to adverse price developments. I consider a more explicit inflation target as something the public could easily understand, and I believe it would reduce uncertainty at a time when it is badly needed.\n\nYou here in Savannah—one of the country's leading port cities—will understand the metaphor of navigating shoals. The economic challenges of the moment call for careful navigation. There are risks accompanying both action and inaction, but the risks that weigh more heavily on my mind are those associated with a movement toward deflation. I am prepared to consider action in the near term that can help avoid that danger and change the course of the economy for the better.",

            "content": "The University of the South (Sewanee) has academic strength across the board, I know, but when I hear the name Sewanee, it evokes an immediate association with fine writing and literature, particularly modern American literature. I think of the School of Letters—a unique academic asset in both name and substance—as well as the famous summer workshops for writers.\n\nI'm sure I can safely assume that literature professors, especially here at Sewanee, are deeply conversant with all types of American letters—the essay, short story, and novel. But I'll bet little critical attention has been paid here at Sewanee to a widely read and interpreted textual form that is published every few weeks from 20th and Constitution Avenue in Washington. I'm referring, of course, to the statements on monetary policy decisions of the Federal Reserve after each meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), in which I participate. I'm a special fan of this literary genre.\n\nI realize this seems a pretty obscure category of literature to many of you here. Believe me, I'm not insulted. I assure you these short narratives are as anxiously awaited in certain financial and economic circles as, say, a new novel of Jonathan Franzen, and very carefully deconstructed to discern the intended nuance of the authors.\n\nThe most current FOMC statement came out Tuesday of last week. It was about 300 words in its four key paragraphs. On the basis of impact per word, this is some of the most powerful writing in America. So today I want to conduct a short seminar on this literary form—the post-meeting FOMC statement—and, in particular, last week's installment. I will give you my personal interpretation of the plotline traced in the September 21 statement and why students here today should care. As I always do, I must emphasize that the views I will express are my own and may not reflect the views of my colleagues on the FOMC or within the Federal Reserve.\n\nYou students here today have a big stake in the story encapsulated in the statement and especially what it foretells. It conveys the central bank's assessment of the current state of the U.S. economy as well as the outlook for economic growth, inflation, and employment. It explains the policy decision taken at last week's meeting and signals the future course of policy. The economic and employment world you will enter on graduation will be significantly affected by how accurately the FOMC gauges the path of the nation's economy and devises policies to influence that path.\n\nSo let me guide you through this small example of what might be called \"econlit.\" I'll start with highlights from the first paragraph, which deals with the current state of economic activity and the outlook.\n\nEconomic activity\nIn the September statement, the committee characterized the economy in this way (and here I'm excerpting words and phrases verbatim from the statement): \"the pace of recovery…has slowed in recent months. Household spending is increasing gradually…but remains constrained by high unemployment, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit. Business spending on equipment and software is rising, though less rapidly than earlier in the year. Employers remain reluctant to add to payrolls. Housing starts are at a depressed level. Bank lending has continued to contract.\"\n\nTo summarize, the picture painted is one of lackluster economic expansion with several drags on recovery. And, importantly, the pace of expansion slowed markedly in the second quarter and continues to be weak in the third quarter.\n\nI believe this slowdown will prove to be temporary. In my view, much of the strength we saw last fall and winter was a consequence of policies that brought forward spending that would have occurred later. For example, the \"cash for clunkers\" program accelerated car buying, and the first time homebuyers' tax credit helped the homebuilding sector.\n\nTo put numbers on this slowdown, the economy grew at a 1.6 percent annual rate in the second quarter. This is about 1 percentage point below the so-called trend rate of growth of the economy (the normal long-term rate of growth), which is generally accepted to be in the neighborhood of 2.5 percent.\n\nGrowth at this anemic level is unlikely to generate enough new jobs to bring down unemployment to any significant degree. Unemployment currently stands at 9.6 percent. Given the growth of population, we need sustained job creation of at least 150,000 per month to make significant progress on the unemployment problem. Private sector job creation for the past three months has averaged 78,000.\n\nYou students who will graduate in 2011 and 2012, or later, have a direct interest in the health of the employment market you will enter. Realistically, I expect improvement to be gradual.\n\nInflation\nThe second paragraph of the statement focuses on the FOMC's view of inflation. Here's what the statement said, and, again, I am quoting: \"measures of underlying inflation are…below [emphasis added] those the Committee judges…consistent…with its mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability.\" To explain, the Fed is mandated by Congress to pursue two longer-term goals—maximum employment and price stability. It's the Fed's responsibility to define what is acceptably low inflation, or price stability. Note that the statement used the word \"below\"—that is, too low, not too high. It is a surprise to many people that the committee is worried that inflation is running at a rate that is too low.\n\nConsumer prices have been rising at an annual rate around 1 percent for the past three months. This follows a period spanning several months of disinflation, or the slowing of the rate of inflation. The concern is that disinflation may tip over into deflation. Deflation is defined as a broad and persistent decline in prices.\n\nAs individuals, we might not mind paying lower prices for food, books, cars, and other consumer purchases. But deflation can be a very bad state of affairs for the economy as a whole.\n\nDeflation can feed on itself, turning into a deflationary spiral. The Great Depression was essentially a deflationary spiral. Believe me, none of us wants an economy that falls into a deflationary spiral.\n\nI do not expect outright deflation to develop, but the slowing of the economy in the middle of this year, combined with a very low measured rate of inflation, suggests to me the risk of deflation cannot be dismissed.\n\nThere are a number of plausible explanations for this troublesome situation of slow growth and too-low inflation. One that I'm giving serious weight comes from anecdotal feedback from business contacts across the Southeast. Business people are citing the elevated state of uncertainty as a reason they are reluctant to hire and are very careful about investment spending.\n\nTo be more specific, my business contacts point to the uncertain path of the economy itself as well as the direction of fiscal, regulatory, and tax policies. Some also cite the chance that the recent sovereign debt scare in Europe might return and bring stress in financial markets and the banking system, even here in the United States. The uncertain outcome of the upcoming elections is also mentioned.\n\nI believe this cloud of uncertainty is also affecting consumer behavior. Consumers are very careful about spending in part because of the still-treacherous job situation and concerns about which way the value of houses might go.\n\nThere are other explanations for the slowdown. Views about what should be done, if anything at all, follow from one's view of the underlying causes. I will return to this central question in a moment when I frame the monetary policy decision dilemma that, in my opinion, is taking shape.\n\nBut before that, let's go to the third section of the FOMC statement, which tells the public what policy actions, if any, the FOMC decided to take during its meeting.\n\nPolicy decision\nThere are two parts to the policy section of the latest statement. The first part reads, \"the Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions…are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an extended period.\" The federal funds rate is the rate at which banks borrow from each other, mostly overnight, to meet their reserve requirements at the central bank. Think of this interest rate as the foundation rate from which the whole structure of interest rates paid by consumers, businesses, and governments is determined, mostly by market factors. The Federal Reserve lowered the target rate to this range in December 2008, when it ended a series of interest rate cuts that began in the fall of 2007 in response to the financial crisis and the recession. A key point is that this base level rate cannot go much lower. It is at its \"zero lower bound.\"\n\nThe third paragraph also explains the FOMC's decision on whether any changes will be made to the size or composition of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. Again I am quoting: \"the Committee also will maintain its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its securities holdings.\"\n\nLet me try to put what seems a small technical matter in context. Just as decisions the Federal Reserve makes about the federal funds rate influence other rates, the size and composition of the Fed's balance sheet typically have a big influence on the economy. This decision affects how much money banks have to lend and the mix of investors' security portfolios.\n\nThe balance sheet has increased considerably over the past two years from around $900 billion to more than $2.3 trillion. Changing the size and the composition of the balance sheet is one of the monetary policy tools the Federal Reserve began to use at the height of the financial crisis. The current size and composition of the balance sheet reflects the policies that the Federal Reserve implemented to stimulate the economy and support financial markets.\n\nThe size of the balance sheet began to decline in June of this year, just as the economy started to lose momentum. So at the August meeting, the FOMC decided to reinvest principal payments from its securities holdings into Treasury securities to keep the size of the balance sheet constant. The intent was to prevent the inadvertent tightening of monetary conditions. The September statement indicated the committee will maintain that policy.\n\nSo the decision last week was to keep policy the same.\n\nForward guidance\nThis brings me to the fourth paragraph of the committee's statement, in which the FOMC provides guidance to the public about future monetary policy actions.\n In the latest statement, the sentence read: \"The Committee will continue to monitor the economic outlook and financial developments and is prepared to provide additional accommodation if needed to support the economic recovery and to return inflation, over time, to levels consistent with its mandate.\"\n\nTo the casual reader, this sentence may seem boilerplate. But at the risk of overdramatizing, the plot thickens with the words \"if needed.\" In the coming weeks monetary policymakers must come to grips with the question of whether there is anything they can do to improve the situation in the economy and, if so, what that action should be. The circumstances of weak recovery, persistent unemployment, dangerously low inflation, and the policy interest rate (the primary tool of modern monetary policy) at the zero lower bound present a tough analytical challenge.\n\nEarlier I referenced a monetary policy dilemma. A necessary debate is jelling on the diagnosis of our economic troubles and the appropriate prescription. As I think about it, there are three lines of argument. One argument maintains there is not enough spending occurring—in economists' terms, a shortfall of aggregate demand—and that this shortfall can be reduced by further stimulus. A second argument is that the economy is undergoing deep structural adjustments in industry composition, labor markets, and household finances, especially the level of debt, and these adjustments will take considerable time to play out. Finally, it can be argued that much of the uncertainty has to be dealt with in other areas of government, and monetary policy can't do much about this kind of problem. This characterization doesn't do full justice to the complexity of the matter, but it lays out in broad strokes what questions are in play.\n\nAs I see it, this debate will intensify over the coming weeks. If action is taken by the Fed, a clear option is to grow the size of the balance sheet since the policy interest rate, for all practical purposes, cannot go any lower. Growth of the balance sheet would be accomplished by a second round of asset purchases (probably Treasury bills and notes) paid for by newly created money. The technical term for this policy is \"quantitative easing,\" and the prospect of more of this approach is being referred to as QE2.\n\nWill it work? And, how much would be needed to make a difference? In my view, a consensus on these pivotal questions remains to come together, and I will not take a position here today. In the weeks ahead my staff and I will be tackling these and related questions to prepare for the important decisions coming.\n\nWriting the policy story\nMy remarks this afternoon may not have spurred you to become an avid reader of the Fed's post-FOMC statements. Again, I'm not insulted. But I hope you better appreciate that woven through the deliberate, technical, and—for many—tedious language of the September 21st statement is a suspenseful plotline in which all of us have an enormous stake. I cannot tell you how the economic policy story will play out. I can assure you, however, that the Fed has scope for further action to influence the course of recovery. And, importantly, I believe the Fed and the committee have the will to act—or not—as demanded by economic conditions in the near term.",

            "content": "Thank you for the opportunity to visit the Tri-Cities area and Johnson City in particular. Today I will comment on the current circumstances of the national economy as well as my outlook. Financial markets and investors—particularly investors who operate in the ultra-short-term trading and investment world—seem very nervous these days. Some commentators are reading recent economic data as suggesting the onset of a second recession and deflationary cycle. Quite naturally, businesspeople and consumers aren't sure what to believe.\n\nAt the last meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in Washington, the committee made a decision that has been widely interpreted as signaling declining confidence in the strength and sustainability of the recovery.\n\nIn my remarks today, I will provide a less alarmist interpretation of recent economic information and the Fed's recent policy decision. I will argue that, generally speaking, there was too much optimism in the early months and quarters of the recovery, and now there may be excessive pessimism.\n\nAs part of this discussion, I will review the relevant changes in the economic environment over the first half of the year and through this week. I'll round out this discussion of recent developments with my views on the economic outlook.\n\nAs is always the case, I am speaking for myself—my views may not be shared by my colleagues on the FOMC or in the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe outlook\nAs we began 2010, I had a medium-term outlook for the economy that included the following key moving parts.\n\nFirst, I looked for continued deleveraging, another term for reducing debt loads. In this regard, I expected an extended period of balance sheet repair on the part of consumers, businesses, and financial institutions. The process of household balance sheet repair would involve, in my view, relatively high (for the United States) personal savings compared with recent years, which would, in turn, restrain consumer spending. Deleveraging would also mean modest growth of capital spending by businesses and constraints on credit expansion by financial institutions.\n\nSecond, in the housing sector, I anticipated a bottoming out of house sales, housing starts, and prices.\n\nThird, as regards the commercial real estate sector, I expected continuing adjustment and strains from a process of debt restructuring and resolution based on lower valuations with some resulting drag on the banking sector.\n\nFourth, I believed we would see slow recovery in employment and other labor market indicators.\n\nFinally, I foresaw a low inflation rate. I did not expect a continually falling rate of inflation.\n\nSimply stated, I was expecting a relatively modest recovery, a typical pattern following the kind of financial crisis we experienced.\n\nEconomists sometimes get teased about needing both hands to do their job. This is because they're prone to say \"on the one hand, on the other hand.\" I am not an economist by training, but I have picked up the two-handed approach to economics from the many hours I've spent with my research staff at the Atlanta Fed.\n\nSo, on the one hand, as we entered this year, I believed the economy was on a path of sustained recovery, the pace of which would be restrained by the factors I just discussed. I expected modest growth and slow healing. Today that description still fits my broad outlook on the economy for the foreseeable future.\n\nOn the other hand there have been some developments whose severity my staff and I did not anticipate when the year began and have complicated the story. Most prominent among these is the European sovereign debt scare, which some have called a crisis.\n\nIn May, concern escalated dramatically in financial markets of a default by Greece, to be followed by some other countries in the European Union (EU). The EU and European Central Bank (ECB)—along with the International Monetary Fund—took decisive action, and European sovereign debt concerns have substantially abated. The Federal Reserve did its part by reinstating swap lines with the ECB, the Bank of England, and other central banks in an effort to ensure an adequate flow of dollar funding to global capital markets. This episode was a major test of global financial markets, including U.S. markets. I believe that in terms of financial stability our markets passed the test. But concern about global sovereign debt added to uncertainty and weighed on our economy into the summer.\n\nWhile my outlook for recovery was—and, I will argue, remains—thematically correct, it's also true that I've been off somewhat in the particulars of the story. Growth at the end of last year and early part of this year was stronger than I anticipated while economic activity in the second and third quarters seems weaker than I expected.\n\nBut such ups and downs are not unusual during a recovery. A little history: following the 2001 recession, gross domestic product (GDP) grew at the annualized rate of 3.5 percent in early 2002. Growth then decelerated to about 2 percent for the next two quarters then fell to almost zero in the fourth quarter. Entering 2003, growth edged up to a little over 1.5 percent and then accelerated from there to a sustained period of relatively strong growth for two years.\n\nLooking at the 2009–10 recovery, it seems clear that some of the early strength was promoted by policies that pulled forward spending from the second and third quarters of this year. The recent sharp decline in housing-related indicators following the expiration of homebuyer tax credits is the most obvious example of this effect.\n\nAllow me to use both hands again: on the one hand, downbeat news has commanded much of the spotlight recently, but on the other hand there are developments I would put in the positive news column. Let me cite some of these.\n\nCorporate earnings: in the second quarter, companies in the S&P 500 reported average year-over-year earnings growth of 38 percent.\n\nBusiness balance sheets: larger businesses are generally in good shape after trimming losses and improving their balance sheets. As opportunities present themselves, these businesses will be able to move quickly to seize them.\n\nBusiness investment in equipment and software: largely because of deferrals during the recession, this form of business capital spending has been strong, in excess of a 20 percent annualized rate during the first half of 2010.\n\nManufacturing: Wednesday's Institute for Supply Management report on manufacturing conditions showed continued expansion. By this measure, the U.S. manufacturing sector has expanded for 13 consecutive months.\n\nConsumer confidence: the Conference Board's consumer monthly confidence index released Monday posted a modest gain after falling in recent months.\n\nBank balance sheets and lending terms: many banks continue the process of repairing their balance sheets. And banks participating in the Federal Reserve's most recent Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey (mostly larger institutions) reported easing of credit terms for commercial and industrial loans.\n\nClearly, the news isn't uniformly negative. In addition, there are economic indicators that deserve to be interpreted on both hands. For instance, the personal savings rate of U.S. households has been well above historic norms for most of the year. Rising savings advances the necessary rebalancing of consumer and household finances after a period of consumption fueled by excessive leverage, but, of course, savings take away from current consumption needed for recovery. In this case, a long-term virtue is a short-term vice.\n\nAmong the likely causes of the elevated savings rate is the unambiguously negative fact of high unemployment. The news this morning did not substantially change the picture.\n\nJoblessness is taking a significant toll on household spending, even households untouched by unemployment. In an environment where the psychology of consumers and businesses is fragile, weak data cannot be completely dismissed even when—as I would suggest—the weakness is temporary.\n\nMelding all this mixed information, my basic view of the economy has not changed, but my perception of risks has shifted somewhat to the downside.\n\nPolicy decision from August FOMC meeting\nIt was this perspective—a perspective I'd characterize as moderate optimism tempered by acknowledgement of weaker conditions and greater downside risk—that I carried into the last FOMC meeting on August 10.\n\nAs the minutes issued Tuesday of this week depict, the FOMC was presented with the possibility that the Fed's balance sheet might shrink more rapidly than previously predicted as mortgage-backed securities (MBS) mature or are prepaid.\n\nTo briefly review, the Federal Reserve's balance sheet was expanded rapidly from about $900 billion to $2.3 trillion between September and December of 2008. This expansion mostly funded emergency lending facilities designed to counteract acute stress in various credit markets. As those loans expired, they have been largely replaced by purchases of government and agency securities, including $1.25 trillion of agency MBS and $300 billion of Treasuries. These purchases injected liquidity into the economy and helped shape an environment of lower long-term interest rates.\n\nOver the course of last year, purchases offset the runoff of direct loans such that the size of the balance sheet remained more or less constant. Earlier this year—at a time when the economy appeared stronger than it has recently—the FOMC decided to let the balance sheet slowly shrink with MBS runoff.\n\nAt the last meeting there were two important considerations as I saw it. First, as already discussed, some economic data came in weaker than expected, shifting the balance of risks to slower growth in the near term and further disinflation. Second, the Fed's holdings of MBS were projected to decline faster than previously thought because lower rates were generating heavy mortgage prepayments and refinancings.\n\nSo, in the context of a softening economy, the FOMC was confronted with the prospect of unintended withdrawal of support for the recovery through a decline in the level of liquidity provided to the economy.\n\nMonetary policy is, at present, quite stimulative and appropriately so, in my opinion. It's entirely possible that the effects of some decline of current accommodation would have been negligible. But a small precautionary action to avoid any risk associated with inadvertent tightening was prudent, in my view, in the midst of disappointing economic indicators.\n\nThat is how I interpret the decision announced following the August meeting—a small tactical change designed to preserve the level of liquidity provided to the system. I supported the committee's decision, but I do not view it as a fundamental change of outlook or strategy. I do not believe this change necessarily heralds the beginning of a period of further expansion of the Fed's balance sheet. Nor do I think the decision precludes a return to a policy of allowing the balance sheet to shrink on its own.\n\nI think the decision has been over-interpreted in some quarters. These interpretations, along with alarmist commentary about deflation and a double-dip recession, are feeding an exaggerated sense of foreboding.\n\nNegative sentiment will dissipate\nLet me sum up. As I see it, the economy has slowed somewhat but remains on a gradual recovery track with all that implies for top-line growth for businesses and employment.\n\nThe recent economic softness reflects the choppy, sometimes uneven transition that occurs when the economy is shifting from public stimulus to improving private demand. The economy, in my view, is experiencing a temporary downshift.\n\nI believe the economy continues to improve in certain fundamentals and continues to strengthen defenses against a shock. The financial system continues to heal. There are signs that availability of credit is easing. Households continue to reduce debt, and businesses are increasingly resilient.\n\nAs the economy continues to grow, even at a modest pace, and adverse shocks don't materialize, negative sentiment will dissipate. By the end of the year, I expect the economy will look and feel better than today.",

            "content": "Rotary Club of Baton Rouge\n Baton Rouge, La.\n June 30, 2010\n\nI appreciate the opportunity to speak here at the Baton Rouge Rotary. I'm in my third year as a Rotarian and have spoken at a number of Rotary Clubs across the Southeast. I figure the four-way test ensures a friendly audience even when my message must be a sober one and isn't thoroughly upbeat and inspirational.\n\nI know the ongoing oil spill in the Gulf dominates attention here in Baton Rouge. Indeed, I believe it has come to affect the confidence and sense of control of Americans throughout the country. I'll comment further on the oil spill's economic impact later in my talk.\n\nIt's been just a week since the Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting in Washington. In the days running up to the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings, my colleagues and I take stock of the national economic conditions and outlook as a baseline for deliberations on policy. Today I'd like to walk you through my version of that stock taking, updated slightly to take account of the economic news of the past week.\n\nThe central question is whether the recovery that is now well under way will be sustained or will falter, resulting in a slowdown or even a second recession—the so-called double dip.\n\nAs I said, this will be my own version of the economic picture. As is always the case, I am speaking for myself—my views may not be shared by my colleagues on the FOMC or in the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe risk of inflation\n I'd like to start by talking about the risk of inflation. Price stability is half of the Fed's dual mandate; maximum employment is the other. I'd characterize the current state of inflation as low and reasonably stable.\n\nThere are several measures of inflation—headline versus core, CPI versus PCE, wholesale versus retail—and a number of ways to massage the numbers for insight into subtrends and underlying causes. But no matter the measure, it's difficult to discern much broad-based price pressure today.\n\nRecent retail price trends have evidenced further disinflation, the intermediate condition between rising inflation and deflation. During a period of disinflation, the pace of price increases slows and the rate of inflation declines.\n\nThe rate of core consumer price inflation has declined from 2.5 percent as recently as two years ago to an annualized rate of around 1 percent over the past 12 months. Commodity prices have fluctuated up and down in response to global supply and demand, but again it's hard to interpret the rise of some commodity prices as a broad-spectrum, one-directional phenomenon.\n\nLikewise, the measures we have of forward-looking inflation expectations are stable and relatively low. Surveys of households about their inflation concerns have shown little upward—or, for that matter, downward—tendency over the past few years. Inflation predictions that are priced into some government bonds also don't seem to signal a problem.\n\nIn the business arena, very few firms have much in the way of pricing power in the current economy. This limitation stems from the weight of excess capacity, sometimes called economic slack. Reasonable economists—I know a few—can debate the amount of slack at any given time, but I think both the hard data and the consensus of the Atlanta Fed directors and many other business contacts point to considerable slack at work.\n\nIn manufacturing, while the percent of capacity in use has been rising, the current share is quite low and still about 8 percentage points under prerecession levels.\n\nAs regards wages, the high level of unemployment has limited workers' negotiating power. As you know, nearly 10 percent of the labor force is counted as unemployed, and an almost equal number count as underemployed.\n\nTo sum up, I don't see inflation as much of a current worry. If anything, there is a small risk of deflation that must be monitored. Limited inflation allows focused attention to recovery and growth, which I'd like to turn to now.\n\nRecovery and growth\n A fairly widespread national economic recovery—seen across most sectors and geography—has been proceeding for almost a year. The pace of growth was strongest in the fourth quarter of 2009, which helped achieve a growth rate of almost 4 percent in the second half of last year. The economy has apparently downshifted a bit in the first half of 2010. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth for the first half of the year is now expected to come in around 3 percent.\n\nThe story of the climb out of recession is one of an evolving mix of factors contributing to growth. The transition last year from recession to recovery was helped by federal government stimulus. Stimulus spending is still at work but is much less forceful in 2010 compared with 2009. Fourth quarter 2009 growth was supported by a slowing in the pace of inventory liquidations. In the first half of 2010 we've seen rising consumer spending, rather strong business investment, and very strong growth of manufacturing production.\n\nLet me elaborate on each of these factors.\n\nRising consumer activity surprised many in the first quarter of the year, but in April and May consumers seemed to put away their wallets to a certain extent. According to some analysts, the strong first quarter spending represented pent-up demand coming out of recession, and the apparent pause reflects the return of a more cautious attitude influenced by stock market gyrations and other worrisome developments, even including the oil spill. Yesterday it was reported that the Conference Board's estimate of consumer confidence, based on the attitudes of 5,000 households, fell sharply in June, wiping out the confidence gains seen in the prior two months.\n\nBusiness spending on equipment and software has been strong in the first half of the year. Again, analysts have interpreted this performance as a sign of pent-up demand following deferrals in 2009 when so many businesses put a stop on everything but essential spending. Shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft, a rough proxy for business spending on new capital equipment, rose 1.6 percent in May alone, indicating an annualized double-digit rate of growth.\n\nManufacturing production is up about 8 percent over the past year through May. Almost every manufacturing industry has posted strong growth during that period, with double-digit gains across a number of durable goods, including metals, machinery, computers, and motor vehicles. Keep in mind that these industries bore a disproportionate amount of the pain associated with the recent recession, and current production is still well below peak levels.\n\nIn addition to these three factors in the recovery story over the past year, another factor I should mention is the supporting role of productivity growth. The pace of growth of productivity in the broad economy has been very strong coming out of the recession—5 to 6 percent annualized. This increase explains, at least partially, an improvement in output devoid of much progress on unemployment. Employers have increased hours of work recently but have been hesitant to hire. Businesses are making every effort to squeeze as much production as possible out of their downsized workforces and are pursuing productivity gains from reorganization, automation, and supply chain streamlining. These strategies were formulated during the recession and continue.\n\nHere's a key point about these contributors to recovery—each could be transitory. The economy has not yet arrived at a state where healthy and sustainable final demand is underpinning growth.\n\nI make this point not to predict a reversal of the progress made but just as a cautionary reminder to avoid counting chickens too early. There are sectors that remain in a very depressed condition—housing, for example.\n\nRecent numbers suggest a sharp slowdown of residential real estate market activity with the expiration of the homebuyer tax credit. Home sales fell sharply in May, with new home sales plunging to their lowest level in the history of the data—47 years. Inventory problems could weigh on house prices and construction activity for some time.\n\nThe most sobering aspect of current economic reality is the employment picture. I referenced earlier the national level of unemployment being close to 10 percent.\n\nUnemployment peaked at just over 10 percent last October and has remained stubbornly high since then in spite of the economy's growth. The most recent job creation data were discouraging. While total nonfarm payroll jobs grew by 431,000 in May, much of that hiring was for temporary Census work. Private sector employment grew by only 41,000. On Friday we'll get the employment report for June, and it's anticipated that about 240,000 census workers were pared from federal payrolls. Analysts hope that additional private sector employment will replace about half of those job reductions.\n\nAll this said, I believe the recovery will move ahead at a modest pace and unemployment will gradually come down. Impediments to growth are being removed. Financial market function is being restored. Private balance sheets are being repaired. And necessary structural adjustments are under way.\n\nThe past few weeks, however, have seen a slight retrenchment from the mind-set of optimism and growing confidence that prevailed earlier in the year.\n\nOne reason is the numbers. The first quarter was apparently a little weaker than previously thought. Just last week, the growth rate of real GDP was revised down from 3 percent to 2.7 percent. The estimate of consumer spending on services was lowered, as were measures of net exports and investment in equipment and software.\n\nUncertainty and risk\n More influential, in my opinion, is the heightened sense of uncertainty and risk surrounding the outlook.\n\nIn your businesses and in the general economy, at any point there is more or less visibility into the future. To be sure, significant uncertainty accompanies any economic forecast. Think of a \"cone of uncertainty\" projected forward from today and encompassing a variety of plausible scenarios or narratives.\n\nRecently that cone has splayed wider. Several recent sources of uncertainty have clouded the outlook. I will cite four, including the oil spill in the Gulf.\n\nFirst is European sovereign debt. What started as a threat of default on public sector debt obligations of certain European countries (Greece, Portugal, Spain, Italy, and Ireland) has spread to European funding markets, both euro and dollar. Risk aversion has brought liquidity pressures onto European banks.\n\nOur financial system here in the United States has rather small and manageable direct exposure to the Greek government and the other sovereign borrowers. But as the situation has evolved, exposure to European banks as well as foreign and local corporations in the affected countries has complicated the estimation of risk.\n\nThe concern is that continuing and possibly escalating financial market pressures will be transmitted through interconnected banking and capital markets to our economy. There is also the potential effect on our export markets of a stronger dollar and weaker European economies.\n\nIn its June publication, one-third of the economists in the Blue Chip panel of forecasters indicated they had lowered their growth forecast of the U.S. economy over the next 18 months as a consequence of Europe's debt crisis. This situation is still evolving.\n\nA second source of uncertainty is ongoing state and local fiscal tightening. State budget gaps are expected to widen this year and in 2011 as federal support recedes. By one estimate, next year's budget gap for all states is expected to peak at $144 billion. Closing these budget gaps means spending less and taxing more. This situation is our nation's very immediate analog of the public finance pressures being felt in Europe.\n\nA third area of uncertainty is commercial real estate. Banks across the country, especially small and regional banks, are heavily exposed to the commercial property sector and face a heavy docket of loan restructurings that may require sizable write-downs.\n\nIt's not yet clear how much pain might be imparted to the overall economy by loan losses of banks and investors from the downward revaluation of commercial properties. Views vary on how severe a problem is developing and whether it will require an organized comprehensive resolution effort to avoid widespread damage to the economy.\n\nAnd there is the oil spill, which is, naturally, the central environmental and economic concern here in Louisiana and more broadly in the Gulf region. Its effects are falling most severely on individuals employed in commercial fishing, recreation and tourism, and deepwater drilling as well as businesses and suppliers associated with those industries. So far, the measurable economic effects have been mostly local and regional.\n\nAs was the case in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, the oil spill brings two main risk factors for the national economy—the impact on energy supplies and transportation. To date, the supply of natural gas and refined petroleum products has not been significantly disrupted. Importantly, the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP) is open and functioning normally. And key transportation facilities remain operational, although shipping has had to navigate around the slick.\n\nThe economic effect at the national level has been limited. I'm prepared to believe, however, that this relentless environmental disaster is an additional factor holding back consumer and business confidence. The spill disheartens us all and, I believe, makes the public a little more reticent to assume a smooth recovery path.\n\nThoughts on policy\n So, to pull this together, a recovery of the national economy is proceeding but not yet with solid and sustainable underpinnings. Inflation appears restrained. The outlook from here is beset by somewhat more than normal uncertainty. There is a chance of overachieving forecasts of moderate growth and gradual reduction of unemployment, but at the same time there are notable risks. In my view, these circumstances suggest caution in moving away from policies designed to give the economy the best possible prospect of recovery with full employment. Adjustment of monetary policy will be needed eventually, but this is not the time.\n\nRecent developments make me even more convinced that current policy is appropriate. Financial markets and many businesses are more nervous today than a few weeks and months ago, and it's my view that monetary policymakers should hold to a guarded policy stance and evaluate carefully the risk and reward of a change of policy.\n\nAll deeply distressing experiences—whether national economic and financial crises, regional environmental calamities with associated economic pain, or traumas on a personal level—are followed by a strong impulse to return to normal. This urge also holds for our central bank. Normalization of interest rate policy and the size and composition of the Fed's balance sheet is much desired, but I believe conditions at this moment call for patience.",

            "content": "Alabama Bankers Association\n  Annual Convention\n  Braselton, Ga.\n  June 4, 2010\n\nAs we  all know, the past few years have been very difficult for banks in the  Southeast—especially here in Georgia and, to a lesser extent, in Alabama. Of  the 246 bank failures nationally in the past three years, 73 have been from the  Atlanta Fed's six-state region. Virtually all these failures have been  community banks.\n\nI  realize there are representatives of some large regional banks in the audience.  But because this audience is predominantly community bankers, I'd like to address  my remarks mostly to you.\n\nI have  been a banker, but never a community banker. That said, I think I have a pretty  good appreciation of the challenges your business presents.\n\nDuring  my remarks this morning I want to share some views I've formed from recent  experience. I doubt I will say anything you don't know or haven't heard before,  and I expect we're on the same page regarding some of my observations about  community banking. I'll also comment on some lessons that apply particularly to  those of us in the regulatory community, including the Federal Reserve.\n\nAs  always, these views are mine alone and don't necessarily reflect the views of  my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal  Reserve System.\n\nEconomic situation\n  To  provide some context, I'd like to begin with an overview of the economic and  banking situation in the Southeast. It's worth noting parenthetically that our region  serves as an excellent economic proxy for the whole country, so I frequently  make the claim in Washington that economic intelligence from the Sixth Federal  Reserve District has relevance to the nation overall.\n\nIn  general, the Southeast's economy continues to rebound. A growing body of  evidence suggests a sustainable recovery is under way. Regionally, that recovery is not yet well  established.\n\nRetail  merchants in the region continue to experience increased traffic and sales, and  their outlook has become more optimistic.\n\nHomebuilders  indicate that new home sales softened recently but remain above very low levels  compared with this time last year. Residential real estate agents, including  those in Alabama, report a recent increase in existing home sales.\n\nCommercial  property markets continue to experience falling rents and rising vacancy rates.  Challenging conditions persist, especially in the retail and office markets. One  area of good news is the multifamily category in general. This property type is  stabilizing after three consecutive months of rent growth.\n\nThe Southeast's  manufacturing and transportation segments continue their steady rebound as new  orders and production grow.\n\nLabor  market reports are generally more positive than in 2009 and earlier this year,  though unemployment remains high. Most Southeastern states, including Alabama, reported  job gains in April. Unemployment declined modestly in April in most Southeastern  states. The unemployment rate in Alabama was 11 percent in April—down a bit  from the first quarter but still well above the national unemployment rate.\n\n  I  believe it is fair to say that, taken as a whole, the region's economy is improving.\n\nSoutheast banking update\n  I have  said repeatedly that stabilization of financial markets is a precondition of a  return to economic growth. Here in the Southeast, the banking industry still  needs more time to heal. To generalize, I believe that banks are stabilizing  and, although not improving rapidly, not getting significantly worse as a group.  That said, as I look forward, more bank failures in the region are likely.\n\nConditions  at community banks in the Southeast remained weak during the first quarter of  2010. While in better shape than a year earlier, about a third of district  banks had negative return on assets in the first quarter. Annualized net charge-offs  have declined, however, from record high levels at the end of 2009. Bank asset  quality remains a concern because the recovery is not well established in many  industries, the restructuring and workout of commercial mortgages is still  substantially ahead of us, and unemployment remains high.\n\nLoan  demand is soft. Lending across the six states in our district fell last quarter  by more than $20 billion from a year earlier. Declines were led by ongoing  runoff—in some cases intentional—in construction and development (C&D),  commercial and industrial (C&I), and consumer lending. Some new loan  production has occurred with the migration of borrowers from large banks to  community banks.\n\nDeposit  growth has been healthy. Some growth of demand deposits has come from marketing  efforts. Other growth in demand deposit accounts has occurred because of  corporate cash accumulation, which is likely to get drawn as business activity  picks up.\n\nAlabama banks\n  Alabama  bank profit performance has improved modestly in the past year. Aggregate  return on assets (ROA) in Alabama rose 20 basis points to 0.41 percent, and the  percentage of unprofitable institutions declined to 17 percent.\n\nThis  performance is far short of early 2007 (the days before the recession). In that  period, ROA was above 1 percent and only 5 percent of banks were unprofitable.\n\nAsset  quality for Alabama banks deteriorated in early 2010 compared with last year. Annualized  net charge-offs rose to more than 1 percent of total loans, and 4 percent of  loans were noncurrent in the first quarter.\n\nLessons from recent experience\n  I joined  the Fed in March 2007, just a few months before the financial crisis and  subsequent recession began to develop. It's been a trying period for everyone. We've  all learned a lot. I can't possibly do justice in a short talk to all the  banking and regulatory lessons of this period. So I'll put forward five basic  points: three about banking and two about supervision and regulation.\n\nFirst, concentrations are deadly. The most  fatal concentrations for community banks have been in real estate, particularly  residential construction and development loans.\n\nStepping  back, I think it is a concern that, industrywide, secured real estate loans as  a percentage of overall loan portfolios have been growing for decades. This trend  has been driven in part by the migration of corporate borrowers to securities  markets. I would argue that C&I lending capability has atrophied to a  degree as a consequence. In the most recent reading we have, half of small  banks across the nation had more than 73 percent of their total loans secured  by real estate.\n\nConcentrations  in construction lending particularly have been a problem. Southeast banks that  have failed or are now in trouble had higher levels of construction lending as  of year-end 2003 and then greatly expanded lending in this area during the  housing expansion after 2003.\n\nIn  Alabama, construction and development loan exposures are on the decline. In the  first quarter of 2010, C&D-to-total assets stood at just over 10 percent,  down 4.6 percentage points from two years earlier but still well above levels  in the early 2000s.\n\nIn  contrast, commercial mortgage exposure among Alabama banks continues to rise. In  the first quarter of 2010, commercial mortgage loans stood at just under 20  percent of total assets. Between 2003 and 2008, commercial mortgage loan  exposures averaged less than 17 percent.\n\nIt's  fair to ask: Given the painful consequences of overexposure to residential and commercial  real estate, why did bankers and regulators allow a concentration to build in  this area of lending?\n\nThe  answer I often hear from bankers is because it's there. There's not a lot  else—there are not a lot of other lending opportunities. Bankers cite  competitive realities, ease of valuation, and abundance-of-caution collateral  as the underlying logic of this real estate bias. Direct real estate lending is  more available and, in my interpretation, easier than C&I lending to small  and midsized businesses, the natural business banking niche of community banks.\n\nAs  credit scoring models have improved, national and regional banks have  successfully competed for small business commercial and industrial loans. In  this competitive situation, bankers may perceive that a loan backed by real  estate collateral is easier to evaluate than one that requires an intensive  individual analysis of the borrower's business plan and expected future cash  flow.\n\nUpdate on small business lending\n  I just  referred to small business C&I as a natural market niche of community  banks. The Atlanta Fed's research department—leveraging contacts from our  Regional Economic Intelligence Network—recently conducted a survey of over 300  established small businesses in the Southeast. The survey focused on credit  availability and usage. I thought you might find a summary of responses  interesting.\n\nFor one  thing, banks are these small businesses main source of financing. Bank loans  and lines of credit trump credit cards, home equity lines of credit, and  personal credit as a source.\n\nLarge  national and regional banks more often compete for non–real estate secured  C&I loans. We found that construction and real estate firms are more likely  to seek credit from a regional or community bank.\n\nAt the  moment, loan demand is soft. Thirty-eight percent of firms surveyed sought  credit in the first quarter of 2010 while 42 percent plan to seek credit over  the next six months.\n\nThose firms  that sought credit recently were most often looking to refinance an existing  loan or obtain additional working capital. Firms planning to seek credit over  the next six months mentioned business expansion, acquisition of another  business, or purchase of real estate as their financing need.\n\nFinally,  we found that of those firms applying for credit, about half received all or  most of the financing they sought.\n\nClearly,  there are challenges to recapturing the C&I niche, but there also are  opportunities.\n\nRealistic growth goals and reduced  reliance on wholesale funding\n  Let me  return to lessons from recent experience. My second basic point is speed kills.  Trying to grow too fast can overwhelm organizational capacity, resulting in  deterioration of discipline. Growth in banking results from general economic  growth in the community, competitive share capture, and, of course, expanding the  geographic footprint. In my view, it is very hard to grow at a pace much above  the general growth rate of the area's economy without either assuming undue concentrations  or gaining share at the expense of competitors, typically accomplished through  relaxed standards. Share capture of loan assets too often is a wolf in sheep's  clothing.\n\nBank  assets historically—over a 30-year period—have grown in nominal terms 6.7  percent a year, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC). During  the real estate boom of 2003 to 2006, banks grew on average by 10 percent. Banks  that failed often grew faster. In Georgia, for instance, non de novo banks that  eventually failed grew on average by about 30 percent during that period.\n\nMy third  point is hot money can burn you. Often, rapid growth brought dependence on  wholesale funding, another factor that distinguished troubled banks in the  recent period. From 2003 to the present, many banks now considered troubled entered  this period with a greater dependence on wholesale funds and became even more  dependent during the housing bubble.\n\nAlabama  banks' reliance on net noncore funding increased substantially prior to and  following the onset of the recession, with the median net noncore funding  dependence ratio rising from a low of just under 20 percent in 2003 to nearly  30 percent in 2009.\n\nCore  deposits form a more stable base on which to grow and build franchise value and  serve as a healthy constraint to excessive asset growth. Many years ago—1974,  to be precise—I filed away in my head the warning that the farther away a bank gets  from consumer deposits, the greater chance it has to be blown away by changing  market sentiment. I think this idea still holds.\n\nSupervisory lessons \n  So far,  my observations have focused on banks. But I'd also like to make some comments  that apply to the regulatory community.\n\nMy first  point concerns de novo bank charters. Between 2000 and 2008, 112 new  institutions were established in Georgia. By comparison, 26 opened in Alabama. I  believe new bank charters have been granted too liberally, and the entry bar  needs to be raised.\n\nI will note  that the Federal Reserve is not a bank charter granting agency. We get involved  when a bank holding company is to house the new bank or if they choose to be a  state member bank.\n\nSome of  the recent bank failures grew out of an investment concept that looked  something like this: Take experienced—but sometimes narrowly  experienced—regional bankers who left their former employers as a result of  consolidation. These executives would capitalize the bank with private investor  money with a medium-term investment horizon, put together a business plan with  what turned out to be optimistic assumptions regarding deposit growth, loan  origination and diversification, and then grow the bank aggressively with the  intent to sell to a larger bank in five or six years.\n\nToo  often management deviated from the business plan at an early stage when their  starting assumptions proved to be unrealistic. As regulators, we've learned we  need to be more realistic in our assessment of proposed business plans and less  tolerant of deviations from those plans. This observation connects to my final  point—how bank supervisors define their task.\n\nWe regulators  need to broaden supervision from point-in-time solvency and compliance evaluation  to include a more strategic, forward-looking, anticipatory, and holistic  evaluation of the bank's operating mix. The Fed is working to incorporate a  horizontal approach (looking across institutions) and to become more multidisciplinary.  We are, for example, involving economists and others with specialized expertise  in asset and funding markets. The objective is to realistically assess not only  the current condition of the banks we supervise but also their future  prospects.\n\nThe challenge of the community  bank business model\n  As I  said at the outset, I think I have some appreciation of the broad challenge top  managers of community banks face. I see it as management of an imperfect  business model. No business model is flawless, but community banking presents  particular challenges.\n\nThe  competition from larger regional and national banks for commercial and  industrial lending relationships, mortgage origination, and consumer deposits  requires community banks to trade on local knowledge and ties and highly  responsive service. Community bankers must find a workable balance of often  conflicting pressures. You must originate earning assets from a limited  geographic market without excessive concentrations. To achieve a spread of  risks, you often are forced to diversify your asset mix beyond your known  market. You have to marshal underwriting capability across a variety of  borrowers with limited human resources.\n\nIn so  doing, you have to strike a balance between soft criteria-based, relationship  lending and hard criteria-based analysis of a limited set of opportunities. And  you must compete hard for core deposits—often competing on rate and thereby  compressing margins—in order to fund growth without undue reliance on volatile  wholesale funding. And you don't need to remind me you have regulators to deal  with. I know your job is not easy, and I appreciate the demands—sometimes  competing demands—you are under as community bankers.\n\nLet me  close with this thought: As bankers and regulators, it's our collective  responsibility to heed the lessons of recent experience and get it right going  forward to ensure a healthy, well-functioning banking system for our  communities and our nation.",

            "content": "Atlanta Technical  College\n  Business and  Industry Breakfast\n  Atlanta, Ga.\n  June 3,  2010\n\nThank you for the opportunity to speak at the college's annual business and industry breakfast. I want to congratulate Atlanta Technical College on being named the best community college by Washington Monthly. ATC certainly deserves such praise, but I think community and technical colleges in general deserve praise for their essential role in so ably preparing students for America's always fluid and still weak employment market. I am aware that a high percentage of community and technical college students are older than 30. In the case of ATC, almost 45 percent are over 30 and more than 21 percent are over 40. ATC and its sister institutions do a tremendous service in upgrading the skills and retooling workers in our economy and smoothing the adjustments—both macroeconomic and personal—that are necessary in a dynamic, open economy.\n\nThis morning I want to focus on what might be viewed as a puzzling and frustrating aspect of the economic recovery that is under way. Most indicators suggest that overall economic activity stopped contracting and began growing again starting around July 2009. So the economy is approaching 12 months of sustained recovery, and yet not much has happened in employment markets to reduce the high level of joblessness. How can that be? During the last three quarters, gross domestic product (GDP) has expanded at an average annualized rate of 3.6 percent. Current estimates point to GDP growth of around 3 percent in the current quarter. These numbers are not off-the-charts strong, but they represent solid aggregate economic performance. Why haven't we seen rehiring accompany this growth? Why hasn't employment recovered at the same pace as the overall economy? Well, employment always lags recovery to some extent. Following the previous two recessions, where recovery has been modest, we've seen weak job growth.\n\nThe answer also lies in a surge in labor productivity growth, that is, output per hour of work. This productivity growth has allowed the economy to expand and firms to record better sales and profits without yet adding many workers to payrolls. Historically, productivity has always been strong just after recessions. So the pattern we're seeing is not abnormal.\n\nRecently my staff and I have been trying to gauge the sustainability of recent strong productivity growth and its impact on prospects for reduction of unemployment. In the long run, labor productivity growth is the friend of all of us. It fuels broad-based improvement of living standards. Short term, productivity gains may be the nemesis of those whose prospects depend on job creation.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's monetary policy mandate from Congress is to pursue both maximum employment and low inflation. The possible tension between productivity and employment is a subtext of the larger story of economic growth and inflation and the question of whether there is a short-term tradeoff between the two. So I will try to connect the employment and productivity outlook to my views on appropriate monetary policy.\n\nI should emphasize that what you'll hear this morning are my personal views. They are not necessarily shared by my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nEconomic summary\nLet me set the scene with a quick summary of current economic conditions. As stated earlier, the broad national economy is in recovery as indicated by GDP growth for almost a year.\n\nIn the middle of last year government spending stimulated most of the economic growth. In the fourth quarter of 2009 and the first quarter of this year, inventory adjustments drove a lot of economic activity. Consumer activity over the last few months has exceeded the expectations of many analysts. This activity has occurred even while American households continue to deleverage, that is, pay down their debt. Business investment in equipment and software has been surprisingly strong considering the consensus forecast of modest growth ahead. Both consumer spending and business investment in capital goods may just be evidence of short-term and temporary satisfaction of pent-up demand following deferral of spending during the recession. The end game of this evolution is solid and broad-based final demand.\n\nAlthough, as I have suggested, risks remain to a forecast of sustained growth, I think confidence is warranted. The mix of sources of strength underpinning the recovery will evolve. Former contributors to growth will beget new contributors.\n\nAs a consequence of the growth we've seen and the positive outlook, employment market conditions have begun to improve. Payroll employment is estimated to have risen by about 560,000 during the first four months of this year.\n\nWe will get another important reading on employment markets tomorrow. Even if that report shows further gains in employment (some forecasters expect 500,000, with 400,000 being U.S. Census jobs), it's fair to say there will remain a large excess of workers looking for jobs relative to the demand for workers in the economy. Total jobs lost in the recession and immediate aftermath approach 8 million. This gap is likely to close only gradually. And, further, the resulting slow growth of wages and salaries has the potential to limit growth of consumer spending for a while.\n\nI'll round out this snapshot of the economy with a couple of comments on inflation. Because of the downward pressure exerted by the recession and the relatively modest recovery so far, the rate of consumer price inflation has slowed quite a lot. This recent disinflation has not yet translated into decline of longer-term inflation expectations. Most measures of inflation expectations have remained pretty stable. Overall, for now, the inflation picture is not a major concern, in my view.\n\nSo, to sum up, we've had growth of the economy and improvement in jobs markets. Among the factors pushing the economy forward—along with personal consumption, business investment, and inventory effects—is labor productivity. I'd like to take a deeper look at this element of economic progress and its relationship to employment.\n\nRole of productivity as an element of economic growth\nTo simplify a bit, there are two causes of labor productivity growth. The first is improvements to technology that help people work better. The second is people working harder. People might be working harder because the companies they work for have cut employees in response to tough economic times and are trying to keep production levels, revenues, and earnings up with fewer people. Technological improvements tend to be durable, but squeezing more and more out of a diminished and, in many cases, reorganized workforce may not be sustainable.\n\nIn recent months, the U.S. economy has enjoyed especially strong productivity growth in the business sector (averaging 6 percent per quarter over the last three quarters versus the long-run average of 2.6 percent). I suspect that much of this productivity growth is of the second, work-harder type. Many employers reacted to the downturn by aggressively cutting their workforces, reorganizing remaining workers, and cutting other costs. They have reacted to the upswing by holding employment at or near recession levels, seeking efficiencies in supply chains, investing in labor-saving automation, and generally tweaking their business models to operate more efficiently than before the recession. We've heard this story frequently in anecdotal accounts of our directors and business contacts across the Southeast.\n\nAs long as efficiency and productivity gains can be achieved in this way, employers may remain hesitant to hire. So a key question with immediate relevance for the recovery and employment is, how long can firms ride this productivity growth before having to yield to new hiring to support greater activity?\n\nInternational comparison\nBefore venturing a view on that question, let me frame an international context for better perspective on the ups and downs of labor productivity in this country. Even though the timing and extent of the economic downturn were similar in most advanced economies, resulting labor productivity patterns have varied widely. For instance, in the United States the level of GDP declined by 3.7 percent, while the unemployment rate rose 4.5 percentage points during the recession. By contrast, in Germany the cumulative GDP decline was about 6 percent, while unemployment rose by only about 1 percentage point. Germany—and several other advanced economies—experienced a serious recession but a significantly smaller increase in unemployment in comparison with the United States.\n\nIt's striking that the United States, even in good times, tends to see much greater flows into and out of unemployment rolls than other countries. This is an aspect of the vigorous turnover of jobs in our economy—the regular destruction and creation of jobs in a dynamic market economy. Other countries tend to experience relatively less such movement in labor markets over time. Their experience probably reflects institutional factors such as social laws that make separating employees more expensive and lower quotients of entrepreneurial activity.\n\nIt can be argued that the comparative absence of labor market rigidity in the United States results in comparatively large movements over time of workers between industries and sectors and across geography. We in the United States simply have more flexible employment arrangements across the economy, allowing employers to adjust rapidly and aggressively to downturns and requiring workers to be agile in response to changing conditions.\n\nThere is a point to be made for the benefit of ATC students here: Beyond the specialized skills you are acquiring in the college's excellent programs, there will be a high return to work skills that make you versatile and mobile—for example, computer and IT skills.\n\nOutlook for labor productivity and employment\nTo return to the question I posed earlier, slightly rephrased: Will high productivity growth continue and have the effect of impeding employment growth?\n\nI do not expect the recent outsized productivity growth to continue indefinitely and become a new, permanently higher trend rate. Some degree of \"wait and see\" behavior is at work and is no doubt reflected in the productivity numbers. With growing economic momentum, deferral of hiring will become riskier.\n\nSome employment gains should result as labor productivity levels out and falls back over time to something resembling the historic trend rate. But the pace of hiring is likely to be gradual. Current data on the use of part-time workers suggest that businesses have some scope to increase hours without hiring new full-time employees. And there are other, more structural obstacles to the rapid reemployment of the jobless. Some jobs in the construction sector and certain manufacturing industries are likely permanently lost, requiring some amount of migration of workers to other sectors. And, for a time, skill and geographic mismatches may frustrate employers willing to hire.\n\nAlso, the weight of uncertainty about the future business environment makes a gradual pace of employment progress a reasonable assumption. I hear often from members of the business community that uncertainty regarding federal, state, and local fiscal fundamentals and regulatory rules-of-the-game are feeding reticence to pull the trigger on new ventures, new hires, and new investments. The recent European sovereign debt and banking pressures have added to uncertainty in financial markets.\n\nSizing all this up, I expect recovery in the medium term to be neither jobless nor job rich.\n\nAppropriate monetary policy\nAs the recovery proceeds—as I believe it will—a central concern of monetary policy will be when and by how much the Federal Reserve raises the base level of interest rates.\n\nThe Fed has held its interest rate policy at close to zero for about a year and a half. This has been done to foster conditions that would end the contraction of the economy and then encourage recovery. Again, I believe a modest recovery has been under way for almost 12 months.\n\nAs I stated earlier, the Fed has a dual mandate from Congress to keep inflation low and promote maximum employment.\n\nI've put forward the view that inflation is not currently a major concern. So one might ask, do you believe the base interest rate must remain near zero—at its current level—until unemployment is reduced substantially and most of the employment lost in the recession has been restored?\n\nI'm not convinced that will be necessary. I continue to support the current stance of interest rate policy. But the time is approaching when it will be appropriate to consider recalibrating interest rate policy. I do not believe that time has yet arrived. The conditions that require a change of policy are not yet at hand. However, as the economy continues to improve and financial markets find firmer ground, extraordinarily low policy rates will not be needed to promote recovery and will become inconsistent with maintaining price stability.\n\nThe implication is that the policy rate may have to begin to rise even while unemployment is considerably higher than before the recession. I'm very concerned about unemployment, and certainly employment trends should be a critical consideration in setting policy. But I accept that good policy, even in circumstances of unacceptable levels of unemployment, may incorporate higher interest rates.\n\nAgain, I want to acknowledge the vital role that Atlanta Technical College plays in our community in equipping young people, and some slightly older people, to prosper even in difficult times.

            "highlights": "How deeply should the government be involved in the mortgage finance system? Atlanta Fed financial economist W. Scott Frame discusses the issue in a speech to the Bankers Club of Chicago on May 27, 2010.",
            "content": "Bankers Club of Chicago\n Chicago, Ill.\n May 27, 2010\n\nOver the past several months, we have all been closely following the legislative process surrounding financial system reform. That process appears to be coming to a close as Capitol Hill looks ahead to a summer recess followed by midterm elections.\n\nNotably, an important set of issues relating to housing finance was largely not addressed in the recent legislative process. Chief among these is a reconsideration of the future scope of government involvement in our mortgage finance system—both in primary and secondary markets. I expect housing finance reform to be a legislative priority in 2011, driven primarily by a desire to resolve the uncertainty surrounding the future of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Together, these government-sponsored enterprises have already cost taxpayers over $111 billion.\n\nTonight, I would like to share my thoughts on redefining the scope of government involvement in secondary mortgage markets. In particular, I would like to outline some options for the conventional-conforming market historically served by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Please bear in mind that these are my own views and not necessarily those of the Atlanta Fed or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nCurrent government participation in mortgage markets\n I would like to begin by providing some background on the federal government's current participation in mortgage markets.\n\nThe federal government directly and explicitly projects itself into the mortgage finance space through the provision of FHA (Federal Housing Administration) and VA (Veterans Affairs) mortgage insurance and the guarantee of the timely payment of principal and interest on securities backed by such loans through Ginnie Mae (Government National Mortgage Association). These programs have historically been self-sustaining and are typically used by first-time and low- and moderate-income homebuyers. In 2009, FHA and VA mortgage insurance was obtained for about 25 percent of all mortgage originations, and Ginnie Mae accounted for 25 percent of all mortgage-related security issuance. These market shares are high by historical standards.\n\nSome analysts have identified potential issues with the FHA program that may ultimately result in significant cost to taxpayers. As a result, it is likely that we will see additional programmatic changes—especially in terms of underwriting standards and the financing of insurance premiums. Nevertheless, I expect that the FHA and Ginnie Mae will continue to play an important, but more limited, role in our mortgage finance system.\n\nThe government also participates in secondary mortgage markets—albeit in an indirect and more opaque way—through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These government-sponsored enterprises, or GSEs, are quasi-public/quasi-private financial institutions. On one hand, each was created by Congress and maintains an exclusive federal charter. On the other hand, shares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are traded on the New York Stock Exchange. This unusual governance arrangement results in two sometimes opposing corporate objectives: one, fulfilling certain social policy goals and supporting related political constituencies, and two, maximizing shareholder value.\n\nBy law, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are limited to operating in the secondary mortgage market. Their participation in this market takes two forms. The first is the issuance of credit guarantees against mortgage pools, called securitization. And the second is leveraged investment in mortgages and mortgage-backed securities. Today, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac together hold about $1.7 trillion in assets and have another $4 trillion in net credit guarantees outstanding. This $5.7 trillion in obligations reflects about one-half of all U.S. residential mortgage debt outstanding.\n\nSpecific provisions in the GSEs' charter acts have long created a market perception that each institution's debt and mortgage-backed obligations are implicitly backed by the U.S. government. Such perceptions significantly reduce the required yield on securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and some of these savings are then passed on to homeowners with conventional-conforming mortgages.\n\nAs we are all aware, once residential real estate prices began falling in 2007, the incidence of mortgage default and foreclosure increased dramatically. As a result, both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac became financially distressed in 2008—owing to their singular exposure to U.S. residential real estate and thin capital cushions. And following the deteriorating housing and mortgage market conditions, the availability of new mortgage credit receded both in terms of prices and quantities.\n\nThe federal government responded to this situation by placing both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into conservatorship and entering into senior preferred stock agreements with each institution. This intervention calmed bond market investors by effectively guaranteeing the GSEs' obligations—and thereby improving the flow of capital to the residential mortgage sector. Indeed, in 2009, conventional-conforming mortgages represented 65 percent of all originations; and together, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac accounted for 72 percent of all mortgage-related security issuance.\n\nSo, what next? \n The failure of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac provides us with an opportunity to redefine the federal government's role in secondary mortgage markets.\n\nOne option, of course, would be to simply recapitalize Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and \"return them to the wild\" through an initial public offering. If policymakers are inclined to go down this road, I believe it is important to consider certain changes. I will suggest four.\n\nFirst, I would like to see significantly increased capital requirements for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that are consistent with those faced by other regulated financial institutions. This measure will reduce perverse incentives for large volumes of U.S. mortgage-related risks to reside in only two institutions. My second recommendation is that GSE investment portfolios be strictly limited. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's massive balance sheets provide little social benefit in terms of liquidity and pose material risks to the institutions themselves and the financial system more broadly. A third suggestion is that any federal guarantees for GSE obligations be made explicit and priced by the government. This clarification will provide transparency and improve financial stability. Finally, I would recommend stripping out the GSEs' affordable-housing mission. Over the years, both institutions were market laggards in this area, and it is unclear whether these particular activities had any discernible effect on affordable-housing outcomes. In fact, some analysts have suggested that the GSEs' affordable-housing goals contributed to the institutional failures.\n\nIt is quite possible that policymakers will not simply resurrect Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac but instead will take a broader view about the desirability and structure of government intervention in secondary mortgage markets. I think that this would be a healthy discussion.\n\nIn terms of \"first principles,\" it is not clear that government-sponsored securitization is required for well-functioning mortgage markets. Nevertheless, there may be political pressure to insulate mortgage markets from significant external shocks and hence maintain stable access to mortgage credit over time. Recent testimony by administration officials seems consistent with this view. These same officials have also called for accurate and transparent pricing of any government guarantees, suggesting that any such guarantees would be explicit. Nevertheless, it is very likely that any government guarantees will be mispriced at least some of the time. If this were not the case, market participants would not seek them out.\n\nOne approach would be for the federal government to securitize conventional mortgages by issuing blanket credit guarantees for qualified mortgage pools. As mentioned before, Ginnie Mae already does this for mortgages insured by the FHA or VA. The benefit of this approach is that the explicit guarantee is directly controlled by the government, and recognition of risks and costs appears in the federal budget. However, the experience with government-run programs suggests that—relative to the private sector—such an operation would be less efficient and innovative and have difficulty retaining capable staff. Furthermore, the idea of having the federal government permanently take on a large fraction of U.S. mortgage exposure will strike many as just too much government.\n\nPerhaps more politically palatable would be some sort of hybrid public-private model that is structured differently than Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Some analysts have suggested having privately owned securitizers that would have access to priced government tail-risk insurance and be subject to safety-and-soundness regulation. Relative to the fully government model, this approach would likely bring greater efficiency and innovation as well as involve more private capital at risk and hence a smaller role for government. I believe that the main challenge with this approach would be the regulators' willingness and ability to limit \"mission creep\" as the institutions would have an incentive to expand the government subsidy.\n\nThere are several institutional considerations that would need to be tackled with a new hybrid public-private model.\n\nThe first issue is how to charter such entities—should they be created in statute, or should chartering authority be delegated to a regulator? On the one hand, \"first principles\" tell us that competition is good and through this process a natural market structure will evolve. In this case, a regulator would be imbued with the ability to issue an unlimited number of charters subject to the applicant meeting some reasonable minimum criteria. On the other hand, it has been argued that important standardization and liquidity benefits are much more easily achieved with few issuers. Moreover, it has been suggested that such limits would also reduce misrepresentation and fraud. These issues merit further study.\n\nA second issue is whether such entities would be required to be monoline firms (as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are today) or whether they could be affiliates or subsidiaries of other, diversified financial institutions. For example, should a large commercial bank be permitted to obtain one of these charters and securitize loan pools with explicit government backing? It is quite plausible that scope economies—or synergies—may exist between mortgage origination and securitization. However, allowing stock-owned financial institutions access to one of these charters may expand the safety net and further distort risk-taking incentives.\n\nA third and related issue pertains to permissible ownership structures. If these entities are to be monolines, should they be owned cooperatively by originators or as stock firms by public shareholders? Our experience with cooperatives suggests that such institutions have weaker risk-taking incentives, although stock purchase requirements would add to the cost of participation.\n\nFinally, no matter what the number and structure of these entities, we will need a regulator with political independence and broad authorities to limit taxpayer risk.\n\nIn terms of risk sharing, some analysts have suggested having the securitizer(s) purchase priced tail-risk insurance from the U.S. government that carries an explicit guarantee. However, there are some important additional questions to answer relating to the loss sharing between the private and public sectors on a pool of mortgages. For instance, what is the threshold at which the government tail-risk insurance is triggered? In instances where this level is below that of the mortgage underwriting standard and securitizers are thus exposed to risk, should some of this credit risk be shared by the mortgage originators? Put differently, should originators be required to have some \"skin in the game\" through a risk retention requirement? It strikes me that if such requirements are to be placed on private-label securitizations, one should consider similar rules for government-sponsored deals that face the same adverse selection problem.\n\nConclusions\n Now that financial regulatory reform appears to be in the home stretch, housing finance reform is likely to be an important legislative item in 2011. A central part of these efforts will be the resolution of the GSE conservatorships and a redefinition of the federal government's role in secondary mortgage markets.\n\nI believe that the most likely outcome is that the government will maintain a role by chartering privately owned securitization conduits that would be required to purchase government tail-risk insurance. Such conduits could actually include Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac—after each is restructured through a receivership process. They might also include the Federal Home Loan Banks or possibly even mortgage originators themselves.\n\nThe past few years have been exceptionally difficult for U.S. mortgage markets. Let us hope that the natural healing process, coupled with thoughtful changes in public policy, will lead to a much brighter future, a future where creditworthy borrowers have reliable access to mortgage credit and taxpayers are well protected.",

            "content": "Pensacola West Suburban Rotary Club\nPensacola, Fla.\nApril 15, 2010\n\nFor my remarks today, I plan to speak about the current economic situation and outlook and comment on some of my concerns as I assess the sustainability of the recovery under way.\n\nThe views I will express are mine and are not necessarily shared by my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nThe economy today \nThe economy is well into recovery, perhaps as much as 10 months. This view is based on quarterly gross domestic product (GDP) growth data as well as improvement in major economic indicators such as consumer spending, manufacturing activity, and job growth. Positive trends are evident in a number of data points that are the vital signs of the economy. I should add that anecdotal feedback from contacts across the Southeast and elsewhere conveys improving confidence.\n\nThe Atlanta Fed's base case forecast for the near term looks for growth to continue. The pace of growth will probably be somewhat slow. I expect moderate growth because the economy is working through some formidable adjustments that act as drags on growth.\n\nAt this juncture, financial markets—including many credit markets—are functioning effectively, but I should add that substantial deleveraging is taking place in the household and private business sector. This process is natural and healthy but is not painless or quick.\n\nThe lackluster pace of growth I'm expecting leaves the economy somewhat vulnerable to shocks or setbacks that might derail the recovery. At the same time, the recovery thus far has been a testament to the economy's capacity to move forward despite serious damage done by the recession and the repair required in its aftermath. So far, so good.\n\nHere in Pensacola a maritime military metaphor should be a comfortable device for exploring factors that could set back recovery. Looking out to the horizon, imagine a squadron of hostile torpedo boats aimed at us ashore. Today I want to address each of the threats I can identify at the moment and assess their individual potential to torpedo the recovery.\n\nHousing\nFirst, the housing sector. This sector was \"ground zero\" in the financial crisis, and the sharp falloff of construction and employment contributed greatly to the ensuing recession. It's a widely held view that stabilization of the home sales market—and the housing sector more broadly—is essential for a sustained recovery. I agree with that view.\n\nDuring the recession, we experienced large declines in residential construction, house prices, and sales. In recent months, the housing sector appears to have leveled out and is bumping along a low bottom.\n\nTotal housing starts have begun to make modest gains from their low point in April 2009.\n\nHome prices stabilized during the second half of 2009, and early readings this year have shown that prices are holding relatively steady, with slight declines and increases, depending on the market. Although foreclosures have abated somewhat, nearly a quarter of all residential properties with mortgages were in negative equity at the end of last year, a slight increase from a year earlier. Looming foreclosures could continue to dampen a rise of home prices.\n\nNew and existing homes sales rose sharply in the second half and then fell off just as sharply. The supply of homes for sale, as measured by months of inventory, declined during the second half of last year but then increased again.\n\nClearly, it is difficult to know with certainty the true health of the housing market in the absence of government support, specifically the homebuyer tax credit.\n\nMy overall conclusion is that we should not expect a full return to precrisis levels of construction activity, prices, or homeownership for some time. But I do think the needed housing sector stabilization is in process. And stabilization is a necessary precondition to rebuilding some of the sector's previous strength.\n\nCommercial real estate\nLet me turn to commercial real estate (CRE). I've been watching developing challenges in this sector for well over a year, and I think much of the adverse impact remains ahead of us. The loss of occupancy, the loss of operating cash flow, and the resulting loss of property value is colliding with loan maturities in banks and securities. Much restructuring is required.\n\nCommercial real estate is a general concern because of its potential spillover effects to the broad economy for at least the medium term. I have spoken in earlier talks about the linkage of CRE losses to the banking system—particularly small and regional banks—and credit flows to businesses and consumers.\n\nWe know it's going to be bad for the parties directly involved. The question is, How bad will the spillover effects be?\n\nLet me summarize the situation in commercial real estate. While delinquencies and loan losses on commercial mortgages are expected to continue to rise, there is evidence that some property markets are stabilizing.\n\nInvestment demand for certain property types appears to be increasing. Commercial mortgage originations steadily increased in 2009, and property sales increased toward the end of the year. There are indications that private capital is returning to commercial real estate markets.\n\nEven with the recent evidence of improvement, prices are down more than 40 percent from their peak. The decline in prices creates significant challenges for borrowers and lenders trying to refinance the $1.4 trillion in loans that are expected to come due over the next four years, half of which are currently underwater.\n\nThese problem loans will greatly strain banks whose balance sheets are heavily concentrated in CRE, and the FDIC expects the result to be more bank failures this year than last. Smaller banks will have the toughest time because of their greater relative exposure to CRE. The loan portfolios of small banks—with less than $10 billion in assets—have three times the exposure of CRE loans relative to their capital base compared with the exposure of larger institutions, with more than $50 billion in assets.\n\nSo, to return to the spillover question, my view today is that commercial real estate will be a drag on the economy but won't torpedo the recovery. In the context of the national economy, the problem is manageable and will be managed. I am encouraged that, so far, the stakeholders—borrowers, banks, creditor groups, and new investors—are working the problem and executing restructuring solutions.\n\nGreece\nA third concern arises from the daily headlines, and this is Greece and the European Union's (EU) handling of the Greek fiscal crisis. The news has alternated between comforting and disquieting almost on a day-to-day basis. The Greek sovereign debt story is a concern because it feeds anxiety about another shock to the global banking system—particularly European banks—as well as the potential of a broad retreat from sovereign debt exposure affecting interest rates and recovery prospects here in the United States.\n\nThe latest news is that EU leaders have agreed to a backstop plan—a combination of EU bilateral loans and International Monetary Fund assistance—that will be implemented if Greece runs out of market-oriented fund-raising options.\n\nRecently, the concern has centered on a potential bank liquidity crisis. Depositor and investor focus has expanded from the public sector alone to more general Greek exposure. At the moment, it is unclear how threatening these liquidity problems are.\n\nThe Greek fiscal crisis is unfolding in real time and remains, at this juncture, unpredictable. So far the problem has been isolated to Greece even though there are other countries under serious fiscal debt stress. A generalized investor retreat from sovereign debt has not materialized. The Greek drama has not threatened U.S. Treasury auctions, and the U.S. banking system has very limited direct exposure. However, the financial crisis has taught us that we can't be relaxed about stresses in financial markets, no matter how distant and isolated they appear to be.\n\nFor that reason, the situation should be watched carefully.\n\nState and local fiscal stresses\nCloser to home, there is appropriate concern about our own fiscal stresses and their possible negative effect on the recovery. I'm referring to fiscal problems at the state and local government levels in particular. The government sector overall makes up about 20 percent of GDP. State and municipal governments represent about 12 percent of GDP.\n\nState and municipal governments across the country are now implementing painful spending cuts and tax increases to close large budget gaps. The federal stimulus package, rainy day funds, and lowered contributions to pensions and other accounting adjustments have forestalled some of these cuts. But now—with a lag—the potential drag on local economies is materializing.\n\nStates still had budget gaps in excess of 10 percent for fiscal year 2010. As federal government aid to states is waning, states are working to close an additional 11 percent gap in the coming fiscal year and project shortfalls of a similar magnitude in 2012.\n\nAt the same time, cities confronted budget gaps of roughly 3 percent last year, according to a survey conducted by the National League of Cities. Because of lags in adjustments to the property tax digest and continuing declines in funding from state governments, cities aren't expected to begin recovery until 2012.\n\nDespite these challenging problems, I see state and local government belt tightening as a long-term drag on the recovery with varied effects at the regional, state, and local level, but not an outsized near-tem vulnerability. Fiscal adjustment is occurring, fortunately, in the context of a now growing private economy. Adjustment will proceed but shouldn't imperil broad improvement of economic conditions.\n\nPrivate spending\nPrivate spending will certainly have a big impact on the fate of the recovery. Private spending has two dimensions: personal consumption and business investment spending. The confidence that underpins consumer behavior is linked to employment conditions and household wealth. Growth prospects and the degree of medium-term uncertainty shape business spending.\n\nAs regards the factors influencing consumer spending, unemployment rose last fall to above 10 percent, the highest since the 1981–82 recession. Declines in home values and equity prices put significant pressure on the balance sheets of consumers. Through the fourth quarter of 2009, the net worth of households was about 18 percent below its peak in the second quarter of 2007.\n\nWhile consumer spending contracted sharply during the recession, the consumer is coming back. Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) rose in February for the fifth consecutive month.\n\nMuch depends on the labor market. Income follows employment, and consumer spending follows income. The jobs picture seems to be gradually strengthening. The private sector added nearly 50,000 jobs monthly on average during the first quarter of 2010, but, clearly, stronger growth is needed to bring down the unemployment rate.\n\nRecent data also suggest that the second component of private spending—business investment—is likely to continue growing. Spending on equipment and software grew at a solid pace in the fourth quarter, and durable goods orders, which are forward looking, suggest continued expansion.\n\nFor the general economy, I'm encouraged by growth in both categories of private spending. However, powerful forces are still restraining consumption and investment spending, and consequently I don't think it's realistic to expect spectacular growth in either in the coming year. But I do expect solid advances in private spending to be one of the key economic stories of 2010.\n\nInflation\nMy final concern is the risk of a surge in inflation and its advance warning, inflation expectations. Understand this is not in my forecast, but the concern is that unwelcome price developments could limit the Fed's ability to provide policy support for a gradual recovery.\n\nAs the global economy has moved into recovery, the prices of energy, metals, and other raw material commodities have risen. These market movements have led some analysts to fear greater pressure of pass-through of commodity price increases, which could add a cost-push dynamic to the inflation picture.\n\nWhile some categories of prices have gone up, aggregate measures of prices are indicating disinflation and not rising inflation. For example, yesterday's consumer price index (CPI) report indicated that retail price growth remains in check. The overall index for last month rose 2.3 percent on a year-over-year basis, and the core CPI was up just 1.1 percent.\n\nAdditionally, large amounts of resource slack have given businesses little pricing power, and underlying wage and price trends have continued to ease. Our directors and business contacts around the Southeast have confirmed anecdotally this view on current inflation pressures.\n\nDespite the lack of evidence of current inflationary pressures, some have expressed concern about the potential inflationary consequences of the Fed's very aggressive monetary measures taken in response to the financial crisis and recession. As a result of those measures, the Fed's balance sheet more than doubled in size.\n\nDiscussion among market participants and Fed observers has focused in recent months on whether the Fed can engineer a policy exit, that is, an optimal shrinking of the balance sheet. Much planning, market testing, and consultation has already been performed in anticipation of an eventual exit. I am very confident that the Federal Reserve will be able to manage the normalization of its balance sheet with appropriate timing and pace. I do not expect inflation to change the course of economic recovery over my forecast horizon.\n\nSo far, the public seems to agree. The stability of long-term inflation expectations, in my view, is signaling confidence in the Fed's ability to conduct a successful exit from stimulative policies.\n\nMonetary policy comments\nLet me close with some thoughts on the implications of the views I've expressed for the stance of monetary policy.\n\nAs a central banker, I keep a worry list. A good part of this talk has been a survey of my concerns. These points of vulnerability have been identified in recent months and weeks by many other public officials and commentators. Such public recognition of a problem, a risk, a vulnerability often sets in motion focused efforts to address it by a variety of relevant actors. And often the outcome is better than the original estimates of potential impact precisely because the problem is being worked.\n\nGiven the current state of the economy, I am very comfortable taking a personal position that is neither sanguine about these potential torpedoes nor unduly alarmist or defeatist. I take comfort that each big problem that is actionable is being addressed, and the recovery is moving forward. As I said earlier, so far so good.\n\nHaving said that, I believe the recovery requires continued support of accommodative monetary policy. I think there is risk associated with starting a process of tightening too soon. In my view, the strong medicine of low rates should remain in place to facilitate adjustment processes that are by their nature gradual.",

            "content": "Business Leaders Luncheon\nHartford, Conn.\nMarch 31, 2010\n\nAfter the deepest and longest recession in the past half century—a recession largely precipitated by a financial crisis in which the global financial system came close to unraveling—the U.S. economy is now in recovery. Today I want to discuss the prospects that the recovery will proceed forward—is sustainable—and the implications of the outlook I will present for perhaps the most vexing current problem coming out of the recession: unemployment. I will close by connecting these views to the direction of monetary policy.\n\nAt the outset I must emphasize that my remarks today will reflect my personal views only and don't necessary reflect the views of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nThe economic situation and outlook\nToday is the last day of the first quarter of 2010. I expect the first quarter to extend the recovery that began last summer and accelerated in the fourth quarter of 2009. Fourth quarter gross domestic product (GDP) growth was revised down a little last week but still was measured at 5.6 percent, a rather strong number. I don't expect growth of that strength to repeat itself in the first quarter. A big contributor to fourth quarter growth was the slowdown of inventory liquidation, in all likelihood a transitory phenomenon. When inventory liquidation slows, more activity is required to maintain inventory-to-sales ratios. For the first quarter, I expect a more moderate growth rate, a little below 3 percent.\n\nUnderpinning the continued growth we're experiencing is steady improvement in private spending in the United States. Private spending has two elements. The first, consumer spending, is expanding. Despite low levels of confidence and constrained access to credit, consumer spending, is growing at a moderate pace.\n\nThe second element is business spending on inventory and capital goods. This category of private spending has been rising quite briskly in recent months. Last week we got another positive reading for February but at levels that disappointed analysts. As a consequence, many forecasters revised down their estimate of equipment and software spending for the first quarter.\n\nNonetheless, business spending on equipment and software is helping to offset softer housing and commercial construction. Problems in the housing sector vary by location and have been especially acute in my part of the country, the Southeast. Nationally, the pace of home sales slowed late last year, and sales have eased further so far this year. Continued stabilization of the housing sector—especially house prices—is likely a precondition for sustained economic recovery.\n\nThe economy remains in a transitional phase from a period that depended on support of public sector programs to a period of resumed growth based on private spending. For the recovery to be sustained, we need consumers to consume and businesses to spend on inventory, investment goods, and human resources. Economic forecasts hinge on how formidable those positive forces will be and on the strength of countervailing headwinds.\n\nViews about the economic outlook fall roughly into two narratives. The more optimistic scenario is a V-shaped bounce back from severe recession. This has been the historic experience for the most part. In this scenario, growth exceeds the underlying long-term potential of the economy for a number of quarters, and unemployment declines at a steady pace. Both consumer activity and business investment show rising growth. Exports contribute meaningfully to GDP, reflecting growth of our principal trading partners, particularly in Asia. And the banking system navigates a troubled commercial real estate sector and expands credit to both businesses and consumers, fueling a rather strong recovery.\n\nBy contrast, the second scenario is a relatively modest recovery, with slow reduction of unemployment. Various headwinds hold back GDP growth. They include (1) a banking sector that is slow to expand credit in part because of weak loan demand and commercial real estate problems, (2) a weak state and local public sector that is adjusting to fiscal pressures by cutting expenditures and employees, (3) as referenced earlier, a housing sector that is slow to stabilize, and (4) an extremely cautious business sector as regards investment and hiring. You can add to this list the impact of some level of subdued consumer activity reflecting a more frugal mindset.\n\nIn our contacts with business executives, my staff of economists in Atlanta and I have been probing the questions that underlie the headwinds hypothesis. We have been getting a lot of anecdotal confirmation. As a consequence, our outlook is closer to the second narrative.\n\nPerspective on labor markets\nAs already suggested, an implication of this slow recovery scenario is the very gradual decline of today's unacceptably high rate of unemployment. For perspective, let me recount the movement of the official unemployment rate reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in my short tenure as a Fed policymaker. I became Atlanta Fed president in March 2007, just over three years ago. When I started, the unemployment rate was 4.5 percent. Today, the rate stands at 9.7 percent, down from a high of more than 10 percent in October.\n\nI view unemployment as a daunting economic challenge—and very likely a dominant political issue—of the period ahead. So, for the next few minutes, I'd like to attempt a deeper examination of the topic of unemployment.\n\nUnemployment is a multifaceted problem. I will comment on what happened to labor markets through the recession, the current state of employment and unemployment in the country, and what has to happen to bring unemployment down to its optimal level. I will touch on trends in labor force participation, underemployment, job destruction and creation, and structural dimensions of unemployment.\n\nEmployment situation\nFirst, let me relate what has happened since the start of the recession. Today, there are about 130 million payroll jobs in the United States, and that number is about 8.4 million lower than at the beginning of the recession. At its peak in January of last year, monthly job loss reached 779,000.\n\nIt's evident that a lot of jobs were lost. Job loss was very broad based, and the resulting unemployment has been of long duration. That said, men were disproportionately affected during this recession, specifically young men. Men's share of unemployment was greater than their share of the labor force.\n\nGiven troubles in the housing sector, it is not surprising that the construction industry has shed 26 percent of its jobs—a decline of almost 2 million jobs since the start of the recession. The manufacturing industry has shed 16 percent of its jobs, with an employment decline of 2.2 million, of which about one-fourth is related to declines in the housing sector. The construction and manufacturing labor markets are dominated by men, as reflected in their disproportionate increase in unemployment. These industries are unlikely to return to prerecession levels of employment any time soon. The challenge ahead is transitioning workers—whether men or women—to areas of growth.\n\nAbout 15 million people in the United States are unemployed. Of these, about 70 percent are covered by some type of unemployment insurance, and half of those are covered under federal extended benefit programs. These extended benefit programs are helpful to unemployed workers making a transition to new jobs. But the programs also may partially explain the unusually high and persistent unemployment rate, with some estimating the effect to be 1 percentage point or even higher.\n\nAlso, underemployment is prevalent. The underemployed include both discouraged workers (defined as people who want to work but are not currently actively looking) as well as individuals who are working part-time but want to work full-time. The unemployment rate that combines the fully unemployed and underemployed workers is about 17 percent.\n\nAnother indication of underemployment is reduced hours of work. Average hours of work per week are still well below prerecession levels although up from the lowest point seen last fall.\n\nDespite the weak state of labor markets, there are signs that the worst may be behind us. The rate of job loss is slowing. The rate of decline in payroll employment has been close to zero in the last couple of months. Also, while initial and continuing unemployment claims are at historically high levels, both have fallen.\n\nAnother bright spot is temporary employment. The temporary services sector shed more than 800,000 jobs during the recession but has seen a notable increase since last fall. This improvement is noteworthy as temporary employment is often viewed as a leading indicator.\n\nDeconstructing unemployment and labor market rigidities\nThe normal state of affairs in the country's labor market is a dynamic mix of separations from employment and new job creation. There are two causes of separations—layoffs and voluntarily quitting a job, or so-called quits. The BLS began collecting data on these factors in 2000.\n\nIn 2008 and 2009, layoffs surged. Fortunately, the number of layoffs per month has recently returned to prerecession levels.\n\nIn addition, quits are at a decade-low level likely in part because of the uncertainty of job availability.\n\nToday's slow pace of employment gains is due more to the slow pace of job creation, not the high rate of layoffs. Job gains, as conventionally understood, require two things: a vacancy and a worker able to fill that vacancy. For most of 2009, vacancies were relatively flat while unemployment continued to rise. This condition suggests the existence of what labor economists call \"match inefficiencies.\"\n\nThere are two key types of match inefficiency. One is geographic mismatch. In 2008, the percentage of individuals living in a county or state different than the previous year was the lowest recorded in more than 50 years of data. People may be reluctant to relocate for a new job if the value of their house has declined. In addition, many who would like to move are under water in their mortgage or can't sell their homes.\n\nThe second inefficiency is skills mismatch. In simple terms, the skills people have don't match the jobs available. Coming out of this recession there may be a more or less permanent change in the composition of jobs. Skill mismatches require new training, and there is evidence that adult education institutions have responded to this need. For instance, officials at Miami-Dade College in Florida, which is the largest college in the country and a grantor of associate and vocational degrees, told us they have recently seen a strong increase in enrollment, especially of men in their 20s.\n\nThis evidence of retooling is encouraging, but, to be realistic, structural adjustment takes time.\n\nProspects for labor market recovery\nLooking forward, the consensus forecast for March is that the economy will add 200,000 new jobs. That number includes a boost from temporary government hiring for the census.\n\nHowever, according to an Atlanta Fed estimate, we need to add about that number to payrolls each month for the next year to bring unemployment down a full percentage point. This estimate assumes that the growth in the labor force stays in line with the growth in the population.\n\nAll things considered, labor market trends appear to be headed in the right direction. But it's quite possible the recovery could be well advanced before any significant reduction of unemployment materializes. It's also quite possible circumstances justifying the start of a cycle of policy tightening will develop well before the unemployment rate has found a satisfactory level.\n\nA realistic level might be above the level I saw when I joined the Fed. I do believe the structural rate of unemployment has risen. Calibrating monetary stimulus to a goal of bringing unemployment fully to prerecession levels would be a mistake.\n\nSo let me now comment on how I'm thinking about the relationship between the Fed's employment mandate and monetary policy.\n\nImplications for monetary policy\nAs you know, monetary policy is highly accommodative. And I think this stance is appropriate at present. I continue to support the substance of the policy the FOMC articulated in recent meetings. That is, economic conditions warrant a low federal funds rate target for an extended period. Markets are highly interested in the meaning of \"extended period.\" I don't think it is appropriate to talk in terms of a specific timeframe or number of meetings. As long as inflation remains subdued and inflation expectations anchored, a key factor for me is improvement of employment markets.\n\nGoing forward, I will be looking for signs that employment gains are likely to repeat and accumulate and, once achieved, are likely to be durable.\n\nWhat might such signs be? One indication would be that the process of job creation is improving. In January, we saw a sizable increase of job openings, according to the BLS. I'm looking for that to become a trend. A second sign would be a decline in the measured rate of underemployment. And the third sign would be a string of employment gains large enough to appreciably move the unemployment rate down over time.\n\nThere are hopeful, if tentative, signs of improvement in employment markets. We have a long way to go, and for that reason I believe it is premature to assume an imminent reversal of the Fed's accommodative policy. But you can interpret the fact that I am here discussing the conditions under which such a reversal will be appropriate as an indication of my conviction that we are, finally, moving in the right direction.",

            "content": "Naples Council on World Affairs\nNaples, Fla.\nMarch 22, 2010\n\nThis afternoon, I will give you an update on the U.S. economy and comment on conditions in the global economy that affect this country. I'll also offer views on the interplay between fiscal uncertainty here and abroad and appropriate monetary policy to achieve both growth and control of inflation.\n\nThe views that follow are mine alone and don't necessary reflect the views of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nCurrent economic juncture\nFirst, the national economy: I expect first quarter gross domestic product (GDP) growth numbers will show the economy continues to recover. The recovery began last summer and accelerated in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter growth was driven by what I believe was the transitory phenomenon of slowing inventory liquidation. Most forecasters expect the first quarter to clock in at a slower but quite respectable pace of around 3 percent, and I agree with that view.\n\nUnderlying continued growth is a steady improvement in private spending in the United States. Consumer spending is expanding modestly.\n\nBusiness spending on equipment and software is helping to offset softer housing and commercial construction.\n\nHere in southwest Florida, you are well aware of the challenges faced in housing. In Naples, house prices have declined 64 percent from their peak in the second quarter of 2006 and have yet to stabilize.\n\nNationally, home sales slowed late last year, and sales have eased further so far this year. Continued stabilization of the housing sector—especially house prices—is likely a precondition for sustained economic recovery.\n\nAlthough job cuts in the United States appear to have tapered off in recent months, the share of jobless receiving extended unemployment benefits has continued to grow. Last month's U.S. unemployment rate remained very high at 9.7 percent.\n\nAnother gauge of the labor market is the percentage of people who, along with the unemployed, have stopped looking for work—so-called discouraged workers—as well as those who are working fewer hours than they want. The combined unemployed and underemployed figure is about 17 percent of the workforce.\n\nWith job growth negative to flat, real incomes have stagnated. Total personal income, including transfers from the government, has grown modestly, but income from wages and salaries has declined from a year ago.\n\nTo give a context for these domestic developments, let me comment on the international environment in which our economy is evolving. Overall, the outlook for the global economy continues to improve, and international trade has rebounded sharply.\n\nEmerging Asia is driving the global rebound, led by China and India. China's economic growth has been especially strong, lifting global demand for raw materials and capital goods. Latin America has weathered this global crisis much better than previous downturns thanks to stronger economic fundamentals. The region is further benefiting from rising commodity prices.\n\nMeanwhile, recoveries in key developed economies, which still account for the largest share of our export market, have been much less dynamic. Japan's economy has fallen back into deflation, and its economic growth trajectory remains very uncertain. Europe's recovery is fragile as concerns mount about Greece and other countries with large fiscal burdens. I'll discuss this topic more in a moment. Overall, despite the notable divergence in growth rates between developed and emerging economies, the global economy is expected to expand at a solid pace this year, continuing to provide support for U.S. exporters.\n\nLooking ahead, the central question for the United States is how strong the recovery will be and how long it will take to reduce unemployment.\n\nViews about the economic outlook fall roughly into two narratives. Scenario one is the familiar V-shaped, strong bounce back from severe recession. In this scenario, growth exceeds the underlying long-term potential of the economy, and unemployment declines at a steady pace. Both consumer activity and business investment show growth. Exports contribute measurably to GDP, reflecting growth of our principal trading partners, particularly in Asia. The banking system successfully navigates a troubled commercial real estate sector and expands credit to both businesses and consumers, fueling a rather strong recovery.\n\nBy contrast, the second scenario is a relatively modest recovery, with slow reduction of unemployment. Various headwinds hold back GDP growth. They include (1) a weak banking sector that is slow to expand credit in part because of weak loan demand and commercial real estate problems, (2) subdued consumer activity reflecting a more frugal consumer mindset as well as restricted consumer credit, and (3) extremely cautious business investment in both inventory and capital goods.\n\nMost forecasters see a future resembling the second narrative. My forecast—and that of my staff at the Atlanta Fed—is close to the second narrative. The recovery under way seems at this juncture to be tentative and fragile.\n\nGreece and fiscal uncertainty\nMy staff and I typically incorporate known, somewhat quantifiable risks into our forecasts. I referred to these as headwinds. They are factors we expect to be drags on growth. There are other plausible emerging scenarios that are not factored into my formal outlook. I monitor these for evidence that they're materializing—becoming real—and need to be more formally considered. One such concern is what might be called \"fiscal uncertainty.\"\n\nYou've all been reading about Greece and the European Union's handling of the Greek fiscal crisis. At the moment a nexus of fiscal uncertainty is the situation playing out in Greece.\n\nLast October, the government of Greece revised its 2009 fiscal deficit sharply higher to more than 12 percent of GDP. Consequently, the ratio of public debt to GDP was revised up by 17 percentage points this year to 125 percent of GDP.\n\nInvestors around the world are concerned about Greece's deficit and rising debt. Market pressures, along with European Monetary Union mandates, have forced the government to present a credible plan to tame its deficit. As of today, how this will play out is not clear.\n\nIt's worth considering whether this is just a distant development or one with relevance to us here in the United States. What do fiscal problems in Greece have to do with my economic outlook for the United States?\n\nI see three ways the Greek crisis might directly affect the U.S. economy. First, adjustment across the EU to fiscal problems could dampen euro area growth and constrain U.S. exports to that region. The European Union as a whole is this nation's largest export market. Second, related to this, safe haven currency flows from the euro into dollar assets could cause appreciation of the dollar and hurt U.S. export competitiveness. Third is the possibility that the Greek fiscal crisis could lead to a broad shock to financial markets. This could play out in the banking system or in the form of a general retreat from sovereign debt.\n\nAt this point, these possibilities are not factored into my outlook in any way. But developments around the Greek situation deserve rapt attention.\n\nWe have our own set of fiscal uncertainties in this country—at all levels of government. The National League of Cities projects that municipal governments will face a shortfall of $56 billion to $83 billion from 2010 to 2012. Local governments in this country are pressured by lower sales tax revenues and shrinking property tax digests along with other demands.\n\nOn average, state-level governments began fiscal year 2010 with a revenue-expenditure gap of 17 percent. Three states had expected budget gaps in excess of 40 percent. Florida's budget gap going into the current fiscal year (2010) was 23 percent.\n\nAcross the country, state governments have responded to these strains by drawing down rainy day funds, raising taxes, cutting budgets, and furloughing employees.\n\nTo date, some amount of spending cuts and tax increases at the state level have been avoided thanks to the federal stimulus package, but that infusion of money is temporary. It appears state budgets next year will need to shrink considerably to get to balance.\n\nI'm sure you're familiar generally with the situation at the federal level. According to the Congressional Budget Office, under current law federal budget deficits rose from an average of about 2.4 percent of GDP in the period from 1970 to 2008 to 10 percent in 2009. No budget path currently under consideration would keep the public debt from growing relative to gross domestic product. Clearly, an ever-rising debt-to-GDP ratio is unsustainable and a matter of great concern.\n\nGovernment finances are severely strained at all levels. All of these fiscal pressures represent another downside risk for the broad economy. But I see a connection to inflation risk as well. Let me explain.\n\nThe FOMC met last week. In that meeting the federal funds rate target was kept at the \"low as it can go\" range of 0 to 25 basis points. Also, the Committee, in its post-meeting statement, said that economic conditions are \"likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.\" This policy is obviously very accommodative, and, in my opinion, is appropriate for a recovery that is tentative and facing headwinds.\n\nPolicy dilemma forming\nBy congressional mandate, the Fed in conducting monetary policy must balance support for economic growth and the associated goal of bringing down unemployment with pursuit of price stability—low inflation. In my view, the current accommodative stance of policy is not inconsistent with the dual mandate as long as inflation expectations remain well anchored.\n\nIn these times of fiscal uncertainty I am concerned about the possibility of a monetary policy dilemma developing. If you, the public, become convinced nothing will be done to restore the federal fiscal balance, especially at the federal level, this skepticism may be reflected in inflation expectations. You may come to believe that the only plausible scenario is inflating our way out of the problem.\n\nIf such a situation begins to develop, the Fed will face a difficult trade-off between continued support for the recovery and aggressive action to reanchor inflation expectations.\n\nFor the time being, inflation expectations are holding steady, and incoming data suggest price pressures are muted. It is hard for me to summon much concern about inflation in the immediate future. Almost all measures of core inflation show indications of disinflation. But this pattern could shift. As a policymaker, I have to pay constant attention.\n\nInflation expectations as critical factor for policy\nIn my view, the capacity to maintain interest rates at the level appropriate to support the recovery depends critically on containment of inflation expectations.\n\nThe Greek drama we're watching with such great interest should heighten recognition of the urgent need here in the United States for a credible path to fiscal sustainability. Rising public awareness of the country's serious fiscal imbalances should serve as a call to action.\n\nThe nation has successfully navigated such challenging circumstances in the past and can do so again. With a credible fiscal plan, monetary policy should be able to remain supportive of the recovery that I'm confident will build in strength.",

            "content": "New York Association for Business Economics\nNew York, N.Y.\nMarch 3, 2010\n\nIt's an honor to speak to the New York Chapter of the National Association for Business Economics (NABE).\n\nThere was a light moment in a recent Fed meeting when staff reported back the collective assessment of Board and Reserve Bank seniors of the degree of uncertainty we're now facing regarding the economic future. The consensus was (is) that uncertainty at this juncture is heightened relative to history. One of my colleagues asked, \"Has there ever been a time when the answer was anything other than uncertainty is higher than in the past?\"\n\nThe country is now living out a postrecession, postcrisis story. If I were to put a title on the story it would be \"Recovery and Reform.\" We're in an early chapter of the story, and the ending is uncertain—quite uncertain.\n\nIn this unfolding story, I see three subplots: (1) the recovery, (2) regulatory reform, and (3) the long-term rebalancing of economic fundamentals. These subplots can be treated as distinct, but I see linkages. Today I will comment on each individually and explain how I perceive the intersection ofrecovery, the regulatory reform deliberations in Congress, and longer-term rebalancing. My aim in this speech is to speak plainly and put forward a connective logic of what otherwise could be considered separate stories.\n\nI must emphasize these are my personal views that are not necessarily shared by my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nRecovery\nLet me first discuss the outlook for recovery. In thinking about the possible trajectories of the recovery, I have been using the sorting device of two competing scenarios to sharpen my observation and interpretation of incoming indicators. This approach is admittedly simplistic, but I find it useful to evaluate incoming data as consistent with one or the other scenario.\n\nThis group is very familiar with both scenarios. Scenario one is the familiar V-shaped, strong bounce back from severe recession. In this scenario, growth exceeds the underlying long-term potential of the economy and unemployment declines at a steady pace. Both consumer activity and business investment show growth. Net exports contribute measurably to gross domestic product (GDP), reflecting growth of our principal trading partners, particularly in Asia. The banking system successfully navigates a troubled commercial real estate sector and expands credit to both business and consumers, helping the recovery.\n\nBy contrast, the second scenario is a relatively modest recovery, with slow reduction of unemployment. Various headwinds hold back GDP growth. They include (1) a weak banking sector that is slow to expand credit in part because of commercial real estate problems, (2) subdued consumer activity reflecting a more frugal consumer mindset as well as restricted consumer credit, and (3) extremely cautious business investment in inventory and capital goods.\n\nAgain, these two basic views of the world are familiar to you as they are also captured in the latest NABE forecast.\n\nMy current forecast—and that of my staff at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta—lines up with the second scenario, the modest recovery scenario.\n\nThe incoming data through last week have not made me alter my basic forecast, but I consider it still too early to make a definitive call on which scenario will play out. The January numbers, as you may know, have been mixed. Consumer spending was strong for the month, while business spending on capital goods was weak, and job growth was flat. Upside surprises in inventories, capital spending, and consumption could tip the scales in favor of a stronger growth forecast. I will be particularly attentive, watching for evidence of these developments as the recovery proceeds.\n\nBecause I hold to this forecast of modest recovery and believe inflation is likely to remain subdued, I fully support the message of the most recent FOMC statement to the effect that the fed funds target rate will remain exceptionally low for an extended period.\n\nRegulatory reform\nMeanwhile, Congress is deliberating financial regulatory reform. Proposals for comprehensive reform are being formulated in the Senate. Deliberation over the future configuration of public agency roles is taking place in an atmosphere of popular anger at perceived regulatory failures and taxpayer-funded bailouts as well as inflamed Main Street–Wall Street animosity.\n\nPublic outrage at economic and financial developments since the summer of 2007 is understandable and should not be ignored. But—easy to say, hard to do—I feel we would all be well served to get beyond the anger of the moment and on to a sober, realistic, and forward-looking thought process about how to avoid another crisis or respond to an incipient crisis. To my mind, the question is how to erect the strongest defenses against a recurrence—in other words, how best to assure future financial stability. Answers must consider what went wrong in the past but also—with some humility—likely future sources of financial instability.\n\nUncomfortable as it may be, a responsible working assumption is that another crisis will occur at some point in the future. This assumption is not intended to be a forecast; rather, it's an anchoring statement to bring a cautionary perspective to the task of regulatory reform.\n\nI would further argue that reform should be grounded in realism about the character of the global financial and banking system going forward as well as the ability to legislate away some disagreeable aspects of that reality.\n\nLet me elaborate. I will make five points. First, systemic risk is real, even if hard to define. And systemic risk is transnational reflecting the global network reality of money flows, securities distribution, and counterparties to financial contracts.\n\nSecond, the presence of banks and financial institutions too big, too connected, and too operationally critical to fail is likely to be a condition to be managed for some time while efforts are undertaken to eliminate the problem.\n\nThird, some amount of moral hazard accompanies the necessary safety net in place as a defense against temporary illiquidity of individual institutions and any accompanying financial instability. The Fed's role as lender of last resort is a central element of that safety net.\n\nFourth, the shadow banking system will remain. Not all systemically influential financial activity will take place in regulated entities.\n\nFinally, financial players will continue to innovate. Market participants will naturally seek advantage, and some competitive advantage comes from new financial instruments and products.\n\nIf you take these points as realistic, I think you might also agree that no one can guarantee that there will be no future crises or predict with any certainty future sources of trouble. Regulatory reform legislation can be thought of as an exercise in fortifying defenses against inevitable future stresses and problems.\n\nThe first line of defense against excessive risk-taking and imprudent firm management will continue to be the prudential discipline of firms themselves along with market discipline.\n\nThat said, the Fed must play a central role in a defense structure designed to prevent or manage future crises. My key argument is the indivisibility of monetary authority, the lender-of-last-resort role, and a substantial direct role in bank supervision. Only the Fed can act as lender of last resort because only the monetary authority can print money in an emergency. To make sound decisions, the lender of last resort needs intimate hard and qualitative knowledge of individual financial institutions, their connectedness to counterparties, and the capacity of management.\n\nThere is sentiment in Washington that would separate these tightly-linked functions that are so critical in responding to a financial crisis. Removing the central bank from a supervision role designed to provide totally current, firsthand knowledge and information will weaken defenses against recurrence of financial instability. Flawed defenses could be calamitous in a future we cannot see.\n\nWhatever configuration of agency roles and responsibilities emerges from deliberations on regulatory reform, those arrangements must, in my view, guard and preserve the capacity to act decisively in the broad national interest in an emergency.\n\nLong-term rebalancing\nLet me now touch on the topic of long-term rebalancing, which is another way of saying the addressing of economic fundamentals. Again, this audience is quite familiar with fundamentals that are out of balance. Most prominent are the fiscal balance, the external balance, and perhaps also the balance of investment and consumption.\n\nRecovery is possible if these fundamentals are left untouched, but such a recovery is unlikely to prove durable. A scenario in which deep imbalances are ignored would set the stage for the return of problems in the real economy in a few years.\n\nThe state of public sector finances is chief among the weak fundamentals. It is difficult for me to see a stable future without a credible path to fiscal sustainability. Failure to convincingly articulate such a path could lead in time to fear of monetization of federal debt—the belief that inflating away the problem is inevitable.\n\nFailure to address persistent weak fundamentals will increase the likelihood of wrenching adjustment and another financial crisis in the future. Major imbalances delineate the geologic fault lines of the world financial system, and they weigh on the minds of market participants. History has demonstrated that obscure incidents and minor parties can set in motion a destructive dynamic. In my professional lifetime, I've witnessed Herstatt, Penn Square, the Thai Baht, and subprime mortgage-backed securities. We cannot know what will trigger the next crisis or when—even if—it will happen.\n\nTo my mind, the aim is a durable recovery and prevention of a recurrence of financial crisis accompanied by deep recession. Flawed regulatory reform will weaken crisis defenses, and neglect of imbalances will increase the country's vulnerability to a replay of recent history.",

            "content": "Augusta Metro Chamber of Commerce\nAugusta, Ga.\nFeb. 18, 2010\n\nI'm honored to be asked to speak at the Augusta Metro Chamber of Commerce annual meeting. I appreciate this opportunity to meet with the business leaders of Augusta. The Southeast, despite the severe recession, still accounts for a significant share of the country's economy. Our region today closely parallels the overall national economy in industry composition and economic behavior, so our soundings in various cities across the region tell us much about current reality as businesspeople like you are living it. Your input is very valuable in the policy process, so I look forward to your questions and comments at the end of my remarks.\n\nI became a central banker and policymaker almost three years ago. Through the period since March 2007 I have been living that old Chinese curse \"may you live in interesting times.\" In my experience, at every juncture of the financial crisis, the resulting recession, and the now-developing recovery, we at the Fed have faced an uncertain outlook with a very tricky set of issues.\n\nThis juncture is no different. Tonight, I will share my views on the current economic situation, the factors that could influence the trajectory of recovery, and, as a result, the Fed's policy decisions in coming months. These are my personal views and don't necessarily reflect those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System or on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nPrimary credit rate announcement\nEarlier today, the Fed announced an increase in the primary credit rate. The primary credit rate—also called the discount rate—is the rate at which the 12 Federal Reserve Banks across the country provide temporary liquidity to healthy banks. How should today's announcement be interpreted? I would not interpret this action as a tightening of monetary policy or even a sign that a tightening is imminent. Rather, this action should be viewed as a normalization step.\n\nSpecifically, the Fed increased the spread between the discount rate and the top of the targeted range for the federal funds rate by a quarter point to 50 basis points and shortened the term of such loans to overnight. The federal funds rate (often shortened to \"fed funds rate\") is the overnight rate at which banks lend excess reserves or borrow required reserves for deposit at the central bank, the Fed. Targeting this rate is the primary tool of monetary policy.\n\nIn two steps, beginning in August 2007, the Fed reduced this spread from its precrisis level of 100 basis points to 25. These actions, along with several other policy moves, were taken to stabilize the banking and financial system. Today's action is another example of the removal of the special credit and liquidity facilities put in place in response to the financial crisis.\n\nA number of those special credit or liquidity facilities targeted at specific money markets during the financial crisis expired at the end of January. In addition, the Term Auction Facility, or TAF, which at its peak provided $493 billion of short-term loans to banks, has shrunk to an announced $25 billion; the last scheduled auction will be March 8. In addition, the Fed's program of purchases of mortgage-backed securities has tapered off and will close at the end of March. All of this is happening because stress in the financial system has abated.\n\nMy point is that the public and markets should not misinterpret today's move. Monetary policy—as evidenced by the fed funds rate target—remains accommodative. This stance is necessary to support a recovery that is in an early stage and, in my view, still fragile.\n\nState of recovery\nThe recovery is likely in a transitional phase from an economy heavily buttressed by government support—both Federal Reserve programs and fiscal programs—to an economy propelled by private-sector business investment and consumer demand.\n\nPositive signs in the economic data indicate that this transition is under way. For example, new orders for manufactured goods are growing, including orders for core capital goods. Industrial activity is improving, and, in fact, we learned yesterday that manufacturing output in January rose by a rather strong 1 percent. Consumer spending increased 2 percent in the fourth quarter of last year at an annualized rate, and retail sales were positive in January.\n\nThe overall housing sector is in a mixed state but with some encouraging news. Construction spending appears to be steadying after severe declines. Inventories of existing and new houses have fallen substantially. New home inventories have stabilized, and existing home inventories are still falling. The National Association of Realtors pending home sales index ticked up in December. House prices in most markets seem to have stabilized.\n\nHowever, I should add that this is the national picture. In a recent survey conducted by the Atlanta Fed as part of our regional intelligence-gathering process, Southeastern builders and realtors reported improved buyer traffic in January, but the current and projected sales picture softened. The situation in our region is not quite so positive.\n\nBut, on the whole, we've got a recovery going, and there are reasons to be hopeful for sustained growth. The question is, At what level?\n\nOutlook—two narratives\nI see two competing narratives about how this recovery will play out. Growth in the fourth quarter of 2009 was quite strong and raises hope for a robust recovery. In this, the first narrative—that of a traditional sharp bounce-back following a deep recession—growth exceeds the underlying long-term potential of the economy and unemployment declines at an accelerating pace.\n\nIn this narrative, businesses rebuild inventory levels and resume capital expenditures in anticipation of growing sales. Consumers regain confidence, and retail spending grows briskly. You can add positive export growth as the economies of our major trading partners—especially in Asia—also show better growth.\n\nFinally, in this narrative the banking system successfully navigates a weak commercial real estate sector and starts expanding credit to both business and consumers.\n\nThe alternative narrative entails some fundamental changes in business practices and consumer habits. In this scenario, businesses have learned from the recession that they can operate permanently at leaner inventory levels and flat or lower employee head counts. And the impressive worker productivity gains measured in recent data continue to accumulate.\n\nConsumers, in this narrative, have assumed a quite different mind-set compared to the precrisis, prerecession \"normal.\" Chastened by the recession and high unemployment—consumers are simply more frugal and more inclined to save. And even if consumers wanted to resume prerecession spending habits, the consumer finance industry, in this narrative, will not accommodate previous levels of consumption.\n\nIn this narrative, growth continues, but at a very modest pace, and unemployment is very slow to recede. The first narrative is a return to something resembling normal as we knew it; the second narrative describes a somewhat new and different world.\n\nThe Atlanta Fed's base case outlook\nThe question is, Which world are we in?\n\nWell, I'm not entirely sure. My late wife, when she heard me say \"I'm not entirely sure,\" would reliably fire back \"you mean you don't know.\" She had a way of cutting to the essence.\n\nIn my view, we're at an uncertain juncture and must watch closely for indicators in coming months to discern which reality is playing out. Indicators will include retail sales, inventory and capital investment, and, importantly, job creation and hiring.\n\nMy team of Atlanta Fed economists and I are forecasting the second narrative. We are forecasting a lower-growth, more gradual recovery with slow progress on unemployment. Our outlook gives weight to some challenges facing the economy and the banking sector that we believe may constrain recovery.\n\nLet me highlight three factors I will be watching closely.\n\nFirst, as has been widely publicized, the U.S. economy grew at a very healthy annualized rate of 5.7 percent in the fourth quarter of last year. A number that high would suggest a rapid-growth narrative, but most observers do not expect this pace of growth to continue through this year.\n\nMore than half of the growth surge in the fourth quarter came from the slowing of inventory liquidation. In the arithmetic of GDP calculation, slower destocking means more sales are coming out of production than out of inventory. Once liquidation has run its course, a kick to GDP from inventory changes would require more rebuilding. Because I'm not forecasting a substantial rebuilding of inventory, I don't expect to see much inventory effect in GDP growth in 2010.\n\nI've heard anecdotal comments from retailers that they have been willing to forgo sales to avoid an unwanted building of inventory. This inventory caution could very well continue. On the other hand, if uncertainties lift, businesses may be less inclined to give up revenues for inventory cost savings. If significant inventory replenishment does occur, growth could be much stronger this year than my forecast suggests.\n\nA second factor is just the atmosphere of uncertainty and the effect this has on business investment. What are the uncertainties weighing on business decisions, especially capital expenditure decisions? I would cite problems in the commercial real estate sector that could compromise the repair of credit markets and banks and, as a consequence, business access to credit. I would also cite public policy coming out of Washington in areas such as health care, tax, regulation, and the federal deficit.\n\nBusiness spending slowly trended up through 2009 from a quite negative growth rate at the beginning of the year to a barely positive growth rate at the end of the year. Because of the cloud of uncertainty, my forecast does not include much further improvement of capital spending in 2010. But again, if some of that uncertainty lifts, business spending could push the economy higher.\n\nThe third and maybe most important factor I'm watching is the labor market. I expect a very slow recovery of employment markets and, therefore, a slow decline of the unemployment rate. But it's worth noting that as the recovery got under way in the second half of last year, businesses relied on productivity enhancements to expand production and were able to defer hiring.\n\nA shift from productivity-driven expansion to jobs-driven expansion could materialize as benefits of earlier cost and head-count reductions reach their limit. The additional hiring that would follow would likely improve business and consumer confidence and feed a virtuous cycle.\n\nAgain, I lean to the slower-growth narrative. I expect businesses to be very cautious with respect to inventory accumulation, capital spending, and hiring. But I will be watching carefully for signs that an alternative, faster-growth scenario is developing.\n\nMonetary policy stance\nI have given you my best estimation of the world we're in and the outlook from here. But, to be frank, which narrative will unfold is not clear, and, for this reason, in my view, monetary policy in the coming year must be nimble. If the first narrative—the more optimistic one—develops, inflation pressures could increase and the momentum of the economy could call for higher interest rates to preserve and sustain healthy expansion. If the second narrative plays out, policymakers will have to be patient and guard against removing accommodation too early.\n\nIn either case, I am confident the Federal Reserve has the necessary tools and the capacity to act. The Fed has been preparing for an eventual exit from its extraordinary policies that blunted the financial crisis and recession. As Chairman Bernanke noted last week, preparation has entailed the evaluation of the capacity of markets to absorb transaction flows, operational testing of specific tools, and arrangements with market counterparties. Whichever way the economy tips, we are prepared.\n\nClosing\nLet me close by framing what I hope is your takeaway from my remarks this evening. The economy is recovering. The strong fourth quarter GDP growth performance is probably not sustainable, but continued growth is very likely. Two economic narratives—and variations on these two, of course—could play out. There are reasons to be cautious about predicting the stronger of the two, but there is a lot of uncertainty at this juncture. For this reason, you should expect the Fed to be especially watchful and nimble in response to developments. And you can be confident that the collective judgment of the members of the FOMC is up to the task and that the Federal Reserve has the necessary tools to calibrate policy to actual developments at the appropriate time.",

            "content": "Rotary Club of Atlanta\nAtlanta, Ga.\nJan. 11, 2010\n\nThis  is my third speech to the Downtown Atlanta Rotary since I became president of  the Atlanta Fed in March 2007. An address by the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank  president at the beginning of each year has become a fixture on the club's  calendar. I'm honored to carry on this tradition.\n\nThe  turn of the year is a demanding juncture for a speaker. I know you expect to  hear a clear summary of what has happened in the past year and what's going to  happen in the year ahead. Today carries even more than the usual transition  import because it's a turn of the decade—a decade that was not so easy.\n\nIn  preparation for this talk I looked back at my previous two speeches to this  group. Two years ago—in January 2008—I did identify the risk that problems in  subprime mortgages could spread to the broad economy. But I did not anticipate  the near collapse in financial markets in September of that year, and I said I  expected the economy would improve through the year and into 2009. I missed the  fallout of the financial crisis.\n\nLast  January, my predictions were closer to the mark. I said I thought the economy  would remain very weak for the first half of 2009. I called for financial  markets to stabilize enough to support a recovery in the second half of the  year. That's about what happened. In fact, the pace of recovery in the second  half of 2009 was stronger than I expected.\n\nToday  I will try to meet your expectations of a summary of where we are (as regards  the national economy) and where we're going in 2010. But, in addition to  remarks on the outlook, I want to comment on some important issues concerning  the longer-term institutional arrangements for governing the country's economic  policy and shaping our economic future. Specifically, I want to talk about the  importance of Fed independence and insulation from short-term political  pressure in the conduct of monetary policy. I also want to argue for  maintaining a strong, independent, apolitical regional voice in policy  deliberations through the 12 Reserve Banks. I must make my usual disclaimer:  The views I'll put forward are mine alone and don't necessarily reflect those  of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal  Reserve.\n\nCurrent state of the economy\n  A  recovery is under way, and the economy is moving ahead toward a necessary  transition from government-provided life support to private sector–propelled  consumer and investment activity. I concur with most economists who believe the  economy moved from recession to recovery in the third quarter.\n\nFor  the second half of 2009, gross domestic product (GDP) is likely to come in  between 3 and 3.5 percent when the final numbers are published. That  performance is not as strong as many had hoped given the severity of the recession  but is certainly a welcome relief after the severe drop-off in consumer  spending, business investment, and exports that occurred early in 2009.\n\nThe  most recent data indicate that growth of consumer spending remains constrained  by a weak labor market and modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and  tight credit. But despite these headwinds, household spending is expanding  modestly.\n\nBusinesses  are still reluctant to invest and hire. Businesses are holding fire pending  clarification of future government policy in the areas of health care, taxes,  and climate change. Most importantly, many businesses are waiting for clear  improvement in top-line revenues. And firms continue to pare inventories and  are making progress bringing inventory levels into better alignment with sales.\n\nPurchasing  managers report growth of industrial orders and production. Also, the  international economy is helping. Major emerging economies in Asia are doing  particularly well. As a result, U.S. exports are improving.\n\nIn  the crucial housing sector, the signs are mixed. House prices seem to be  stabilizing. Existing home sales ticked up in November, and existing home  inventory has fallen substantially from previous high levels. But the pending  sales index fell a steep 16 percent in November, suggesting weaker months  ahead. The new home sales number fell in the most recent data, and construction  activity remains very soft.\n\nFinancial  markets, including credit capital markets, are performing better, and this  improvement has supported the economic growth we're seeing. But the banking  system, although certainly in better shape than a year or more ago, is still in  a weakened state and still needs a lot of repair. I continue to hear complaints  that bank credit isn't flowing. At the same time, bankers tell us there is a  lack of qualified loan demand under acknowledged tighter credit standards. A  recent small business survey performed by the Atlanta Fed suggested that  business loan demand was down primarily because of weak sales and modest revenue  prospects. The credit availability picture was mixed. No surprise,  construction-related firms and manufacturers had the most trouble obtaining  credit during the last six months. But others did well in having their credit  needs met. Of more than 200 respondents, nearly half did not look for credit at  all, mostly citing weak sales or sufficient cash reserves.\n\nTo  summarize the current situation, the economy is on the mend, but it's not free  of drags or risk.\n\n2010 outlook \n  I expect  the recent growth of the economy to be sustained, but the pace of the expansion  to be slow over the foreseeable horizon. This forecast of slow recovery takes  account of nagging problems, particularly unemployment and commercial real  estate. Near-term growth will probably not be strong enough to substantially  bring down the large number of unemployed.\n\nTo  back this up, growth at the economy's long-term trend rate—something like 3  percent annually or a little lower—would generate about 160,000 jobs per month  under standard assumptions about population growth, labor force participation,  and productivity trends. Employment growth at this level would reduce  unemployment only marginally over the coming year. As Friday's payroll  employment report indicates, getting to 160,000 jobs per month could be a  challenge even with GDP growing.\n\nAs  regards the inflation outlook, I am reasonably confident that the rate of  inflation will remain in check for the immediate future. Current inflation  readings are acceptable and inflation expectations seem to be stable. I talk to  many business people who tell me they have little or no pricing power. On  balance, I expect inflation pressures to be restrained as a slow recovery  proceeds.\n\nIn  sum, I expect a better overall year in 2010. The bottoming of the inventory  liquidation cycle, some recovery in business investment, and better economic  prospects in the rest of the world set a foundation for continued growth going  forward. But it will not be a gangbuster recovery.\n\nRisks\n  As I  proved two years ago, economic predictions are never certain. There are risks  to this outlook that bear watching. I've already mentioned commercial real  estate. The risk associated with commercial real estate is linked to banks,  small business credit, jobs, and ultimately consumption. The overall commercial  real estate debt in the financial system is smaller than residential, but it is  disproportionately concentrated in small and regional banks. Smaller banks are  a significant source of credit for small businesses, and in most recoveries we  look to small businesses to generate a significant number of jobs.\n\nMuch  hinges on the valuation of commercial properties realized in refinancings and  restructurings during the next three or four years. Commercial real estate  valuations derive from jobs, among other factors, so you can see the potential  for a self-reinforcing dynamic that could be worse than expected.\n\nHowever,  given the accumulating evidence that recovery is gaining traction, I'd say  confidence is warranted. But I'd also suggest that it's prudent to be guarded  in your optimism. The ride could be bumpy.\n\nThoughts on exit\n  If my  outlook for 2010 is accurate, this will be the year that necessarily involves  exit from a lot of the emergency policies put in place to fight the financial  crisis and recession. How that process might unfold is and will be a matter of  active discussion among the members of the FOMC.\n\nLast  January, I talked about the dramatic expansion of the Fed's balance sheet in  response to the financial crisis in September 2008. Although the total balance  sheet has not yet started to shrink, some unwinding already has begun. At our  last meeting in December, the FOMC said that most of the Fed's special  liquidity facilities will expire at the end of this month and the purchase of mortgage-backed  securities and other agency debt will taper off and come to an end early this  year.\n\nA  bit like Goldilocks' porridge, the exit or unwinding process needs to be—in my  view—not too fast, not too slow, but just right. I continue to support an interest  rate policy described in recent FOMC statements as low for an \"extended  period.\" What does \"extended period\" mean? I don't want to put a date on it. To  me, it means the policy rate will be kept low until recovery has shown momentum  that is based on private business and consumer demand, job growth is  established or at least imminent, and the downside risks appear to be safely  navigable. This unwinding is in the context of well-behaved inflation, of  course.\n\nDanger of politicization\n  While the  economic medium term is looking more hopeful, some troubling ideas are in play  that could affect the country's economic policy institutions for the long haul.  Some of the proposals are a reaction to things gone wrong during the last two  years. A look back to identify fixable problems is entirely appropriate, but a  reaction fashioned in a heated aftermath can overshoot.\n\nIn  particular, I'm concerned about measures that would have the effect of  politicizing the central bank—the Fed—and especially decision making on matters  of monetary policy.\n\nMonetary  policy has a long-term orientation and often takes effect with lags and  interacts with other fundamental, longer-term forces in the economy. In my  experience, monetary policy is about setting a course and making periodic  adjustments in response to major changes in conditions. Importantly, monetary  policy should not swing with the daily news or be influenced by short-term  political pressures.\n\nI  am concerned that certain legislative proposals could compromise the independence  that enables staying on course. I'm referring to the \"audit the Fed\" amendments  that were passed in the House and introduced in the Senate. The audits would be  performed by the Government Accountability Office (GAO). In 1978, Congress  thought it wise to exempt monetary policy from GAO review. Congress did this in  keeping with established international practice and studied opinion that  independent central banks do a better job of keeping prices stable. The effect  of these proposals would be to roll back the clear exclusion of monetary  policy. The Fed has no argument with audits in the conventional meaning of the  term. We're already subject to many audits by the GAO and external auditors. In  government, the word \"audit\" can be misleading sometimes. GAO audits can amount  to full-blown policy reviews. Fed operations outside of monetary policy are  already subject to GAO policy review, so this proposal is about ad hoc,  after-action reviews of monetary policy, potentially frequent. In my view, this  notion is not about transparency and accountability. Both are bedrock  principles to which the Fed should continue to be held. Rather, this is about  politicizing a process that should remain apolitical.\n\nThe  Fed must have the capacity to make unpopular decisions—to take away the punch  bowl, as it were. Many of you remember the circumstances of the early 1980s  when the Paul Volcker–led FOMC acted against inflation. One should ask—would  Volcker have been effective if the intense opposition to his policies was  joined with formal, statutory methods of bringing pressure? The stakes in this  issue are big.\n\nI  am also concerned about ideas that have been floated that could have the  effect—if taken too far—of politicizing the input of regional Federal Reserve  Banks in policy deliberations. From its inception, the Federal Reserve System  was designed to have checks and balances, to avoid concentration of power in  New York and Washington, and to give every region of the country an apolitical  voice in policy formulation.\n\nLet  me explain how we work to give voice to people like you in the Southeast.  During the time between meetings of the FOMC, the Federal Reserve Bank of  Atlanta collects economic intelligence and policy views from some 44 board  members of the Atlanta Bank and its five branches. Most of these board members  make a number of calls to collect input from their community contacts. Also, we  meet periodically with members of six advisory councils representing a range of  major Southeast industries and constituencies. Before each FOMC meeting my  staff and I make calls to informal advisers in industry and finance. I estimate  we get input directly or through directors from about 1,000 citizens in the  Southeast on ground-level economic conditions and the impact of policy. A  number of members of this Rotary Club have contributed such advice over the  years—some as members of our board of directors.\n\nI  feel strongly this interactive channel of citizen input to national policy  should be preserved. We have worked hard to democratize the region's input on  national policy decisions through aggressive outreach to business and other  leaders.\n\nThe  mood today enveloping much of the discussion of needed financial and regulatory  reform is affected by public anger and an impulse to punish. I fully understand  these sentiments. The country is just now emerging from a long and painful  recession caused largely by a crisis in our financial system. We need to fix  things, but purported reforms that weaken how the country's economic affairs  are governed will be harmful and tough to undo. This debate is not a remote  political one. It's a Main Street issue. If markets come to question the  independence of Fed monetary policy, that questioning could cast doubt on the  country's commitment to price stability. In the real world, uncertainty resulting from injudicious reforms will be  factored into asset prices and borrowing rates by the world's markets and will  make recovery more expensive.",

            "content": "These are by no means all of the government efforts to stabilize the economy and financial markets, stimulate activity, and treat the effects of job loss. Certainly, the Fed's maintenance of its policy rate at the so-called zero lower bound for almost a year now should not be overlooked.\n\nA second reason to strike a note of caution about the economic picture is that both the data and anecdotal descriptions of ground-level reality are quite mixed. Data on foreclosures, unemployment, personal income, and bank failures continue to disappoint. Also, nonresidential construction continues to decline, and state and local government budgets remain severely constrained.\n\nAlong with my colleagues at the Atlanta Fed, I spend a lot of my time asking business contacts about industry conditions and the outlook for their businesses. In recent soundings we've heard frequently about weak top-line sales, continuing inventory liquidation, reticence regarding capital expenditures, and reluctance to hire.\n\nCharacteristics of this recession\nTurning to the outlook from here, my baseline forecast is for a relatively subdued pace of growth beyond the current quarter and through the medium term. The potential sluggishness of the recovery partly reflects certain unique characteristics of this recession. It was led by a crisis in banking and capital markets that was triggered by a sharp and persistent reduction in valuations of residential real estate assets.\n\nThe downturn in residential real estate did not remain contained in that sector. Trouble was transmitted to the rest of the economy via credit markets. The housing downturn triggered a crisis on Wall Street that soon became a recession on Main Street, and, as job losses mounted and delinquencies rose, fed back again to financial markets. Also, personal consumption retrenched because of the real estate price shock, tighter credit, and fear of job loss hitting close to home.\n\nDespite marked improvements in financial markets from a year ago and improved flow of private capital to banks in recent months, the banking system has not fully recovered—far from it. Bank credit losses are still climbing, and many banks are still capital constrained. It almost goes without saying that recovery of the banking system is crucial to the recovery of the overall economy.\n\nTo draw insights from the recession relevant to the future, it's instructive to consider the connectivity among sectors and the potential of a self-reinforcing negative feedback loop involving multiple sectors.\n\nToday, I'm particularly concerned about the interaction among bank lending, small business employment, and CRE values.\n\nTo elaborate, there is a tight linkage between CRE values and jobs. In a mid-September conference at the Atlanta Fed, CRE practitioners, investors, and academics agreed that the evolution of the CRE picture will depend greatly on the path of employment. This point was strongly reinforced in the Urban Land Institute's \"Emerging Trends in Real Estate\" report at this conference.\n\nSmall business impact\nLet me go on to show the link between jobs and small business credit. During the last two economic expansions, small firms (those with fewer than 50 employees) contributed about one-third of net job growth. But the depth and duration of this recession have taken a substantial toll on small businesses. In the 2001 recession, small firms held up reasonably well and accounted for only 9 percent of net job loss. In this recession, however, small firms have accounted for about 45 percent of net job losses per our most recent data through the end of 2008.\n\nSmall businesses tend to depend greatly on the banking sector—especially community and regional banks—for financing. A Federal Reserve survey earlier in the decade showed that more than half of smaller firms had a credit line or loan with a bank. In addition, about half of these businesses used a personal or business credit card to finance working capital. In this recession, credit standards have tightened for all businesses, including small businesses.\n\nAt this juncture, it's hard to be encouraged about a fast rebound in job growth. As you know, last week's employment report pushed the official unemployment rate to 10.2 percent, the highest since May 1983. Â,â Net job losses continue on a monthly basis but at a declining pace. Because employment growth tends to lag recovery from a recession and because of factors such as small business credit constraints, my current outlook for employment is one of very slow net job gains once the trend reverses, in all likelihood sometime next year. If this view is correct, this job growth outlook doesn't help the commercial real estate situation.\n\nSo how serious is the CRE problem for the financial system and the broad economy?\n\nFirst, let me provide some overview comments: While the CRE problem is serious for parts of the banking industry, I don't believe it poses a broad risk to the financial system. Compared with residential real estate, the size of the CRE debt market is smaller, and the exposure is more concentrated in smaller banks.\n\nHowever, I am concerned about the potential impact of CRE on the broader economy. Unlike residential real estate, there is not the same direct linkage from CRE to household wealth—and therefore consumption—caused by erosion of home equity. However, there could be an impact resulting from small banks' impaired ability to support the small business sector—a sector I expect will be critically important to job creation.\n\nTo add some detail: At the end of June 2009 there was approximately $3.5 trillion of outstanding debt associated with CRE. This figure compares with about $11 trillion of residential debt outstanding.\n\nAbout 40 percent of the CRE debt is held on commercial bank balance sheets in the form of whole loans. A lot of the CRE exposure is concentrated at smaller institutions (banks with total assets under $10 billion). These smaller banks account for only 20 percent of total commercial banking assets in the United States but carry almost half of total CRE loans (based on Bank Call Report data).\n\nMany small businesses rely on these smaller banks for credit. Small banks account for almost half of all small business loans (loans under $1 million). Moreover, small firms' reliance on banks with heavy CRE exposure is substantial. Banks with the highest CRE exposure (CRE loan books that are more than three times their tier 1 capital) account for almost 40 percent of all small business loans.\n\nTo repeat my current assessment, while the CRE problem is very worrisome for parts of the banking industry, I don't see it posing a broad risk to the financial system. Nonetheless, CRE could be a factor that suppresses the pace of recovery. As the recovery develops, the CRE problem will be a headwind, but not a show stopper, in my view.\n\nIt's appropriate to be a bit tentative in the assessment of CRE risk to the financial system, however. In 2007, many underestimated the scale and contagion potential of the subprime residential mortgage-backed securities problem. With this experience in mind, my assessment should continue to be refined.\n\nThat said, I do see the process of CRE adjustment and resolution as a pivotal element of economic rebuilding. Toward these ends, on Oct. 30, financial regulators issued guidance addressed to both bank examiners and financial institutions. The guidance called for a balanced and pragmatic approach to CRE loan workouts and examiner loan classifications, consistent with accurate and timely recognition of losses.\n\nIn my view, now that growth has resumed, the overall objective of economic policy should be to bring about a durable recovery and an environment that reduces unemployment as quickly as possible while containing inflationary pressures. The process of achieving this objective will necessarily involve judicious removal of government supports and the normalization of monetary policy. As policymakers consider these decisions, attention to the state and trends in the commercial real estate sector will be essential.",

            "content": "World Affairs Council of Jacksonville\n \tJacksonville, Florida\n \tSeptember 10, 2009\n\nThere are around 90 active world affairs councils in the United States keeping their cities’ business and government leaders abreast of world developments. Some serve a vital purpose of education and information directly pertinent to the economic welfare of the city and its hinterlands. I consider the World Affairs Council of Jacksonville one of those. Jacksonville—with its important and growing port—makes a meaningful portion of its living from global exchange. The state of the world economy matters to Jacksonville.\n\nToday, I will discuss the U.S. economic situation along with developments in the global economy as they affect this country’s economic interests. I'll put forward a current assessment of the nation’s policy challenges using a framework familiar to country risk analysts. And I'll connect this analysis to the issue of central bank independence, an issue that is drawing serious attention as a result of the financial crisis and actions taken in response. It's important that I emphasize that the views I'll express are my own and don’t necessarily reflect the views of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nStatus and forecast—U.S. economy\nTo lay the groundwork for this discussion, I'll begin with an overview of the current state of the U.S. economy. Overall, the U.S. economy is improving but still fragile. Stabilization is proceeding, and the first stages of recovery are under way.\n\nIt is to be expected at a time like this that the vital signs of the economy are mixed. Some indicators are improving while others are not getting worse or are just declining at a slower pace. Let me detail some of the key signals we’re getting from the domestic economy.\n\nAlthough consumer confidence is rising, actual consumption has remained muted overall. Consumers remain cautious because of employment concerns and wealth loss. Financing for consumer durable goods purchases is tight. Households continue to deleverage—that is, pay down debt. The savings rate is high compared with recent years. For now, an atmosphere of frugality and self-restraint seems to have set in.\n\nManufacturing production numbers improved in July after eight months of decline, but this performance mostly reflects a surge in auto production, perhaps in anticipation of the \"Cash for Clunkers\" program.\n\nInventories were liquidated aggressively during the first half of the year. The most recent survey of purchasing managers showed a slowing of liquidation. My view is that some replenishment may be under way—notably auto inventories. But many businesses learned during the recession how to operate with leaner stocks.\n\nSales of both new and existing homes rose in August, and prices are up a little, according to the Case-Shiller index of 20 major real estate markets. However, regional information gathered by the Atlanta Fed across the Southeast is not uniformly upbeat.\n\nLast week's labor market report for August showed that the economy is still shedding jobs. The United States lost 216,000 jobs in August, and the unemployment rate rose to 9.7 percent—the highest since June 1983.\n\nRegarding inflation, the headline inflation rate has fallen over the last year in part because of lower oil prices compared with a year ago. Core measures of inflation excluding food and energy costs also have been drifting lower, currently measured at 1.5 percent. With continuing economic weakness and financial uncertainty, firms have very little pricing power. I've tested this thesis in conversations with business leaders in this region with very little pushback. I expect inflation will remain contained for some time.\n\nAs I said, the picture is mixed, but stabilization and recovery appear to be taking hold.\n\nRecent improvements in the financial sector are supporting economic stabilization. Trust among financial institutions has been restored as reflected by risk spreads in the interbank lending market. With the support of a Federal Reserve lending program, securitization of credit card receivables, auto paper, and student loans has bounced back to almost precrisis levels. Corporate bond issuance has been strong since the beginning of the year. Overall, capital flows reflect an unwinding of the near-total retreat from risk-taking and the flight to safety that occurred last fall. Despite this improved flow of capital to riskier assets, financial conditions are still vulnerable, and the flow of credit remains constrained.\n\nOften a deep recession is followed by a sharp rebound in business and overall economic activity. As I look ahead, at least beyond the third quarter, I do not foresee this trajectory. Over the medium term, I see a slow recovery with ongoing repair of the financial sector and structural adjustments in the broad economy.\n\nThere are risks to even this lackluster outlook. One risk I'm watching is the interplay of commercial real estate and the financial sector. Commercial real estate values across the spectrum of property types—retail, office, hotel, warehouse—have fallen as a result of the recession. These values back loans held by banks and also by nonbank financial institutions and holders of commercial mortgage-backed securities. Maturing loans will bring the deterioration of lending ratios to a head.\n\nStatus and forecast—international economy\nLet me now turn to the international economy. Last fall, the financial crisis in the United States quickly spread to the rest of the world through trade and financial linkages. As a result, the world economy fell into the worst recession since World War II.\n\nThe global economy is now emerging from a recession with the help of unprecedented monetary and fiscal support. Europe is expecting slightly improved performance in the short term, although the strength of the European economy is uncertain beyond an immediate rebound. China and other developing countries in Asia are leading the global recovery. Rising domestic demand and imports in China are contributing to economic recovery in export-oriented economies in Asia and elsewhere in the world.\n\nIf it was ever the case that the fortunes of the U.S. economy were decoupled from the rest of the world, it is no longer so. In 1968 total trade (the sum of exports and imports) was about 9 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). By 1988 trade amounted to about 15 percent. As of last year, exports and imports together had risen to over 28 percent of GDP.\n\nThe impact of increasing openness extends beyond markets for goods and services. The globalization of financial markets has been as important as—if not more important than—the globalization of product markets. According to McKinsey & Co., total global capital flows rose from $1 trillion in 1990 to $11 trillion in 2007.\n\nBecause the United States runs a chronic trade deficit, foreign sources represent a considerable portion of the financing for the U.S. economy. Nonresident investors own nearly half of U.S. Treasury securities outstanding, 11 percent of U.S. equities, over 20 percent of U.S. corporate bonds, and about 15 percent of mortgage agency bonds.\n\nAlthough U.S. exports declined considerably in this recession and only now have begun to recover, the drop in imports was even larger. As a result, the U.S. current account and trade deficits narrowed somewhat. If this trend holds, the United States would become less reliant on the rest of the world for financing our public sector deficit as well as overall consumption.\n\nCountry risk exposure evaluation of the United States\nI began my career as an international banker in the Middle East. As a young banker I was taught the techniques of country risk and country exposure evaluation. I remember well the speeches and lectures of some of the seasoned graybeards of my bank.\n\nThey taught that analysis begins with measurement of the relative growth of a country’s public sector versus its private sector. If the public sector is growing, one should determine how that growth is being financed. Is the government raising taxes or improving tax collection? Or is the government borrowing? If debt financing, is the government borrowing from domestic sources in local currency or from external sources in foreign currency? If borrowing externally, what are the ratings trends of the country’s sovereign debt, and what seems to be the direction of creditor attitude and appetite?\n\nVery importantly, if the country is financing government spending domestically, is the balance sheet of the central bank growing, and does it appear that the central bank is monetizing the growing public sector debt, perhaps under political pressure? Monetizing means issuing new money to buy the government’s debt. And how independently does the central bank appear to be operating?\n\nIf—from this analysis—we saw a picture of a public sector growing relative to the private sector, with that growth resulting from deficit spending, and that deficit spending being largely financed by the central bank monetizing new government debt, the conclusion was…do not increase the bank's exposure and do not go long on the country's currency.\n\nI was first exposed to this framework for analysis more than 30 years ago. I think it is still a sound framework. So, for our edification, let's apply this framework to the United States. Let’s ask, what is our reality today within this framework?\n\nDuring the recession—over the last six quarters—total federal government outlays as a share of GDP grew from just under 5 percent to about 6.4 percent of GDP.\n\nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the 2009 federal deficit will be about $1.6 trillion, or 11.2 percent of GDP. One international benchmark is 3 percent. This is the ratio required to qualify as a new member of the European Monetary Union.\n\nTo finance federal deficits, the Treasury is issuing new debt. In 2009, the U.S. Treasury will issue about $1.7 trillion of net U.S. new debt. According to the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), this country’s national debt-to-GDP ratio will be 51 percent this year, up from 38 percent last year and is projected to reach 79 percent by 2013.\n\nBy comparison, the European Union's debt-to-GDP ratio was higher than the United States’ before the crisis and is expected to rise to nearly 90 percent by 2013. Among major developed economies, Japan is by far the most indebted. Its debt-to-GDP ratio reached 100 percent in 1997 and is forecast to hit 200 percent by 2011. By contrast, developing countries are much less indebted. For the group as a whole, debt-to-GDP ratio is not expected to rise above 35 percent.\n\nDespite the recent growth in U.S. public indebtedness, the level of debt is still manageable. But the trend is unsustainable and in a less stable country would spell trouble. I am confident that we will return to a sustainable fiscal path, a judgment apparently shared by financial market participants that continue to absorb U.S. debt at quite low rates of return.\n\nHowever, it would be unwise to be Panglossian about the current stance of policy, and this includes monetary policy. As I noted earlier, one of the key questions of country risk analysis is whether it appears that the central bank is monetizing the growing public sector debt, perhaps under political pressure.\n\nHere we are fortunate that both developed and developing countries have absorbed the hard lessons of history. For the most part, they have adopted institutional arrangements that enhance the credibility of central banks in their efforts to maintain low and stable rates of inflation, even in the face of significant fiscal pressures. In the United States, such credibility has allowed the Federal Reserve, Congress, and Treasury the flexibility to aggressively respond to the financial crisis without a potentially destructive unleashing of inflation expectations. And, thanks to operational independence, the Fed is not in a situation of monetizing the federal debt.\n\nStable inflation expectations and credibility are not guaranteed. The circumstances that promote stable expectations—particularly in an environment with rapidly rising fiscal deficits and large injections of liquidity—arise by design, not by accident. Though the details of central bank design differ somewhat from country to country, experience clearly points to independence, accountability, and transparency as the key building blocks.\n\nIndependence, transparency, and the decentralized Federal Reserve System\nTo build on this theme, I believe central bank independence in the conduct of monetary policy can appropriately be considered an enduring principle of sound governance of any country or political entity that issues a currency. I came to believe this many years ago, long before I joined the Federal Reserve.\n\nCentral bank independence correlates well with low and stable inflation, which correlates with sustainable economic growth that maximizes employment. Those two very desirable outcomes, not surprisingly, also happen to be the congressional mandates for the Federal Reserve.\n\nOver the past 15 years or so, institutional reforms designed to give central banks more independence to pursue price stability have been introduced around the world with great success.\n\nIn 1990, the EIU estimated that average inflation in the world was 40 percent. By 2000, it was 4.3 percent. This year, world inflation is expected to be a mere 2 percent—very close to what many consider price stability.\n\nIt's no surprise I’m an advocate of central bank independence in the formulation of monetary policy. But the independence of a central bank cannot be sustained without a clear and deliberate regime of accountability to the public and their representatives. That regime requires what I call defined transparency. By this I mean formal reporting and communication practices that are sufficiently comprehensive and appropriately timely to balance process integrity with the value of open government.\n\nLet's consider where we are today. Central banks around the world now publish their objectives, publicly communicate their policy actions, and speak freely and openly in public forums. In the case of the Federal Reserve, the chairman testifies semiannually on monetary policy, policy decisions are announced in a release immediately following an FOMC meeting, and the minutes of those meetings are reported on an expedited basis. The Fed also now publishes quarterly forecasts.\n\nAlso, the Fed publishes its balance sheet on a weekly basis and provides annually a detailed report on the financial activities of the Federal Reserve that are audited by an independent public accounting firm. In addition, the Government Accountability Office audits the Federal Reserve across all its operations with the exception of, importantly, monetary policy.\n\nFurthermore, the Federal Reserve System has a characteristic that is somewhat unique among central banks of the world. The system has a decentralized structure whereby regional, independent Reserve Banks, under the broad supervision of politically appointed governors in Washington, D.C., jointly set policy.\n\nThis decentralized structure, in my view, greatly enhances both the independence of the system and its transparency.\n\nRegional representation at the policy table provides a means for all corners of this diverse nation to weigh in on the important monetary issues influencing the economy. Reserve Banks gather economic intelligence from around their districts representing the varied views and interests of our respective regions. And Reserve Banks are well positioned to bring important information back home again, communicating the Fed’s objectives in a way that enhances the understanding of their rationale.\n\nI strongly advocate this notion of defined transparency, which I mentioned a moment ago. I’ve seen firsthand the delicacy of the policy role the Federal Reserve plays opposite markets and financial institutions. The events of the last two years have exposed the fragile edifice of financial stability.\n\nI think the principles of transparency that should apply to the making of monetary policy include the following: Disclosure that does not do systemic harm. Disclosure that does not tend to shorten policy time horizons and open the monetary policy process to short-term political considerations. And, disclosure that does encourage a relationship of trust, confidence, and credibility between the public and the central bank.\n\nIn my view, the public interest resides in policies that influence the economy over the longer term, address economic fundamentals, and are politically neutral. I welcome further discussion on ways the Fed can be more accountable and transparent but always within the context of maintaining the monetary policy independence that has proven effective in the pursuit of broad economic goals.\n\nIn striking the right balance of independence, accountability, and transparency, we must also remain mindful of the global role of the dollar and the worldwide distribution of our obligations. I believe the independence of the Federal Reserve is crucial to the world’s perception that the United States will continue to pursue responsible monetary policy. This perception is an essential underpinning of a calm, reasoned, and favorable assessment of U.S. country risk.",

            "content": "Chattanooga Area Chamber of Commerce\n Chattanooga, Tennessee\n August 26, 2009\n\nThe last time I was here I delivered a speech to the Rotary Club of Chattanooga in late March of 2008. Since that time, the economic situation has changed dramatically.\n\nA year and a half ago, as you recall, the U.S. economy was clearly slowing. But it wasn't yet apparent that we were in the midst of a deep and protracted recession. Also, a major financial crisis was not part of the outlook.\n\nNow, evidence is mounting that the worst of the economic downturn is behind us. Today, I will talk about the economic situation and outlook at this juncture. I also want to take a deeper look into a critical economic issue for many Americans—and that is employment. The views I will express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nCurrent state of national economy\n  Let me begin with the current state of the economy. Overall, the U.S. economy is improving but still fragile. Stabilization has taken hold, and the beginning stages of recovery are under way, in my view.\n\n\n\nConsumer spending has been dampened by housing market weakness and concerns about employment.\n\nThe attitude among the business leaders I talk to is quite cautious. Investment spending this year has declined sharply, but, according to recent data, the speed of falloff appears to be slowing. Also, inventories have been liquidated aggressively in the first half of the year.\n\nRecent improvements in the financial sector are supporting economic stabilization. Capital flows and securities issuance reflect an unwinding of the flight to safety that occurred last fall. Despite this improved flow of capital to riskier assets, I would say that financial conditions are still vulnerable, and the flow of credit remains weak.\n\nI'm concerned that commercial real estate weakness poses a serious potential risk to the economic recovery and to the banking system. Commercial real estate loan exposure is heavily concentrated in banks and commercial mortgage-backed securities. Commercial real estate values—that is, collateral values for loans—are being revised down materially by the potent combination of increased vacancy, rent reductions, and appropriately higher capitalization rates. Further, there is a clear link between employment trends (positive and negative) and commercial real estate trends.\n\nAs regards inflation, with continuing economic weakness and financial uncertainty, firms have very little pricing power. Headline inflation has fallen in part because of lower oil prices compared with a year ago. Core measures of inflation excluding food and energy costs also have been drifting lower. Looking ahead, I expect inflation will remain contained.\n\nOutlook\n\nWith respect to growth, my forecast envisions a return to positive but subdued gross domestic product (GDP) growth over the medium term weighed down by significant adjustments to our economy. Some of these adjustments are transitional in the sense that they impede the usual forces of recovery. Among these are the rewiring of the financial sector and the need for households to save more to repair their balance sheets.\n\nSome of these adjustments, however, are more \"structural\" in nature. By this, I mean that the economy that emerges from this recession may not fully resemble the prerecession economy. In my view, it is unlikely that we will see a return of jobs lost in certain sectors, such as manufacturing. In a similar vein, the recession has been so deep in construction that a reallocation of workers is likely to happen—even if not permanent. I'll discuss manufacturing and construction a bit more in a moment.\n\nMy forecast for a slow recovery implies a protracted period of high unemployment. And labor market weakness is a concern I hear about often as I travel around the Southeast. Given this concern, I'd like to devote the remainder of my formal remarks to the challenge of unemployment and the potential for a jobless recovery.\n\nUnderemployment\n\n This recession has had a severe impact on employment in various ways: jobs, furloughs, and number of hours worked. For example, the average manufacturing workweek has fallen below 40 hours for the first time since 1983. And the number of workers employed part-time for economic reasons has increased more in this recession than in any since the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) started tracking that information.\n\nIf one considers the people who would like a job but have stopped looking—so-called discouraged workers—and those who are working fewer hours than they want, the unemployment rate would move from the official 9.4 percent to 16 percent.\n\nWhere job losses occurred\n\n While the unemployment pain in this recession has been broad based, certain sectors have been hit particularly hard. I've already mentioned the most prominent cases, construction and manufacturing. Both fields employ a disproportionate number of men. As a result, some have called this a \"mancession.\"\n\nThe share of the jobs lost in construction and manufacturing is out of proportion to the share of jobs represented by these male-dominated sectors. Prior to the recession, construction and manufacturing together accounted for a little more than 15 percent of employment. Their job losses during the recession, however, account for more than 40 percent of all U.S. job losses. While men typically have borne most of the job losses during a recession, this recession ranks among the worst.\n\nSlow recovery\n\n Clearly, it will be some time before the number of jobs in the economy returns to prerecession levels.\n\nThe higher share of part-time employment arguably gives employers a means to increase work hours without adding to the overall number of full-time workers. Businesses seem inclined to defer hiring and focus on productivity until a sustained pick-up in top-line demand is beyond doubt.\n\nFirms always have incentives to improve efficiency and keep a lid on costs—including labor costs. The last two recoveries have involved unusually long periods of GDP growth accomplished through productivity gains instead of employment growth. At this point, there is scant evidence that the coming recovery will break that pattern.\n\nThe sectors in which job losses have been most pronounced are unlikely to see a rapid return to prerecession levels of business activity, let alone prerecession levels of employment. Construction, which represents about 6 percent of employment, has seen a recent activity uptick in the residential category from very low levels. But the inventory of unsold homes on the market is elevated. Much of this inventory will have to be absorbed before construction employment returns to any levels we might consider \"normal.\" Industry capacity before the recession approached 2 million housing starts on an annual basis. Starts are now hovering around 580,000.\n\nUnfortunately, time may not return manufacturing employment to prerecession levels. Between 1965 and 2000, manufacturing employment generally fluctuated between 16.5 and 19.5 million jobs. The number of manufacturing jobs fell to just over 14 million in the first years of this decade and has continued to drift downward. The harsh financial constraints of this recession appear to have accelerated this secular decline.\n\nSolutions to the unemployment problem\n\n The country's employment problems are not completely intractable. Fortunately, most who are directly affected by job loss are eligible for the short-term income support of unemployment insurance. Benefits through that program have been extended three times since July 2008 and may be extended again.\n\nFor many workers, unemployment benefits provide much-needed income support to see them through a difficult job market. Some workers will have to look for a job in a new field. There are some powerful forces in place that can assist those workers who need to make career changes—labor market flexibility and an educational infrastructure well suited to retraining workers.\n\nFirst, with respect to labor market flexibility, the easier it is for workers to change employers, the faster structural adjustment can occur. U.S. workers have become accustomed to changing jobs. The BLS estimates that the youngest baby boomers had almost nine different jobs by the time they reached the age of 42.\n\nAlong with worker flexibility, worker retraining programs can also facilitate necessary adjustments. Community colleges serve an important role in preparing \"nontraditional,\" often older, students for new careers and in providing targeted training on a contract basis with private companies.\n\nIn the fall of 2007, more than a third of all postsecondary students were enrolled in community colleges, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. Since the early 1960s, enrollment in community colleges increased by about 750 percent—roughly four times the growth rate of enrollment in public and private four-year institutions.\n\nThe role that community colleges play in retooling the workforce can be seen by the bumps in enrollment during recessions. Also, enrollment in for-profit educational institutions has increased from only about 1.5 percent of postsecondary students in 1990 to about 7 percent more recently.\n\nIn recognition that many of the nation's unemployed will need to retool to re-enter the labor market, approximately $24 billion of federal stimulus money was allocated for training and education, according to the Workforce Alliance.\n\nHow Chattanooga is poised for recovery\n\nWith respect to our national employment challenge, Chattanooga offers a useful example—and perhaps a preview—of how labor markets will adjust as recovery takes hold. Since 1990, Chattanooga's employment situation has typically beaten that of the United States. But in this recession Chattanooga has been sharing the national pain. Like the nation as a whole, Chattanooga has seen a disproportionate share of job losses in construction and manufacturing.\n\nFortunately for this area, top employers also include health and long-term care insurance companies, health care providers, and health care educators. Officials project one of the fastest-growing employment sectors through 2016 will be health care. Chattanooga should benefit from this growth coming out of the recession, and the local health care insurance industry is also poised for more demand with the aging of the U.S. population.\n\nBut Chattanooga can boast of something unusual in today's economy: new manufacturing jobs. As you know, the new Volkswagen plant is expected to add some 2,000 manufacturing jobs to the local economy by 2011. This development runs counter to national trends, as I've already explained.\n\nPolicy issues\n If my prognosis for the broad economy is correct, the pace of job restoration and growth through the medium term will be frustratingly slow. So, what can be done to address the prospect of high unemployment and underemployment?\n\nFurther fiscal stimulus has been mentioned, but the full effects of the first stimulus package are not yet clear, and the concern over adding to the federal deficit and the resulting national debt is warranted.\n\nThe FOMC has stated its intention to keep the policy interest rate low for an extended period. I agree that this approach is needed. This policy stance should encourage more business activity and facilitate more hiring.\n\nNo policy is certain to improve outcomes, and no policy is without risks. The challenge my colleagues and I face is navigating between the risk that early removal of monetary stimulus snuffs out the recovery and the risk that protracted monetary accommodation stokes inflation expectations that could ultimately fuel unwelcome inflationary pressures.\n\nThe Fed must deal with this tension, particularly in coming quarters, as we pursue our dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment. I believe the overriding concern should be the quality of recovery as opposed to the speed of recovery. The best answer to unemployment is restoration of a healthy, balanced, and growing economy capable of producing sustainable employment. This objective will require structural adjustment in the economy and personal adjustment for many workers.\n\nI believe the economic outlook—including the employment picture—calls for continuing efforts to remove obstacles to the rebuilding of economic strength on solid foundations. Chief among such obstacles is the still-constricted bank and securitization credit system, especially those segments that finance small business and households.\n\nI also believe progressive local community leaders can play a role in addressing the unemployment challenge. Beyond recruiting inbound investment that brings immediate jobs, you as local leaders can continue to pursue a human capital agenda for your region. By this, I mean initiatives to advance early childhood pre-K education for three- and four-year-olds, improvement of the public K–12 system, and backing of the community and technical college infrastructure that is so vital to worker skill development and retooling.\n\nI do not expect quick fixes for the unemployment challenge ahead, but I am convinced the right policy objective is sustainable employment growing out of a recovery that is grounded in durable and resilient fundamentals.",

            "highlights": "Remarks by Dennis P. Lockhart, President and Chief Executive Officer, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta; Rotary Club of Nashville, Nashville, Tenn., July 20, 2009.",
            "content": "For my remarks this afternoon, I'll talk about how I see the economy at this juncture, the near- and medium-term outlook, and the growing concern about inflation. Let me add at this point my usual disclaimer that my remarks are my thoughts alone and may not necessarily reflect the views of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nIt's especially important that I mention this caveat the day before Chairman Ben Bernanke makes his semiannual monetary policy report to Congress. Tomorrow the chairman will speak for the Federal Reserve System. Today, I am speaking just for myself, informed by advice from my colleagues at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.\n\nCurrent economy\nCurrent economic conditions are mixed at best, but the economy appears to be in stabilization mode. Stabilization necessarily precedes recovery. A recovery has not yet taken hold but should begin before too long.\n\nI'll start with a look at manufacturing, which has been hard hit in this recession. Just last week we learned that manufacturing production was down 0.6 percent in June, month over month. In the past year, manufacturers have cut production by more than 15 percent, and the manufacturing capacity utilization rate dropped to about 65 percent, a record low.\n\nHere in middle Tennessee, manufacturing accounts for about 12 percent of employment. The number of manufacturing jobs here declined by about 12 percent on a year-over-year basis in May, the most recent data available. I know that many of you here today have directly felt the troubles in this important sector.\n\nRecent indicators of business investment are also down but are a bit less discouraging. Durable goods orders increased this spring and in May reached the highest levels in four months. On the other hand, the most recent data showed the liquidation of business inventories continuing, but the pace has slowed.\n\nConsumer spending absorbs about two-thirds of economic output, and the recent picture in this area is mostly negative. After taking price changes into account, it appears that retail spending fell again in June. Restaurants, department stores, and building materials retailers all posted month-to-month declines. Overall, retail results are in line with the ongoing weakness in consumer spending we have been seeing.\n\nThere is also indication of worsening consumer confidence. The University of Michigan's July report indicated that consumer sentiment fell sharply in recent weeks, reversing the gains seen in May and June. Growing consumer pessimism has been reported in other survey data. It appears that expectations of future economic conditions, and particularly employment prospects, are weighing on attitudes.\n\nAs for housing, permits and new home starts in June improved markedly compared with previous months, and the large inventory of houses for sale has been pared back somewhat. But the housing sector is still under great stress. Reflecting a persistent pace of foreclosures, the percentage of distressed sales remains high—about one in three sales in May. All in all, this information suggests a slower pace of decline in a still weak residential sector.\n\nData on the overall economy suggest the same trend of slowing decline. I, along with my team in Atlanta, believe real gross domestic product (GDP) fell slightly in the second quarter. This performance represents substantial progress coming off a contraction of 5.5 percent (annualized) in the first quarter.\n\nThe most recent monthly labor market report was disappointing, but employment tends to lag improvements in economic performance. Nothing in the incoming data has altered our view that the economy is nearing a bottom and will soon begin a very slow recovery.\n\nFinancial market healing\nIf stabilization is to lead to sustained recovery, the health of financial markets is crucial. In this regard, I see notable signs of improvement.\n\nFor example, most short-term money markets have seen rising volume, increased liquidity, and less concern with counterparty risk.\n\nIn the corporate bond market, spreads have declined and lowered the cost of capital for investment-grade businesses.\n\nOur credit markets include both banks and the very important securitization markets. Securitization markets have been coming back gradually from a base late last year of nearly zero. Total asset-backed security issuance in the second quarter of 2009 was $49 billion, which is 14 times larger than during the frozen market conditions of the fourth quarter of 2008.\n\nEquity markets were up globally in the second quarter. While the calendar of initial public offerings remains weak, stock issuance in the second quarter tripled compared with the first quarter of 2009 and hit the highest level for the past year and a half.\n\nMuch of the recent equity issuance activity was capital raises of large banks. It's positive news that the banks participating in the so-called stress tests have raised a substantial portion of the required capital. Some banks have begun repaying their Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) funds to the U.S. Treasury. Also, use of the Fed's special credit facilities has fallen by $500 billion since March of this year.\n\nDespite this progress, the financial sector remains in a fragile state. So far this year, 57 U.S. banks have failed, including 13 in the Southeast. Banks in this region suffer from overconcentration of loans backed by residential and commercial real estate.\n\nOutlook\nNow, let me speak to the question of the outlook from here. Often a deep recession is followed by a sharp rebound in business and overall economic activity. Unfortunately, as I look ahead, I do not foresee this trajectory. I expect real growth to resume in the second half and progress at a modest pace. I do not see a strong recovery in the medium term.\n\nThere are risks to even this rather subdued forecast. The risk I'm watching most closely is commercial real estate. There is a heavy schedule of commercial real estate financings coming due in 2009, 2010, and 2011. The CMBS (commercial real estate mortgage-backed securities) market is very weak, and banks generally have no appetite to roll over loans on properties that have lost value in the recession. Refinancing problems will not directly affect GDP—it's commercial construction that factors into GDP—but I'm concerned problems in commercial real estate finance could adversely affect the otherwise improving banking and insurance sectors.\n\nRemoving obstacles to growth\nI'd like to elaborate further on my thinking regarding this forecast of an anemic recovery in the medium term. I will argue that growth is the natural state for the U.S. economy, and growth in the medium term will be slowed by structural impediments that must be removed or attenuated.\n\nGrowth is the natural state because market competition requires continuous innovation—product innovation, technological innovation, new business models, and development of new markets. Businesspeople—especially those in publicly held companies—understand that over the longer term it's either grow or disappear.\n\nIt follows then that resumption and acceleration of growth depends on removal of obstacles. By obstacles, I mean conditions that get in the way of a natural pace of growth.\n\nI see a number of obstacles whose removal will take some time. For example, the healing of the banking system will take time. Working off excess housing inventory will take time. The reallocation of labor to productive and growing sectors of the economy will take time. It will take time to complete the deleveraging of American households and the restoration of consumer balance sheets.\n\nIn short, I believe the economy must undergo significant structural adjustments. We're coming out of a severe recession, and it's not too much an exaggeration to say the economy is undergoing a makeover. We must build a more solid foundation for our economy than consumer spending fueled by excessive credit—excessive household leverage—built on a house price bubble.\n\nThe surviving financial system must find a new posture of risk taking. The balance of consumption and investment must adjust, with investment being financed by greater domestic saving. The distribution of employment must adjust to match worker skills, including newly acquired skills, with jobs in growth markets. Some industrial plant and equipment must be taken offline to remove excess and higher-cost capacity.\n\nAs I said, these adjustments will take time and will suppress growth prospects in the process. I believe the economy will underperform its long-term potential for a while because of the obstacles to growth that must be removed, adjustments it must undergo.\n\nMany observers see substantial slack in the economy that could persist for some years. Economists' more formal term for slack is “output gap.” We at the Atlanta Fed see a meaningful output gap developing, but in our view it is smaller than would normally be associated with the weak pace of growth we expect over the next couple of years because all the obstacles to the natural pace of growth already mentioned have brought down the economy's potential for the medium term.\n\nInflation risks\nThis observation leads me to some comments on inflation.\n\nAt this juncture, my assessment is that inflationary and deflationary risks are roughly balanced.\n\nStill, I recognize that concerns about inflation risks have recently risen in some quarters, and I would like to comment on those concerns.\n\nInflation pessimists—those predicting alarmingly higher inflation—point to growing federal deficits and the substantial growth of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet since last October. More precisely, they note the enormous increase of excess bank reserves on the liability side of the Fed's balance sheet. The argument is that surely this rapid growth of the monetary base and balance sheet must translate eventually, and possibly quite soon, into outsized growth of the money supply. This growth in the money supply is inflationary if not reversed fairly soon. That's the argument.\n\nTo carry this argument a little further, the concern is that banks will begin to lend the large quantity of reserves that exist today, putting the money into circulation as the economy picks up. The growth in spending that could result from this increase in money could push against the economy's capacity constraints in a way that creates inflationary pressures, according to the inflation pessimists.\n\nAltered role of bank reserves\nLet me draw attention to an important policy change that has altered the relationship between the quantity of bank reserves and overall spending in the economy.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I'm not saying that the current size of the balance sheet is necessarily the most appropriate. What I am saying is one should not assume at this point that extraordinary measures to shrink the balance sheet are required to contain inflationary pressures.\n\nIn addition, let me highlight two points from the minutes of the most recent FOMC meeting. First, the size of the balance sheet is currently expected to peak later in the year and then begin to decrease. This decrease will occur as various liquidity programs are phased out or decline in use and as long-term asset purchase programs are completed.\n\nSecond, the FOMC is actively studying mechanisms to deliberately shrink the size of the balance sheet should the need arise, and to do this without causing disruptions to the economy. According to the minutes of the last FOMC meeting, a top Fed priority is “ensuring that policy accommodation can ultimately be withdrawn smoothly and at the appropriate time.”\n\nIn my view, some inflation pessimists are not giving weight to the changed mechanics of monetary policy transmission to the broad economy. For some years now the Fed has used interest rates—interest rate policy—to influence economic activity and inflation. Paying the banks interest on their reserves allows the Fed to tighten monetary conditions by resetting this floor interest rate without direct manipulation of the size of the balance sheet.\n\nNonetheless, it's important that we policymakers remember that rising inflation fears can evolve into inflation expectations on which businesspeople and consumers act. Modern inflation fighting by policymakers is substantially about anchoring expectations. The bulwark against rising inflation expectations is the Fed's credibility. By this, I'm referring to the belief that the monetary authorities have the tools—and the commitment—to act against inflation.\n\nI want to assure you the Fed has several tools and is readying itself to act on the balance sheet when the time comes. And I am very confident of the FOMC's commitment to price stability. I recognize, however, it's easy to say one is committed to act in advance of the need to act. Circumstances at the time may make the need less clear and the decision more complicated. So, if the incremental step of announcing a formal inflation target would serve to calm current fears and prove convincing on an ongoing basis, I would favor such a move. I think that discussion needs to continue.\n\nLet me summarize my argument here today. The economy is stabilizing and recovery will begin in the second half. The recovery will be weak compared with historic recoveries from recession. The recovery will be weak because the economy must make structural adjustments before the healthiest possible rate of growth can be achieved. While this adjustment process is going on in the medium term, I believe inflation and deflation are roughly equal risks and require careful monitoring. Slack in the economy will suppress inflation. And inflation is unlikely to result—by direct causation—from the recent growth of the Fed's balance sheet. In any event, the Fed has a number of tools being readied to unwind the policies used to fight the recession, and it will be some time before their use is appropriate.\n\nI will end with those thoughts and would be happy to take your questions.",

            "highlights": "Remarks by Pat Barron, First Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta; Georgia Bankers Association's Annual Convention, Atlanta, Ga., June 15, 2009",
            "content": "Georgia Bankers Association's Annual Convention\n June 15, 2009\n\nThanks for that introduction, Joe. It's an honor for me to speak to the Georgia Bankers Association. I consider the Georgia Bankers Association a source of strength for our nation's banking industry.\n Late last year, when I was invited to speak at your 2009 annual convention, the United States was in the midst of a severe financial crisis, probably the most severe in my adult lifetime. Since that time, the pace of change has been intense, but in spite of the \"gloom and doom\" we've seen some preliminary signs of economic stabilization.\n\nToday I want to talk about how the banking industry has adjusted in this tough economy while offering some personal perspectives on lessons learned from recent experience—both for bankers and regulators. I also want to share my views on what I expect the future holds for your industry. Despite some major problems, the outlook for banking is not all bad, I believe.\n\nI would note that these are my views and do not necessarily represent the views of the Board of Governors or any Reserve Banks.\n\nEconomic situation\n To lay the groundwork for this discussion, I'd like to begin with a description of the overall economy and my take on the outlook.\n\nAs you know all too well, many of today's problems started with housing, and, by most measures, the housing market is still a major drag on the economy. Homebuilding has collapsed to record low levels, less than half a million annual housing starts in April compared with 1.4 million in 2005. Even with this collapse in residential construction, housing inventories remain elevated.\n\nThe Case-Shiller national home price index fell more than 19 percent from a year earlier during the first quarter, the biggest drop in the reading's 21-year history. Housing prices in many markets are being weighed down by a steady increase in foreclosures and other distressed properties that have entered the market.\n\nWith better affordability, housing activity in some places has started to pick up. But this improvement is largely anecdotal and is barely evident in the data.\n\nThe residential downturn has spilled over to most every sector of the economy—including state and local governments, many of which are now coping with severe budget shortfalls.\n\nBusinesses have sharply reduced spending and hiring. The national unemployment rate last month climbed to 9.4 percent.\n\nAlthough the jobless rate is elevated, recent unemployment insurance claims data indicate the pace of job destruction seems to be letting up some. A slowing contraction in job loss could suggest stabilization ahead. Here in the Southeast, for example, Florida recently posted a month-to-month increase in employment. I would note that I visited with several of Florida's business leaders last week, including a couple of bankers. For the first time, I heard positive comments about the economic outlook—versus comments over the last two years that were all negative.\n\nOn the consumer side of the economy, personal consumption expenditures improved during the first quarter and were one of the few positive factors in the first quarter gross domestic product report, which came in at –5.7 percent. I would also note retail sales, which came out last Thursday, increased 0.5 percent in May. Some of the increase may be related to higher gasoline prices. But overall the report was positive and suggests retail sales are nudging up from very low levels.\n\nEconomic outlook\n Given this environment, I expect the economy will begin to recover in the second half of this year. For the medium and long term, I continue to believe we will experience positive but relatively subdued growth.\n\nHowever, this outlook is clouded by potential threats. The main risks on my watch list start with global economic weakness. This recession knows no borders, and economic problems in one country have the potential to spread quickly and \"re-infect\" banks in other parts of the world. Secondly, another trouble spot is commercial real estate in this country. Many loans are due for refinancing just as rents and values are declining, and they face an unfavorable credit climate marked by an almost nonexistent market for commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS).\n\nThese challenges have already claimed some well known office buildings, including the John Hancock Tower in Boston and the Equitable Building in downtown Atlanta, both of which were foreclosed and sold at auction earlier this year.\n\nAlso, I'm closely watching the spending power of American consumers. Despite the stabilization of consumer spending that I just mentioned, households continue to carry heavy debt loads and are confronted with employment uncertainty, stagnant or even declining incomes, and credit conditions that are less than favorable.\n\nIn addition to risks to the real economy, I want to stress that the Federal Reserve remains vigilant to risks on the inflation front. A renewed round of accelerating weakness could reintroduce the deflation concerns that characterized much of last year. But, unlike that period, I don't want to dismiss the possibility of emergent inflationary pressures. This risk is related in part to concerns about the large amount of monetary and fiscal stimulus that has been applied to combat the financial crisis and the recession. Policymakers must be prepared to respond, as the need for such stimulus is no longer present.\n\nState of banking\n Many of those policies have been geared to restoring banking health and functioning credit markets, which are vital to economic growth.\n\nSo what is the condition of the banking sector?\n\nThe good news is profitability has returned to banking. The banking industry reported a profit of $7.6 billion in the first quarter, compared with a $37 billion loss in the fourth quarter.\n\nBut, on the negative side, regulators so far this year have seized more than 36 institutions. The number of problem banks identified by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) has climbed sharply this year to 305—the highest level in 15 years.\n\nGeorgia has the dubious distinction of leading the nation in bank failures during this crisis. As you are well aware, 11 Georgia banks have been closed since the beginning of 2008 with the potential for more to come.\n\nLarge and small banks alike remain saddled with nonperforming real estate loans, and the state of the housing and commercial property markets do not signal any quick recovery in the quality of those credits. Also, credit problems have expanded beyond real estate to credit card and other consumer and commercial debt, much of which also resides on banks' balance sheets. Banks in the first quarter set aside nearly $61 billion to cover loan losses, compared with $37 billion in the prior quarter.\n\nI'm particularly concerned with bank capital, which is needed during tough times as a backstop against potential losses. To get a better reading on the health of the largest banks from a capital perspective, as you know, the Federal Reserve, working with the Treasury Department and other supervisory agencies, recently implemented the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program, or simply put, the \"stress tests.\"\n\nThe completion of those assessments seemed to remove some of the uncertainty from the market regarding the solvency of the nation's largest banks. More importantly, the early results of banks' capital-raising efforts have been positive, with most able to raise capital through public stock offerings.\n\nAlong with the stress test results, I've found some encouraging signs in credit markets. Markets for short-term funding have improved, including the interbank lending markets and commercial paper markets. With confidence returning to these and other private capital markets, usage of several short-term Federal Reserve credit and liquidity facilities has decreased because of crowding out by more robust private activity—clearly, a desired effect.\n\nAlso, bond issuance has improved recently, and spreads between Treasury yields and rates paid by corporate borrowers have narrowed somewhat, indicating that market participants are more willing to take on credit risk than in late 2008.\n\nAll in all, I would say that Fed policy actions to provide liquidity have helped to ease credit strains, although much more progress is needed before many banks are strong enough to provide sufficient credit to the economy without the increased government backing.\n\nWhile these are positive signs, I think we would all agree, the credit market healing process will require a bit more time. The Fed has said that it will extend its credit facilities as needed. And at its last meeting on April 29, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) said that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period. Also, the FOMC is in the midst of an effort to strengthen mortgage lending and housing markets by purchasing a total of up to $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities and up to $200 billion of agency debt. We are at roughly the halfway point in those initiatives.\n\nLessons learned\n Overall, despite some improvement, I would say the banking industry at present remains dependent on the increased liquidity programs and FDIC guarantees. Further, it is likely that industry has a ways to go before we would be in a position to declare it in good health.\n\nThe current financial crisis, dating back to the emergence of subprime mortgage problems in the summer of 2007, bears a certain resemblance to prior episodes that were associated with slow and protracted economic recoveries.\n\nAs with the savings and loan episode of about 20 years ago, this financial crisis offers painful lessons in the perils of rapid growth, concentrations of risk, and excess leverage. It appears that many of the lessons of the '80s are being relearned in today's crisis, albeit they occurred in a very different financial market structure. Unlike the 1980s, when most loan originations remained on bank balance sheets, the modern credit market had become dominated by securitization and the movement of risk off balance sheet—to free up capital and generate liquidity to make new loans.\n\nBefore the crisis, investors around the globe had an almost endless appetite for highly rated mortgage-backed securities. Financial intermediaries had a strong demand for mortgages of just about any type because they could generate profits by packaging them into highly marketable securities. In hindsight, that seemingly unlimited supply of capital artificially boosted home sales and price appreciation, which led to increased speculation by parties all along the \"food chain.\"\n\nSecuritization is mostly a Wall Street, big-bank business, so why are so many community banks on Main Street now suffering? Again with the benefit of hindsight, it now seems clear that the demand for mortgages and mortgage securities helped push home sales to levels that were not sustainable had more attention been paid to the borrower's ability to repay, versus a forecast that home prices could increase indefinitely.\n\nNonetheless, demand for housing kept increasing, creating what looked to some like a supply shortage in housing and residential lots. And that's where community banks come in. Residential acquisition, development, and construction lending became the core business of many small banks, especially here in the Southeast. And many more banks were chartered and opened in the first half of this decade to get in on the housing construction boom. In fact, Georgia has consistently been among the leaders nationally in de novo banking, having opened more than 100 new banks since 2000.\n\nThe problem is that the demand for mortgage securities was largely liquidity driven, and, as you know, demand can change quickly.  But supply takes a longer period of time to adjust. Unfortunately, many community banks are on the supply side of the housing market. When housing demand suddenly dried up, banks held finished inventory that couldn't be sold, unfinished subdivisions that no longer made economic sense, and, worst of all, hundreds or thousands of vacant developed lots—now known simply as dirt.\n\nI don't have to tell you that even if the economy stabilizes and begins a very modest recovery, as I believe it will, it is going to take quite a while to work through the excess inventory of houses and lots that now burden many of our community banks.\n\n Along with concentration of risk, another lesson of this cycle pertains to liquidity. Banks that depended on short-term borrowing for liquidity have not fared well in the past two years. The importance of liquidity has been apparent at large and small banks alike. As you recall, the interbank lending market dried up with the collapse of confidence associated with failures in subprime and other risky loan securitization. Concerns about bank liquidity drove down stock prices for highly leveraged investment banks in 2008 and since that time have led to several high-profile bank failures.\n\nIn fact, one of the main reasons that remaining investment banks elected to become bank holding companies was to gain access to liquidity. They sought liquidity in the form of FDIC insured deposits, TARP funding, and permanent access to the Federal Reserve discount window. Likewise, community banks that relied heavily on Internet deposits or brokered CDs rather than traditional core funding, are generally finding it more difficult to navigate this turbulent period.\n\nLet me emphasize that it's not just banks that have learned lessons from recent experience. The entire regulatory community needs to make important adjustments. The crisis exposed inadequacies in risk management for many financial institutions and in regulatory oversight. In response examiners have stepped up efforts to work with banks to improve risk-identification practices. For instance, the Fed has emphasized the importance of stress testing to help detect risks not identified by more typical statistical models.\n\nSo we are trying to do a better job of taking into account potential hazards such as large market moves, evaporation of liquidity, prolonged periods of market distress, or structural changes in the market. As it has turned out, this financial crisis has brought about all of these changes, and more, and all in a very short time period. So we should prepare for the worst and make the adjustments needed to an eventual economic recovery and a return to a new normal.\n\nBack to basics\n What do I mean by a new normal? To begin with, I expect this crisis will open doors of opportunity. Yes, there will be fewer banks. But the strongest banks in the future will be the ones that build market share during this time of adjustment.\n\nA key ingredient for success in this new normal of banking will be, quite simply, hard work. That is, the days of raising Internet deposits and funding real estate projects with little oversight—or simple underwriting—are gone. To succeed in the future, banks will have to spend substantial effort and time, first on closely evaluating potential credits and second on administering and monitoring those credits once they've been made. In addition to managing risks, the challenge facing some banks will be finding profitable lending opportunities more so than finding the funding.\n\nFuture growth will come from those banks that master the fundamentals. Successful banks, most likely, will have a stable core of deposits, they will focus relentlessly on cutting costs and improved efficiency, and they will probably resist the temptation to make easy profits on products they don't fully understand. They will need to have heightened awareness and skill when it comes to risk selection and risk management.\n\nThe winners will, in my opinion, follow tried and true strategies to cultivate relationships in the grassroots of their respective communities. They will distinguish themselves through outstanding service and value for their customers—both depositors and borrowers. They will excel at building relationships by attracting new customers and retaining old ones.\n\nIn my 42 plus years with the Federal Reserve, I have seen banking evolve from a highly regulated and low-risk endeavor to one less regulated and dominated by high margin business models that ultimately proved unsustainable.\n\nAfter the dust settles from the financial crisis—and that may be awhile—I expect the future lies somewhere between the two extremes I just described. For those of you who have what it takes to adjust to a new and probably more difficult reality, the future of banking is yours for the taking!",

            "content": "These and possibly other explanations may all be factors in the market. I'm sympathetic to the good omen explanations—that the rise is connected to the improved outlook—but I don't rule out that there is something here to monitor very carefully. The steepening of the yield curve may reflect growing concern over the nation's ability to correct profound structural imbalances; that is, to combine recovery with transition.\n\nAn immediate recovery that does not bring with it substantial progress in rebalancing the economy for the longer term will not be durable. And failure to effectively come to grips with the requirements of rebalancing could result in unwanted inflation and chronic economic underperformance.\n\nThe rebalancing agenda has been widely expounded. Among rebalancing imperatives, the U.S. citizenry must rebalance consumption and savings. Connected to this, the country must rebalance consumption and investment. And above all, the worsening fiscal imbalance must be addressed.\n\nHigher nominal rates in the term Treasuries market can be seen as an expression of creeping doubt that the American polity, and more specifically the policy community, is up to the sacrifices, tradeoff decisions, and the courage of convictions the situation requires.\n\nThe concerns about our economic path are crystallized in doubts expressed in some quarters about the Federal Reserve's ability to fulfill its obligation to deliver low and stable inflation in the face of very large current and prospective federal deficits. In a word, the concerns are about monetization of the resulting federal debt.\n\nI do not dismiss these concerns out of hand. I also recognize that the task of pursuing the Fed's dual mandate of price stability and sustainable growth will be greatly complicated should deliberate and timely action to address our fiscal imbalances fail to materialize. But I have full confidence in the Federal Reserve's ability and resolve to meet its inflation objectives in whatever environment presents itself. Of the many risks the U.S. and global economies still confront, I firmly believe the Fed losing sight of its inflation objectives is not among them.",

            "content": "Your conference theme—\"Meeting the Challenges of the Financial Crisis\"—provides wide latitude for a speaker to look back, look forward, and treat any number of topics. This afternoon, I plan to look ahead and consider certain challenges of the post–financial crisis period.\nIndeed, I believe it's a good time to start thinking about life on the other side of the financial crisis. Today, the economy is still very weak, but there are some encouraging signs that support cautious optimism.\n\nMy outlook calls for the beginning of a recovery in the second half of 2009. I do not expect a strong recovery, but I do expect the economic contraction we're now experiencing to give way to slow and tentative growth as early as the third quarter.\n\nRisks remain to this cautiously optimistic outlook. I am concerned about the commercial real estate sector and how its performance could affect the banking system, which I addressed in a recent speech. I am concerned that continuing job losses will reverse the slight indications of improving consumer confidence. And I continue to watch house prices with concern. House prices continue to fall, as indicated by the Case-Shiller index. Along with these domestic risks, global risks are also considered in my outlook given downward revisions in forecasts for gross domestic product growth in most major economies.\n\nNonetheless, I think this is an appropriate juncture to give more detailed and practical thought to the world we want to construct after this difficult period. In my remarks today, I plan to share my personal views (not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee) on a basic question about the postcrisis environment. It is: What regulatory environment will both align with the reality of financial markets and adequately address recent failings?\n\nI trust this topic is appropriate for a conference in honor of Hyman Minsky. As you know, he devoted much of his academic life to the forces that give rise to financial instability and the important role that institutional arrangements play in both the promotion of, and the remedy to, financial instability.\n\nFinancial markets and securitization\nThere has been much discussion about restoring a commercial bank–dominant financial system, downsizing large systemically critical financial institutions to eliminate the \"too big to fail\" problem, and limiting the role of securitization as part of a shrinking of the shadow banking system. These are examples of opinions that range from predictions to prescriptions on what the financial system will look like.\n\nThe financial system has already undergone what some would call radical change. I'm referring to the reduction of the number of stand-alone investment banks, the conversion of some investment banks to bank holding companies, and the forced consolidation of the commercial bank sector. I'm cautious about predicting such substantial change going forward. I expect the financial system to continue to involve a mix of capital markets and institutions, but with a wider array of institutions falling under regulatory supervision. Furthermore, I take it as given that there will continue to be large international institutions with operations in many countries, that is to say, regulatory jurisdictions around the globe.\n\nLooking ahead, I see an ongoing role for securitization and the originate-to-distribute model. Securitization markets have shrunk dramatically over the last year and a half and in some cases have shut down altogether. I expect these markets to return, perhaps in simpler form and with more accountability.\n\nI expect securitization to continue because this form of financial intermediation developed in response to needs and realities that have not disappeared. I was a commercial banker in the 1980s and I remember well the onset of the practice of balance sheet allocation according to return on assets and ultimately return on equity. Commercial banks were, and remain, caught in a dilemma of wanting to serve their clients by providing loans, but not always being able to justify booking very competitively priced loans on their balance sheets.\n\nThis tension gave rise to various securitization, distribution, and asset liquidity strategies including off-balance-sheet vehicles, such as the now notorious structured investment vehicles. The excesses that arose need to be addressed, of course, but the underlying economics of 12-to-one leverage banking continue to dictate that assets retained on balance sheet meet net interest margin and return requirements. Banks must compete against all businesses for capital and seek competitive returns and earnings per share growth. In this respect, they do not compete only against other banks.\n\nSecuritization has brought benefits to consumers that cannot be easily matched by a bank that originates a loan to hold. In particular, mortgage securitization, which began in the 1980s, has led to lower mortgage rates, advancing the social goal of homeownership by improving affordability. In more recent years, however, mortgage-backed securities have been engineered and resecuritized into increasingly complex structures known as collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs and even CDOs squared.\n\nInvestors in these securities relied on credit rating agencies to assess risk, and banks took advantage of regulatory arbitrage to conduct this business off balance sheet. The resulting lack of transparency regarding the value of the securities and the financial condition of the banks holding them was a central factor in the financial turmoil of the last 18 months.\n\nGoing forward, markets and investors will show a new awareness of the potential for complexity, opacity, and risk in securitized instruments. This awareness, in and of itself, has and will continue to provide incentives for the creation of simpler and more transparent securitization structures. For these and other reasons, I expect our securitization system to be reformed but not replaced.\n\nAgile oversight required\nThe regulatory environment we construct in the coming months must be suited to a financial system that remains a mix of capital markets and institutions—formal and shadow banking—with an array of institutional operating models.\n\nAgainst this reality, a system that responds to the perceived faults of the precrisis financial world by imposing a set of rules about what behaviors are prohibited is almost certain to amount to \"fighting the last war.\" I do not believe we can easily anticipate where the next source of stress in financial markets will arise.\n\nIn my view, the postcrisis environment will require agile oversight. This regulatory approach should stress actively managing risk as it evolves with the associated potential for an institution failing versus an approach that focuses on avoiding failure.\n\nFollowing this logic, the regulatory environment we construct should be a well-balanced mix of rules and principles guiding flexible response and should also give a meaningful role to market discipline. In an ideal world, effective market discipline necessarily allows for failure in a system in which no institution is too big (or interconnected, or complex, or operationally critical) to fail. It will take some time to achieve this ideal situation.\n\nSeveral policy actions over the last year and a half have been about avoiding the failure of a large, systemically critical institution. It's important to emphasize that some of these actions took place in the absence of resolution authority, that is, the authority of a regulator to manage the failure of an insolvent institution in a purposeful and orderly manner.\n\nIn simple terms, resolution involves these steps: 1) seizing control of the entity, 2) finding an acquirer or acquirers, 3) selling off assets, 4) stabilizing funding arrangements, including insured depositors and counterparty exposures, 5) working out unsold assets, 6) allocating losses to shareholders, bondholders, wholesale depositors, and other claimants, and 7) managing final liquidation and shutdown, if required.\n\nThough this list sounds relatively straightforward, aspects of it are extraordinarily complex. At the core of the systemic risk issue is the fact that banks and other highly leveraged financial institutions are involved in a complex network of two-way, short-term funding arrangements. The failure of a large interconnected financial institution threatens the funding of its counterparties, which then threatens their counterparties, and so on.\n\nThe metaphor that seems apt is a chain of falling dominoes. Any robust resolution process must come to grips with the potential for these sorts of network spillovers and include mechanisms for short-circuiting the potential cascade of counterparty failures when a lead domino falls.\n\nIt seems to me that this type of resolution of a large, globally integrated and diversified financial institution is new territory for regulators and involves some challenges that haven't been faced. Ideally the process would be substantially accomplished in a short period of time with as little expense to the taxpayer as possible. Some commentators have suggested that \"a short period of time\" be defined as something along the lines of \"over a weekend.\" Given the required scope and degree of integration with multiple national economies, that description of speed may be unrealistic.\n\nThe challenge (or problem) of resolution can be summarized as follows: The entity is not just a domestic financial institution, but a collection of many domestic institutions, all with cross-border connections. These entities in aggregate involve hundreds or more legal vehicles, operating across a range of business lines that are not easily separable, in as many sovereign legal and regulatory structures, each interested in orderly resolution in its jurisdiction. Further, there may be (is likely to be) no single buyer that is qualified and acceptable to all. A resolution exercise of this magnitude has not been performed before.\n\nYet, without a believable resolution capability, the too-big-to-fail problem isn't reduced. The problem becomes \"too big (interconnected, complex, etc.) to resolve.\"\n\nThis challenge suggests resolution planning should be a continuous effort on the part of regulators. Practices might include \"what-if\" consultation with national authorities where the biggest offshore operations are located, resolution simulations to identify potential problems in advance, and working with institutions and host governments to achieve cleaner and simpler legal structures that are resolution-ready. By resolution-ready, I'm envisioning legal vehicle structures that wrap the assets and business units of organic businesses into entities that can be easily evaluated and transferred in the event of a necessary disposal.\n\nThese are just top-of-mind ideas. My point is I'm urging careful thought on the implementation and execution capabilities required to limit systemic risk. In assessing the proliferating opinions about regulatory reform and focus, we should ask, how would you operationalize it?\n\nThe financial crisis in this country has resulted in financial industry consolidation. The effect of industry consolidation is greater concentration without, as yet, much reduction of systemic risk. The preferable direction is the opposite—toward less concentration.\n\nIdeas have been floated, but there is not yet much consensus on how to accomplish deconcentration. Forced downsizing and breakup is an option. I have concerns about such an approach. It strikes me as a drastic measure that could unfairly penalize relatively healthy and successful institutions.\n\nAn alternative could be a scheme of escalating supervisory attention as a financial institution approaches and exceeds thresholds of systemic risk. This approach might provide a check on institutions and be a disincentive to becoming a potential systemic problem.\n\nNo return to simpler times\nIn my remarks, I have tried to contribute—based on my experience as a banker turned policymaker—constructive thoughts for the architects of the postcrisis financial and regulatory world. Next month, the Atlanta Fed hosts a conference at Jekyll Island, Ga. The conference will take place where about a century ago many of the ideas leading to the Federal Reserve System were deliberated. Those meetings were held in 1910 in the aftermath of a financial crisis that bears strong resemblance to our current experience.\n\nComing off the turbulence of 2007 through 2009, I can appreciate the yearning for a simpler era. But the future financial architecture and the regulatory approach that lines up with it must be constructed, in my view, to be durable, evolve with inevitable change, and be equal to the reality of the financial sector that will survive this period. I expect the financial system to retain its diverse elements including securitization markets, large globally integrated institutions, and vigorous innovation.",

            "content": "Global Interdependence Center Conference on Food and Water: Basic Challenges to International Stability\nParis, France\nMarch 26, 2009\n\nIn the United States today there are growing social and political tensions between those who identify with the mainstream public—often called Main Street—and the financial sector, often lumped together as Wall Street. Many of my country's citizens see their interests as disconnected from the banks and financial markets.\n\nIn the past few months, I've delivered several speeches with the message that functioning credit markets are absolutely necessary for economic recovery. With a global recession and ongoing and comprehensive interventions aimed at restoring financial stability, I believe it's important for everyone to understand the linkages between credit markets and the broader economy.\n\nYour theme of food and water stability offers me another way to make my point about the interconnection of credit and economic activity. In my remarks, I will offer my views as a central banker on how problems in credit markets have dampened global trade, including trade in that most elemental of traded goods—food.\n\nTrade and finance\nI'd like to begin with some background on trade and credit markets. The fall of trade barriers and the rise of market economies, especially those in Asia and Eastern Europe, have driven rapid growth of international trade in recent decades. The value of merchandise trade in 2008 was about $16 trillion, according to the World Trade Organization. By some estimates, merchandise trade rose from 16 percent in 1983 to 25 percent in 2008 as a percentage of gross global product.\n\nImportantly, about 90 percent of cross-border trade transactions involved some form of credit (as opposed to cash settlement). So functioning credit markets have been and remain crucial to the flow of goods and services around the world.\n\nTrade-related credit is now supplied primarily by banks using the instrument of the documentary letter of credit, whose purpose is to secure payment for the exporter. Letters of credit guarantee that an importer is able to pay and allow exporters to load cargo for shipments with the assurance of getting paid. Pre-export and post-shipment funded credit is tied to the self-liquidating feature of letters of credit.\n\nA significant majority of trade finance is handled by private sector banks and is highly concentrated among a small number of lead institutions. Furthermore, there are anecdotal reports about the disappearance of the secondary market in trade credits and country exposure.\n\nExport credit agencies, which are often state run, tend to step up to play a countercyclical role by supporting export transactions when their domestic banks pull back. Export credit agencies assume risks that private lenders are unwilling or unable to accept and handle a sizeable portion—although a minority—of global trade financing.\n\nThis financing infrastructure made possible decades of trade expansion that came to a sudden halt in the fourth quarter of 2008. Since that time, many countries have reported double-digit declines in trade in nominal value terms, with real physical volume also declining.\n\nEconomists expect trade to decline during an economic slowdown. But the recent sharp contraction of trade appears to be far more severe than would be expected given the decline in global economic activity.\n\nI believe some of the fall in international trade can be attributed to the disruption of the interbank credit system. The marked reduction of interbank lending appetite has been associated more with the market for short-term liquidity, but it also has affected trade credit. With the interbank liquidity crisis, banks have moved to reduce overall counterparty exposure including trade credit.\n\nPricing also has been affected and adjusted upward based on perceptions of increased risk. According to the International Monetary Fund, more than 70 percent of banks said that charges for various types of letters of credit have risen in the past year. And the percentage is higher for trade-related secured lending facilities in which goods traded serve as collateral. Trade credit remains available in many cases, but its higher cost means fewer transactions are getting done.\n\nThe recent sharp decline of commodity prices also has affected trade financing. Volatile commodity prices have undermined confidence in the value of commodity cargo. There are reports of commodity goods piling up in the physical channels of trade because of trade finance closing down.\n\nTrade finance used to be less affected by macro financial instability. But since the Asian financial crisis of 1997, trade finance has become more sensitive to generalized liquidity squeezes.\n\nThe Asian crisis a decade ago was a defining moment in the evolution of trade finance. With the broad-based disinvestment from emerging markets during that period, the threat of contagion among borrowers alarmed international lenders. Capital account instability played a significant role during this period—more than during prior episodes of instability.\n\nIn 1998, at the peak of the financial crisis in Indonesia, international trade finance for imports emerged as a problem. In that case, international banks reportedly refused to confirm letters of credit opened by local banks because of an overall loss of confidence in the banking system.\n\nSince this episode, trade credit has tended not to be distinguished from other forms of exposure by creditors and, as a result, is now treated as just another form of short-term credit.\n\nThe global food chain and credit \nNow, let me add a few remarks about trade in food, which of course is a basic life necessity. According to the United Nations, food trade amounted to nearly $800 billion in 2007, or close to 6 percent of global trade. As a significant component of overall trade, food trade is also affected by problems with trade credit. Contraction of international trade in food commodities is a serious concern.\n\nFood represents from 10 to 20 percent of consumer spending in industrialized nations, but as much as 60 to 80 percent in developing economies. Many emerging countries depend on imports for a significant share of their food supply. As a result, some of these countries are highly vulnerable to contraction in food trade credit.\n\nMy home country has a major interest in this issue. The United States is one of the world's major exporters of food commodities. In the fourth quarter of last year, U.S. food exports fell 23 percent quarter over quarter.\n\nBeyond food exports, U.S. economic growth early last year was supported by overall exports, which held up until the sudden collapse in the fourth quarter. In my economic outlook for the remainder of 2009, I do not expect a sudden return of exports as a driver of recovery in the United  States.\n\nAn obvious conclusion is the world is interconnected not just by the flow of physical trade but also through the flow of trade credit.\n\nSteps to address financial issues\nIn the public square of the United  States, the tension over government actions to stabilize the banking and financial system has intensified in recent weeks. Much of the reaction to certain developments is understandable but, in my view, draws attention away from what must be the fixed focus of policy—to return the banking and financial system to health.\n\nFurthermore, the framing of the problem has been, perhaps naturally, mostly domestic. As a consequence, consideration of damage to the global trading system has taken a back seat for the most part.\n\nMy purpose today has been to bring attention to this dimension of the financial and economic crisis that besets us and to reemphasize the centrality of stabilizing banking systems. Banks are a vital element of the international trading system.\n\nMany actions have been taken to stabilize the U.S. financial system, and further very important measures are in train. For instance, the removal of legacy \"toxic\" assets from bank balance sheets is an essential step. The Treasury's plan announced Monday should address this issue. I believe the capital adequacy assessment program, which some have called stress tests, will establish a baseline of consistency with regard to balance sheet weakness and capital needs going forward. Finally, I welcome adjustments to fair value treatment of assets trading in illiquid markets that the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued for comment last week.\n\nThe subject matter of this conference—food stability—serves to elevate the priority of restoring full functioning of the trade finance system through continuing efforts to fix our various national banking systems. Food stability—or its inverse, food instability—tends to grab our attention and bring needed focus on what must be done.\n\nInternational trade has lifted millions of people out of poverty. But that progress is at risk. The weakened fundamentals of banks and the resulting diminished availability and higher cost of credit have become weak links in the chain of global trade. By restoring functioning credit markets, I believe these weaknesses can be repaired.",

            "highlights": "Remarks by Dennis P. Lockhart, President and Chief Executive Officer, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta; Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce, Miami, Florida, March 4, 2009.",
            "content": "Thanks for inviting me to be your speaker for the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce Trustee Luncheon. I appreciate this chance to speak to the business leadership here in your city.\n\nAlready this year I have given several speeches on the economy, and in my earlier remarks to other groups I provided a picture of a U.S. economy that was very weak but in a position to begin a modest recovery during the second half of the year.\n\nAlso, in these speeches I talked about a number of risks to this outlook. In my remarks today, I will elaborate on two of those risks, specifically residential and, especially, commercial real estate.\n\nI believe this focus should interest you since real estate is a very important contributor to south Florida's economy and, for that matter, to the Southeast region overall. Problems in residential real estate are well known. But with continued economic weakness I'm increasingly paying attention to commercial real estate.\n\nDeclining commercial real estate markets could put further pressure on already strained financial institutions and markets. And overcoming problems in the financial sector is central to achieving economic recovery.\n\nAs a policymaker, I feel the need to ground my views in a sober, unvarnished assessment of reality. But I do want to leave you with a sense that the Fed is ready and able to respond decisively to emergent problems in the economy and that the Fed's actions are buttressed by other public policy programs and vice versa. Let me lay the foundation for this discussion with a summary of the state of the U.S. economy and my near-term outlook.\n\nI must state up front that these remarks are mine alone and don't necessarily reflect the views of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nThe economy\nLooking broadly at the national economy, the recent numbers have been discouraging. Just last Friday, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis announced gross domestic product (GDP) contracted by 6.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008—worse than the 3.8 percent decline shown in the preliminary numbers.\n\nOther incoming data give little reason to be upbeat about the immediate future. Unemployment continues to rise. Unemployment insurance claims have been high—worse than generally expected. Consumer spending has declined sharply since last fall, especially spending on durable goods such as autos. Businesses have scaled back investment spending.\n\nIn the housing sector, January home sales reports—both new and existing—were well off December levels. Housing starts have fallen from a peak rate approaching 2 million to an annual run rate below 500,000. The pullback in new construction is probably a necessary evil to bring down elevated house inventories.\n\nAmid this sharp drop-off in economic activity, I take some comfort in signs of improvement in strained credit markets, particularly where policymakers have provided support. Interbank lending risk spreads have fallen in recent months, and residential mortgage rates have reached levels low enough to encourage refinancing and purchases by creditworthy borrowers. Commercial paper spreads over short-term Treasury bills have declined, and investment-grade corporate bond spreads have remained generally flat for some months. Investment-grade corporate bond issuance has been healthy of late.\n\nNotwithstanding some improvement, it's fair to say credit markets remain stressed.\n\nAll that said, I have been predicting an upturn in the overall economy beginning in the second half of 2009, with a slow and gradual return to our full economic potential. To temper that outlook a bit, uncertainty remains unusually high, and one has to be mindful of very real downside risks, including a further deterioration in real estate.\n\nResidential real estate\nAs you know, residential real estate was the catalyst of problems in credit markets. Problems in housing contributed to economic weakness, but now the slowing economy is feeding back into the continued housing slowdown. South Florida has been among the hardest-hit residential markets, so let me spend a few moments discussing housing.\n\nAt the current pace of sales, the nation's supply of new homes is more than 13 months—the highest on record. Sales of new single-family homes fell 10 percent in January, and existing homes fell more than 5 percent.\n\nHome prices here in Miami—after a steep run-up during the housing boom—have fallen 41 percent from a peak in December 2006. Nationally, house prices in 20 major MSAs have fallen almost 27 percent since their peak in the second quarter of 2006, according to the S&P/Case-Shiller index.\n\nOther measures show smaller declines nationally. There's no doubt, though, that declining house prices have been a major driver of mortgage delinquencies, defaults, and foreclosures. What's happening is a profound revaluation of mortgage portfolios as well as securities in the global secondary market for mortgage-backed securities.\n\nEfforts to prevent foreclosures appear to have had only modest success so far.1 There are many reasons this might be the case, but among them is the obstacle posed by securitization agreements to loan modifications. To date, payment-reducing modifications have been the exception rather than the rule. As a result, redefault rates have been high, and new foreclosures continue to add downward pressure on housing prices.\n\nI should also comment on the weakening multifamily residential real estate picture. No two rental markets are exactly alike. But to generalize, those markets trending the worst probably share one or more characteristics. They had excessive condo construction or condo conversion activity. Such markets are seeing unsold units return as rentals. They had very high home price appreciation in the years 2004—07 with large amounts of speculative house construction activity. Today, in several markets, houses compete with apartments as rentals. And they have been experiencing high and rising foreclosure rates.2\n\nCommercial real estate\nWhile historically smaller than residential real estate, commercial real estate (or nonresidential structures) accounts for a not-insignificant portion of the American economy—at least 4 percent of GDP directly and perhaps more, depending on estimates. Also, commercial real estate is important to the financial sector. And a rejuvenated financial sector is essential for economic recovery.\n\nThere are currently some $2.5 trillion of commercial property loans on the balance sheets of financial institutions and in commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) markets. In contrast, residential mortgage debt amounts to about $11 trillion.3\n\nSome 25 percent of commercial real estate debt is securitized, compared with 60 percent of outstanding home mortgage debt. The volume of CMBS has more than doubled since 2003, a bit faster than the growth of overall commercial real estate debt.\n\nThere are several subsectors of commercial real estate: retail, office, hotel, and industrial. All are facing problems.\n\nThere is a growing imbalance of retail space for several reasons. A lot of new retail space was added in areas that saw a high level of home construction, much of which has not been absorbed.\n\nThis imbalance is aggravated by general weakness in the retail industry. Established retail centers are seeing rising vacancy rates. When an anchor tenant leaves a shopping center, or overall occupancy falls below a threshold level, other tenants are often free to cancel their leases. Industry data indicate that abandoned retail store expansions and store closings have reached levels not seen since the recession and real estate slump of 1991–92.4\n\nThe hotel subsector is facing excess supply in the face of soft demand. Occupancy rates declined about 8 percentage points in the fourth quarter of 2008, according to industry sources.5 Summer tourism was hurt by high gas prices, and now business travel is declining as companies scale back in a weak economy.\n\nAlso, with the decline in the economy and rising unemployment, office and industrial vacancies have been rising. In virtually all segments of commercial real estate, there is downward pressure on property values because of new construction coming on stream—construction started before the recession fully set in—coupled with the effects of the economic downturn.\n\nInterestingly, the only property type currently withstanding downward pressures is warehouse. This seems to be, perversely, at least partly because of the back-up of inventories resulting from weak consumer spending and adverse retail and manufacturing conditions.\n\nFinancing pressures\nGiven eroding demand for commercial space, financing pressures in commercial real estate are cause for concern. Vacancy, property value, and financing are connected, of course.\n\nBanks are a primary source of construction financing for commercial properties. Various financing models have evolved. The largest construction loans on \"trophy properties,\" for example, are typically syndicated among very large banks with equity provided by institutional investors. When construction is completed and the property's operating cash flow has stabilized, the loan is placed with an investment fund, with an institutional investor, or in the CMBS market.\n\nFor other large properties, banks lend for the construction of new projects or to refinance existing loans and then look to the CMBS market to provide the longer-term funding. For smaller properties, many regional and community banks do not use the CMBS market on a regular basis, often keeping the mortgages on their books.\n\nThe National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts estimates that about $400 billion of commercial mortgages are set to mature this year, raising concern about maturity defaults.\n\nCommercial real estate finance challenges could further complicate efforts to stabilize the banking system and credit markets. Banks that financed the construction of commercial properties may end up keeping those loans if the properties cannot achieve the cash flow needed to service new permanent debt. Loans maturing face a CMBS market that virtually shut down in the latter part of 2008 and a banking industry that is already saddled with bad assets from the residential sector.\n\nPublic policy response\nAs a Fed policymaker, I must consider whether we have tools in place to soften the impact of emerging weaknesses.\n\nThe Fed has a number of tools at our disposal and has been using them aggressively.\n\nWith the emergence of financial turmoil, starting in the latter half of 2007, and weakening growth, the FOMC aggressively lowered the short-term policy interest rate—the federal funds rate—from 5.25 percent in September 2007 to a range just above zero today. The federal funds rate is the foundation rate of the whole spectrum of private market rates of varying tenors and loan purposes. By influencing the yield curve, the fed funds rate acts to stimulate general economic activity.\n\nThe Fed also introduced a number of targeted credit facilities aimed at easing liquidity pressures faced by financial institutions and restoring the functioning of key capital markets. Examples include facilities for commercial paper and money market mutual funds.\n\nRecently, the Fed has begun directly purchasing assets in securities markets. The Fed has authorized the purchase of up $100 billion of debt of federal housing finance agencies, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and another $500 billion of agency guaranteed mortgage-backed securities. To date, about $195 billion has been expended in this program. The provision of such liquidity has served to lower yield spreads on these securities, which ultimately can translate into lower mortgage rates for consumers.\n\nWith continued illiquidity in securitization markets, the Federal Reserve—in cooperation with the U.S. Treasury—recently announced that it is prepared to expand its forthcoming Term Asset-Backed Securities Liquidity Facility (TALF) from $200 billion to up to $1 trillion. This program was originally designed to support consumer and small business finance through lending on securities backed by small business loans, student loans, auto loans, and credit cards. An announcement yesterday also said that the Fed and Treasury are looking into accepting CMBS and other types of AAA-rated, newly issued ABS.\n\nI also want to mention measures taken to stem preventable foreclosures. Here in south Florida, for example, our staff created and co-chairs a homeownership preservation task force of nearly 80 organizations to promote dialogue between lenders and foreclosure counselors. Since foreclosure prevention is not always possible, we are also providing data and analysis to local municipalities as they prepare to purchase, rehabilitate, and sell properties to help protect neighborhood integrity.\n\nNear term and long term \nIt's fair to ask: Will these efforts be effective? There are no guarantees, but I take comfort from several aspects of the public policy response. First, policymakers have acted forcefully to address the economic and financial sector crises.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Fed interventions have had success in credit markets where we've introduced specific facilities to address acute market stress. I look forward to the day these programs are no longer necessary, but they can be kept in place as conditions require.\n\nSecond, other public policy organizations have also acted. For instance, the U.S. Treasury Department has announced a multipronged financial stability plan, which includes measures to strengthen the capital position of banks, remove bad assets from bank balance sheets, and other actions. And the new administration has recently released its comprehensive Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan that is designed to lower actual payments for many homeowners. In addition, Congress recently passed a large economic stimulus package with measures intended to stop net job destruction and kick-start job creation.\n\nWith regard to the longer run, it will be important to take a very careful look at what went wrong during this period. Many observers have expressed doubts about the securitization process. They have pointed to incentive conflicts within the originate-to-distribute model of financial intermediation, along with concerns about the ability of lenders and the rating agencies to properly measure risk.\n\nIn my view securitization markets need reform but in the end will be a substantial part of the nation's total credit system. Securitization has provided cost benefits to consumers and other borrowers and liquidity to loan originators, including commercial banks. It's essential that securitization markets get brought back to life.\n\nOne more thought in closing: Public policy and the resilience of our citizens are being tested. With respect to public policy, I want to assure you that the Fed has the capacity to act, even with the federal funds rate near zero, with the aim of returning the country as quickly as possible to its enormous potential for growth and prosperity.\n\nFootnotes\n\n1.

            "content": "Rotary Club of Atlanta\nAtlanta, Georgia\nJanuary 12, 2009\n\nWithout question, last year was extraordinary. Developments included the failure of storied investment banks and the introduction of an arsenal of economic policy tools and responses.\n\nEntering 2009—having been back in the South now for almost two years—I added one more tool to a list that includes rate cuts, special liquidity facilities, rescue funds, deposit guarantees, and interventions to save institutions whose failure would pose risk to the global system. Following an old tradition, I had a plate of black-eyed peas on New Year's Day for good luck. I figured, \"Well, it can't hurt.\"\n\nAs a policymaker on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), I want to organize my thinking by revisiting basic questions. I will structure my remarks today around two such questions. They are, first, what is Fed policy trying to accomplish in these extraordinary times? Second, how is the Fed going about accomplishing those policy objectives?\n\nThe context here really matters. The principal instrument by which the Fed influences the economy is the federal funds rate (the overnight rate at which banks lend and borrow central bank reserves). The fed funds rate can't go any lower. As you know, at the FOMC meeting December 16, the federal funds rate target was lowered to a range of 0–25 basis points. A year ago, when I last spoke to you, the fed funds rate target was at 425 basis points (or 4.25 percent).\n\nIn terms economists use, the policy rate has reached its zero lower bound. This situation has raised concerns that the Fed can't do any more to combat recession and that monetary policy—broadly defined—has lost relevance at a crucial point in time. I would argue that a federal funds rate this low will have considerable macroeconomic effect especially if accompanied by policies to improve the functioning of credit markets.\n\nTraditionally, these January talks by the Atlanta Fed president at the Atlanta Rotary have concentrated on the economic outlook. I will talk a bit today about the outlook, but I plan to depart somewhat from tradition to explain the new monetary policy regime that I expect will be employed for the foreseeable future—while the fed funds rate can't go any lower. My intent is to assure you the Federal Reserve has not exhausted its policy tools. The policy arsenal available to the Federal Reserve remains a powerful corrective force on the economy.\n\nAs usual, I offer the disclaimer that all my remarks are my personal views and don't necessarily reflect the views of my colleagues on the FOMC.\n\nThe state of the economy\n I'll begin with some economic highlights of the year we have just put behind us. We now know that the U.S. economy was in a recession that began in December 2007, and this recession could end up as one of the longest since World War II.\n\nFriday's employment report reinforced both the depth and breadth of the downturn. Nonfarm payrolls tumbled an estimated 524,000 in December as the unemployment rate hit 7.2 percent—a 16-year high. The economy lost around 2.6 million jobs for the year. Moreover, the job losses are very broad-based across industries, with only government, private education, and healthcare adding jobs in December.\n\nThe depth of the downturn is reflected in the dramatic decline in consumer spending in the third and fourth quarters of 2008, led by a collapse of auto sales. Motor vehicle sales were some 36 percent below year-earlier levels in December.\n\nJust a few months ago, inflation was at very high levels following a steep run-up in commodity and fuel costs. However, commodity prices, most notably oil prices, have fallen sharply in recent months, evidencing a marked pullback in global growth. This, combined with a fall-off of broad domestic activity, has led to a substantial slowing of inflation.\n\nAs much as anything, we'll probably remember 2008 for extreme volatility and dysfunction in financial markets, particularly credit capital markets serving businesses and households. Volumes of credit flows fell off dramatically, risk spreads widened, and some markets virtually shut down. We've seen improvement since the worst period in September and October, but, all in all, financial conditions going into 2009 are still unsettled.\n\nToday, as we move into 2009, economic conditions are extremely weak and financial markets remain impaired. In the banking sector, a posture of risk aversion—or at least caution—persists.\n\nWhat's the Fed trying to accomplish?\n Keeping these circumstances in mind, let me address the first question I posed at the outset. That is, what's the Fed trying to accomplish?\n\nIn simple terms, we're focused on containing the impact of the economic downturn and stimulating a recovery as early as possible. The Fed is not alone in this effort. The Treasury Department and other federal agencies have also implemented policies to support economic growth, and the incoming administration has proposed a large fiscal stimulus package for the economy.\n\nThe Fed, as the country's central bank, conducts monetary policy—as distinct from fiscal policy—under legal mandates set down by Congress. The Fed's mandated policy objectives—the so-called dual mandate—are sustainable economic growth along with low and stable inflation.\n\nThe mandates have not changed. But what has changed is some aspects of how we pursue those objectives. Extraordinary circumstances this last year and a half have required the Fed to expand the set of tools employed to meet those objectives.\n\nNew monetary policy\n Modern conventional monetary policy is usually thought of as the Fed's adjustment of the federal funds rate target in the overnight market for bank reserves. Bank reserves are a liability on the central bank's balance sheet. The fed funds rate is important because it influences the whole term structure of interest rates. The lowering of the funds rate target some 525 basis points since September 2007 can be seen as a direct response to worsening economic conditions and the resulting downward revisions to the outlook.\n\nThe federal funds rate is a very general tool and one that relies on the functioning of credit markets to have its intended effects. But, as you know, credit markets have not been functioning normally even in markets strongly backed by the U.S. government, such as agency (e.g., Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) mortgage-backed securities. In turn, mortgage markets and housing demand have suffered.\n\nProblems that began in the subprime mortgage-backed securities market spread rapidly and often ferociously among interconnected markets and institutions. It's not too much an exaggeration to say no one and no market remained untouched. In response to events, the Fed had to be creative.\n\nInitially, as the Fed responded to credit market strains, the focus was on interbank markets. But, as problems spread, the Fed introduced almost a dozen targeted credit and financial market facilities. The facilities now include short-term credit programs for financial institutions, longer-term lending arrangements, direct asset purchases, and swap lines with foreign central banks. The Fed has intervened, for example, in the commercial paper market, the agency market, and the private asset-backed securities market. Programs have supported banks, nonbank financial institutions, money market mutual funds, and, as you know, specific institutions deemed to be systemically critical.\n\nAmong the programs in force is the direct purchase of agency (Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, etc.) notes and mortgage-backed securities. These securities are directly linked to mortgage rates. Purchases began just a few days ago. The goal of such a program is not, in my view, to engineer a particular interest rate level, that is, to hit a particular rate target. But direct purchases can promote directionally lower rates, help restore normal market functioning, and thereby achieve a return to reliance on private sector market-based credit allocation.\n\nThe introduction of targeted asset-side measures has been aimed squarely at the breakdown of credit markets, the circulatory system of our modern economy. In my view, a precondition of economic recovery is the return of the normal functioning of credit markets.\n\nLet me emphasize that this asset-focused approach is a departure from what the textbooks describe as conventional monetary policy and is not without controversy. Some have called it credit policy to distinguish it from the conventional approach where the central bank achieves its objectives through its influence on bank reserves on the liability side of the balance sheet.\n\nI don't often use slides in speeches, but I want to show you this image because it so clearly illustrates this new approach and, I believe, helps to answer the second question I posed at the outset. And that is, how will the Fed go about accomplishing the policy objectives I described earlier by using the asset side of its balance sheet?\n\nAs the graph shows, there are two aspects of this policy approach—growth of the Fed's balance sheet in absolute terms and change of the composition of assets. Even with the federal funds rate effectively at zero, there is ample scope to do more of both if conditions require.\n\nMeasuring policy actions \n Is it working? Well, isolating the effects unique to the Fed's policy actions on these various markets is difficult. Nonetheless, financial market functioning has shown some signs of improving in recent weeks.\n\nBy way of example, in the short-term interbank funding markets, which are of central importance, spreads have declined markedly across maturities.\n\nConditions in commercial paper markets also have improved. Commercial paper issuance has increased from recent lows, and spreads on 30-day, asset-backed commercial paper, for instance, have narrowed.\n\n In addition, mortgage rates have fallen recently in response to the Fed's announcement that it will purchase large quantities of mortgage-backed securities and agency debt. Freddie Mac's most recent mortgage market survey showed the average 30-year fixed rate has declined to just over 5 percent—the lowest since the series began in 1972.\n\nIt's impossible to measure what economists call a counterfactual—what might otherwise have happened. But without a willingness to use all available tools and to adapt policy tools as conditions required, I'm convinced the economy's performance and current outlook would have been considerably worse.\n\nOutlook\nLooking ahead, the overall economy is very weak, and I expect it will remain weak at least through the first half of 2009. The incoming data suggest fourth quarter GDP contracted somewhere between 4 and 6 percent (annualized). And this quarter's performance could be similar. At some point—perhaps later this year—I believe financial markets will have stabilized sufficiently to support a recovery. So I am looking for an improving economy in the second half. To temper that a bit, there is always the risk of a shock or reversal in the financial sector or elsewhere that could again alter the outlook to the downside.\n\nClearly, the U.S. economy is in a tough fight against pernicious economic forces. But, on balance, confidence is warranted. Indeed, restored confidence is an essential ingredient in the mix of factors that will change the momentum of the economy. To buttress confidence, I want to assure you the Federal Reserve still has considerable ammunition in reserve to be used as needed.\n\nBy this time next year, I'm hopeful circumstances will look very much better than they do today. I must admit that I don't really like black-eyed peas, so I'm hoping I can take a pass on that dish next New Year's Day.",

            "content": "Thank you all for inviting me to speak to you this afternoon. This is a real privilege.\n\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac have become the subject of a great deal of attention and controversy. The source of this dispute lies in the institutions' unique federal charters that allowed them to become exceptionally large, profitable, and politically powerful. Recently, however, Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's exposure to risky mortgages compelled the federal government to intervene to stabilize both institutions and mortgage markets more generally.\n\nIndeed, on September 7, 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were placed into conservatorship by their federal regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency. And concurrent with this action, the U.S. Treasury entered into \"senior preferred stock agreements\" with each institution, obligating the federal government to inject up to as much as $100 billion each in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Little did we know at that time, but this action would only be the first of many public-sector capital infusions for financial institutions.\n\nIn my remarks this afternoon, I will first provide you with some background about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Then I will describe the sources of financial distress facing these two systemically important institutions, outline the federal government's steps to stabilize them, and present some evidence concerning the effectiveness of this and other recent federal interventions in secondary mortgage markets. At the end of my talk, I will offer some principles for federal involvement in these markets over the long term.\n\nWho are Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac?\nFannie Mae's roots are in the Great Depression. The National Mortgage Association of Washington, as it was first known, was created within the federal government in 1938 to allow geographic diversification and improved credit availability. Its business was to purchase FHA-insured mortgages from financial institutions around the United States. Fannie Mae was subsequently spun off in 1968 as a publicly traded company as a way to reduce the federal debt during the Vietnam War. By contrast, Congress in 1970 created Freddie Mac, which was owned by the 12 Federal Home Loan Banks and the savings and loans that were members of these banks. Freddie Mac became publicly traded in 1989 as part of the resolution of the thrift crisis.\n\nHence, today Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are quasi-public/quasi-private financial institutions, which are often referred to as government-sponsored enterprises, or GSEs. On one hand, each was created by Congress and maintains an exclusive federal charter. On the other hand, shares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are traded on the New York Stock Exchange. This unusual governance arrangement resulted in two, often opposing, corporate objectives: fulfilling certain social policy goals and assisting related political constituencies and maximizing shareholder value.\n\nBy law, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are limited to operating in the secondary mortgage market. Their participation in this market takes two forms. The first is the issuance of credit guarantees against mortgage pools, called \"securitization.\" And the second is leveraged investment in mortgages and mortgage-backed securities. As of June 30, 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac together held almost $1.8 trillion in assets and had another $3.7 trillion in net credit guarantees outstanding. This $5.5 trillion in obligations slightly exceeded the $5.3 trillion in publicly held U.S. Treasury debt at that time. It also reflects about one-half of all U.S. residential mortgage debt outstanding.\n\nHence, while Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's federal charters limit the scope of their activities, the scale is tremendous. One important reason for this is that the charters also confer several statutory and regulatory benefits that result in the capital markets viewing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac obligations as being implicitly guaranteed by the federal government. Examples of such benefits include Treasury lines of credit, the ability to issue government securities for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the ability to use the Federal Reserve as their fiscal agent.\n\nThe perception of an implied federal guarantee conveys a subsidy on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, part of which is translated into lower mortgage rates for consumers. These perceptions have also insulated Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from market-imposed limits on the institutions' size and risk-taking. These features were well understood by the federal government, which created a regulatory structure for the two institutions in 1992. Unfortunately, this structure proved deficient in many respects.\n\nSources of financial distress\nAs we are all aware, housing and mortgage markets have become increasingly stressed over the past two years. This stress has led to significant dollar losses at a variety of financial institutions, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The losses borne by the GSEs emanate from four places.\n\nThe first source of losses is the write-down of the value of private-label mortgage securities backed by subprime and so-called Alt-A mortgages. (Private-label mortgage securities are those not guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Ginnie Mae.) Holdings of such securities likely reflected a couple of factors. One is that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac faced distorted risk-taking incentives because of the perceived implied federal guarantee. Another factor was the federal requirements that mandate a certain percent of each institution's business be devoted to affordable housing.\n\nThe second source of financial distress at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac has been a substantial increase in provisioning for expected mortgage-related credit losses. These expected losses are associated not only with subprime and Alt-A mortgages but also prime loans.\n\nA third problem has been a loss in the market value of each institution's holdings of their own mortgage-backed securities. An unusual and unforeseen widening of the yield spread between Fannie Mae- and Freddie Mac-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities and 10-year Treasuries has led to mark-to-market losses. This widening is believed to be primarily caused by the financial market turbulence, although the aforementioned credit problems at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have also likely played a role.\n\nFinally, following the imposition of the conservatorship, both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac wrote off so-called tax-deferred assets in line with accounting conventions required of other regulated financial institutions. This write-off was also caused by dim prospects for positive profitability any time soon.\n\nTotal losses for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac over the past four quarters have been about $67 billion. While significant, these losses are modest relative to each institution's overall book-of-business. The problem was that both institutions were extremely leveraged, leaving little room for error. This point had been made previously, most notably by former Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President Bill Poole.\n\nEarlier this year, debt investors became increasingly concerned about the financial condition of both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These investors also sought clarity from the federal government about whether bondholders would be shielded from losses. The attendant uncertainty caused a dramatic fall in Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's share prices during June and early July. In response to concerns that the two institutions would be unable to rollover their debt, U.S. Treasury Secretary Paulson requested that the federal government be given broad authority to invest in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. That provision was included in the Housing and Economic Recovery Act that passed in July 2008.\n\nGovernment intervention\nDuring August, the U.S. Treasury studied investment options and sought third-party opinions about the financial conditions at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The Treasury also engaged the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) in discussions about the legal and operational hurdles to government involvement at one or both institutions.\n\nOn September 7, FHFA Director James Lockhart, U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke spoke at a press conference. These officials outlined a plan to stabilize the residential mortgage finance market that included placing both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into conservatorship and establishing new Treasury-operated liquidity facilities aimed at supporting the two institutions—a mortgage-backed securities purchase facility and a standing credit facility.\n\nBy becoming a conservator, the FHFA assumed the responsibilities of the directors, officers, and shareholders of both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Also, new chief executive officers were named to act as agents of the conservator.\n\nConcurrent with the conservatorships, the U.S. Treasury entered into a senior preferred stock agreement with each GSE. The purpose of the agreements is to ensure that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac maintain positive net worth going forward. If the regulator determines that either institution's liabilities exceed assets under GAAP, the Treasury will contribute cash capital equal to the difference in exchange for senior preferred stock. Each of these agreements is of an indefinite term and for up to $100 billion.\n\nIn exchange for the senior preferred stock agreements, the Treasury received from each Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac $1 billion of senior preferred shares and warrants for the purchase of common stock representing 79.9 percent of each institution on a fully diluted basis. The agreements also included various covenants.\n\nEffect on mortgage rates\nThe intent of the senior preferred stock agreements was to provide comfort to Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's senior and subordinate creditors and holders of mortgage-backed securities. This action, in turn, was expected to lower and stabilize the cost of mortgage finance. Of course, the senior preferred stock agreements had significant negative consequences for stockholders.\n\nThe initial market reaction to the federal intervention at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was tighter spreads on each institution's debt and mortgage-backed obligations. Related to this, conforming mortgage rates fell by about 50 basis points. These market reactions, coupled with a relatively smooth operational transition, suggested that the imposition of conservatorships at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was, so far, a success.\n\nHowever, by the first of November, mortgage rates and yields on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac obligations had climbed back to preconservatorship levels. Policymakers searched for additional tools to lower and stabilize the cost of mortgage finance. In response, the Federal Reserve announced November 25 that it was establishing new facilities to purchase up to $500 billion in mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae, and purchase up to $100 billion in debt obligations of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Bank System.\n\nLooking ahead\nThe federal intervention into Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac consisted of both the imposition of conservatorship regimes and the senior stock purchase agreements. Congress will likely need to pass new legislation to move these institutions out of the current arrangements. Today's consensus is that the previous public-private business model is inherently flawed and unstable.\n\nIndeed it is unclear what role Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will ultimately play in the U.S. housing finance system. And the reasons for this uncertainty do not solely rest with the two enterprises. The financial distress at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac has occurred along with significant and well-publicized problems at private mortgage insurance companies, monoline bond insurers, and a host of mortgage originators. The federal government has stepped in to fill some of this void. FHA-insured mortgages have increased as a share of mortgage originations, and Ginnie Mae securitization activity has similarly expanded. Hence, the federal government may need to redefine its role in supporting secondary mortgage markets.\n\nSecondary mortgage markets can help reduce mortgage rates by increasing liquidity, allowing geographic diversification, and encouraging competition. The federal government played a historically important role in developing these markets—both directly through Ginnie Mae and indirectly through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. However, based on my research, I conclude the reliance on secondary mortgage markets has probably been excessive, owing to a couple of factors. One factor was regulatory capital requirements for GSEs and depository institutions that encouraged more securitization than otherwise would have been the case. Another factor was the weak mitigation of the numerous conflicts-of-interest inherent in the originate-to-distribute model of financial intermediation.\n\nLooking ahead, I think it would be helpful for the federal government to develop a set of principles to guide its involvement in secondary mortgage markets. Among other things, I believe that policymakers should reassess various public policies encouraging homeownership, reconsider the mechanisms relied upon for ensuring the flow of funds to mortgage markets during times of stress, revisit regulatory policies that act to distort financial risk-management decisions, and require that any interventions are made transparent by accounting for them in the budget process.\n\nThe past two years have been a time of extraordinary upheaval for U.S. mortgage markets. In my opinion, the associated adjustments are likely to continue in 2009 as the new Administration and Congress take the lead in further action to stabilize our nation's mortgage finance system.",

            "content": "Delivered in place of Richard Fisher, president and chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, who was unable to speak because of an illness.\n\nToday, I plan to offer remarks on current economic conditions with some brief comments on building a recovery. Let me offer the disclaimer that my remarks are mine alone and don't necessarily reflect the thoughts of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Afterwards, I will be glad to engage in dialogue with you and try to answer any of your questions.\n\nCurrent conditions—economy and financial markets\nEarlier this week, we learned the economy is officially in recession and has been since December 2007, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. Already, we know that this recession has been longer than the past two recessions. At present we're in the midst of a long and painful adjustment process.\n\nLet me discuss the major components of the economic downturn. Employment is weak. We'll get a better picture tomorrow [Friday, Dec. 5] with the release of November data. Commercial forecasters project a decline of another 300,000–350,000 jobs for last month.\n\nThese job losses would be in addition to an employment decline of 1.2 million for the first 10 months of the year. More than half of that job loss occurred between August and October, so the rate of job decline has accelerated. The most recent unemployment rate is 6.5 percent—the highest since 1994.\n\nThe U.S. industrial sector is sharply contracting. The ISM Manufacturing Index continued its steep decline in November, reaching its lowest point since the 1982 recession. Also, purchasing managers report a sharp falloff in costs for commodities such as fuels and chemicals. The prices paid measure, after a sharp run-up earlier this year, is at the lowest level in almost 60 years.\n\nConsumer spending this year has declined sharply. Though retail sales for \"Black Friday,\" the day after Thanksgiving, were better than expected, the National Retail Federation projects holiday sales will rise about 2 percent this year—the smallest increase since 2002.\n\nThe housing decline has continued with negative consequences on overall economic growth. Housing sales are soft, inventories are high, and prices are falling.\n\nThe United States is not alone in economic weakness. And just a few months ago the picture was entirely different with strong global demand, along with a weakening dollar, supporting solid growth in U.S. exports. In recent years, some assumed that U.S. economic strength or weakness had become decoupled from growth in developing nations. But a recent slowdown in global growth calls into question that decoupling theory. Now, there's very little evidence to support the view that a severe economic cold in the United States would not infect the rest of the world.\n\nEconomic outlook\nGiven this picture of a pretty dramatic worldwide economic slowdown, let me briefly describe the Atlanta Fed's near-term outlook, which is not encouraging. Employment is expected to weaken further. Also, house prices likely will continue to fall with a further erosion of household wealth. Personal consumption likely will decline—at least for the next few months.\n\nWith a worsening recession in the United States, the rest of the world probably won't do so well, either. The International Monetary Fund now projects that for 2009 economic growth in advanced economies will contract for the first time since World War II. Growth for emerging economies also is expected to slow to about 5 percent.\n\nOne positive bit of news is that falling commodity prices and increasing economic slack have eased global inflation pressure.\n\nWith regard to the U.S. economy, I expect very weak growth for much of 2009.\n\nI hasten to add, however, that economic forecasts always involve substantial uncertainty. The elements interacting today include the complex and volatile behavior of financial markets globally, compounding weakness in the real economies of interdependent countries and regions, the political transition in this country, and the ever-present threat of noneconomic shocks from weather and geological events to pandemics to geopolitical crises.\n\nThis litany is intended to emphasize the challenge of economic forecasting.\n\nAs I evaluate options as a monetary policymaker, I believe the obvious questions when considering plausible scenarios are how deep will the recession be and how long it will last? If consensus forecasts are correct, we are experiencing the worst of this episode now and into early next year. It is difficult in these circumstances to hold any forecast with great conviction, but I do believe that process of adjustment necessary to recovery is ongoing.\n\nPolicy resources and elements of recovery\nI think it's possible to isolate elements of the current circumstances that require resolution as a recovery develops. I hesitate to call them sine qua non prerequisites rather as primary contributors. They are 1) housing sector and house price stabilization, 2) a return of consumer confidence, and 3) credit confidence.\n\nA direct path to recovery is unlikely, and, as we have seen, events arise that potentially threaten to knock us off the path to a more stable economic environment. Here I am thinking, of course, of the credit markets events of last spring and, especially, the last couple of months. In each of these cases, the Federal Reserve, U.S. Treasury, Congress, and other organizations stepped in to unfreeze frozen markets and limit, to the extent possible, damage to the broader economy.\n\nWhat else can the Fed do? In my view, the Fed retains a number of options to help ease the economy through this difficult transition.\n\nFor instance, the Fed has the ability to influence the economy by adjusting the fed funds rate, which has been lowered to 1 percent. It is true that we are limited in this approach by the fact that the funds rate cannot fall below zero. But as Chairman Bernanke indicated in a speech a few days ago, there are many other mechanisms that the FOMC can use to provide liquidity beyond targeting overnight interest rates.\n\nBeyond that, the Fed also has the ability to provide liquidity through various facilities, which have been expanded significantly in recent months. Also, the Fed has the ability to work with other central banks, and that process of international coordination of policy actions is continuing.\n\nThe recession has advanced to the point that it's well beyond the housing sector, where many of the problems started. The process of working through today's problems is ongoing. It has been painful, and the spillover of financial turmoil has been broad based.\n\nNotably, that spillover has involved periodic and acute problems in credit markets. The Fed and other authorities have stepped in as appropriate to help address issues and have worked to dampen the effects of these problems along the way. I am fully confident that we have both the means and the will to continue to do so as events require.\n\nClosing\nThe country faces very challenging circumstances. There is little to be encouraged about in current data. The near-term outlook does not, in my view, offer material relief. If current forecasts bracket reality, this quarter and the next one or two are likely as bad as it will get. Policymakers have policy tools remaining to respond to unwelcome surprises. And the intrinsic resilience of the economy at its core combined with the regenerative capacity of the financial system will carry us through.\n\n",

            "highlights": "Remarks by Dennis P. Lockhart, President and Chief Executive Officer, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta; Joint conference hosted by the Business Development Board of Palm Beach County, the Economic Council of Palm Beach County, and Palm Beach County, Florida, November 7, 2008.",
            "content": "The country is suffering from a severe financial crisis that has contributed significantly to an accelerating economic downturn. What started as a housing sector problem became a generalized financial and credit market problem that spilled into the general economy.\n\nToday, I want to provide a good fix on where we are—the current status of the economy and financial markets—and then take stock of what policymakers have done to date in response to developments. Finally, I'll comment on near-term recovery prospects for financial markets and the economy and share some personal thoughts on what's needed for durable recovery over the long term.\n\nI must emphasize that the views you'll hear are mine alone and not necessarily shared by my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nStatus of the economy\nAs you know, the Federal Reserve pursues a dual mandate—economic growth consistent with maximum sustainable employment and price stability.\n\nRecent data indicate that the national economy is in recession. Economic activity as measured by real gross domestic product (GDP) declined an estimated 0.3 percent at an annualized rate in the third quarter, according to the advance estimate. Data for October suggest an even steeper decline in GDP for the fourth quarter.\n\nRecent downbeat readings follow fairly strong GDP growth in the first part of the year. Those results were buoyed primarily by exports and the temporary impact of the federal tax rebate on consumer spending.\n\nGDP data earlier this year probably masked underlying weakness. I say this because employment has declined in every month this year. In recent weeks, business reluctance to hire has shifted into a marked increase in layoffs. The most recent reading of unemployment was released this morning and came in at 6.5 percent—up from 4.9 percent in January 2008 and the highest in 14 years. In 2008, nearly 1.2 million jobs have been lost.\n\nContraction of the nation's housing sector has also continued to weigh heavily on the overall economy this year, and this has been especially apparent in parts of Florida, such as the Palm Beach area. A spike in foreclosures has added to the supply of homes for sale in the area and accelerated price declines. The problem is particularly evident in the local condo market, where construction continues to outpace demand. West Palm Beach ranks among the top 10 cities in the United States for condo completions, with thousands of units still under construction.\n\nThe U.S. economy in September and October appeared to weaken dramatically. Forces of contraction took hold in consumer spending, business investment, industrial production, and foreign demand for U.S.-made goods. Problems are now broad based. Beyond the housing sector, activity has fallen in auto manufacturing, transportation and distribution, retail trade, financial services, and some segments of commercial real estate.\n\nAnd without question, the dramatic events of September and October in the global financial markets contributed to an extremely cautious posture on the part of consumers and businesses.\n\nTo illustrate the relevance to Florida, the tourism industry reflects the erosion of economic confidence. At a tourism industry meeting organized by the Atlanta Fed last week in Miami, it was noted that during the first eight months of this year tourism attendance was steady—although revenue per visitor declined. But starting in September attendance collapsed, with tour operators, hoteliers, restaurants, and other businesses noting a sharp drop-off in activity.\n\nAs a result of the widespread weakness in the U.S. economy, inflationary pressures appear to be declining. In particular, sharply lower energy and other commodity prices have contributed to lower headline inflation measures, and businesses appear to be more hesitant to pass on cost increases. The headline personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index in September eased on a year-over-year basis for the second consecutive month, to 4.2 percent.\n\nEconomic outlook\nAll in all, the near-term economic outlook is not encouraging. The incoming data in September and October have been worse than expected, and these results pushed my staff and me to revise downward the Atlanta Fed's outlook for the economy.\n\nI foresee substantial weakness at least through the first half of 2009. This weakness will exacerbate the employment picture. In my outlook, unemployment will rise some more.\n\nIf there is anything positive in this near-term outlook, it is the trajectory of prices. I expect headline inflation to decline over the coming months and fall into an acceptable range below 2 percent by 2010. Over the longer term, inflation experience is influenced by inflation expectations. Encouragingly, the University of Michigan consumer survey's reading for October shows a moderation in inflation expectations both for the year ahead and for the longer term.\n\nEarlier, I mentioned the positive effect of exports on overall economic performance in the first half of the year. Could exports save us? Here too the picture is not encouraging. Economic weakness has spread in recent months to engulf much of the developed and emerging world, including key trading partners in Europe and Asia. This, together with the recent increase in the dollar, should push down exports.\n\nThe front-and-center question about the path of the economy is how deep and how long. Economic forecasts always involve substantial uncertainty. The elements interacting today include the complex and volatile behavior of financial markets globally, compounding weakness in the real economies of interdependent countries and regions, the political transition in this country, and the ever-present threat of noneconomic shocks from weather and geological events to pandemics to geopolitical crises.\n\nThis litany is intended to emphasize the challenge of economic forecasting. Prudence dictates consideration of alternative scenarios that, taken together, capture a range of outcomes. For instance, there are plausible upside scenarios anticipating rapid stabilization of financial markets and a quick snapback of the economy. And there are, of course, scenarios estimating a deeper and more protracted period of economic distress, and I believe these have to be taken seriously.\n\nThe term \"risk,\" as used in financial and economic discourse, means a quantifiable deviation from expectations. So—contrary to popular understanding—you can have upside risks along with downside. In our consideration at the Atlanta Fed of paths for the economy and its components, we commonly make a judgment on the balance of risks around our baseline outlook and include it in the mix of things influencing my policy recommendation. On balance, I must give greater weight to downside risks at this juncture.\n\nI don't want to suggest a truly dark, doomsday-like scenario. Such storylines get much airing in times of stress but ignore the self-correcting nature of financial markets as well as the arsenal of policy tools available.\n\nStatus of the financial crisis\nThe intense correction in the housing sector—clearly evident here in Palm Beach—has undermined confidence in the broader financial sector that has, in turn, fed economic weakness and further housing decline. This adverse feedback loop is very real. This dynamic has exposed the highly reticulated reality of our modern financial economy that helps explain the surprising spread of what was widely thought to be a disturbance limited to the U.S. housing sector.\n\nHere is my sense of the status of the financial crisis: The dysfunction is centered in the credit markets including interbank, mortgage, corporate and business, municipal, and commercial real estate. To varying degrees, these markets remain quite strained. Also, equity markets have expressed pessimism about the effect of constricted credit flows on the broad economy and about the obvious weakness of incoming economic data.\n\nIn many credit markets liquidity remains tight, maturities remain short, new issuance remains subdued, and pricing remains wide relative to precrisis levels. Fears of counterparty insolvency remain widespread in the interbank funding markets. September and October saw a flight to safety as evidenced by demand for Treasury securities, for example. There have been signs of improvement lately, but concerns persist that this is a false dawn, and more trouble could lie ahead.\n\nSmaller businesses don't access credit markets directly; rather, they borrow from banks. About 75 percent of domestic banks last month reported tighter lending standards for loans to smaller firms, according to the Fed's Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey. That rate is up from 65 percent in the July survey.\n\nWhat's been done\nAs financial troubles have gathered over the last few months and the systemic scope and scale of the situation have become evident, an impressive array of creative measures have been employed to forestall further deterioration. These measures can be organized under the rubrics of monetary versus fiscal, liquidity versus solvency, and domestic versus international.\n\nThe federal funds rate target has been lowered by a total of 425 basis points since August 2007. On October 29, the FOMC dropped the target fed funds rate by 50 basis points to 1 percent—the lowest level since 2004. This cut followed a drop of 50 basis points on October 8. Also, earlier this year, the Fed lowered the premium for discount window borrowing.\n\nIn my view, these decisions were forceful responses to deterioration of the overall economy and the continuing dysfunction and volatility of the financial system. Now is not a time to be tentative.\n\nThe Fed has also undertaken several liquidity-enhancing measures over the past year, including six special-purpose facilities known by their initials: TAF, PDCF, TSLF, AMLF, CPFF, and MMIFF. To encourage resumption of interbank and wholesale lending, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) has temporarily guaranteed most short-term deposits.\n\nThe fiscal authority—the U.S. Treasury, with Congress approving—put Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into conservatorship. In addition, the Treasury Department is now implementing the TARP (Troubled Asset Relief Program) approved under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. A key feature of the TARP is the injection of capital into the banking system, a program aimed at preserving solvency. This follows implementation of a fiscal stimulus package earlier this year.\n\nUnder the heading \"international,\" the Fed has put in place dollar swap facilities with a number of central banks. These facilities provide U.S. dollars to the monetary authorities of countries whose commercial banks require dollar-based liquidity support. And on October 8, as already mentioned, the Fed participated in a coordinated action of rate cuts along with five other central banks. Much has been done.\n\nI expect these cumulative measures will help create the conditions needed for financial markets to stabilize and find a new normal. What's got to happen? Two things: First, U.S. house prices need to stop falling, and the volume of defaults and foreclosures needs to stop rising. These factors should help stabilize troubled asset values. Second, deleveraging of the financial sector must run its course. Deleveraging continues—both voluntary and forced (forced by regulatory ratios, fund redemptions, and tougher lending terms between financial counterparties). Progress on these fronts should enhance clarity regarding the condition of counterparties in transactions internal to the financial sector and lead to a general return of confidence. Restoration of confidence is essential.\n\nRecovery will certainly come, and there are hopeful signs these last few days in the credit markets that the process has begun.\n\nWith sustained improvement of term funding and other indicators of credit market health, my rather sober and downbeat short-term economic outlook proceeds to an eventual recovery of growth near potential with inflation returning to an acceptable range.\n\nBuilding a long-term, durable recovery\nLet me close with some thoughts for the long term. In some respects, the current financial crisis and economic fallout can be seen as a painful adjustment made necessary by macro imbalances that are global in nature. Symptoms in this country of such imbalances have included a highly leveraged financial system, a savings shortfall in the household sector, and growing public sector deficits.\n\nIn my view, a mere cyclical recovery that returns to the status quo ante will not be durable. The shape of that recovery must witness coming to grips with deep structural imbalances in our economic arrangements if we are to lower the potential for a recurrence of instability. Ideally, the return of confidence and the better conditions this will bring should be accompanied by progress or even resolution of these imbalances as part of a durable recovery for the long term.",

            "content": "Greater New Orleans Inc.\n New Orleans, La.\n Sept. 30, 2008\n\nThanks for inviting me to speak to your distinguished group. Hurricanes Gustav and Ike brought back memories of Katrina and Rita three years ago and reminded onlookers around the country of the courage and resilience of the people of New Orleans in the face of manifold stresses brought by these storms.\n\nToday we're in the midst of very stressed financial markets with the potential of doing serious damage to the broad economy—Main Street in the current jargon—both here in the United States and abroad.\n\nIn a few moments, I will talk briefly about the domestic economic outlook. But considering the fluid and fast-moving developments in the financial markets during the last month, I feel some obligation to address the immediate matters that are front of mind for most Americans.\n\nSpecifically, I will comment on conditions in the financial markets. I will try to bring some perspective to the complex situation policymakers currently face. And I will try to draw the connections between the financial sector, where these problems currently reside, and the lives of ordinary citizens.\n\nAfter my remarks, I will be happy to take some of your questions. Let me add that the views I present are mine alone and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nConditions\n Let me begin by trying to summarize the extraordinary situation that has developed this month (extraordinary even in the context of the continuing financial turmoil that began in August 2007 and has persisted for 13 months).\n\nCredit markets remain quite strained. This is particularly the case in interbank markets in the United States and abroad. The interbank markets are a fundamental element of the plumbing of the financial world. Banks with excess balances put them to work by lending to other banks that have clients—companies and individuals—who need the funds.\n\nThe loan portfolios of U.S. banks and financial institutions are, as you would expect, mostly dollar-denominated. But foreign banks in recent years have also built sizeable \"books of business\" in dollars. The dollar interbank credit contraction is a worldwide problem that affects not only our banks here but banks overseas, particularly in Europe.\n\nWhen banks lend or take on other forms of exposure to each other, they gauge the counterparty risk. In recent weeks, there has been a widespread withdrawal of confidence in counterparties that has resulted in efforts to reduce exposure.\n\nAs part of this, maturities have shortened, risk spreads (typically measured as the interest rate spread over U.S. Treasuries) have widened, the cost of hedging against default risk (another measure of perceived counterparty risk) has risen dramatically, and the range of assets accepted as collateral has narrowed. Also, demand for liquidity provided by the Federal Reserve has intensified.\n\nThis contraction in availability and rise of the cost of credit have worsened as well for corporate and business borrowers. We've heard anecdotes confirming this from contacts throughout the Southeast. In short, Main Street is being affected.\n\nThe balance sheets of many banks and financial institutions continue to be burdened by illiquid, impaired assets that—because they are illiquid—are exceedingly difficult to value. One frequently hears the complaint, \"No one knows what this stuff's worth.\"\n\nFinancial institutions worldwide have been trying to deleverage; that is, offload at acceptable prices some of their stock of impaired assets and generally bring down their leverage ratios. This has proven hard, if not impossible, to do. As you know, a high proportion of the troubled assets is made up of mortgage-backed securities whose financial performance—cash flow—is unstable because of the continuing delinquency and foreclosure saga. Uncertainty about what's in a security is compounded by uncertainty about how individual loans will perform. Projections of loan performance are, in turn, affected by an uncertain economic outlook. All of this has driven off almost any buyer interest in these securities.\n\nIn recent weeks, an extremely difficult environment in credit markets—both interbank and corporate—has spread to the sphere of money market mutual funds. Problems have been felt mostly in institutional money market funds. Concern about fund exposure to financial institutions whose liquidity is deteriorating has prompted redemptions. News of redemptions has raised worries—and a few actual cases—of money funds \"breaking the buck,\" taking principal losses. Money market funds were never supposed to do that.\n\nIn response, earlier this month, the Fed introduced a new liquidity facility called the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (AMLF). This facility provides liquidity to markets by extending loans to banking organizations to finance their purchases of high-quality asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) from money market mutual funds.\n\nSeptember events\n Up to this point, measures in response to conditions and developments have been incremental—dealing with problems as they arise one by one. Let me review the key developments in the month of September:\n\nSunday, Sept. 7: The U.S. government placed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into conservatorship. This action was taken to stabilize housing and mortgage finance markets.\n\nMonday, Sept. 15: Bank of America announced it agreed to buy the investment bank Merrill Lynch. Also, efforts to find a buyer of Lehman Brothers failed. The same day Lehman Brothers announced it was going to declare bankruptcy.\n\nTuesday, Sept. 16: AIG received an emergency credit line from the Federal Reserve—an action supported by the Treasury—to facilitate an orderly downsizing of the company.\n\nFriday, Sept. 19: The Treasury's rescue plan was first publicly proposed. As you know, the ultimate proposal presented to Congress after extensive deliberations was voted down yesterday in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nAlso on Sept. 19: As mentioned earlier, the Fed introduced the AMLF.\n\nMonday, Sept. 22: Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley—the last two independent investment banks on Wall Street—were approved to convert their status to bank holding companies. This meant that going forward they would be supervised by federal banking regulators, conform to bank leverage ratios, and have access to the Fed discount window.\n\nFriday, Sept. 26: Washington Mutual, a $300 billion thrift, announced that most of its assets would be acquired by JP Morgan.\n\nMonday, Sept. 29 (yesterday): Wachovia announced that most of its banking assets would be acquired by Citigroup with federal assistance.\n\nThese events were the most notable effects of deteriorating trends in credit and financial markets that, if allowed to march on, pose a serious threat to the broad economy. Let me elaborate further on those trends.\n\nConditions, continued\n Equity markets are down significantly for the year, particularly in September.\n\nBond markets have been under significant stress, with major corporations finding it difficult and expensive to issue debt. New debt issuance was $15.5 billion in September of this year compared with $101 billion in September of 2007.\n\nIn the so-called cash markets, which are short term and normally very liquid markets, commercial paper issuance has become increasingly difficult for large corporations. Total commercial paper outstanding is down $244 billion from September 2007 and down $44 billion the week ending September 24.\n\nThese data on credit markets translate to accelerating shrinkage of business credit at all levels, from large corporations to small businesses.\n\nThe yield last Thursday on the one-month Treasury bill was 0.1 percent versus 3 percent at the beginning of the year and 1.6 percent at the beginning of September. This drop in yields reflects a broad flight from risk.\n\nIn sum, the situation in September has been one of accelerating deterioration of the institutional and market landscape of our financial system.\n\nThese conditions are still with us and, as of yesterday, show no signs of relenting. \n If they persist, they will surely evoke public policy responses in an effort to restore confidence in financial markets. Confidence will return with improved liquidity, more clarity on the value of troubled assets, and the recapitalization of financial institutions. These are prerequisites of credit expansion in support of growth.\n\nThe ultimate aim is to avert serious costs to the total economy and facilitate the process of long-term economic recovery.\n\nImplications for real economy \n Let me turn to the question of the outlook for the total economy.\n\nAt the root of today's financial turmoil is housing sector weakness. In recent months, housing starts have declined sharply, and inventories of unsold new and existing homes remain high. With oversupply, house prices in most markets have continued to decline. Financial instability has affected house prices by tightening credit to potential home buyers.\n\nPrior to September, we at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta had a rather downbeat outlook for the second half of 2008 and early 2009. We expected—and continue to expect—a very weak second half reflecting contracting consumer spending, weaker business investment, and slower export volume.\n\nExport demand has been an important factor that has helped sustain the U.S. manufacturing sector in recent months. But economic growth prospects in many of our major trading partners have weakened notably in recent months, and this weakening has dampened the outlook for the export sector.\n\nConditions in labor markets also have weakened. During the first half of 2008 the data showed that residential construction and related manufacturing industries were reducing their workforce while other businesses were hesitant to add to payrolls. But more recently the data suggest that layoffs have become more widespread, and hiring intentions have pulled back further.\n\nWeak labor markets feed into weak income growth and sluggish consumer spending. Reports from retailers suggest that the outlook for the upcoming holiday season has been pared back as consumers are expected to tighten their belts further. At the same time, lending standards for most types of consumer credit have tightened.\n\nLouisiana's economy is somewhat an anomaly in the current environment. Recovery efforts following the 2005 hurricanes mean that job creation continues. It's noteworthy that total employment in the state has recently surpassed pre-Katrina levels, although New Orleans remains a much smaller city than before the storm.\n\nAs you may know, the Fed has a dual mandate that deals with growth and inflation.\n\nThough I and my staff take nothing for granted, I feel better about inflation. I believe the weaker economy combined with lower oil and commodity prices would serve to suppress inflationary pressures, especially \"headline\" or overall inflation.\n\nOverall, the outlook for inflation may have improved, but prospects for growth have weakened. Importantly, I believe problems in our financial system add significant risk to the downside for the economy.\n\nA working financial sector matters to us all. Credit is the lifeblood of a modern economy. Illiquid credit markets mean illiquid banks and ultimately illiquid businesses. I don't need to explain to a room full of businesspeople what happens when credit dries up and a business becomes illiquid. Cash becomes king, efforts are made to accelerate inflows, and cash outlays are reduced. Managers focus on discretionary expenses, and then the biggest categories of cash outflows—salaries and investments. Jobs, and livelihoods, are at stake.\n\nOur modern economy involves linkages that aren't always apparent—including vital connections between the financial sector and businesses and households. In my view, we need to deal with today's problems in the financial sector realistically, pragmatically, and as a national community.",

Their concept empowers parents to choose providers in a  competitive market.\n\nMiami is emphasizing technical  assistance to providers and overall leadership to be delivered by a center of  excellence organized under the auspices of the United Way.\n\nNorth Carolina's approach involves  decentralized local program development funded by state and business dollars  governed by a public-private oversight board.\n\nI  know there are other nodes of early education leadership and innovation. I hope  to visit others in the coming months and develop a good sense of the national  landscape in this arena.\n\nIn  their communities, committed individuals make a huge difference. For example,  in Minnesota, leadership comes from Duane Benson (chief  executive officer of the Minnesota Early Learning Foundation), key private  sector companies, and my colleagues at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. In Miami, David Lawrence, former  publisher of the Miami Herald, has  developed a national reputation for his leadership in this cause. In North Carolina, former Gov. Jim Hunt  played a key role. In addition, a range of leaders from the public and private  sector—including North Carolina's large banks—keep the  North Carolina Partnership for Children and its Smart Startinitiative going.\n\nThe Atlanta case\n  In Atlanta, we're not starting from  zero. Georgia benefits from a  lottery-funded voluntary universal statewide pre-K program for 4-year-olds that  includes content standards, approved curricula models, quality assessment, and  onsite monitoring. But in 2007–08 this program only reached 57 percent of the  nearly 134,000 four-year-olds in the state. The participation rate in metro Atlanta—where about half of Georgia's 4-year-olds reside—is barely 50 percent.\n   \n  Smart  Start Georgia, led by the United Way of Metropolitan Atlanta,  has worked to significantly increase the number of nationally accredited  childcare centers across the state. We also have some good models of teacher  training and technical assistance in some communities. Yet we need to find ways  to replicate these models and extend their reach.\n\nA  key challenge for a populous region such as greater Atlanta is taking implementation  strategies that have proven to be effective in smaller settings and extending  them to more children—scaling them. While we've made great progress in Georgia, we have much work to do to  achieve a fully built-out delivery mechanism with all of the elements I listed  earlier. I am encouraged that we are starting with some critical elements  already in place and a commission of diverse leaders—including several business  leaders—willing to learn about this issue, set aggressive goals, and deliver  recommendations with practical steps for implementation.\n\nConclusion \n  As  I said up front, this subject matter is new to me, and I expect to learn a lot  in the coming months. So I must couch my propositions and observations in  predictable caveats—they are preliminary, tentative, and revisable. But let me  make a bold claim about the long-term future. In time, development of our  children in formal pre-K programs will begin at age 2. And by age 5, our  population of children will be on a much surer path to individual success in  school and readiness to compete as adults in the global economy.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nCenter on the Developing Child at Harvard   University.

            "content": "I'm aware that Georgia State's College of Business (now the Robinson College of Business) has been convening these economic outlook conferences since at least the 1980s, when I previously lived in Atlanta. You've earned a fine reputation. I'm honored to be included in the program this morning.\n\nThe stock in trade of Federal Reserve Bank presidents is the economic outlook speech. Later this morning Rajeev Dhawan will provide his views on the outlook. Instead of competing with such a well-regarded economic forecaster, I will devote my remarks to the topic of inflation.\n\nOn August 14, the July reading of the so-called headline consumer price index was released. The 12-month inflation rate through July was measured at 5.6 percent, the highest since 1991. This is a high and worrisome number.\n\nI've titled my talk this morning \"Inflation beyond the headlines.\" Central bankers aren't especially known for clever wordplay, but the title was meant to suggest both a deeper treatment of the topic and a look at the phenomenon of inflation beyond so-called headline inflation: the inflation you and I experience as consumers. I plan to cover the current state of inflation in our economy, some instructional information and views on inflation analytics, and my near-term outlook for inflation. I must emphasize I am speaking only for myself. The views I will express are mine alone and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nWhat do we mean by inflation?\n Let me begin by posing the simple question: What do we mean by \"inflation\"? The answer to that simple question isn't as simple as it may seem.\n\nThe popular treatment of inflation in our sound bite society risks confusing inflation with relative price movements and the cost of living. By cost of living, I'm referring to the costs you and I incur to maintain our level of consumption of various goods and services including essential items such as food, gasoline, and lodging.\n\nRelative price movements occur continuously in an economy as individual prices react to market forces affecting that good or service. Neither relative price movements nor sustained high living costs constitute inflation as economists commonly use the term.\n\nUp front, I want to be clear that I'm well aware recent cost increases have hurt many households and businesses, especially those heavily dependent on transportation. Believe me, I'm not happy about paying $3.80 for a gallon of gasoline, and I know you're not either.\n\nIn the past three months, costs faced by the average urban family as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) have risen at an annualized rate of more than 10 percent. Food and energy accounted for about two-thirds of that rise. But the higher cost of maintaining consumption—while certainly painful—is not exactly the same thing as higher inflation. Let me explain.\n\nEarly in the last century, the economist Irving Fisher offered a vivid metaphor for the movement of individual costs relative to the aggregate level of inflation. The general inflation, he said, can be thought of as the movement of the swarm of bees. He likened the relative movement of individual prices (both up and down) to the movement of individual bees within the swarm. Now, I admit that Fisher's analogy may be simplistic. Not all prices move in the same direction, but consumers tend to pay greater attention to rising prices than those that are falling. Recently, the average price of personal computing has declined while energy and food costs have increased.\n\nMonetary policy discussions are focused on the movement over time of the swarm, or the aggregate price level.  That is where monetary policy holds its influence over prices.\n\nTo keep track of overall inflation there are two commonly used measures: the consumer price index, or CPI, and the personal consumption expenditure price index, or PCE price index. Both measures are expenditure-weighted averages of price changes for a notional basket of goods and services. They seldom mirror an individual consumer's personal experience.\n\nThe differences between the two measures are largely conceptual. For instance, the CPI measure is based on an average consumer's out-of-pocket expenditure while the PCE index is based on the total cost of the expenditure. So, while the total cost of pharmaceutical drugs is counted in the PCE index, only the consumer's insurance co-pay is counted in the CPI.\n\nAlso, the PCE price index updates the consumer basket continuously over time while the CPI is fixed every two years.  By this method, the PCE better reflects the tendency for substitution, such as buying more chicken if the price of beef goes up.\n\nIn my view, the compositional differences don't clearly favor one index versus the other. While the level of the inflation rate measured by the two indices differs at any point in time, over the short term both generally give the same signal about the pattern of inflation.\n\nTaken together, measures of both CPI and PCE inflation are important tools to help get a fix on the overall inflation picture, giving us a sense of whether the inflation is persistent or transitory along with other information needed to make informed policy decisions.\n\nAt times, large movements in some component prices may mask the underlying inflation trends in the CPI and PCE indexes. For this reason, measures of core inflation can be useful tools. Measures of core inflation typically remove volatile food and energy costs from the overall CPI or PCE number.\n\nInsights can be drawn from some alternative measurements of core inflation. For instance, the Cleveland Fed's median CPI and the Dallas Fed's trimmed mean PCE index calculate inflation after stripping out extreme price changes—both high and low. Other approaches to refine core measures of inflation involve using statistical techniques.\n\nBefore I go any further, I will say that I agree with those who say core inflation measures in isolation are an inadequate approach to determining the direction of overall price changes. Like you, I ultimately care about the trend rate of overall inflation, which I believe is ultimately the appropriate object of monetary policy.\n\nUpward movements of individual prices may take a variety of forms. For instance, smaller portions or downgraded quality for the same price, removal of service or warranty features accompanying a product, changes in packaging where the package has utility—all these represent individual item inflation. They are called quality changes. The agencies that compute the CPI and PCE indexes work to account for these quality changes.\n\nAttempts to measure the aggregate rate of price change—no matter how sophisticated—remain imperfect. As a result, when it comes to measuring inflation, judgment is needed to distinguish persistent price movements that underlie overall inflation from the relative price adjustments. Separating the inflation signal from noise involves much uncertainty—especially when making decisions in real time. Discerning accurately the underlying trend is difficult. It is essential for those of us who have responsibility for responding to these trends to use a wide variety of core measures and inflation projections to make the most informed judgment we can.\n\nToday's U.S. inflation\n With that, let me turn to the current inflation situation. No matter how you measure it, the aggregate inflation we are experiencing in the United States at the moment is uncomfortably high. Over the first half of this year, the CPI has risen at an annualized rate of nearly 5.5 percent. Over the same period, the PCE index has risen at an annualized rate of 4.5 percent. With the surge of energy prices in early summer, the annualized CPI for July was the highest in 17 years.\n\nAlso, considering the global context, I should add that consumer inflation measures in most parts of the world also have moved higher in recent months. Headline inflation rose to above 4 percent in major developed economies in July. In developing economies, inflation has been running at the highest rate since the start of the decade. On the positive side, inflation in China has declined in recent months to around 6 percent from a peak of 9 percent at the beginning of the year.\n\nMeasures of core inflation in the United States suggest that overall price pressures have been on the rise, perhaps because higher commodities costs have begun to affect prices paid by consumers and businesses across a broader range of other goods and services. In July, core CPI inflation on a year-over-year basis increased 2.5 percent—up from an average annual rate last year of 2.3 percent.\n\nHow did we get here? The mechanical answer, of course, is the outsized rise of particularly prominent prices in the consumption basket, notably food and energy. The rate of change in the food and beverages component of the CPI, which accounts for about 15 percent of the total market basket, rose at an annual rate of slightly more than 6.5 percent in the first half of this year.\n\nOver this time, the fuel and utilities piece of housing prices increased at an annual pace of nearly 21 percent and motor fuel by about 32 percent. In the CPI these two components account for more than 10 percent of total household expenditure.\n\nI expect the recent decline in oil prices will begin to reverse some of the pressures we have seen on overall inflation in the first half of the year. But the underlying global supply pressures remain tight, and demand pressures remain relatively high. As such, any relief will likely be only partial.\n\nFurthermore, some government estimates suggest little respite from food price hikes in the near term. At this point, it seems quite probable that PCE index inflation this calendar year will clock in at more than 3.5 percent and the CPI somewhere north of 4 percent—an improvement over the first half of the year, and trending in the right direction, but not numbers I would be comfortable with over the longer term.\n\nOutlook and risks\n Although recent measures of inflation are higher than I would like to see, I would say that recent price increases are more likely to be transitory than persistent. I expect that CPI inflation will peak near the July level of 5.6 percent. By comparison, in March 1980 the CPI peaked at 14.8 percent.\n\nLet me elaborate in the context of current Fed policy. On August 5 the FOMC voted to leave the fed funds rate at 2 percent and issued the following statement: \"Inflation has been high, spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities, and some indicators of inflation expectations have been elevated. The Committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year, but the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain.\"\n\nI concur with that view and believe current Fed policy is consistent with an easing in overall inflation given the dynamics of the economy. With weak growth and financial market strains, I believe the most likely outcome is that both headline and core inflation will diminish over the rest of 2008 and into next year as the temporary effects of energy and food price increases abate. Note that my outlook does not require that food and energy prices fall, but simply that their rates of increase moderate.\n\nSome of you may wonder why a central bank would allow higher energy prices to push up measured inflation even in the short run. Let me respond to that question by posing a counterfactual argument.\n\nSuppose that in the current environment of weakening economic growth the FOMC were to lean heavily against the recent run-up in energy prices. Because monetary policy necessarily works on prices in the aggregate—the swarm—tightening policy would lower the dollar value of all prices, including oil. Unless monetary policy can materially affect demand and supply fundamentals in global oil markets, energy would still be expensive relative to other goods and services. Also, energy would still be expensive relative to wages whose dollar values likely would decline because of policy actions that restricted growth in the entire economy.\n\nIt might be possible for restrictive monetary policy to slow the economy enough to reduce the demand for energy and soften prices overall as a consequence. I doubt, however, that many people would be happy with attempts to solve the problem of high oil prices through policies that would deliberately reduce the real incomes of American consumers and wage-earners.\n\nWhy expectations matter\n With my inflation outlook, I do not mean to dismiss the very real threats to Fed objectives. In today's geopolitical environment, for instance, there's always the potential of a severe energy price shock.\n\nAlso, my forecast could be wrong. If overall prices do not moderate in the near term as I expect, inflation expectations could become unmoored.\n\nIn the long run, the crux of the problem is not the elevated overall rate of inflation per se. It is the prospect that these elevated rates of inflation persist to such an extent that they become embedded in expectations and mainstreamed into the price and wage setting decisions of businesses, workers, and consumers.\n\nIn such an event, the decisions required to serve the FOMC's dual mandate of price stability and maximum sustainable growth would become very difficult indeed. We need not look back many years to recall the seriousness of unfettered inflation expectations. During the so-called Great Inflation between 1965 and 1984, the average CPI inflation rate for this extended period was 6.3 percent and PCE index averaged 5.6 percent.\n\nThis persistent run-up in prices was reversed only after the Fed raised the fed funds rate to extremely high levels. Victory was achieved at great cost to the real economy and only after inflation expectations were brought back under control. Such an episode need not recur—even with temporarily elevated prices—if the Fed acts as needed to keep inflation expectations anchored.\n\nThere are three commonly cited measures for inflation expectations: economic forecasts, such as the ones you will be hearing at this conference, surveys of households, and financial data such as the term structure of interest rates. One example of the latter is Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS.\n\nTaken as a whole, these measures suggest inflation expectations may have risen modestly—but not by a material degree. By that, I mean not sufficient for me to think Fed policies have been off target with respect to the central bank responsibility for price stability. But like measurements of inflation, measurements of inflation expectations also are far from perfect. For instance, surveys of household inflation expectations can be criticized as flawed stemming from the way questions are posed and the size and selection of the sample. Further, because financial market data reflect more than inflation expectations, these data are not always reliable indicators.\n\nSome fear inflation expectations are on the move in reaction to recent experience. As suggested a moment ago, I don't hold that view. But I feel that it's important to acknowledge that not enough is known about transitional periods from one state of expectations to another. Even though we're measuring expectations, there's an element of looking back to gauge their essence. I do not dismiss the view that we run the risk that by the time change in expectations is clear, it's too late. In my view, we need to know more about how and why inflation expectations shift.\n\nThat said, years of hard work by economists have gone into developing the measures of inflation expectations we currently track. And I have challenged our Atlanta Fed research staff to build on this progress.\n\nProtecting hard-won credibility\n To recap, I acknowledge that current prices—no matter how measured—have been elevated. Thankfully, commodity prices appear to have declined somewhat, though there is no certainty that they will continue to be better behaved. And, some pass through has unquestionably occurred.\n\nIn this context, with higher commodity costs causing painful increases in the cost of living, I believe we should not let the sting of individual bees divert our attention from the direction of the swarm. I believe the Fed's central concern is evidence of broad-based, persistent, and increasingly institutionalized upward price pressures.\n\nLike many forecasts, the Atlanta Fed's forecast shows the inflation trend moving gradually lower as general economic weakness eases some price pressures. My belief is that the Fed has undertaken tactically prudent actions to help move the economy through a difficult transition in line with the larger strategic goals of sustainable growth, low and stable inflation over the long term, and financial stability. Also, let me emphasize that I am mindful of today's elevated risks and am prepared at any point to change tactics to ensure inflation expectations do not become unanchored.\n\nFurther, I'm acutely aware that the current FOMC has inherited the inflation policy credibility that was hard won by our predecessors. One thing that has impressed me since taking my position last year is the seriousness with which my colleagues approach the duty to protect that legacy. I am confident that the Federal Reserve's institutional commitment to maintaining low and stable inflation will prevail.\n\nThank you. I would be happy to respond to your questions and comments.",

            "content": "Japan-America Society of Georgia\n  Atlanta, Ga. \n  June 4, 2008\n\nIt's an honor for me to  join you this evening as your speaker for the Japan-America Society of Georgia  annual dinner.\n\nI'm here tonight as both  the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and a former banker and private  citizen who is a longtime admirer of many things Japanese. Earlier in my career  I had substantial experience with Japanese companies and visited Japan  several times. My talk will represent both my perspective as a current Federal  Reserve official and musings and remembrances from earlier experience.\n\nRise of China and India\n  I'd like to begin my  remarks with a potentially controversial statement. Japan  has receded in the consciousness of the American business community, and public  attention in this country has turned away from the relationship between the United States and Japan. For the last few years, China has been  top of mind. Americans have grown increasingly aware of the rise of China as a manufacturing powerhouse and  destination for offshored American manufacturing jobs, as a consumer product  exporter to our market, and, recently, as an important financial and industrial  investor in U.S.  assets. I could add to that the growing profile of India as a services provider.\n\nBut I don't need to tell  this group that Japan still  matters to the United States  and especially to the economy of the Southeast region. And the Southeast is  important to Japan.  Let me flesh out the picture.\n\nJapan's importance to the U.S. Southeast\n  For the purposes of my  argument, I will define the Southeast as roughly the same geography as the  Sixth Federal Reserve District, which includes all of Georgia, Florida,  and Alabama and parts of Mississippi,  Louisiana, and Tennessee. We could add other states to my  definition of the Southeast, and that would only serve to strengthen the case.\n\nThis region is  economically diverse, with a composition of industries similar to the nation as  a whole. The population of the six states in this region is about 45 million,  and the region's economic output last year was about $1.8 trillion. If the  region were ranked as a nation, the Southeast's economy would rank eighth in  the world, below Italy and  above Canada.  By comparison, Japan,  the second-largest economy in the world, had a GDP in 2007 of $4.4 trillion.\n\nFor the past two decades,  the Southeast has grown more rapidly than the United States as a whole. There are  many reasons for this growth, but among them is the region's attractiveness to  businesses, including foreign investment. Japan  has been a very important source of investment throughout the United States  and especially in the Southeast.\n\nJapan is the second-largest investor in the United States (after the United Kingdom).  Japanese companies in 2005 employed about 614,000 people in the United States,  including more than 100,000 in the Southeast as defined by the Atlanta Fed's  Sixth District states. That number is up from about 90,000 in 1995, which  suggests Japan's  economic commitment to the Southeast is ongoing.\n\nWithin this region, Georgia plays  an important logistical role. This state offers excellent port and air  transport facilities along with other essential commercial infrastructure. Between  2002 and 2005, Japanese firms increased their investment in commercial property  in Georgia  from $779 million to $859 million. Based on available data, employment at  Japanese-affiliated companies in Georgia is about 25,000.\n\nThe Southeastern state  where Japanese firms own the most real estate is Florida, which is the most populous state in  our district and the state with the largest economic output. Japanese firms in  2005 owned $1.2 billion of commercial property in Florida. Also, about 19,000 Floridians are  employed by Japanese companies.\n\nElsewhere in the  Southeast—notably Alabama, Tennessee,  and Mississippi—Japanese  firms have led the development of highly efficient vehicle manufacturing and  assembly facilities. Between 1995 and 2005—the most recent year for which data  are available—Japanese firms in these three states increased hiring from about  38,000 to more than 54,000 jobs.\n\nVehicle assembly in this  region has grown at a time when employment in the industry nationally has  declined. But with weak economic and consumer spending growth in the United States  during the past year, auto plants have cut back vehicle production. The reduced  flow of auto imports from Japan  and elsewhere has been reflected in lower import traffic at major ports in this  region.\n\nOf course, investment and  trade go in both directions. Japan in 2007 accounted for 7 percent of all U.S. imports  and 6 percent of U.S exports. From the reverse perspective, about 23 percent of  Japan's exports went to the United States. Clearly,  this country continues to be an important market for Japan.\n\nGeorgia's goods exports to Japan in 2007 amounted  to $1.2 billion, including the shipment of transportation equipment, machinery,  and chemicals.\n\nWith any economy, the  financial sector is important. Japanese banks started building a presence in  the Southeast when I lived in Atlanta  back in the 1980s. By 1991, there were 11 Japanese banks with offices in  Georgia and Florida with assets totaling $3.9 billion. By 1999, most of the  Japanese banks had closed their Southeast offices. Today, I'm aware of only two  Japanese bank offices that operate in Georgia.\n\nWhy the retreat? Much of  this had to do with retrenchment in the Japanese banking industry as Japan dealt  domestically with a decade of recession and slow growth. Japanese banks in the  1980s became overextended by making loans to businesses whose collateral later  collapsed in value. Many borrowers struggled to make payments, and Japanese  lenders had to take enormous losses on bad loans. This financial instability  spilled over to the broader Japanese economy and led to an extended period of  slow growth. Between 1989 and 2001 the wealth of the private sector in Japan declined  by more than $10 trillion—two to three times the value of the economy's annual  economic output. This period—sometimes called \"the lost decade\"—was  characterized by very low interest rates calibrated to resist deflation and  stimulate economic growth.\n\nExpectations for a different experience\n  Some have argued that the  United States is today in a  similar position to that of Japan  in 1989 and will suffer a similar prolonged period of economic weakness. I  understand why this connection is being made as both episodes were preceded by  rapid appreciation in asset prices—often called bubbles—followed by rapid  depreciation, as we are experiencing today with house prices.\n\nI do not expect this  country to experience the same protracted economic weakness as Japan, in part because we can learn from Japan's  experience in order to avoid something similar. Taking lessons from the Japanese  experience, we here in the United    States must come to grips with broad  systemic inadequacies and make necessary changes. Affected financial companies  are already well into the process of loss recognition and recapitalization. In  the coming months and years we can expect substantial improvements in the area  of risk management and liquidity management even to the extent of fundamental  changes of their business models. Also, the debate on reform of the regulatory  framework has already begun. Years of economic performance are at stake, and  I'm confident we will muster the will to make the necessary changes.\n\nHistorical precedent  supports my view. In the late 1980s, the United States went through the  savings and loan crisis. Recognition of the scope of the problem took some  time, but ultimately U.S.  policymakers were able to respond aggressively with a comprehensive resolution  of the problems of impaired assets, insolvent institutions, and weak  management.\n\nThere is one similarity  between the situation in Japan  in the '90s and the reality today in the U.S. financial system that gives  pause. One explanation for the slow response in Japan was the relatively more  opaque nature of its banking system, reflecting the complex relationship  culture of Japanese business. Much has been written recently about the so-called  \"shadow banking system\" of hedge funds and complex securities in the United States  that also renders much of our financial system opaque. Improved transparency  must accompany other reforms as an early priority.\n\nCultural differences but mutual respect\n  Need I remind this group  that our two countries differ profoundly culturally? A book that has influenced  my thinking on our cultural differences is The  Seven Cultures of Capitalism by Charles Hampden-Turner and Alfons Trompenaars.  In surveys of businesspeople in a dozen or more countries asking them how they  would resolve value dilemmas, American and Japanese businesspeople were often  at opposite ends of the spectrum. Yet, during the last 60 years a symbiotic  partnership has developed and matured, yielding great benefits to both  countries. I would argue that the relationship between Japan and the United  States stands as perhaps the world's most prominent example of pragmatic  cooperation between peoples who, if not opposites culturally, are at least  very, very different.\n\nIt hasn't always been so,  but I believe the relationship works so well because of a high quotient of  mutual respect. Let me share some personal remembrances in that vein.\n\nFrom 1988 to 2001, I  worked closely with a number of Japanese bankers from then Fuji Bank, now  Mizuho. There was much I admired in my Japanese colleagues, and I learned a lot  from them that I've taken to heart.\n\nThere are two allied  notions in Japanese business culture—seijitsu (sincerity) and wa (harmony). In a  few words, sincerity is the proper discharge of one's duties and obligations no  matter what. It's about dedication to the interests of the company or team and  the subordination of one's personal interests to the interests of the  institution that employs you.\n\nWa,  as I said, means harmony. It is the ideal that informs the teamwork culture in Japanese  organizations. Two of my colleagues rose to become eventual presidents of Fuji  Bank, and a number rose to become managing directors—the senior most position  below president. I observed that the personality types that lead Japanese  organizations are quite different than those we often reward with high positions  in American business culture. Japanese leaders are skillful facilitators of  organizational harmony and teamwork.\n\nAt a higher, less  personal, level, I believe Japanese concepts have been internalized here in  American business culture and have served to make the United States  more competitive. Kaizen, continuous  improvement, is widely practiced as a requirement of competitive survival. Kanban, just-in-time supply, with the  commitment to absolute reliability it implies, is now an essential element of  the sophisticated supply chains of American and global manufacturers and  retailers.\n\nThere is irony in this  assertion that Japanese ideas have become Americanized because the intellectual  origins of kaizen and kanban techniques, and the encompassing  concept of total quality management, are widely attributed to two Americans: Edwards  Deming and Joseph Juran. Both were prophets ignored in their home countries, to  paraphrase the old saying, so they took their ideas of statistical quality  control in manufacturing processes to Japan after the Second World War. Their  message, in a nutshell, was \"do it right the first time.\" Six Sigma is a descendant  of Deming and Juran.\n\nI know from personal  experience that Japanese executives working here have learned from their  American colleagues. In my observation, my Japanese colleagues learned much  about risk taking, risk management, and risk-reward calculation. They learned  about rapid decision-making, competitive differentiation, and invention of  contrarian business models. Speaking of his experience in an aggressive, risk-taking  American financial company, one of my Japanese friends said, \"You are hunters,  and we are farmers.\"\n\nThere is one other  Japanese concept I admire because it demonstrates the Japanese sense of humor. It  is chindogu. I am a prospective  member of the International Chindogu Society. For the Americans here tonight, chindogu is the Japanese word for the  art of the \"unuseless\" invention. Unuseless  here means almost completely useless, but with just a hint of serious purpose. Examples  of chindogu inventions are eyelid  clips to stay awake in boring meetings. Or bedroom slippers encased in dust  mops to clean your floor while you shuffle around the house. I submitted the  idea of advertising bibs for cows grazing beside highways, but this idea has  actually been put into practice in Holland.  A rule of the International Chindogu Society is, if you invent something that  turns out to be so handy you actually use it, you have failed to make a chindogu. You should go to the patent  office.\n\nLoyalty and livelihood\n  I have a serious  thought—related to chindogu—as I  close. In an earlier speech some months ago, I argued that in this world of  global commerce, global brands, international trade and cross-border  investment, and complex international supply chains, our notion of product  loyalty should be updated. I argued that in many product categories, national  identity is increasingly unuseless. I argued that there is a difference between  national brand identity and the geographic origin of a product, and that, if at  all, we as consumers owe loyalty to the products of companies that provide a  livelihood to our people.\n\nForeign companies—including  many represented here tonight—employ more than 170,000 people in Georgia. Your  companies and your products are bedrock contributors to the national and southeastern  economy.\n\nThank you.",

            "content": "Jacksonville Regional Chamber of  Commerce\n  June 2, 2008\n\nThank you,  Lee [Thomas], for that introduction, and thank you, too, for your service as a  board member of the Atlanta Fed. Lee is in his second term as a board member  and brings wise counsel to the table each time we meet.\n\nI'm  grateful to Lee and everyone associated with the Jacksonville Regional Chamber  of Commerce. Your hospitality has been great. I appreciate the opportunity to  speak to the city's business leadership at a juncture in the country's economic  life that presents difficult trade-offs and serious challenges.\n\nThe last  few weeks have had the feel—for me personally and I think many in the business  and financial community—of coming up for air. Since the emergence and spread of  financial turmoil starting last August, our economy has been confronting one  challenge after another. These challenges include financial market illiquidity  and significant losses by banks and financial institutions, a deep decline in  housing sector activity and falling home prices, rapid onset of general  economic weakness, and inflation pressures resulting in part from rising energy  prices.\n\nAlthough  conditions have improved on some fronts, I don't feel we can yet \"breathe  easy.\" The path of the economy is still enveloped in considerable uncertainty,  and serious risks remain.\n\nIn my  remarks this afternoon, I will share my perspective on the current state of the  national economy, the outlook through the remainder of the year and into 2009,  and the risks to that outlook. I want to close by offering some comments on  longer-term concerns that may encroach on prospects for sustained financial  stability and general prosperity. I'll add at the outset that these views are  mine alone and don't necessarily reflect those of my colleagues on the Federal  Open Market Committee.\n\nGlobal context\n  The global context is important,  and I know you agree with this view here in Jacksonville given the port's role in import  and export trade.\n\nDuring the  first quarter, major U.S.  trading partners in Europe, emerging Asia, and Japan reported stronger than  anticipated gross domestic product (GDP) growth. The International Monetary  Fund (IMF) projects global GDP growth in 2008 to be 3.7 percent on an  annualized basis—a very solid number but about 1.25 percent lower than the  growth recorded last year. With this growth, many economies also have  experienced rising inflation, which is a concern for central banks around the  world.\n\nFor the next several minutes, I will present a  verbal storyboard of the economy's recent past, present, and near-term future. I would  argue that Jacksonville—with  its role in international trade and business services, particularly financial  transaction services—is highly invested in some of the key subplots of our  current economic narrative.\n\nOver the  last few months, the national economy has seen developing challenges on three  fronts: growth, inflation, and financial stability. In the last several weeks,  financial markets have become somewhat more stable.\n\nGrowth story\n  I would  characterize the current position of the overall economy as growing slowly, poised for gradual recovery, but carrying real risks that could  subvert the story. Since last fall, we've suffered a pronounced economic  slowdown, with positive but low growth numbers. The early estimate of first  quarter growth of 0.6 percent was revised upward last week to 0.9 percent. This  performance followed growth of 0.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2007.\n\nConsumer  activity accounts for about two-thirds of the economy's output. In the first  quarter, year-over-year growth of consumer spending slowed to just 1  percent—the slowest pace since 2001. And consumer sentiment, as measured by the  University of Michigan's index, has reached the lowest  level since 1980.\n\nProspects  of a weak economy caused business investment to slow over the last two  quarters. Businesses seemed to have become more cautious in capital outlays,  with discretionary investment often postponed. Total nonresidential fixed  investment, which includes spending on equipment and software as well as on  nonresidential structures, was flat in the first quarter.\n\nIndustrial  production growth has deteriorated in recent months. For instance, production  of automotive products declined more than 14 percent in April from a year  earlier. Parenthetically, I understand that soft U.S.  demand for autos has dampened import traffic at the Jacksonville port. Completing the picture,  exports have provided some counterweight to negative trends in our  manufacturing economy. In the first quarter of the year, exports of goods  increased by an estimated 2.8 percent.\n\nThe service  sector—which is, as I said earlier, very important to Jacksonville's economy—has also not evaded  the current economic slowdown, especially in segments directly connected to  real estate. Recent readings of the health of this sector are mixed. Looking at  the sector through the prism of employment, there has been job growth in health  care, education, and tourism. In contrast, we've seen job losses in financial  services and wholesale and retail trade.\n\nEmployment  trends are a crucial indicator of overall economic health. The storyline for  employment up to this point has been weakness  but not a collapse. Nonfarm payroll employment declined for the fourth  consecutive month in April, and the unemployment rate stands at 5 percent compared  with 4.4 percent early in 2007. However, the most recent employment report was  not as bad as expected with a modest loss of 20,000 jobs. Also, initial claims  for unemployment insurance have not moved higher in recent weeks. We'll get  another update on the jobs situation later this week.\n\nDrags on the economy\n  We're experiencing some powerful drags on economic growth.  Among them is the weak housing sector. Prices for existing homes nationwide in  the first quarter declined more than 14 percent from just a year earlier,  according to the Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller index. Realtor data show  the median price for existing homes sold in Jacksonville declined 6.7 percent during the  first quarter of 2008 compared with a year earlier. Nationally, inventories of  new and existing homes for sale remain high at more than 10 months' supply at  the current pace of sales. As a comparison, the average for the past decade was  around four months' supply.\n\nIn Jacksonville and the rest  of the nation, new home construction has declined to low levels—a necessary  adjustment to reduce inventories. Nationally, new home sales were down 42  percent in April relative to a year earlier, but the sales rate actually ticked  up by 3.3 percent during the month. In addition, existing home sales have been  relatively stable in recent months. Our careful assessment of the incoming data  on housing suggests a storyline of a  slowing pace of continuing decline.\n\nA second  factor weighing down growth has been energy costs. Crude oil prices have increased  more than 30 percent since January 1 to the present range of $125–$130 per  barrel. With higher transportation and other energy costs, consumers have less  money to allocate for other types of spending.\n\nAnother  drag on growth has been tighter credit standards. In the Federal Reserve's most  recent Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, most domestic banks reported they  had tightened standards on residential mortgages and some other classes of  consumer loans. Also, a majority of lenders said they had tightened standards  on commercial and industrial loans to large and middle market firms.\n\nBank credit  is part of the larger story of the financial markets. Here the storyline is more settled but still fragile. From the  exceedingly difficult conditions of mid-March (the time of the Bear Stearns  action), credit markets have stabilized somewhat, liquidity has improved, and  credit spreads have come down. For example, the AAA corporate bond spread over  10-year Treasuries stood last week at 165 basis points, down from more than 200  in March.\n\nInflation situation\n  Let me  round out my storyboard of the current economy with a discussion of inflation.  The inflation storyline so far has been uncomfortable  levels with hints of rising expectations. We gauge inflation conditions in  the economy in a number of ways. There are two principal consumer price  indices—the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Personal Consumption Expenditure  (PCE) price index. Both indices reflect price movements in hundreds of goods  and services and are computed monthly at the so-called \"headline\" level (with  everything included) and as a \"core\" measure, which excludes energy and food.\n\nCore  measures are considered useful in reducing monthly noise in the data to get a  sense of the longer-term inflation trend. Some economics shops—including the  Cleveland and Dallas Federal Reserve Banks—trim off the outlier components of  the basket of goods and services each month to get another assessment of the  fundamental picture.\n\nThe  headline CPI and PCE inflation measures have behaved similarly in recent months  and have been quite volatile, reflecting the sharp swings in food and energy  prices. The headline CPI was up 3.9 percent over last year in April—down a bit  from March's reading but still elevated relative to the benign inflation  experience of much of the last decade.\n\nCore CPI  inflation, which excludes food and energy costs, has hovered at above 2 percent  for the last few months and has displayed no clear trend. However, the most  recent Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland  trimmed mean CPI index came in at 2.8 percent in April and appears to have  drifted higher in recent months. If we take a longer-term view, the inflation  picture also is disconcerting. The three-year average headline CPI inflation is  at the highest level since the early 1990s.\n\nWith  inflation elevated, I'm attentively monitoring measures of inflation  expectations. Measures of consumer attitudes show that year-ahead inflation  expectations have moved higher. However, survey questions about the longer term  revealed more moderate attitudes, suggesting that inflation expectations have  not indisputably ratcheted up. An explanation of the short-term upward movement  is that rising inflation expectations are commonly associated with rising  energy prices.\n\nSo, to  summarize the storyline for the current state of the U.S. economy, we have a slow-growth  economy poised for gradual recovery, weak but not collapsing labor markets, a  slowing pace of decline of housing, more settled but still fragile financial markets,  and uncomfortable levels of inflation with hints of rising inflation  expectations.\n\nThe outlook\n  Let me now  turn to the outlook. My storyline looking ahead is not so severe a slowdown, but not so quick a recovery. As already  mentioned, the first quarter of 2008 delivered GDP growth of just under 1  percent. I believe the second quarter may be somewhat better than some earlier  dire forecasts. The federal government's economic stimulus should provide some  boost to household spending in the second and third quarters. On balance, I'm  expecting a weak first half followed by some improvement in the second half as  the drags on growth I mentioned earlier gradually diminish.\n\nMy base  case for inflation assumes a fall-off from the current elevated level of inflation  supported by some moderation of energy and food price increases. I also expect  soft economic growth to constrain the ability of businesses to pass through  energy and other costs and raise prices in the coming months.\n\nOil prices  so far this year have risen more than I anticipated as energy supply has lagged  behind demand growth. My outlook assumes that energy costs do not continue to  climb much further, which is an uncertain proposition. Also, I'm assuming that  financial market conditions continue to stabilize and that housing sector  conditions do not deteriorate dramatically.\n\nWe remain  in a period of considerable uncertainty. There are very real risks to this  outlook. I will cite three.\n\nThe first  is renewed financial instability. As I said, markets remain fragile. A new  spell of instability could follow, for instance, from the seizing up of a  systemically important credit market.\n\nThe second  risk is an oil price shock in the face of growing global demand. Recent  indications are that the high price of gasoline and other energy products is  blunting demand in the United    States. But demand continues to rise in  emerging economies, most notably China.\n\nThe third  is a persistent and even steeper decline of house prices. Some analysts have  pointed to the risk of an adverse feedback loop—a self-reinforcing spiral. In  this line of thinking, buyers would hold off home purchases in hopes of lower  prices, banks would refuse to finance purchases on the basis of questionable  and falling appraisals, and prices would continue to be marked down in hopes of  attracting buyers.\n\nLong-term challenges\n  Beyond the immediate challenges  of economic growth, inflation, and financial stability, I'd like to draw  attention to certain persistent structural imbalances that present serious  risks to our nation's long-term and continuing economic well-being. In coming  years these imbalances, if not addressed, will loom like geologic faults  threatening severe economic and financial disruption and potentially requiring  wrenching adjustments. Surely a lesson of the last several months is that  excesses and imbalances can trigger surprising, destructive dynamics with  elements of contagion and fear.\n\nWe face  current and future imbalances in the form of structural trade deficits, foreign  petroleum dependency, and fiscal deficits. The trade deficit is rooted in the  feeble savings practices of our population along with stubborn dependence on  imported oil. The growth of entitlement obligations beginning in the next  decade constitutes a fiscal challenge of unprecedented magnitude. These  concerns deserve high rank on the country's economic agenda.\n\nI'm hoping  breathing will come more easily as the year plays out, as we enter 2009 and as  immediate challenges subside. But recent experience tells me we won't be fully  at ease until a sustainable trade, energy, and fiscal balance has been  achieved.\n\nThank you.",

            "content": "I won't discuss these questions in  detail, but let me make a few observations. In the narrow sense, the decoupling  debate has been about whether slower spending in the United States will lead to slower GDP growth in countries dependent on U.S. import demand. This concern is then broadened to a global slowdown or  recession.\n\nMy view is the following: Global  economic integration has progressed in recent years to the point that a  slowdown in the United    States will unquestionably be felt, but not  as severely as imagined by some. Domestic growth momentum in many emerging  economies will attenuate the influence of U.S. weakness. And the accumulation  of foreign currency reserves by these countries—the result of trade  surpluses—provides an accessible resource to stimulate their own domestic  growth to offset weaker exports, should that weakness materialize.\n\nCapital flows and  currency reserves\n  That brings me to the second issue I  want to discuss, which concerns capital flows and foreign currency reserves  accumulation. In the textbook version, capital—both physical and financial—is  supposed to flow from mature economies where returns are low to developing  countries where the fruit hangs low and risk-adjusted returns are high.\n\nIn the last few years, many emerging  economies—in spite of very robust growth rates—have been accumulating foreign  currency surpluses derived mostly from export earnings and inbound investment. China's  official foreign currency reserves approach $1.7 trillion. India's reserves are about $313  billion. Estimated reserves for Brazil  are $196 billion and for Russia,  $534 billion.\n\nThese surpluses must be invested, and  since the reserves are in dollars and other hard currencies, they are mostly  invested in U.S.  and European financial assets.\n\nIs this a case of the poor financing  the rich? How can this happen? At a high level, we can say that the earning  (and investment attraction) power of emerging economies exceeds their absorption  capacity in terms of both investment and consumption. In other words, they're  on a roll and can't spend it all. There  are many causes of this phenomenon. I'll highlight four:\n\nIn my view, we can expect these \"upstream\"  capital flows to continue for some time.\n\nSovereign wealth funds\n  The flow of capital from emerging to  developed economies is becoming institutionalized and encouraging the emergence  of sovereign wealth funds. China,  Russia, Abu Dhabi, Saudi Arabia,  and several other non-OECD countries have established government-controlled asset  management firms to professionally manage their \"excess\" reserves. All of these  countries appear to be planning for surpluses well into the future.\n\nThese sovereign wealth funds are in  the process of diversifying some portion of their total holdings in pursuit of  better returns. Diversification has occurred both within a currency—the  dollar—and across currencies and geographic exposures. Diversification within  the dollar, for instance, may involve purchase of nongovernment, higher-risk  bonds and corporate equity securities as well as direct significant minority  equity investments in banks and corporations. In addition, these funds will  likely invest as limited partners in private equity and hedge funds managed by  professional money managers here in the United States.\n\nThese pools of capital have become a  major force in the world. Some sovereign wealth funds have played prominent  roles in the recapitalization of U.S. and European banks that  incurred losses in the recent financial turmoil.\n\nA movement has developed to require sovereign  wealth funds to adopt a code of conduct. I believe this development is healthy,  if only to improve transparency and to dampen alarmist sentiment in the West.\n\nThere has been a fair amount of handwringing  recently about sovereign wealth funds accumulating U.S. assets. I believe our posture  has to be realistic—one country's trade deficit (ours, in this case) is another  country's investment surplus.\n\nThe increasing flow of cross-border  investments helps to make the global economy even more integrated and gives  emerging economies a shared stake in the success of the U.S. economy.\n\nGood news for the world\n  And that brings me to my final point:  The growth and rising prosperity of the emerging economies and their financial  coupling with advanced economies—especially the United States—is good news for the  world. Financial integration with successful emerging economies should  ultimately make our own economic path less precarious. This process is ongoing.  Beyond recent and immediate cyclical patterns of the U.S. economy, policymakers must  address persistent imbalances in trade accounts and energy dependence. Add to  these projected fiscal deficits related to baby boomer entitlements. Confronting  these imbalances will be a key policy challenge going forward.\n\nI applaud you for your global  perspective, for caring about the fate of emerging economies, and for seeking  opportunity there. I wish you the best with your conference, and I would be  glad to take a few of your questions.",

            "content": "The Rotary Club of Chattanooga\n  Chattanooga, Tenn. \n  March 27, 2008\n\nI'm delighted to be in Chattanooga today as your  speaker. As you know, things have been quite busy lately at the Federal  Reserve. There's a lot I could talk about this afternoon, but I'd like to focus  on what I believe is top of mind for the members of your distinguished group.\n\nDuring my  remarks, I'd like to talk about the economy, recent Fed actions, and the  economic outlook. I'll close with a few thoughts on guiding fundamentals for  policy in these challenging economic times. My views are mine alone and not necessarily  those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nIn the past few weeks, many have  asked if the economy is in recession. We don't yet have enough evidence to  answer according to the technical definition by the National Bureau of Economic  Research, which is charged with making that determination by looking at a host  of economic indicators. Also, we have not yet recorded two straight quarters  (or even one) of real contraction (negative gross domestic product growth),  which is the popular definition of recession. In fact, the most recent quarter  remained positive.\n\nThat said, it's clear the economy is  in a slowdown that resembles past periods that were the leading edge of a  recession. Economic growth has been slowing since the third quarter of last  year coming off solid growth rates in the second and third quarters of 2007. Following  a sluggish fourth quarter, I expect that GDP for the first quarter of this year  will show little, if any, growth.\n\nAlso,  personal income growth has been flat, and there has been significant softening  of employment, manufacturing activity, and sales at the retail and wholesale  levels. Indeed, some areas such as employment actually have been contracting. Job  growth in recent months was negative, and the unemployment rate has moved up to  4.8 percent, compared with 4.5 percent last summer.\n\nIt's possible—given certain strengths  such as strong business balance sheets and export growth—that the economy will  not pass the threshold into a technical recession. In considering the current  economic situation, I believe that an important policy objective at this  juncture is to ensure that this slowdown is short and shallow.\n\nA critical factor—possibly the  critical factor—in the determination of the length and depth of the current  slowdown is the performance of the housing sector.\n\nNationally, house prices declined by  10.7 percent from January 2008 compared with a year earlier, according to the  most recent S&P Case-Schiller home composite price index evaluating 20  major metropolitan areas. Of course, local results may differ. Chattanooga area home  prices, for instance, last year were still rising—but at a slower rate. On average across the country, though, home  prices have declined, in some markets substantially.\n\nThe number of housing starts and new  home sales has fallen and are at less than half their respective peaks. Unfortunately,  cutbacks in construction have made only a small dent in builders' elevated  supply of unsold new homes—now at around 10 months' supply at the current pace  of sales and up from the average for the past decade of around four months.\n\nHousing weakness has weighed on  growth in other sectors. For instance, the retail segment of the commercial  real estate sector has weakened, according to anecdotal information. As we  know, retail development tends to follow rooftops.\n\nAlso, problems with subprime  mortgages have led to tighter credit conditions that have restricted mortgage  financing, placing further downward pressure on housing activity.\n\nWith regard to financial conditions  more broadly, markets have not yet stabilized. Although financial instability  originated in the residential mortgage-backed securities market, it has spread  to affect a variety of credit markets via market linkages or institutional  interdependencies. The experience has been traumatic, at times generating  primal emotions. Market volatility has been driven by fear, distrust, and  flight to safety. I emphasize this point  because financial system stability is a central focus of Fed policy at the  moment.\n\nAt the same time, inflation has  become a more prominent concern. Price pressures have been most obvious in  energy and commodities, including commodities in the food chain. High and  rising inflation—if allowed to persist—can distort household and business  behavior.\n\nBoth headline and core inflation  measures have been elevated in recent months and above a level I would consider  in the long run to be consistent with an objective of price stability.\n\nEven when inflation abates, shifts in  relative prices of goods such as increases in energy costs—if sustained—can  cause painful dislocations that force households to adjust living patterns and  companies to change their practices and even business models.\n\nFed actions\n  Today, the U.S. economy faces challenges on  three fronts: one, weakening growth; two, unstable financial markets; and  three, elevated inflation and heightened uncertainty about the inflation  outlook.\n\nTo address these issues, the Fed has  two basic sets of tools. At the macroeconomic level there is traditional  monetary policy, and at the level of specific financial markets there are  various liquidity measures.\n\nChanging the federal funds rate  target, which is the main monetary policy tool, supports macroeconomic  goals—sustainable economic growth and stable prices. This tool changes the  overnight interbank price for money.\n\nIn recent months the Fed has  repeatedly lowered the fed funds rate, which was 5.25 percent last September. At  our most recent meeting March 18, the Fed cut the federal funds rate target by  75 basis points to 2.25 percent. This action was taken in response to the  weakening outlook caused by tightening credit conditions and the deepening of  the housing contraction.\n\nChanges in the federal funds rate can  influence but not dictate other interest rates in credit markets. There is not  a one-to-one correspondence between changes in the fed funds rate and longer-term  interest rates for borrower classes critical to the economy. For instance,  while the fed funds rate has declined 300 basis points in the past seven  months, the rate for conventional 30-year mortgages has declined about 65 basis  points, and the yield on AAA corporate bonds has declined only 41 basis points.\n\nIn addition, the ability of  reductions in the federal funds rate to address liquidity strains in credit  markets has proven to be limited.\n\nA continuation of these liquidity  strains presents a serious potential risk to the financial system. As a result,  the Fed in recent months has undertaken additional steps to directly improve  liquidity conditions in key credit markets.\n\nFederal funds rate changes determine  the size of the Fed's balance sheet—the foundation of the money supply. The  Fed's liquidity tools work primarily by changing the composition of the asset  side of the Fed's balance sheet. For example, by temporarily exchanging some  currently illiquid assets for other more liquid assets, the central bank can  mitigate some of the pressures that have prevented credit markets from  functioning smoothly.\n\nA listing of recent liquidity actions  can sound like an alphabet soup—the TAF, or Term Auction Facility, announced  December 12; the TSLF, or Term Securities Lending Facility, announced on March  11; and most recently, the PDCF, or Primary Dealer Credit Facility, announced  March 16 to allow certain nonbank financial institutions to borrow from the  Fed.\n\nEach of these measures are simply  extensions of the traditional tools of the Fed—the discount window and open  market operations. Collectively, the four major liquidity-oriented programs had  the following elements—a lengthening of term of lending, broader types of  collateral, a wider set of counterparties, and a lower premium for the primary  credit rate, which is the rate at which the Fed lends directly to banks through  the discount window.\n\nThese Fed liquidity actions can be  likened to a surgeon's instruments—designed to get at precisely the problem at  hand—and no more.\n\nAlso, the Fed's liquidity actions can  be viewed as a complement to monetary policy, a point that was made in the FOMC's  statement following its March 18 meeting: \"Today's policy action, combined with  those taken earlier, including measures to foster market liquidity, should help  to promote moderate growth over time and to mitigate the risks to economic activity.\"\n\nA week ago Sunday, the acquisition of  Bear Stearns by JPMorgan Chase was announced. Earlier this week, the deal was  changed from the original $2 per share to $10 per share, and certain specifics  were adjusted. To facilitate this transaction, the New York Fed—through a  limited liability company formed for this purpose—will take control of a  portfolio of assets valued at $30 billion as of March 14. JPMorgan Chase will  bear the first $1 billion of any realized losses in this portfolio, and any  gains will accrue to the New York Fed. The arrangement was undertaken with the  support of the U.S. Treasury.\n\nThis action was taken to bolster  market liquidity and promote orderly functioning of short-term funding and  credit risk markets.\n\nAs I said earlier, financial  stability must be a central concern at this time. The Fed has taken strong  measures to avoid potential damage to the broad economy.\n\nOutlook\n  Looking ahead, my forecast has been  affected both by an economic slowdown that has been sharper than I had expected  and the recurring spells of financial market turmoil. A few months ago our  forecast at the Atlanta Fed saw growth slow in the first half of 2008, then  pick up in the second half of the year. But it now appears to me that the  contraction in housing and the dampening effects of financial turmoil on  household and business spending could persist through the remainder of this  year. The recovery in growth I had expected in the second half of this year may  be delayed.\n\nThe tax rebates should provide some stimulus  in the second and early third quarters of this year. But given the uncertain  atmosphere I expect will continue to prevail in May and June, I do not expect  full flow through of the rebates into personal consumption expenditures.\n\nI expect it will take much of the  rest of the year for house prices to bottom out and financial markets to  restore the necessary preconditions of stability—that is, confidence in asset  values and confidence in transaction counterparties.\n\nLooking ahead further to 2009, my outlook  becomes more optimistic. It will take longer than I earlier expected to return  to solid growth, but by the fourth quarter of 2008 the conditions should be in  place to support a return to healthy growth next year.\n\nWith regard to the inflation outlook,  I've learned not to be dismissive of inflation risks in this era of surging  global demand for commodities. But my expectations are in accord with the FOMC  statement of March 18 that inflation should moderate in coming quarters. This  moderation reflects a projected leveling out of energy and other commodity  price increases and the impact of generally weaker demand conditions in the  economy. In any event, it will be necessary to continue to monitor inflation  developments carefully.\n\nGuiding fundamentals\n  As I said earlier, the U.S. economy  faces challenges on three fronts: growth, inflation, and financial stability. I'd  like to close by grounding my remarks in what I believe are some guiding  fundamentals appropriate for this challenging period.\n\nIntegral to the Fed's dual mandate of  maximum sustainable economic growth and stable prices is the goal of financial  stability. Orderly markets and the flow of credit to businesses and households  are necessary for the sustained prosperity of all sectors of the economy—not  just Wall Street. My view of recent Fed interventions is that they are an  attempt to help preserve or restore normal market functioning.\n\nI am aware there are risks inherent  in these actions. The line that separates restoring market function from merely  redistributing losses and gains is not a bright one. This is the reason that  policymakers only rarely and reluctantly intervene in markets.\n\nAlso, the distinction between  liquidity problems and insolvency is not a trivial one when monetary  authorities respond to troubles of market players. The critical evaluation is  the systemic risk posed by the failure of an institution.\n\nSome believe the Fed has overreacted.  Others have said the central bank has been slow to respond to building  problems. And still others have warned that the Fed has crossed lines that  define appropriate function.\n\nBut from where I stand, Fed actions  were taken with a prudent acknowledgement of the unintended consequences that may  accompany almost all policy interventions. The actions taken by the Federal  Reserve over the past several months were taken in perilous and fast-moving  circumstances. Given the likelihood of continued financial and economic  uncertainty, the public authorities charged with achieving and maintaining  financial stability must preserve the capacity to act decisively in the best  interest of the economy as a whole. I believe the Fed has done that. Thank you.",

            "highlights": "Remarks by Dennis P. Lockhart, President and Chief Executive Officer, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta; The Atlanta Commerce Club, Panel Discussion Titled \"The Subprime Crisis: Is It Contagious?\" February 29, 2008.",
            "content": "The Atlanta Commerce Club\n  Panel Discussion Titled \"The  Subprime Crisis: Is It Contagious?\"\n  February 29, 2008\n\nThank you for inviting me to join  this panel discussion on the subprime crisis and the contagion concern.\n\nOne of the responsibilities of the  Federal Reserve is the promotion and preservation of financial stability. The  possibility of contagion, or the spreading of volatility and illiquidity from  one market to another, is one threat to financial stability. With this background,  I would like to offer brief comments on three questions related to the past,  present, and future of the subprime/financial markets story.\n\nThe first question is: How did  problems in the relatively small asset class of subprime mortgage–backed  securities morph into a much broader financial (system) stability problem? Second,  as of today, what is the broad state of risk to financial stability and more  broadly the overall economy? Third, what will it take to return to stable  conditions in the affected financial markets?\n\nFirst question—how did  it happen? \n  Let me begin by trying to place the subprime  market in quantitative context. Although problems with the subprime market have  caused widespread concern, the actual size of the subprime mortgage-backed  securities market is relatively small. Based on our estimates, the size of the  subprime market is more than $1 trillion, which was around 3 percent of the  approximately $30 trillion of domestic nonfinancial debt last summer.\n\nSince that time, this relatively  small asset class has been the biggest factor—but by no means the only  factor—contributing to unstable conditions in a broad array of credit (or debt)  markets. There have been two phenomena at work, in my view. First, some  markets—for example, the asset-backed commercial paper market—are closely  linked to subprime. Other markets have been affected indirectly through a more  general repricing of risk.\n\nTo understand how subprime mortgages  could have triggered such major changes in financial markets, let's recall the  credit environment of a few years ago. Credit losses had been unusually low in  many U.S.  markets for an extended period of time. With the strength and relative  stability of the U.S.  macroeconomy and the strong performance of housing in many geographic markets,  lenders projected low losses even on the riskiest of loans.\n\nThe decline in credit quality first  became apparent in the subprime market. In many cases aggressive mortgage originators  were writing loans to borrowers with weak credit history, little or no equity  invested in the house, and little or no verification of the borrower's ability  to repay. Under the assumption of ever-increasing housing prices, mortgages  written on these low standards were valued as though they were low risk. Once housing  prices stopped rising and began declining in some markets, the potential for  increases in subprime default rates and the increased riskiness of the  mortgages became obvious to financial markets.\n\nSubprime losses began to contaminate  structured instruments in which they were held such as collateralized debt  obligations, or CDOs, that were assets of structured investment vehicles, or  SIVs. What followed was a dramatic decline in liquidity in many markets.\n\nIn response to this generalized  illiquidity, particularly in the interbank market, the Fed in coordination with  other central banks in December implemented a term auction facility.\n\nI would argue that root causes of  problems in the subprime market brought into question some fundamental  practices, incentives, and even institutions of other markets. By fundamentals,  I mean the integrity of origination (that is, the quality of assets that went  into securitization pools), the structure of the securities into which loans  and individual securities were packaged, and the value of these securities as  collateral for margin financing.\n\nAlso, rating agencies had greatly  underestimated the risk of many mortgage-backed securities. This led to a loss  in confidence in the ratings assigned to other complex financing structures  with further reductions in liquidity and increases in the volatility of prices  across a variety of debt markets.\n\nThrough this spread of suspicion,  subprime losses exposed related problems elsewhere, such as the syndication  market for leveraged loans. Some leveraged lending underwriting was in its own  way very aggressive in the period before the markets turned rocky starting last  summer.\n\nFinally, the subprime crisis generated a  thicket of doubts concerning counterparties. Uncertainty about valuations of  securitized debt fed uncertainty regarding the exposure of large banks and  other market participants, which led to concerns about executing trades with  these counterparties.\n\nSecond question—what is  today's risk to financial stability?\n  I would characterize the current  state of affected financial markets (those most affected by the subprime  problem) as evolving positively but still fragile—in other words, unusually  vulnerable to shocks. Affected markets are working through problems of counterparty  mistrust, lower or no trading volume, reduced new origination, and plummeting  market prices that may be well below eventual economic value. For instance,  investors have been reluctant to roll over asset-backed commercial paper  because of the linkages to subprime mortgage–backed securities purchased by  structured investment vehicles, or SIVs. The asset-backed commercial paper  (ABCP) market has shrunk over $400 billion since August of last year, and major  investors have exited, possibly permanently.\n\nThe markets for municipal bonds in  general and especially the markets for auction-rate municipal bonds are under  stress because of their historic reliance on monoline credit insurers to  strengthen the credit of municipalities by adding their credit enhancement. The  monoline insurers are exposed to CDOs with subprime positions.\n\nAdditionally, the decline in the  value of housing is starting to create concern about other consumer loan and  mortgage markets including the markets for credit cards, auto loans, student  loans, and prime mortgages.\n\nIn this context, financial  institutions, in the United    States and abroad, recently have booked some  large write-offs. Several have negotiated investments of new capital. But,  there's still widespread uncertainty about what might follow.\n\nThird question—what  will it take to restore stability?\n  Looking ahead, I believe resolution  of the current financial market problems requires some stabilization of U.S. housing  markets. At this time, it's difficult to determine when that stability will  materialize.\n\nA key  prerequisite to financial stability is clarity of loan and security performance.  In the latter half of 2007 and early weeks of 2008, writedowns of exposures to  subprime securities, CDOs, and other instruments have reflected projections of  future performance of underlying loans. As securities season with the passage  of time, and as the reality of actual defaults and foreclosures is clarified,  valuations should have a firmer basis.\n\nSecuritization of fundamentally sound  loans has continued in recent months, but it's unlikely there will be a  resurgence of new issue and secondary markets for riskier asset classes such as  subprime mortgages. With regard to other debt markets, the new issue and  secondary markets will stabilize as soundly originated new product works  through the pipeline. In time, I believe investors will regain confidence in  both product and counterparties, and buying will resume for a broader range of  asset classes.\n\nAlso, generally favorable economic  conditions should help improve financial market stability. In recent quarters,  economic growth has slowed considerably. The Federal Open Market Committee  (FOMC) lowered the federal funds rate from 5.25 percent last September to the  current level of 3 percent. This reduction should encourage stronger economic  growth in the second half of 2008.\n\nIn closing, let me provide a succinct  answer to this panel's central question, and that is, \"Is the subprime crisis  contagious?\" In short, the answer is yes.\n\nThe subprime mortgage crisis has not  been isolated but is part of a highly integrated, complex, and dynamic global  financial system. Subprime market problems have not been limited to what is, as  I said, a relatively small market because they raised questions about the  fundamental institutional, incentive, and practices framework of several modern  markets.\n\nThank you for your attention.",

            "content": "Let me elaborate on some of these  factors. In my view, we should not rewrite the rules of the game after the  fact. The efforts of private-sector players with the encouragement of the U.S.  Treasury Department under the banner of the Hope Now initiative promote a  voluntary framework for mitigating subprime mortgage foreclosures. I support  this approach. It is far better for the parties in financial arrangements to  work through the process of apportioning losses by mutual consent or through  traditional adjudication channels.\n\nIn my view, we should not—in pursuit  of market order—impose excessive regulatory constraints that undermine the  innovation and competitiveness that are, in the long run, the foundation of  thriving financial markets and institutions.\n\nFinally, in my view, we should not  become identified with \"investment protectionism.\"  Trade protectionism is widely understood and  debated. Investment protectionism refers to differentiated treatment of capital  providers based on national identity and citizenship as well as denial of  certain investment opportunities to nonresidents or noncitizens. There are some  legitimate national security concerns in certain industries, such as defense,  but such concerns can be easily exaggerated.\n\nMuch has been written and said  recently on the latest concern—sovereign wealth funds.  Sovereign wealth funds are special purpose  investment vehicles sponsored and overseen by governments to allocate some of their  foreign currency reserves (dollar surpluses) to a diversified portfolio of  securities and direct investments. I have had some direct experience with  sovereign wealth funds in the Middle East. I  share the views expressed by a number of commentators—sober and sensible, in my  view—who argue that we should not misconstrue the intent of these investors and  exaggerate their threat to our national welfare and security. I think it is far-fetched  that investments would be made for nefarious political purposes and that investment  funds would—or could—somehow impose noncommercial decisions on investee companies.  In my experience and observation, these funds are serious, responsible,  commercially minded, and professional stewards of their countries' wealth. I  think concerns about sovereign wealth funds can be overwrought. To the extent  that trade and capital-account imbalances are the source of potential  instability, the answer is to address the fundamental causes.\n\nThe opposite fear is abandonment by  foreign investors of the dollar and the United States as an investment  destination. We need not, in my opinion, fear a precipitous, wholesale withdrawal  of foreign-owned capital. The most extreme versions of this scenario are simply  not possible. Though some diversification of global capital will proceed from  the natural reapportionment of economic power as economies and capital markets  develop, the United States  and its currency remain at the center of the world's trade and investment system.   So long as we follow sensible policies,  the cost to the global economy of materially altering these arrangements would  be far too high.\n\nTo close, let me summarize the thesis  presented here and add a few thoughts. The United States has experienced  periodic episodes of financial system stress followed by curative adjustment  and reform.  We are in such a period now.  Large and persistent global financial imbalances are contributing factors. The  accumulation of large dollar balances owned by foreign parties must be recycled  into investments. Large volumes, resulting from concentrated dollar holdings  abroad, encourage financial innovation but also excesses. There are excesses  because popular investment products and strategies are pushed beyond prudent  limits under the pressure of competition and linear assumptions.\n\nIf global imbalances are unlikely to  disappear for some time, and we must live with them, then market practitioners  and financial authorities must improve their ability to monitor global  investment flows and recognize incipient problems.\n\nAs I said earlier, there is a fair  dose of conjecture in these ideas. They deserve further exploration and  research. My colleagues and I at the Atlanta Fed intend to do this.\n\nThank you very much.",

            "content": "As a practitioner in the credit industry for the better part  of 30 years, I will offer some tentative, but I believe informed, views on  these questions. With regard to the role of banks in credit markets, there has  been much discussion in recent years of the shrinking market share of banks and  the emergence of a \"shadow banking system.\" I'm referring, of course, to the universe of  off-balance-sheet special purpose vehicles, nonbank loan origination and  lending companies, commercial paper-financed conduits, hedge funds, and other  entities.\n\nI think the recent turmoil has shown that, in fact, banks retained  a central role in the originate-to-distribute credit intermediation model. Banks  may not have held the complete range of securities from risk bearing tranches  to triple A, but they did—as it turns out—hold substantial super senior  exposure, and they did create many of  the conduits that directly owned the securities. Also they provided back-up  liquidity to the conduits that served as intermediaries to the ultimate  investors, and they often helped the ultimate investors finance their holdings  of the securities. Moreover, when problems arose the markets turned to the  banks to use their superior access to liquidity—both market-sourced and  official—to provide funding. In securities markets where banks have recently  substantially scaled back lending, we have seen decreased liquidity as some  investors depended on bank-supplied leverage to obtain their target rates of  return.\n\nWhile banks have taken hits in the recent turmoil, their  central role has been reconfirmed and their inherent strengths accentuated. The  scale and scope of our larger banks and their broad earnings power have cushioned  the losses. And their franchise strength has aided recapitalization.\n\nWhile I see banks recovering, I see little chance that we  will revert to the old approach of originate-to-hold-in-portfolio model. Market-based  credit intermediation provides substantial gains from diversification and  transparency that are not available in the old model. And I see little chance  banks in their various forms won't remain the cornerstone institutions of our  financial system.\n\nSecond, is securitization dead or dying? Here I think the  answer is an unambiguous no. Securitization is not a new and untested financing  tool. Rather, securitization has been around for decades providing fee income  to originators, diversification benefits to lenders, and lower costs to  borrowers. The logic of securitization—done prudently—is too compelling, and  the market infrastructure is advanced. I have heard anecdotal comments to the  effect that major investors have latent demand that will return to the markets  once volatility has subsided.\n\nBut it's clear to me that participants in the securitization  process must address certain weaknesses.\n\nAccusations have flown about irresponsible mortgage origination  practices—that is, the lowering of standards or even fraudulent behavior of  originators who carry minimal risk in the ultimate performance of a loan. Actual practices no doubt covered a wide  spectrum, but it's clear that there were problems, and, in my opinion, this  perverse incentive must be addressed.\n\nIn reaction to troublesome opacity and complexity, I expect  that financing structures will become less complicated. I don't believe investors  will be willing to invest in structures that would require their lawyers days  to figure out cash flows in the event of problems. Simpler, more transparent  securities will facilitate somewhat reduced reliance on agency credit ratings. Ratings  will remain an important part of the process because all investors cannot be  expected to do their own thorough due diligence on every security. Rating  agencies are already undertaking their own reforms, but ratings are unlikely to  be as singularly dominant as they have been in some markets in recent years. Moreover,  investors and rating agencies will not soon forget the lessons of recent months  in evaluating pool probabilities. Tail events can materialize and, given recent experience, seem to do so with  higher frequency than was contemplated by the models employed—models that were  built for other purposes and products.\n\nThird, are we going to see a  permanent shrinkage of the leveraged loan market with the attendant consequences  for private equity? Clearly, some shrinkage—especially in the large deal  category—has happened already, but is it permanent? A year ago there was talk  of a private equity \"golden age.\" Like the four-minute mile before Roger  Bannister, there were predictions of the $100 billion deal. Lender terms—with  covenant-light structures and equity bridges—were collecting critical  commentary.\n\nWhat a difference a year makes! I believe the  private equity industry will continue to operate, but at more modest levels of  deal size, leverage, and loan terms. The recent repricing of risk and  strengthening of terms should be healthy in the longer term. However, a  cautionary note: Leveraged lending tends to go through cycles of tighter, then  looser, underwriting standards. The pressures of competition for loan  origination—including competition from nonbanks and hedge funds—may play  through once again.\n\nFinally, should we expect the  disappearance of foreign investors from U.S. credit markets? As you've  probably read, foreign institutional investors have not avoided the recent  problems. Indeed, one of the realities exposed by the recent turmoil has been  the geographic spread of investors, their direct exposure to subprime and CDO  securities, and the scale of their losses. Given their losses, some pullback is  predictable. There has been a widespread retreat from the subprime market, and I  would not be surprised if this persists for some time. But as regards the  broader credit markets, including mortgage-backed securities, it's more likely  foreign investors will be more selective and rely more on carefully vetted  expert intermediaries in the selection process.\n\nThe fact of such substantial foreign  exposure to the current problems suggests both the importance of foreign  investors to the U.S.  mortgage markets and the extent of the dollar recycling problem faced by  foreign investors. I do not see  permanent impairment of foreign investor participation in our credit markets. After  a pause, the fundamental need will reassert itself—owners of surplus capital  must put their dollars to work.\n\nSo, as we move out of the current  turmoil, I see the U.S.  markets headed toward a \"new normal,\" not a return to normal. The recent  turmoil has discredited the more dubious innovations of the past few years. But  the foundation of earlier innovations over the past three decades delivered too  much value for us to return to the \"old-old\" ways of finance.\n\nI believe the contours of the new  normal will be:\n\nAs I hope you detect, I am optimistic  that the trauma of recent months will pass and our credit capital markets will  be better for the lessons learned. Thank you.",

            "content": "University of Alabama 2008 Economic Outlook Conference\n  Montgomery, Ala.\n  January 17, 2008\n\nI'm honored by the invitation to speak  at the University   of Alabama's 2008  Economic Outlook Conference. It's a pleasure to visit Montgomery and get an up-close and personal  look at the activity transforming this community. Alabama's economy has changed dramatically  since business first brought me to the state in the late 1970s and 1980s.\n\n  A generation ago, Alabama's economy was far more dependent on \"old  economy\" industries and less integrated into the broader national economy. Alabama at that time depended  to a large extent on low-productivity manufacturing, agriculture, and military  spending. During the 1990s, global competitive pressures, reduced defense  spending, and technological change contributed to the loss of many jobs in Alabama—including thousands  of jobs in textiles and apparel.\n\n  But despite some painful structural  changes, Alabama  has become more and more economically diverse. In the past few years, the state  has benefited from growth in business services, aerospace, health care,  education, and other expanding industries. Investment in auto manufacturing also  has had a significant economic impact in the state. I will add that a highly  productive and efficient auto industry has taken root in a number of states in  the Southeast.\n\n  By the Southeast, I'm referring to  the six states that encompass the Federal Reserve's Sixth District, which is  home to some 45 million people. Looking at subregions of our district, economic  performance has varied widely. For instance, post-hurricane rebuilding has  affected growth along the Gulf   Coast. Also, the housing  downturn has been quite severe in Florida.  In that state, which is the largest in our region, the declining housing market  has affected consumer incomes, spending, and employment as well as state  government finances. This dynamic has been evident in other parts of the Sixth  District as well. The housing sector is a serious concern nationally and  regionally, although certain areas in Tennessee  and notably Alabama  have been somewhat less affected so far. \n\n  Taken as a whole, the Southeastern  economy has experienced solid growth in recent years. Because of its size and  diversity, the composition of the Southeast economy closely matches that of the  nation as a whole. Therefore, the region can be a useful barometer for activity  in the broader U.S.  economy.\n\nFor the rest of my remarks this  afternoon, I plan to provide a brief summary of last year's U.S. economic  story and an outlook for 2008. I'll also share some of my personal views on Federal  Reserve monetary policy during this difficult time of economic and financial  adjustment. I'll tell you up front that my message will be a sober one. I want  to add that my comments are my views alone and do not represent the views of my  colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nLooking back at 2007\n  Let me begin by taking you back to a  year ago. As 2006 turned into 2007, the economic environment appeared relatively  benign compared to today. However, we now know that housing activity—measured  by sales, starts, and prices—began to slip in late 2005. Single-family housing  starts peaked in the first quarter of 2006 at 1.7 million units on an  annualized basis, compared with slightly less than a million units in the third  quarter of 2007.\n\n  By midsummer 2006, the FOMC started  noting the cooling of the housing market. The decline in housing activity  coincided with a notable slowdown of economic growth through the end of 2006  and into the first part of 2007. \n\n  Throughout 2007, forecasts of housing  activity were repeatedly revised downward. Despite the intensifying housing  \"correction,\" the economy grew smartly last spring and summer. U.S.  gross domestic product (GDP) grew at annual rates of 3.8 percent in the second  quarter and then a very strong 4.9 percent in the third quarter of 2007.\n\n  But I believe those strong numbers  contain anomalous factors that probably won't be repeated soon. Taking out an  inventory buildup and exports, third quarter growth was moderate—about half the  GDP headline number. Fourth quarter data aren't available, but I expect growth  during the final three months of 2007 to be modest.\n\n  Evidence of slowing economic activity  has been mounting. Beyond last year's sharp drop in residential investment, growth  in manufacturing output remained well below its rate of the previous year. Also,  spending on equipment and software showed only moderate growth in 2007. Commercial  real estate has held up surprisingly well, but the signs are that it will  proceed more slowly going forward. Anecdotal reports suggest that many firms have  begun to assume a wait-and-see posture because of rising economic uncertainty, especially  in the year's second half.\n\n  Also, over the past 20 or so months,  year-over-year employment growth has slowed considerably. Readings on December employment released on  January 4 showed a small monthly increase of 18,000 jobs, with the unemployment  rate moving up from 4.7 to 5 percent. Historically, abrupt increases in the  unemployment rate have been associated with economic downturns.\n\n  Recent employment data affected many  observers' assessments of the risks to the economic outlook. Moreover, analysis  by my staff suggests that the employment picture for 2007 was weaker than recent  statistics indicate.\n\n  Of course, labor markets affect  consumers. So let me turn to consumer spending, which is watched closely  because of the significant role of personal consumption in our economy. The  news here also reflects slowing. Through November, last year's growth in  personal consumption expenditures fell off the pace of 2006, which in turn was  below its pace of 2005. Also in 2007, growth of real disposable personal income  decelerated a bit. Retail sales results for the fourth quarter, released  Tuesday, showed further slowing. Household spending has likely been weighed  down by higher energy costs and declining house prices. Yet despite these  pressures, consumer spending has not plunged.\n\n  From September 2006 through August  2007, readings on overall inflation were generally favorable. But later in the  year food and energy costs surged, increasing pressure to pass through higher prices  for goods and services. For 2007, the consumer price index increased 4.1  percent—the largest calendar-year increase since 1990. The core CPI (excluding  food and energy costs) increased 2.4 percent, which is above my comfort zone.\n\nReviewing the financial  sector\n  In addition to these developments, the  financial sector of our economy had an especially rough ride in 2007. By now, I'm  sure you're all quite familiar with the story from Wall Street, so I'll be  brief. During the middle months of 2007, a weakening housing sector caused  doubts about subprime mortgage-backed securities. Although subprime debt is  less than 3 percent of the total market for dollar debt securities, these  concerns triggered a widespread repricing of risk.  When financial assets bearing risk are repriced,  credit spreads adjust and securities change value in relation to one another.\n\n  These developments happened after  August of last year. Credit spreads widened, trading volume plummeted, and at  various times bond and money markets froze because of concerns about counterparty  creditworthiness. Accounting values of positions in subprime and other affected  securities caused banks and other institutions to announce sizable losses. Further  losses have been announced this week based on year-end values.\n\n  Some off-balance-sheet positions in  structured investment vehicles (so-called SIVs) were brought back onto their sponsors'  books. Uncertainty about who had what exposure caused illiquidity in interbank  markets, and general illiquidity in securities markets kept trading volume low  or nonexistent and values depressed.\n\n  Last year ended with fears about bank  funding over year-end, fears regarding the effect of SIV exposure on money  market funds, and widespread concern about a credit crunch.\n\n  It's fair to say financial markets  were shaken profoundly between August and year-end, and trading conditions are  still far from settled and orderly.\n\n  For a while after markets seized up  in August, financial conditions did improve. I believe a series of globally coordinated  central bank liquidity injections over the final months of the year helped to  ease some market strains. At meetings in September, October, and December, the  FOMC cut the fed funds rate to forestall some of the adverse effects of  financial turmoil on the broader economy. But these actions were not sufficient  to remedy Wall Street's distressed conditions.\n\n  As I prepare for each FOMC meeting, I  gather real-time anecdotal economic intelligence from a variety of sources.  I talk to, among others, bankers, hedge fund  managers, and other financial market players. In my most recent conversations  in December, they voiced serious concern about further—and spreading—market deterioration  and potential spillover into the broad economy. From my contacts in the  nonfinancial world, I generally get less strident impressions of current economic  circumstances. Not long ago, I heard qualitatively different perceptions from Main Street versus  Wall Street. But in recent weeks almost all were quite worried about the  economic outlook.\n\n  There is always uncertainty, but the New  Year has opened with conditions of heightened uncertainty. For 2008, I believe the  pivotal question—the central uncertainty—is the extent of current and future  spillover from housing and financial markets to the general economy. The  dynamics I'm watching—stated simplistically—are the following: first, the  effect of declining house prices on the consumer and in turn on retail sales  and other personal expenditures and, second, the effect of financial market distress  on credit availability and, in turn, on business investment, general business  activity, and employment.\n\n  That said, my base case outlook sees a  weak first half of 2008—but one of modest growth—with gradual improvement  beginning in the year's second half and continuing into 2009. This outcome  assumes that the housing situation doesn't weaken more than expected and that financial  markets stabilize. A sober assessment of risks must take into account the  possibility of protracted financial market instability together with a deep  decline in house prices, volatile and high energy prices, continued dollar  depreciation, and elevated inflation measures following from the recent upticks  we've seen.\n\n  I'm  troubled by the elevated level of inflation, which has been pushed up by higher  energy and food prices. A confluence of factors on  the demand and supply side and the potential for slowing global economic growth  have led many forecasters to believe energy prices will moderate. But  the reality that these prices are set in an unpredictable geopolitical context may  mean my outlook is too optimistic. Nonetheless, I'm basing my working forecast  on the view that inflation pressures will abate.\n\n  Equally important is the state of  inflation expectations. The United    States and much of the world have enjoyed  many years now of very moderate inflation. Even if recent pressures from  gasoline, energy in general, and food prices have been troubling, I believe the  American public expects the inflation rate to gravitate to lower levels over  the long term.\n\n  To a large extent, my outlook for this  year's economic performance hinges on how financial markets deal with their  problems. The coming days and weeks could be telling. Modern financial markets  are an intricate global network of informed trust. Stabilization will proceed  from clearing up the information deficit and restoring well-informed trust in  counterparties and confidence in the system overall.\n\n  To restore market confidence, leading  financial firms, I believe, must recognize and disclose losses based on  unimpeachable valuation calculations, seek investors where necessary to restore  capital ratios, and urgently execute the strenuous task of updating risk  assessments of scores of counterparties. This process appears to be happening. The  good news is that markets can return to orderly functioning and financial institutions  can be rehabilitated quickly. With healthy disclosure, facing up to losses,  recapitalization, and the resulting clarity, I believe there is hope for this  outcome.\n\nA look at monetary  policy\n  For monetary policymakers, the  overriding concern must be the broad health and balance of the general economy  going forward.  In my view, recent Federal  Reserve policy moves appropriately processed information (both data and  anecdotes) that then painted a mixed but slowing picture.\n\n  As you know, during our last meeting  Dec. 11, the FOMC lowered the fed funds rate 25 basis points to 4.25 percent. The  FOMC began cutting the fed funds rate in September following the announcement  in August that \"the downside risks to growth have increased appreciably.\" At  that point, financial markets were in turmoil, and the fed funds rate was 5.25  percent.\n\n  The decision to lower the fed funds  rate was a response to acute stress in financial markets that had the potential  to threaten economic growth.\n\n  The fed funds rate is the foundation  of a structure of interest rates mostly set by the market.  It is not a targeted policy instrument capable  of dictating credit spreads and reducing illiquidity in specific debt  markets—for example, the interbank lending market. For this reason, the  Fed—along with foreign central banks—has put in place in recent weeks more  targeted facilities to provide liquidity when and where needed.\n\n  For instance, last month the Fed  announced the creation of the Term Auction Facility. With this program,  depository institutions bid to borrow money from the Federal Reserve on a fully  collateralized basis. Since participants are bidding for funds, there is none  of the usual stigma about turning to the lender of last resort, the Fed's  discount window, for liquidity.\n\n  I have been encouraged by the early  results of these auctions and the other efforts by central banks in Europe to keep markets functioning. Since the beginning  of 2008, credit spreads have narrowed markedly in the bellwether interbank  markets here and in Europe.\n\n  In his speech on January 10, Chairman  Bernanke suggested that the Term Auction Facility may become a permanent component  of the Fed's policy toolkit.\n\nResponding to  developments\n  The future—even in stable times—is  hard to read. At this juncture, the times present even greater uncertainty than  usual. Recently, negative information has been exceeding expectations. I think  these circumstances call for policymakers to be prepared to respond pragmatically.  In my view, pragmatism in the face of growing weakness in the general economy  may very well require additional moves to lower the federal funds rate.\n\n  As a policymaker, I feel acutely the tension between the need to  promote growth and guard against the specter of higher prices. Implicit in my  view is the forecast that inflation will moderate, allowing policy to focus on  the very apparent near-term risks to the broad domestic economy.\n\n  Clearly, painful adjustments are  under way in housing markets, mortgage markets, and money markets. I believe  this process began in 2006, continued in 2007, and needs much of 2008 to play  out. In the weeks and months ahead, I will be watching the process of these  necessary adjustments closely as I work with my colleagues to determine the  appropriate monetary policy actions.",

            "content": "Rotary Club of Atlanta\n  January 7, 2008\n\nAt this date on the calendar, it's natural  to take stock and think of the year ahead. In my remarks today, I plan to  provide a brief summary of last year's economic story and an outlook for 2008. I'll  also share some of my personal views on Federal Reserve monetary policy during  this difficult time of economic and financial transition. I'll tell you up  front that my message will be a sober one, but I hope that won't prevent your inviting  me back here next January to speak. I want to add that my comments are my views  alone and do not represent the views of my colleagues on the Federal Open  Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nLooking back at 2007\n  Let me begin by taking you back to a  year ago. As 2006 turned into 2007, the economic environment appeared relatively  benign compared to today. However, we now know that housing activity—measured  by sales, starts, permits, and prices—began to slip in late 2005.\n\nBy mid-summer 2006, the FOMC began  noting the \"cooling of the housing market.\" The decline in housing activity  coincided with a notable slowdown of economic growth through the end of 2006  and into the first part of 2007.\n\nThroughout 2007, forecasts of housing  activity were repeatedly revised downward. Despite the intensifying housing  \"correction,\" the economy grew smartly last spring and summer.  U.S. gross domestic product (GDP)  grew at annual rates of 3.8 percent in the second quarter and then a very  strong 4.9 percent in the third quarter of 2007.\n\nBut I believe those strong numbers  contain anomalous factors that probably won't be repeated soon. Taking out an  inventory buildup and exports, third quarter growth was moderate—about half the  GDP headline number. Fourth quarter data aren't available, but I expect growth  during the final three months of 2007 to come in quite sluggish.\n\nEvidence of slowing economic activity  has been mounting. Beyond last year's sharp drop in residential investment,  industrial production growth remained well below its rate of the previous year.  The data in 2007 showed moderate growth of investment in equipment and software.  Anecdotal reports suggest that many firms have begun—especially in the year's  second half—to assume a wait-and-see posture because of rising economic  uncertainty.\n\nAlso, over the past 20 or so months,  year-over-year employment growth has slowed considerably. Readings  on December employment released last Friday showed a small monthly increase of  18,000 jobs, with the unemployment rate moving up from 4.7 to 5 percent.\n\nConsumer spending is watched closely  because of the role of consumption in our economy, and the news here also  reflects slowing. Through November, last year's growth in personal consumption  expenditures fell off the pace of 2006, which in turn was below its pace of two  years ago. Also in 2007, growth of real disposable personal income slowed a  bit. Household spending has likely been weighed down by higher energy costs and  declining house prices. Although weakening, consumer spending has not plunged.\n\nFrom September 2006 through August  2007, readings on inflation were generally favorable, with consumer price  inflation averaging around 2.3 percent on a year-over-year basis. But later in the year energy costs surged,  increasing pressure to pass through higher prices for goods and services. The  consumer price index for November increased at a year-over-year rate of 4.3  percent, driven largely by a 21 percent jump in the energy cost component.\n\nReviewing the financial  sector\n  In addition to these developments, the  financial sector of our economy had an especially rough ride in 2007. You're  all quite familiar with the storyline for Wall Street, so I'll skip the  play-by-play and just provide highlights. During the middle months of 2007, a  weakening housing sector caused doubts about subprime mortgage-backed  securities. Although subprime debt is less than 3 percent of the total market  for dollar debt securities, these concerns triggered a widespread repricing of  risk.\n\nCredit spreads widened, trading  volume plummeted, and at various times bond and money markets froze because of  concerns about counterparty creditworthiness. Accounting values of positions in  subprime and other affected securities caused banks and other institutions to  announce sizable losses.\n\nSome off-balance-sheet positions in  structured investment vehicles (so-called SIVs) were brought back onto  sponsors' books. Uncertainty about who had what exposure caused illiquidity in  interbank markets, and general illiquidity in securities markets kept trading  volume low or nonexistent and values depressed.\n\nLast year ended with fears about bank  funding over year-end, fears regarding the effect of SIV exposure on money  market funds, and widespread concern about a credit crunch.\n\nIt's fair to say financial markets  were shaken profoundly between August and year-end, and trading conditions are  still far from settled and orderly.\n\nFor a while, after markets seized up  in August, financial conditions did improve.

Most recently, they have given me the Wall Street perspective: that  is, serious concern about further—and spreading—market deterioration and  potential spillover into the broad economy.\n\nI also talk to people whose address  is Main Street.  From these sources, I get the impression of an economy that is slowing but  demonstrating resilience. Having said that, I think we're at a time of heightened  uncertainty.\n\nLooking to 2008, I believe the  pivotal question—the central uncertainty—is the extent of current and future  spillover from housing and financial markets to the general economy. The  dynamics I'm watching—stated simplistically—are the following. First, there's the  effect of dropping house prices on the consumer and in turn on retail sales and  other personal expenditures. And second, I'm watching the effect of financial  market distress on credit availability and, in turn, on business investment,  general business activity, and employment.\n\nMy base case outlook sees a weak  first half of 2008—but one of modest growth—with gradual improvement beginning  in the year's second half and continuing into 2009.

A sober assessment of risks must take account of the possibility of protracted  financial market instability together with weakening housing prices, volatile  and high energy prices, continued dollar depreciation, and elevated inflation  measures following from the recent upticks we've seen.\n\nI'm troubled by the elevated level of  inflation. Currently I expect that inflation will moderate in 2008 as projected  declines in energy costs have their effect. But the recent upward rebound of  oil prices—and the reality that they are set in an unpredictable geopolitical  context—may mean my outlook is too optimistic. Nonetheless, I'm basing my  working forecast on the view that inflation pressures will abate.\n\nTo a large extent, my outlook for this  year's economic performance hinges on how financial markets deal with their  problems.

            "content": "Remarks for the chartering ceremony of the \n  Southeastern United States–Canadian Provinces Alliance\n  Montreal, Quebec \n  November 16, 2007\n\nIt's my honor to participate in the chartering ceremony for  the Southeastern United States and Canadian  Provinces Alliance.\n\nThe Atlanta Fed serves the Federal Reserve System's Sixth District,  which includes Georgia, Alabama, and Florida and  parts of Tennessee, Louisiana,  and Mississippi.  Although our district does not align precisely with the states involved in this  alliance, it's a fair proxy for the economy of the Southeast. For this occasion  my references to the Southeast will include all of the states within the Sixth  District as well as North and South    Carolina.\n\nIn terms of industrial composition, the Southeast's economy  is similar to the overall U.S.  economy, which has a gross domestic product of $13 trillion. By comparison, the  economic output of the Southeast is about $2.3 trillion—about the same size as  the United Kingdom.\n\nTo provide some perspective on this large and diverse  economic region, I will briefly comment on some of the region's strengths and  challenges.\n\nStrengths\n  The first strength is the growing number of people in the  Southeast region. Today, the population of the Southeast is about 58 million. Population  in the region has increased steadily with the trend of Americans migrating  south because of the region's attractive weather, lifestyle, and economic  opportunity—among other reasons.\n\nAnother strength is brainpower as reflected in the growth of  knowledge workers and service industries. The Southeast is home to many  high-quality institutions of higher education. The Atlanta area alone has 45 universities and colleges—not  counting postsecondary technical schools, according to the Metro Atlanta  Chamber of Commerce.\n\nA broad historical trend in the Southeast is the substitution  of traditional industries—for example, textiles—with technology-based  industries and associated professional services. Health care, education and  tourism are growth industries.\n\nGrowth clusters—big and small—are located throughout the  region. Last week I visited Huntsville, Ala., which was the cradle of America's space program after World  War II. Now, Huntsville  is home to many aerospace and engineering businesses. Other clusters can be  found in Raleigh-Durham (biotech), Charlotte  (banking), Nashville (healthcare and hospital  management), Atlanta (logistics), and the Mississippi Gulf Coast  (tourism and gaming). Obviously, this list is not exhaustive.\n\nIn addition, the Southeast is well positioned for trade. Of  the nation's 50 largest ports in terms of total international trade, 15 are in  the Southeast. During the past six years, the value of international shipments  across regional ports and airports has grown steadily. The Southeast also has  strong connections to Latin America. Miami serves as a gateway to South   America, and trade and investment connections are growing across  the region.\n\nAnd there is very healthy north-south trade between Canada and the  Southeast as shipments between these areas amount to many tens of millions of  dollars each day. One reason for this connection is proximity. For instance, a  truck delivery from Montreal to, say, Nashville takes about two  days. The same shipment going west to Vancouver  might take as long as five days.\n\nTo emphasize the importance of Canada  as a trading partner, the country is the largest export market for 36 U.S. states  and a majority of Southeastern states.\n\nTrade in automobiles and vehicles is brisk, with growing shipments  from the Southeast into Canada—a  positive outgrowth of the region's vibrant vehicle parts and manufacturing  industry. Outside of the upper Midwest, the Southeast is the auto industry's second  home in the United States.\n\nChallenges\n  Despite the development of efficient manufacturing  facilities, the region in recent decades has suffered the loss of many factory  jobs—particularly in the apparel and textile industries. Although overall  unemployment in the region is a bit lower than the United States as a whole, many  workers in the region have not adjusted to changing technologies and global  competitive pressures.\n\nMany of the kindergarten through 12th grade schools in the  Southeast fall below national averages by certain measures of performance, and  pockets of poverty—especially in rural areas—are a lingering problem.\n\nAs you know, parts of the Southeast are currently  experiencing serious drought conditions. Although perhaps a temporary problem,  this situation points out the need for long-term resource management planning.\n\nFinally, I should point out that the Southeast recently has begun  to suffer from too much of a good thing when it comes to housing. Many lenders,  builders, and other businesses failed to anticipate the end of the housing boom  that lasted from 2001–05. In the aftermath of residential overbuilding, a  painful adjustment is taking place with house prices stagnant or declining and  housing starts dropping sharply in many areas in the region.\n\nI should mention that with the strong Canadian dollar and  weak housing markets, the Southeast has the potential to benefit from second-home  residential investment by Canadians. Canada's  demographic profile is slightly older than the United States. And need I say that  Southeast beaches are warmer in January?\n\nBenefits of trade,  investment and collaboration\n  Taken as a whole, I believe that the economic strengths of  the Southeast far outweigh its challenges. Throughout its history, the  Southeastern economy has shown enormous resilience and an ability to respond to  challenges.\n\nAlthough not contiguous, Canada and the Southeast are both  well positioned to benefit from the interconnection of their economies through  trade, investment, and collaboration. I applaud the leaders for advancing  closer explicit ties between our two economies. I believe this alliance will  provide concrete economic benefits to everyone involved.",

            "content": "Joint Meeting of the Huntsville Rotary Club and the \n Greater Huntsville Rotary Club\n Huntsville, Ala. \nNovember 7, 2007\n\nI'm honored to speak at this joint meeting of the Huntsville Rotary Club and the Greater Huntsville Rotary Club. I arrived here this morning and just visited the Hudson-Alpha Institute of Biotechnology—more evidence that your community is a center of innovation. Huntsville's unique attributes and ongoing prosperity are reminders that in today's world it's human capital—brain power—that accounts for much of the wealth creation and economic resilience. While I'm here over the next two days I plan to visit with some businesses and leaders to find out more about this area's vibrant economy.\n\nI first came to Huntsville in the 1980s, calling on some of your leading corporations. At that time, I was intrigued by Huntsville's cluster of defense and technology businesses. Before that, as a schoolboy growing up in California in the 1950s and '60s, I knew something of the story of Wernher von Braun and the rocket scientists who came to Huntsville after World War II. In the fourth grade, as I recall, I actually tried to build a to-scale model of a rocket in my backyard using crates and cardboard. When my father gently suggested I remove that piece of junk from the premises, I concluded I might not be destined for a career in rocket science.\n\nBut in my banking and finance career, I've been exposed to a different breed of rocket scientists. Instead of exploring the frontiers of space, these so-called rocket scientists have pushed the boundaries of finance. I believe this subject is timely because financial innovations have a major bearing on economic activity—not just on Wall Street but also on Main Streets throughout the United States.\n\nAlso this afternoon I plan to discuss the current economy. My remarks have the disclaimer that the views I express are mine alone—and not those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the Federal Reserve's monetary policy setting body.\n\nThe economic situation \n Given the importance of the defense industry in Huntsville's economy, I suspect a number of people in the room have some military background. Perhaps some of you remember the term \"sitrep.\" For those not familiar with military terminology, a sitrep (situation report) is a current, real-time assessment of conditions and forces on a battlefield. Let me offer a sitrep of our current economy.\n\nRecent economic data present a mixed picture, but basically one of continued strength. The first report of third quarter gross domestic product (GDP) growth issued last Wednesday had the economy growing at an annual rate of nearly 4 percent—a slight increase from strong growth in the second quarter. This year's solid growth has taken place despite widespread and well-publicized weakness in the housing sector.\n\nResidential weakness is reflected in almost every national housing statistic, including a 23 percent year-over-year decline in the sales of new single-family homes in September and a 30 percent drop in building permits.\n\nSo far, evidence of spillover from problems in housing to the broader economy is limited. For instance, personal consumption has held up surprisingly well, and national job market data for October released after the last FOMC meeting were encouraging. According to the initial estimate, nonfarm payroll employment increased by 166,000 in October—the largest gain since May. Net exports have also been very strong recently, propelled by a combination of strong global demand and the depreciation of the dollar.\n\nIn addition to growth, I'm keeping a close watch on prices. Readings on inflation have improved this year, and I believe that inflation will most likely continue to moderate as measured by so-called core inflation indices. But there are some inflationary risks. In particular, recent increases in energy and commodity prices, among other factors, could put renewed upward pressure on headline inflation—the inflation you and I encounter in the marketplace.\n\nDespite the positive readings on recent economic performance outside the housing sector, my forecast calls for below trend, slower GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2007 and first half of next year. This forecast anticipates further weakness in housing in the near term and the likelihood that declines in housing wealth will contribute to a weakening of the pace of consumer spending.\n\nFOMC actions\n It should be no surprise that the troubles in the financial sector were a topic of discussion at last week's FOMC meeting. At this meeting, you'll recall the Fed lowered the target for the fed funds rate 25 basis points to 4.5 percent. This move followed a cut of 50 basis points announced after our FOMC meeting September 18.\n\nThe FOMC noted on October 31 that \"economic growth was solid in the third quarter, and strains in financial markets have eased somewhat.\" However, the committee added \"the pace of economic expansion will likely slow in the near term, partly reflecting the intensification of the housing correction.\" The committee believed its October 31 policy action, combined with its action taken in September, \"should help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets and promote moderate growth over time.\"\n\nAs discussed a moment ago, my view of the economy is consistent with the FOMC statement, and I supported last week's policy action. In part, my position was based on the notion of insurance against downside risks to the general economy given the unusually high level of uncertainty.\n\nI base that assessment on both recent hard data and what I'm hearing from business and financial industry contacts. These contacts provide timely and detailed information that is extremely valuable to a Reserve Bank, particularly during transitional periods.\n\nSome anecdotal information contradicts the picture suggested by recent data. Recent feedback from our Reserve Bank board members and other contacts on the ground is somewhat more negative than the numbers suggest. For instance, anecdotally we hear that attitudes toward future discretionary capital investment have grown more cautious since the onset of financial market turmoil. I attribute negative sentiment about future capital expenditures more to growing pessimism about economic growth rather than to restrictive credit conditions for businesses.\n\nIf I were to use one word to characterize our current economic circumstances, that word would be \"uncertain.\" Much of this uncertainty relates to the potential depth, length, and impact of the housing downturn and potential flow-back to Main Street from the turbulence we have seen on Wall Street.\n\nFinancial market turbulence\n Federal Reserve officials ground monetary policy deliberations mostly in the outlook for the general economy. In these times this focus cannot be uncoupled from concern about the financial sector. This connection exists because credit plays a vital role in fueling virtually all aspects of economic activity. The current level of uncertainty necessarily has a financial markets dimension. So for the sake of a more complete picture, I would like to briefly discuss the evolution of our financial system that brings us to where we are today.\n\nWhen I started my banking career in the 1970s, banks were the dominant intermediaries in the credit system. Banks mostly kept exposure on their books. In those days we spoke of the \"Cs of credit\"—cash flow, collateral, and character—and character reflected the admonition to know your borrower and assess the intangibles of your client. Old timers in those days said, \"Companies don't repay loans, people do.\"\n\nOver the last several decades we've seen an evolution from a bank-centered financial intermediation system to a market-centered system. As a result, lenders have become investors, loan spreads have become investment yields, and individual loans have become the feedstock of pools of like assets brought together through a process known as securitization. These changes have had significant implications both for loan underwriting and where in the system loans are ultimately held.\n\nIn terms of underwriting, the old \"banker-looking-borrower-in-the-eye\" business model has been largely replaced by an \"originate and distribute\" business model. Standardization of loan terms has allowed many classes of loans—to individuals and businesses—to be channeled into marketable securities. The new underwriting model for many types of loans relies on credit scoring and quantifiable measures of the borrower's repayment capacity and the loan's collateral. Loans become units of statistically modeled pools of assets.\n\nIn terms of who owns the loans, the holders could be almost anywhere. A Huntsville mortgage may be held by a local bank, but it could just as easily be held by a New  York investment bank, a London hedge fund, an Asian bank, or a Middle Eastern sovereign wealth fund.\n\nIn the global asset management industry that invests in credit instruments, competition is intense. Small increments of yield can result in performance that differentiates one manager from another. So the incentive to pursue better yield for apparently equivalent risk is very compelling for these investment managers.\n\nWe all know that in today's world—especially in the credit securities markets—there are few, if any, low-risk, high-return investments waiting to be discovered. As a result, many portfolio managers have sought to boost the returns on their portfolios by using leverage. While this leverage may be obtained in various ways, the end result is similar to an individual investor buying stock on margin or buying an option on a stock.\n\nNone of this is to imply that banks have become irrelevant to modern finance. They remain very important to our system, but the reality is that banks are not as dominant as they once were. In their place has emerged a constellation of asset and investment managers that includes money market funds, hedge funds, and specialized players. We used to call some of these groups \"nonbank banks.\" Suffice to say, the makeup of today's credit intermediation system is quite complex.\n\nBenefits of financial rocket science\n Accompanying increased complexity, the market-centered evolution of our credit system has brought many benefits. The innovations of Wall Street's rocket scientists have made markets more efficient, deeper, and more liquid.\n\nSpecifically, financial innovations have provided credit to classes of borrowers who were previously denied access and allowed financial institutions to diversify their often geography-bound risk exposure. Through securitization, risk and yield can now be cut to fit the exacting needs of investors worldwide. Innovations in securitization have turned risky individual exposures—which would require high rates of return—into diversified pools of loans qualifying for lower rates, with those lower rates partially passed back to individual borrowers.\n\nThis financial \"rocket science\" has on balance been positive for society. But, predictably, financial innovation and the evolution of the credit system have brought new challenges. As mentioned, today's institutions, portfolios, and securities can be extremely complex. And this complexity is compounded by opacity. Compared to the past, today's system is opaque.\n\nVisibility—or information—is limited in a variety of ways. First, knowing where risk lies in the system is a challenge. Determining the extent of leverage assumed by investors is a challenge. Holders of mortgage-backed and otherwise collateralized securities are challenged to value new instruments encompassing asset pools that have little performance history. And liquidity-providing market participants often suffer from limited visibility into the risk positions carried by actual or potential counterparties.\n\nClearly, the current circumstances of this new world of financial markets—credit markets—present serious challenges, and then there is the continuing housing sector weakness. So how will the story play out?\n\nA story of transition\n Let me describe three potential story lines, emphasizing the one I believe represents the most likely scenario for the economy.\n\nThe first is a very adverse scenario with housing and financial markets severely affecting real economic activity. In this story, extreme balance sheet pressures cause lending institutions to cut back their regular lending to households and businesses, and the dynamic becomes circular, feeding back on itself. A colleague termed this hypothetical scenario an \"adverse feedback loop\" in a recent speech. I want to emphasize that I view this outcome as being quite unlikely.\n\nAnother story line holds that recent developments in financial markets are a mere hiccup—a temporary dislocation of financial markets followed by a return to normalcy as defined by conditions and practices that prevailed before this summer. I don't view this scenario as realistic. I believe markets, institutions, and risk management practices have been affected profoundly by recent experience.\n\nIn my view, the most likely story line is one involving a moderate slowdown in economic activity over the coming quarters, with a return to growth near trend by late 2008 as the housing sector begins to recover. Underpinning this story is the view that our modern market economy has a keen ability to self-correct as opportunistic capital moves into depressed markets. Markets correct. And market solutions are preferable. This transition already is happening in the market for subprime mortgages. In this story, financial markets may endure some more weeks or months of volatility, but I believe they will find a restructured state of \"normality,\" involving improved risk management practices, reduced leverage, and greater transparency.\n\nAn appropriate public policy posture is to be supportive of market solutions in the financial markets. During our past two meetings, the FOMC reduced the fed funds rate target by 75 basis points. While aimed mostly at the macroeconomy, these reductions, I believe, also support those purposes.\n\nAs already explained, I joined the Atlanta Fed in March of this year. No surprise, but I've learned firsthand that the job involves intense tracking and discussion of the state and path of the economy. We have some near-term uncertainty, but one cannot help being impressed with the continuing resilience of the U.S. economy. That conclusion isn't rocket science, but it gives comfort as the economy works through our current difficulties.",

            "content": "Middle Tennessee State University \n  Murfreesboro, Tenn.\n  September 28, 2007\n\nThank you. I appreciate Bill Ford's invitation to speak here.  As you know, Bill is former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, and his  invitation was one of the first things to hit my desk when I arrived in March. I accepted without hesitation. I owe Bill because he gave me my first flying lesson. Let me explain.\n\nI'm now a little over six months into my stint as president  of the Atlanta Fed. I lived in Atlanta  from 1978 to 1988 while heading up Citicorp's Southeast corporate banking  activities. I first met Bill about 25 years ago when he invited me to a  one-on-one lunch. I remember boning up  on all my \"Ms\" (M-1, M-2, M-3) and on the role of Reserve Bank presidents.\n\nToward the end of our lunch I asked, \"What's it like to  formulate monetary policy?\" He thought  for a moment and gave me a playful response. He said formulating monetary  policy is like flying an airplane in low visibility conditions and choppy air. As  the pilot, many times you see clouds and not much else. So you rely on your  instruments, which are like economic data. The difficulty is half of the  readings may be off, and you don't know which half at any given time.\n\nThis is a great metaphor. I'm sure all of you nonpilots—like  me—have looked into a cockpit and wondered, what on earth are all those  instruments? In setting economic policy we rely on a lot of readings of the  status and direction of the national economy. The instruments in our cockpit  include economic data, anecdotes and opinion from contacts, economic models,  and commercial economic forecasts.\n\nAs I mentioned, I started in Bill's old job in March of this  year. Lucky for me, during my first few months, flying conditions seemed pretty  calm and visibility was good. Then, during the summer, conditions in financial  markets became turbulent. The markets—particularly the debt capital markets  made up of so-called structured securities backed by residential mortgage  assets—became extremely volatile. Markets seized up. Trading plummeted or in  some cases stopped. Credit spreads widened. Lenders and traders became wary of  counterparties. Investors became  suspicious of ratings. None of this is news to anyone here.\n\nA major concern of Fed policymakers has been the effect of  the financial turbulence on the broad economy. Connecting these dots is challenging.  In a fluid and fast-moving situation we have very little timely macroeconomic  data to indicate actual linkages in the current circumstances between the  financial markets and the general economy.\n\nSince your conference theme is the economic outlook, I expect  many of you want to hear my views on prospects for the U.S. economy. I will try to satisfy  you—at least partially—on that score. But I'd also like to discuss the Atlanta  Fed's process for gathering information on the economy and coming up with a  recommendation on Fed policy as well as recent actions on the Federal Open  Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nLet me begin by taking you back in time to the week before  the Sept. 18 FOMC meeting. At that point, I had not yet arrived at a decision  on my policy recommendation. Our Atlanta Fed economic team and I were in the  midst of a briefing and many points of view were expressed. Given the speed of  developments, I was trying to keep an open mind as long as possible as we  approached the meeting.\n\nReconciling different  viewpoints\n  Among our 22 Ph.D. economists at the Atlanta Fed, we have a  team of regional economists and analysts. They track regional data and interact  with a variety of sources including directors and industry contacts. By these  methods they seek detailed knowledge of economic developments in our region. Their  composite of the Southeast is doubly valuable to me as an FOMC participant  because our region is a reasonable proxy for the nation as a whole.\n\nMy responsibility at the FOMC is to contribute to national  policy formulation. I am not there to represent the interests of the  Southeast—rather to extrapolate from the situation in this part of the country  to the national picture. This means I challenge our economists to meet the test  of national relevance.\n\nThe regional team looks at statewide data across the six  states of the Sixth Federal District.  Our focus, however, is not governed by political boundaries. So we try  to get a picture of what's going on in major economic areas such as south Florida, the Gulf  Coast, metro Atlanta,  and middle Tennessee.\n\nWhen we look at the economy in the Murfeesboro area—Nashville, Murfreesboro,  and Davidson County—we see a healthy diversification,  with a similar broad industry representation as the United States as a whole.  One exception, however, is this region's relatively high concentration in  auto-related manufacturing. Recent job cuts in that sector have contributed to  a slowdown in employment growth this year.\n\nAlso, this local area has not been immune to the weakness in  the national housing sector. Home construction, as measured by permit issuance,  is down by about 10 percent through July of this year. Notably, however, this  decline has been mild compared with the nation as a whole, which has seen  permits fall by some 28 percent so far this year.\n\nAlong with our regional team, we have a macroeconomics team  and a financial markets team. Within the  macroeconomics team we have substantial econometric modeling capability. In my  view, forecasts from models are helpful inputs to our thinking, especially with  regard to the major forces at work in the economy, but are not final and  definitive answers.\n\nAs we prepared for the September FOMC meeting, the models  were also anticipating weakness in the outlook for the real, or nonfinancial,  side of the economy. Our models are based mostly on data from different  indicators of the economy such as housing market activity and employment. But our models did not formally incorporate  the impact of the financial market turbulence on the outlook. The backflow from  the financial economy to the real economy was not built into the mathematical  equations.\n\nFor that reason I also sought the input from my team of  financial markets economists. They described to me the increasing concern with  the valuation of claims on subprime mortgages. The problems began to emerge in  July, when rating agencies downgraded or put on watch a wave of bonds backed by  subprime mortgages. These downgrades were, if anything, overdue. Questions about subprime mortgage valuation  sparked a wider reassessment of many financial structures.\n\nConditions of illiquidity, volatile pricing, weak trading  turnover, and very limited new issuance spread from the subprime residential  mortgage-backed securities market, to the asset-backed commercial paper market,  to the high-yield corporate market, to the London Interbank Offered Rate, or  LIBOR, market in Europe, and so on. Financial markets around the world underwent  a massive recalibration of relative risk, asset pricing, and investor staying  power. In the wake of problems at several European banks, the European Central  Bank on August 9 responded with an injection of 65 billion euros.\n\nEquity markets have not been immune from volatility  conditions. One of the indices we follow is the \"stock investors' fear index.\" This  is a colorful name for a measure of implied volatility in S&P 500 and  NASDAQ 100 call options. Stock investors' fear spiked in late July/early August,  rising from a relatively low and declining trend line beginning in 2003.\n\nSimply stated, our financial economists described markets  trying to cope with a shortage of information and a collapse of  confidence. As I framed my thinking for  the last FOMC meeting, I tried to discern whether and how these sharp  adjustments in the credit markets would affect the broader economy.\n\nTo gain a better sense of the economy during these uncertain  times of conflicting data, I've also been listening closely to anecdotal  information. Before FOMC meetings, I meet with our directors. This diverse  group represents a range of industries in the Southeast, many with national or  international reach.\n\nSometimes, their views are expressed in colorful or pithy  ways. For example, at our September meeting, one director said, \"Some big  investors have jumped in a mud puddle, and it has splashed on the rest of us.\"\n\nAnother director said, of the current financial turmoil,  \"When you swim in the ocean, you don't know who's naked 'til the tide goes  out.\"\n\nOther reports were more matter of fact. For instance, one of  our directors described a weakening trend in his consumer business this year  while another noted the current strength of his export business.\n\nTaken together, the reports from the Atlanta Fed's 44  directors helped me connect the financial picture and general economic outlook.\n\nThe economic situation\n  Given the mix of data, forecasts, and anecdotes, I went to  the FOMC meeting with a picture of an economy that had significant risk of  being weakened by recent financial market turbulence. As you recall, the Fed  decided Sept. 18 to lower its fed funds target rate 50 basis points to 4.75  percent. The fed funds rate is the interest rate at which domestic depository  institutions lend to one another overnight—sometimes longer—and is our primary  tool for influencing the overall economy. The Fed's decision to cut this rate  was explained in this statement:\n\n\"Economic growth was moderate during the first half of the  year, but the tightening of credit conditions has the potential to intensify  the housing correction and to restrain economic growth more generally. Today's  action is intended to help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader  economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets  and to promote moderate growth over time.\" The main point, in my view, was our  focus on the total economy.\n\nIn a related action, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors  also approved a 50 basis point cut in the discount rate to 5.25 percent. The  discount rate is the rate at which depository institutions can borrow directly  from the Fed. By lowering the discount rate by the same extent as the fed funds  rate, the Fed kept the premium that institutions must pay for access to the discount  window at 50 basis points.\n\nEarlier, on Aug. 17, the premium for the discount window was  cut from 100 to 50 basis points in an effort to help improve the flow of liquidity  in financial markets. The purpose of this policy action was to make sure that  liquidity was available to banks as needed.\n\nMoving forward, I will be looking carefully at risk factors  that could affect my outlook for the economy.\n\nOne risk factor is housing. Given the large inventory of  unsold homes in many markets and current restraints on certain types of  mortgage financing, I believe the bottom of the housing downturn could be a  ways off—potentially the second half of 2008 or later. I will be looking  closely at incoming data for signs of a turning point in the housing  cycle.\n\nI'm also closely following consumer spending, which accounts  for about two-thirds of gross domestic product. With the persistence of the  housing downturn it seems likely that there has been some drag on consumer  spending. If the housing downturn intensifies, I believe consumer spending is  vulnerable to further weakening related to slower home equity extraction and  reduction in overall household wealth.\n\nBusiness investment is another area I'm monitoring. At  present, however, troubles in credit markets do not appear to have restricted  nonfinancial businesses' access to credit. But I'm listening to business  contacts for indications they are getting more cautious with spending and  hiring plans.\n\nFinally, the Fed is always monitoring inflation, looking for  signs of changes in the longer-term inflation trend. Over the longer term,  inflation is influenced by what you, the public, believe is central bank's  commitment to low inflation and consequently your expectations for inflation  over time.\n\nThe Fed's long-term strategic intent shapes public  expectations. In turn, these expectations influence the myriad actions of  consumers, businesses, and institutions that amount to the real-world execution  of the strategic direction. Currently, I believe long-term inflation  expectations remain anchored, and measures of current inflation have  decelerated during the year from elevated levels in 2006.\n\nMonetary policy involves the apportioning, or balancing, of  emphasis. Going into the Sept. 18 FOMC meeting, my opinion was that the balance  of risks to the economy had shifted from higher inflation toward slower real  growth. I believed, and still do, that the factor weighing most heavily on this  change in the outlook has been the potential negative ramifications of the  financial turmoil.\n\nSince the Fed intervened through open market operations and  lowering the discount rate in August, conditions appear to have improved to  some degree. For the past two weeks, stress in the asset-backed commercial  paper market has shown signs of subsiding. For instance, asset-backed  commercial paper spreads to LIBOR are less than half what they were two weeks  ago.\n\nI've seen a number of credit cycles over the years. And  looking ahead, I expect that many of the practices that shaped the market have  had their run. I'm referring not only to aggressive retail practices such as  no-document loans but also to the layers of leverage and opaque structures  employed by multibillion-dollar investment funds at the wholesale level. In my  view, a reversion to the high-leverage status quo of a few months ago is  unlikely.\n\nIn the coming months I expect the financial markets to find  their balance. Time has a healing quality, and I believe the healing process  will be supported by further disclosure, more rigorous risk evaluation, and a  more deleveraged financial reality. Of course, more financial volatility is  possible, so I'll be watching this area closely.\n\nAnswering our critics\n  When policymakers make a judgment call, you can be sure there  will be criticism from quarters that see things differently.\n\nAfter the Fed's action to reduce the federal funds rate on  Sept. 18, there was questioning of the decision on two fronts: \"moral hazard\"  and concern about the inflationary consequences of this action.\n\nFirst, let me comment on moral hazard. Simply stated, moral  hazard refers to the tendency for protective measures—insurance for example—to  affect a party's behavior toward risk. In the Fed's case, some have asserted  that central bank intervention in markets encourages excessive risk taking. Time  doesn't permit a full discussion of moral hazard, but I would like to touch on  one important point about recent Fed actions.\n\nFederal Reserve purposes are financial stability, price  stability, long-run economic growth, and maximum employment. On Sept. 18, I  considered the financial turbulence of recent weeks in the context of signs the  overall economy had the potential to weaken. I did not see the logic of  subordinating the general welfare of our nation's economy to the possibility  that some participants in financial markets might draw tainted conclusions  about the future landscape of risk. My view is that fulfilling the Fed's  institutional purposes takes precedence.\n\nAs I said, one of those purposes is price stability. While  inflation is currently at the upper bounds of my comfort zone, the Fed has made  progress against it. That's why I believe the recent moderation of inflation  readings allowed a tactical move to reduce risks to the general economy with a  fed funds rate cut.\n\nClosing\n  In closing, I want to emphasize that the FOMC actions last  week were made after careful consideration of conflicting data and anecdotal  reports that suggested a more uncertain economic situation.\n\nTwenty-five years ago Bill Ford equipped me with a  useful metaphor of flying an airplane in low visibility as a way to think about  my current responsibilities. Will the aircraft glide in for a soft landing? In  my opinion, the answer is yes. I believe the current Fed policy abets a flight  path of lower but still positive growth with moderate inflation. More  turbulence may be ahead. So keep your seatbelts fastened.",

            "highlights": "Remarks by Dennis P. Lockhart, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta; Atlanta Business Chronicle Best in Business Breakfast, Atlanta, Ga., September 10, 2007\n(The text for this speech is similar to Lockhart's remarks originally delivered to the Atlanta Press Club on Thursday, September 6, 2007.)",
            "content": "I believe we've been experiencing the unpleasant process of  the financial world changing its ways after a prolonged period of relatively cheap  credit and in consequence, high leverage. What we've been going through is an  intense adjustment in both price and practice, and this process may be  continuing.\n\nHow did all this come about? Underlying these developments  was a financial world awash with funds (or liquidity) looking to be invested. Low  interest rates were a worldwide phenomenon during and after the 2001 recession.  Despite many central banks raising short-term rates since 2004, long-term rates  have remained relatively low. Low rates—combined with the ample liquidity  provided by globally integrated capital markets—provided an environment for  financial innovation. We also saw aggressive practices and the use of leverage.\n\nEconomic performance  and price stability\n  Until a few weeks ago, the liquidity conditions continued, and  the outlook was good, on balance. Global growth was (and remains) strong. After  a weak first quarter, U.S.  growth was expected to rebound strongly in the second quarter, which is what occurred.\n\nWith the exception of declines in housing-related industries  such as construction, building supplies and mortgage servicing, employment  growth overall was maintained through the first half of the year. But new  employment data released last Friday reflected downward revisions for June and  July, with moderating job growth in services industries. In August hiring  declined for the first time in four years.\n\nReadings from July show that consumer  spending remained strong, and business investment during the second quarter  picked up momentum. The most serious negative aspect was—and is—the housing  sector.\n\nMy colleagues at the Federal Reserve and I have been watching  for signs of spillover from the housing and mortgage market adjustment into  other sectors of the economy, especially consumer spending. Weakening home  prices, less available credit, and higher interest rates could cause a slowdown  in home equity withdrawal for consumption. The reduction in overall household  wealth could pull down overall household spending.\n\nLast Thursday, I said in a speech that I had not seen  conclusive signs of weakness in the broader economy. Friday's data, however, show employment was  beginning to soften back in June. This news should be evaluated with recently  positive reports in retail sales. I'm processing this information along with  other timely information as I prepare for next week's Federal Open Market Committee  (FOMC) meeting.\n\nAt our August 7 meeting, the FOMC described economic growth  as \"moderate.\" At that time, the statement said, \"the Committee's predominant  policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as  expected.\"\n\nThis statement reflected the importance of the Fed's ongoing  efforts to lean against inflation pressures. In a sequence of 17 rate hikes,  the Fed increased the federal funds rate from 1 percent in June 2004 to 5.25  percent in June 2006, where it has since rested.\n\nI believe these efforts have yielded measurable success. Inflationary  pressures have softened somewhat in recent months. Inflation expectations  remain well contained. By some measures, the pace of inflation is now around 2  percent.\n\nIn my view current readings of inflation represent progress,  but not victory. I would like to see inflation sustained at a somewhat lower  rate—with emphasis on \"sustained.\"\n\nIf inflation is allowed to accelerate, bringing it back down  will be costly and painful. High and unstable inflation can distort economic  decision making and—once ratified by public expectations—is difficult to  reverse. By contrast, low and stable inflation fosters an economy that's  conducive to rational business activity and resistant to exogenous shocks.\n\nLooking back to a month ago, it seemed—all in all—we had  ongoing economic expansion and declining inflation.\n\nA change in  circumstances\n  Then, after our last FOMC meeting, deteriorating conditions  in financial markets changed the economic outlook. On August 17, the FOMC  statement said that \"the downside risks to growth have increased appreciably.\" The  balance of risk to the economy seems to have shifted. We're facing greater  uncertainty in the economic outlook.\n\nAs you know, I'm a new central banker and policymaker. But I  bring to this new role experience in the financial sector touching on a wide  range of business lines, asset classes, and types of institutions. I know during  a feast there is a strong incentive for market participants to meet the  competition and seek competitive advantage by pushing the risk-reward envelope.\n\nSome of this pushing of limits amounts to sustainable  innovation. Many of these innovations served desirable ends and allocated greater  risk to those investors who had an appetite for it. The subprime mortgage  market has brought the American dream of home ownership to many people who  previously could not qualify for mortgage loans. These developments, on  balance, have been a good thing. But some pushing of limits, in my view, will  prove to have been imprudent excess.\n\nThe causes and possible consequences of the current turmoil  in financial markets were discussed widely the week before last at the Kansas  City Fed's annual conference in Jackson    Hole, Wyo. The  conference focused on housing, housing finance, and monetary policy and was  attended by central bankers, academics, financial practitioners, as well as  members of the press. As expected, analysis and opinion were varied, and policy  prescriptions ran the gamut from strong intervention to cautious and watchful  monitoring of developments.\n\nIn his remarks at the conference, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke  reiterated that the Fed stands ready to take whatever action is needed. His  remarks followed previous actions to inject liquidity into the financial system  through open market operations and the discount window.\n\nI believe the essence of our current challenge is to balance  three interconnected and potentially conflicting concerns: timely action in  response to risks to the total economy, preservation of gains achieved on the  inflation front, and overall financial system stability.\n\nA matter of principles\n  When confronted with complexity, uncertainty, and fluidity as  we're currently experiencing, my approach is to ground my thinking and  judgments in organizing principles. Let me share with you how I think about  policy in times like these.\n\nFirst, there is the principle of market discipline. Markets  must be allowed to work. The risks and rewards of market participation should  play out—to the extent possible—without interference. Policy should enable  natural market functioning. Market participants should expect and actually  experience accountability for their decisions through natural market processes.  It is not the role of monetary authorities to change the risk-reward tradeoff of  investment instruments and markets.\n\nUnwarranted intervention in financial markets raises concerns  about moral hazard. This problem could occur if investors come to believe  that—because of likely Fed intervention—they are immune from severe downside  risk. Intervention can distort risks and create incentives to take exaggerated  investment positions.\n\nWhether or not to intervene in markets is a judgment call.  Although I believe that Fed intervention is appropriate if markets are clearly  not working properly, I am aware of the potential pitfalls of such  interventions. Caution may cause some observers to argue that the central bank  is insufficiently preemptive in its actions. But I believe the Fed's  longer-term objectives are well served by a deliberate and measured response to  financial market turbulence. Such a response should distinguish, as much as  possible, between liquidity actions aimed at keeping markets orderly and  monetary actions aimed at cushioning the economy from the impact of financial  market instability.\n\nA second principle, however, is that the Fed has a  responsibility to promote financial system stability. This responsibility at  times may require actions that might seem to run counter to the first principle.  If done effectively, there need be no necessary conflict between actions taken  to ensure the orderly functioning of markets and the principle of allowing  markets to efficiently allocate gains and losses.\n\nJust last month, as investors became more and more reluctant  to accept debt associated with subprime mortgages, markets began to seize up. Markets  suffered illiquidity and essential transactions were not taking place. In some  instances, lenders could not lend, borrowers could not borrow, traders could  not trade, and accountants could not value positions.\n\nOne of the Fed's tools is providing liquidity. For several  successive days in mid-August, the Fed injected liquidity through its daily  open market operations. Then, on August 17, the Fed's Board of Governors announced  a 50 basis point reduction in its primary credit discount rate for loans to  financial institutions. This action (along with others) reduced the premium for  borrowing from the central bank.\n\nMarkets responded favorably to these actions, but further  volatility cannot be ruled out. As the FOMC said August 17, \"the Committee is  monitoring the situation and is prepared to act as needed to mitigate the  adverse effects on the economy arising from the disruptions in financial  markets.\"\n\nMy third informing principle is sustained focus on  fundamental purposes and responsibilities. In the Fed's case, these are our  long-run mandates to foster maximum sustainable growth and stable inflation. I  believe it's important to keep in mind the longer-run implications of policy—what  happens tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, and beyond.

            "content": "I believe we've been experiencing the unpleasant process of the financial world changing its ways after a prolonged period of relatively cheap credit, and in consequence, high leverage. What we've been going through is an intense adjustment in both price and practice, and this process may be continuing.\n\nHow did all this come about? Underlying these developments was a financial world awash with funds (or liquidity) looking to be invested. Low interest rates were a worldwide phenomenon during and after the 2001 recession. Despite many central banks raising short-term rates since 2004, long-term rates have remained relatively low. Low rates—combined with the ample liquidity provided by globally integrated capital markets—provided an environment for financial innovation. We also saw aggressive practices and the use of leverage.\n\nEconomic performance and price stability\nUntil a few weeks ago, the liquidity conditions continued, and the outlook was good, on balance. Global growth was (and remains) strong. After a weak first quarter, U.S. growth was expected to rebound strongly in the second quarter, which is what occurred.\n\nWith the exception of declines in housing-related industries such as construction, building supplies, and mortgage servicing, employment growth overall was well maintained through the first half of the year. The unemployment rate in July was 4.6 percent.\n\nConsumer spending remained strong, and business investment during the second quarter picked up momentum. The one serious negative aspect was, and is, the housing sector.\n\nMy colleagues at the Federal Reserve and I have been watching for signs of spillover from the housing and mortgage market adjustment into other sectors of the economy, especially consumer spending. Weakening home prices, less available credit, and higher interest rates could cause a slowdown in home equity withdrawal for consumption. The reduction in overall household wealth could pull down overall household spending.\n\nBecause much of the incoming data are backward looking, central bankers also must keep their ears to the ground to listen for changes. To identify at the earliest possible moment a change in the direction for the national economy, I rely on real-time information obtained in part from our contacts around the region. This anecdotal input is especially valuable in times of volatility and possible transition. So far, I have not seen hard or soft data that provide conclusive signs that housing problems are spilling over into the broad economy.\n\nAt our August 7 meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) described economic growth as \"moderate.\" At that time, the statement said, \"the Committee's predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected.\"\n\nThis statement reflected the importance of the Fed's ongoing efforts to lean against inflation pressures. In a sequence of 17 rate hikes, the Fed increased the federal funds rate from 1 percent in June 2004 to 5.25 in June 2006, where it has since rested.\n\nI believe these efforts have yielded measurable success. Inflationary pressures have softened somewhat in recent months.  Inflation expectations remain well contained. By some measures, the pace of inflation is now around 2 percent.\n\nIn my view current readings of inflation represent progress, but not victory. I would like to see inflation sustained at a somewhat lower rate—with emphasis on \"sustained.\"\n\nIf inflation is allowed to accelerate, bringing it back down will be costly and painful. High and unstable inflation can distort economic decision making and—once ratified by public expectations—is difficult to reverse. By contrast, low and stable inflation fosters an economy that's conducive to rational business activity and resistant to exogenous shocks.\n\nLooking back to a month ago, it seemed—all in all—we had ongoing economic expansion and declining inflation.\n\nA change in circumstances\nThen, after our last FOMC meeting, deteriorating conditions in financial markets changed the economic outlook. On Aug. 17, the FOMC statement said that \"the downside risks to growth have increased appreciably.\" The balance of risk to the economy seems to have shifted. We're facing greater uncertainty in the economic outlook.\n\nAs you know, I'm a new central banker and policymaker. But I bring to this new role experience in the financial sector touching on a wide range of business lines, asset classes, and types of institutions.  I know during a feast there is a strong incentive for market participants to meet the competition and seek competitive advantage by pushing the risk-reward envelope.\n\nSome of this pushing of limits amounts to sustainable innovation. Many of these innovations served desirable ends and allocated greater risk to those investors who had an appetite for it. The subprime mortgage market has brought the American dream of home ownership to many people who previously could not qualify for mortgage loans. These developments, on balance, have been a good thing. But some pushing of limits, in my view, will prove to have been imprudent excess.\n\nThe causes and possible consequences of the current turmoil in financial markets were discussed widely last week at the Kansas City Fed's annual conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo. The conference focused on housing, housing finance, and monetary policy and was attended by central bankers, academics, financial practitioners, as well as members of the press. As expected, analysis and opinion were varied, and policy prescriptions ran the gamut from strong intervention to cautious and watchful monitoring of developments.\n\nIn his remarks at the conference, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke reiterated that the Fed stands ready to take whatever action is needed. His remarks followed previous actions to inject liquidity into the financial system through open market operations and the discount window.\n\nI believe the essence of our current challenge is to balance three interconnected and potentially conflicting concerns: timely action in response to risks to the total economy, preservation of gains achieved on the inflation front, and overall financial system stability.\n\nA matter of principles\nWhen confronted with complexity, uncertainty, and fluidity as we're currently experiencing, my approach is to ground my thinking and judgments in organizing principles. Let me share with you how I think about policy in times like these.\n\nFirst, there is the principle of market discipline. Markets must be allowed to work. The risks and rewards of market participation should play out—to the extent possible—without interference. Policy should enable natural market functioning. Market participants should expect and actually experience accountability for their decisions through natural market processes. It is not the role of monetary authorities to change the risk-reward tradeoff of investment instruments and markets.\n\nUnwarranted intervention in financial markets raises concerns about moral hazard. This problem could occur if investors come to believe that—because of likely Fed intervention—they are immune from severe downside risk. Intervention can distort risks and create incentives to take exaggerated investment positions.\n\nWhether or not to intervene in markets is a judgment call. Although I believe that Fed intervention is appropriate if markets are clearly not working properly, I am aware of the potential pitfalls of such interventions. Caution may cause some observers to argue that the central bank is insufficiently preemptive in its actions. But I believe the Fed's longer-term objectives are well served by a deliberate and measured response to financial market turbulence. Such a response should distinguish, as much as possible, between liquidity actions aimed at keeping markets orderly and monetary actions aimed at cushioning the economy from the impact of financial market instability.\n\nA second principle, however, is that the Fed has a responsibility to promote financial system stability. This responsibility at times may require actions that might seem to run counter to the first principle. If done effectively, there need be no necessary conflict between actions taken to ensure the orderly functioning of markets and the principle of allowing markets to efficiently allocate gains and losses.\n\nJust last month, as investors became more and more reluctant to accept debt associated with subprime mortgages, markets began to seize up. Markets suffered illiquidity and essential transactions were not taking place. In some instances, lenders could not lend, borrowers could not borrow, traders could not trade, and accountants could not value positions.\n\nOne of the Fed's tools is providing liquidity. For several successive days in mid-August, the Fed injected liquidity through its daily open market operations. Then, on August 17, the Fed's Board of Governors announced a 50 basis point reduction in its primary credit discount rate for loans to financial institutions. This action (along with others) reduced the premium for borrowing from the central bank.\n\nMarkets responded favorably to these actions, but further volatility cannot be ruled out. As the FOMC said Aug. 17, \"the Committee is monitoring the situation and is prepared to act as needed to mitigate the adverse effects on the economy arising from the disruptions in financial markets.\"\n\nMy third informing principle is sustained focus on fundamental purposes and responsibilities. In the Fed's case, these are our long-run mandates to foster maximum sustainable growth and stable inflation. I believe it's important to keep in mind the longer-run implications of policy—what happens tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, and beyond. Allegiance to core institutional purpose has served the country well for many years.\n\nA balancing act\nTo recap: My first principle is let markets work. The second principle is the central bank has a responsibility to promote orderly conditions in financial markets, stepping in as necessary to avoid severe system disruption. The third principle is to make sure the second principle doesn't undermine our long-term mission.\n\nThere are certainly tensions to be resolved in applying these principles, and formulating measured responses to circumstances requires good judgment, particularly in transitional periods. I believe we are in such a period now.\n\nSo, after the feast comes the dyspeptic sequelae. Fancy phrasing, but a simple notion. Housing and financial markets have feasted on a period of low rates and easy credit. I'm confident that market conditions eventually will settle down. As we move forward, my voice in Fed deliberations will be aimed at balancing response to immediate problems with concern for the best outcome for the long run.",

            "content": "Thank you, Gov. Barbour, for inviting my colleagues and me to participate in the Southern Governors Association's 73rd annual meeting.\n\nTwo years ago this week, Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast. During the tough days and weeks after this natural disaster, the Atlanta Fed continued to provide financial services—ensuring that banks and their customers in this area had access to funds. Since that time, we've stayed engaged with the region's recovery. I must say the people in Biloxi have done a tremendous job in bouncing back. While there's still a lot more work to be done, this region's ongoing recovery serves as a reminder of the resilience of the broader American economy.\n\nDuring my prepared remarks this afternoon, I will briefly describe our Reserve Bank's regional approach to gathering economic information. I'll also provide a high-level snapshot of the Sixth Federal Reserve District's economy. As Gov. Barbour said, the Sixth District includes Florida, Georgia, and Alabama and parts of Tennessee, Louisiana, and Mississippi. I'll refer to this entire region as the Southeast. I'll then describe some of the competitive pressures affecting our region along with some implications for state policymakers.\n\nSoutheastern economic perspective\nThe economic diversity of the Southeast provides a unique window on the U.S. economy as a whole. Economic data and anecdotes collected at the state and local levels are vital to informing the Atlanta Fed's monetary policy process at the national level.\n\nThe Atlanta Fed has on staff some 22 Ph.D. economists. They conduct basic research, analyze data from various industries, and use economic models to gain insights. Our teams look at the macroeconomy, financial markets, the regional economy, and international issues.\n\nUnfortunately, most official statistics we collect are retrospective, telling us about what has happened already. For this reason, our regional team also gathers real-time, qualitative information through a grassroots network of contacts across the Southeast. By blending quantitative data with anecdotal reports, we try to grasp current broad economic trends. In our analysis we are always looking for changing dynamics with the main objective of achieving the best outcome for the nation as a whole over the long term.\n\nSome of our economic research is relevant to concerns at the state level. In a few moments, I will touch on one aspect of this body of research from the Atlanta Fed.\n\nFirst, some background: The Atlanta Fed's region is large, both geographically and economically. The population of the six states served by our Reserve Bank is about 45 million, and the region's economic output is around $1.7 trillion. By comparison, the gross domestic product of the nation is about $13 trillion. If the Sixth District were a nation, its economy would rank eighth in the world, between Italy and Canada.\n\nIn many ways, the Sixth District is also a microcosm of the nation overall. Looking at the industry compositions of all 12 Fed districts, our analysis shows that the Atlanta Fed most closely mirrors the nation as a whole.\n\nThe Southeast's economy is diverse and shares many of the same strengths and weaknesses as the United States. Pockets of the region are lagging because of job losses in manufacturing industries such as textiles, apparel, and furniture making. In these industries, the search for lower labor costs has led to offshoring production. As you know, this story of manufacturing job loss is familiar across the country.\n\nFortunately, some of these weaknesses are being offset by growth in higher-wage manufacturing activities. For instance, a highly efficient vehicle assembly and parts manufacturing industry has taken root in our region. In the Sixth District last year there were 119,000 jobs in this industry—a 13 percent increase since 2001. By contrast, auto employment nationally declined over the same period. Because of the presence of newer, efficient facilities, the Southeast has emerged as an important center of motor vehicle and parts manufacturing. New opportunities have emerged in other fields. The Southeast has experienced widespread growth in service industries. For instance, hiring has been strong in health care, education, tourism, and some other professions.\n\nAlong with this economic vitality, the population of the Sixth District has increased. But this growth has not been uniform. Florida and Georgia have both experienced double-digit population growth since 2001. Louisiana and Mississippi have grown more slowly. There are many factors behind these differences, including the impact of devastating hurricanes in 2005.\n\nMigration from other parts of the United States into the Southeast has propelled much of the growth of jobs in the service sector. But another driver is foreign direct investment. The Southeast's proximity to other national markets is one advantage in the competitive race to attract industry and capital from around the world. In fact, almost 700,000 jobs in the Southeast are at nonbank, foreign-owned businesses.\n\nBut attracting investment—foreign or domestic—depends crucially on having a workforce with the right blend of skills. For the remainder of my talk I would like to examine some of the issues shaping the demand for workers.\n\nWorkforce under pressure\nToday's workforce is being transformed by at least two major forces: globalization and technology.\n\nAs I mentioned a moment ago, many jobs have disappeared from the region because they could be done more cheaply overseas. Also, because of technology, there is less and less need for clerks, typists, or computer operators. Pressure on these types of middle-income jobs has added to workforce anxiety—something frequently voiced in public discourse.\n\nThe Southeast has done well in building on historic strengths and developing promising new industries, for instance, biotechnology and medical research, high-end manufacturing, accounting and management services, and computer and network engineering. These are the types of jobs where technology tends to complement performance—adding value instead of acting as a labor substitute.\n\nAs you know, states compete to attract more jobs in these high-paying industries. And I believe states should continue to encourage development of knowledge workers who are best positioned to thrive in today's changing economy.\n\nLet me drill deeper into this thought by summarizing an Atlanta Fed study of labor market outcomes. For this study, staff on our regional economics team took a close look at employment data from the Georgia Department of Labor. Their findings should be of interest to leaders in all states.\n\nIn their research, our staff examined workers employed at businesses providing information technology services during the IT boom of the 1990s. The bulk of these workers came from other parts of the country to work in Georgia. During the IT bust of 2001 and 2002, many of them lost their jobs.\n\nBut the vast majority of those IT workers stayed in Georgia and regained employment relatively quickly. Why? In large part I believe it was because these workers had skills that were transferable to other local industries.\n\nEven though many IT firms downsized or folded, businesses that use IT on a day-to-day basis still needed workers with IT skills. For instance, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta employs many IT staff even though our main business is not providing technology services.\n\nContrast this with the line workers in manufacturing or construction. These individuals tend to have skills that are specific to the industry in which they work. For instance, when an apparel plant closes, the total demand for sewing machine operators also declines. The absence of alternative uses for their skills means that these workers are more likely to experience extended spells of joblessness or be forced to relocate.\n\nImplications for regional policymakers\nWhat are the lessons from this research for us here today? For one thing, this research suggests that workers with skills that are transferable across industries are personally more resilient. In other words, they are better prepared for industry-specific shocks than workers who rely on industry-specific skills.\n\nIt may be more accurate to think of transferable skills as transferable aptitudes—aptitudes for learning new specific skills. Much of the literature on transferable skills cites very general areas such as communications skills, organization and planning skills, and interpersonal skills.\n\nThe first concern of job-creating businesses is availability and aptitude. Businesses want a potential pool of employees that can learn job-specific skills at the global standards of, one, fast and, two, perfect (or zero defects).\n\nA \"foundation aptitude,\" so to speak, is the ability to learn. For many in our workforce this aptitude is best fostered by solid K-12 programs supplemented by institutions of adult education and retooling. These institutions include technical and vocational schools and community colleges.\n\nIn the diverse Southeast economy—with the pressure of globalization and technological change—the required skill set will change constantly. We hear often that a person who will spend 40 years in the labor force may have not only multiple jobs but also three or four distinct careers. For many, personal retooling is not just a choice—it's a matter of survival.\n\nFortunately, state leaders are well positioned to ease this sometimes painful process by investing in programs to foster worker retooling. How can states encourage development of workers with high aptitude and, therefore, help provide a highly adaptable workforce?\n\nIn my view, those involved in promoting economic development at the state level should apply policies aimed at achieving a resilient workforce characterized by well-developed vocational aptitudes built on foundation skills, especially a capacity to learn new things throughout a career.\n\nI believe states are on the right track when they invest in programs that stress \"foundation skills\" such as applied mathematics and reading comprehension.\n\nCertainly, these issues of workforce resilience are top of mind as we confront the challenges of a rapidly changing economy. I began my remarks with a positive picture of a Southeastern economy that is representative of the nation as a whole. The region and the nation are highly engaged with the world economy. I believe this global integration on balance has been positive and is likely to intensify in the future. As competitive pressures mount, the Southeast should continue to thrive as long as workers adapt to an economy that places a premium value on education and knowledge.",

            "content": "Kiwanis Club of Atlanta\nLoudermilk Center\nAtlanta, Ga.\nAugust 22, 2006\n\nThank you for the nice introduction.  But let me say that it feels strange to hear you describe my upcoming retirement.  I guess I’m still coping with the reality that my 42-year tenure at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta is about to end.\n\nWhen I graduated from Virginia Tech back in the mid 1960s, I surprised my family and friends by taking a job with the Atlanta Fed.  Before I left, some of my classmates responded with a gag gift: a green eyeshade, like one of those visors tellers used to wear in old movies like “It’s a Wonderful Life.”\n\nMany of my college friends were going into more glamorous fields such as aerospace or computer design.  And in their minds, I was condemned to life in a stodgy, backwater industry.  In that era it was thought you would choose one place to work and stay for your entire career.\n\nBut, as it turned out, the financial services industry and the U.S. economy went through a revolution.  Technology, competition, and a growing demand for information were catalysts for dramatic change.  Certainly, this transformation made my career more interesting, and I expect even more change ahead.\n\nSo, you might ask, “What’s the big deal?” Well, I believe that banking’s shift from a low-tech field without competition into a dynamic industry had a profound impact on our personal and business lives and is a major part of our nation’s economic success.  In describing these changes today, I’d also like to point to some potential concerns for the next generation of policymakers.\n\nChanging how money is used\nLet me begin by talking briefly about what bankers call their “back office operations”—the payment systems that most people take for granted.  In the 1960s, if you peeked inside the Fed or most commercial banks, you would have seen endless bundles of checks and cash being counted and sorted by hand.  As you can imagine, the process was inefficient.\n\nOften, it took three to five days or longer for a check to clear.  During the high interest rate 1970s, folks would use this lag to their advantage through a practice we called “remote disbursement.”\n\nFor instance, oil companies were notorious for writing big checks to pay for Gulf of Mexico oilfield leases, and they used checks drawn on small banks in remote places such as North Dakota.  With interest rates at 15 percent, each day’s delay in payment for a $50 million check was worth about $20,000.  So receivers of these large checks sometimes would buy a plane ticket for a courier to physically take the piece of paper across the country to speed collection.\n\nAs more powerful technology became available we got busy and worked to improve the process.  Not long after I started at the Fed, we realized that one computer-driven check sorter could do the work of 40 or 50 manual processors.  Automated check processing became a classic application for emerging computer technology.  Also, instead of relying solely on trucks, the Fed began to charter airplanes to carry checks long distances overnight.\n\nComputers that made check processing more efficient also enabled new electronic payment systems such as the automated clearinghouse, which facilitates transactions like direct deposit of payroll checks.  During that period, credit cards also became more popular.  With new methods of payment, the whiz kids of the banking industry began to think that a checkless—even a cashless—society was imminent.\n\nBut it was not to be—at least not then.  By speeding the collection of paper checks, the Fed may have delayed conversion to electronics.  Also, regulations allowed banks to demand presentment of a paper check for payment, which also discouraged change.  So many banks and their customers did not enthusiastically embrace new technology.  In 2000 Americans were still writing 42 billion checks.  And with the proliferation of automated teller machines, banks continued to circulate more—not less—cash.\n\nFinally, a few years ago, the volume of check payments began to decline about 4 percent per year—while electronic payments volume started to increase at double-digit rates.  This transition continues as debit cards become more popular and businesses convert more and more check payments to electronic entries at the point of sale.  You may have seen some of those new types of electronic conversions on your own bank statement.\n\nLooking ahead, I believe there will always be a market for cash and checks.  But today’s kids who are now growing up on video games no doubt will prefer the convenience and speed of electronic payments.  As money changes hands in new and faster ways, we face an evolving risk of fraud and identity theft.  So consumers must be vigilant in managing their accounts.  And financial institutions must ensure that their payment systems operate on a solid foundation of trust, which is at the heart of a strong financial system.\n\nThe challenge of competition in banking\nTechnology has changed not only payment, but also the whole financial system and U.S. economy.  Just think of the impact of the Internet and the advance of cellular and digital communications.  This recent progress has helped businesses to work more efficiently and allowed emerging economies around the world to develop more quickly than we ever imagined.  Globalization, by the way, has lessened the cost of many imported goods and boosted demand for U.S.-produced goods and services.\n\nAlong with technology, banking also has been transformed by competition.  When I joined the Fed in the 1960s, banks were subject to rigid controls imposed by the states and Congress during the Great Depression.  The idea was to maintain financial stability by restricting competition—both geographically and along product lines.\n\nThere were strict limits on the interest banks could pay on savings deposits, and banks could not pay interest on transaction accounts.  These restrictions were thought to prevent ruinous interest rate competition.  The task of managing a bank balance sheet was largely a matter of following supervisory guidelines—green eye shade kind of work.\n\nMost states limited banks’ ability to branch outside their home county.  And in some places branching was entirely prohibited.  With near monopoly power in their respective neighborhoods, banks had little incentive to grow or innovate.  Hence, the cliché about bankers’ hours of 3-6-3—take in money from savings accounts at 3 percent, lend it out at 6 percent, and hit the golf course by 3 o’clock.\n\nIn the 1980s, with high and rising inflation, the old regulatory framework began to unravel.  Investment banks posed an early threat to the banking deposit franchise with the introduction of money market accounts, which some of you may remember.\n\nTo compete, banks issued large denomination certificates of deposit, which were not subject to interest rate ceilings, thus significantly increasing their costs.  As restrictions on interest payments were lifted, more and more banks and thrifts got into trouble.  We all remember the crisis in the savings and loan industry, which resulted in a bailout that was estimated to cost $175 billion.\n\nThe most difficult year in banking was 1988 when more than 200 banks failed.  Earlier in that decade, I led our bank’s supervision function.  I remember setting up what we called “the war room” at the Atlanta Fed.  This was a place to deal with the complex closure of a family of banks in Tennessee.  In the final days of that crisis, we worked around the clock to find a buyer for the largest of these banks—unsuccessfully, it turned out.  We ended up just closing the bank and hoping this failure wouldn’t lead to an old-fashioned bank panic.\n\nThe number of bank failures declined in the 1990s and has stayed low.  Meanwhile, Congress continued to reform the regulatory framework.  In turn, we saw the rise of well-capitalized megabanks leveraging technology to cut costs and offering diverse and sometimes complex new products in competition with investment banks and insurance companies.  Now, it’s often hard to tell the difference between banks and nonbanks.\n\nThis competitive fray directly benefits today’s consumers and businesses, who enjoy lower-cost financial services, more choices and better access to capital.  The growth of mutual funds has led to the rise of a new class of investors.  Computers unleashed powerful innovations in credit scoring, and, with those new systems, some borrowers can qualify for a loan in minutes, if not seconds.  Innovations in credit analysis and market segmentation have helped millions of Americans become homeowners.\n\nIf you want to buy a car, you can still get an old-fashioned two-year loan, but today you can also choose to make payments over eight or even 10 years.  Along with traditional fixed-rate mortgages, we now have adjustable rate mortgages, interest-only mortgages, reverse amortization mortgages, and more.  And in today’s financial supermarket, we also can find home equity loans, mutual funds, hedge funds and countless other ways to borrow or invest.  With advances in information technology and mathematical modeling, today’s financial markets are better than ever at allocating risk to those with the greatest appetite for it.\n\nIs all of this competition a good thing? All in all, I’d say the answer is yes.  However, sometimes I fret about some of the implications of our global connectedness and the sheer size of some financial institutions and their new products.  And I worry that some homeowners don’t really understand their new and not-yet-fully-tested mortgages.\n\nOverall, however, I believe our economy is much stronger and more resilient today because of the creative adjustments our financial sector has made in response to the sometimes painful challenges of competition.\n\nThe economy in transition\nWhat are the lessons of technology, innovation and competition for our economy?  During the mid-1960s, one-third of the jobs in the United States were in manufacturing, and during the decades after World War II, there was not much global competition.\n\nNow, only one in nine U.S. jobs is in manufacturing, and most of the new factory jobs require technical skills.  The fastest growing fields—financial services included—depend on knowledge, not physical labor.\n\nWe’ve all heard the sometimes bitter debate on outsourcing and immigration.  However, our ports and logistics facilities overflow with low-cost goods from overseas.  Imports and exports—added up—are now equivalent to about one-fourth of gross domestic product.  That figure 40 years ago was about 10 percent.  Today’s economy is truly global.\n\nWe’re all aware of our current preoccupation with lost jobs to other parts of the world, both in manufacturing and the services sector.  But looking at the data, you’ll see three important facts.  First, the majority of jobs lost involve relatively low-skilled, low-productivity work in fields like apparel production and call centers.  Second, with respect to manufacturing, while it’s true there are fewer factory jobs as a proportion of total U.S. employment, the U.S. share of the value of world manufacturing output has remained stable, reflecting increases in worker productivity.  Third, while it’s true that certain service-oriented jobs have moved to other countries, we still export more services to the rest of the world than we import from others.\n\nWhat’s the bottom line of these changes in our economy?  The march of globalization is relentless, and businesses will have to keep spending more on technology to improve productivity.  Technology allows consumers and businesses to compare prices from vendors around the world and find new and less expensive sources.  And innovations in supply-chain management reduce the inventory swings that used to be commonplace in our economy, helping to dampen the contribution of inventory adjustments to economic cycles.\n\nPainful lessons in monetary policy\nGood economic outcomes depend on good monetary policy, where I’ve spent the past 10 years of my career.  Recent experience in this area offers several other lessons.\n\nIn the 1960s, economic growth was strong in part because of the fiscal stimulus of tax cuts and increased military and social spending.  The Fed’s policy of leaning against inflationary pressures attracted little attention.  But in the 1970s, policymakers tried to insulate the economy from relative price movements in one important commodity—oil.  The big mistake in this policy was the failure to recognize that controlling inflation was a necessary first requirement for sustaining long-term growth.\n\nAfter the 1970s oil price shocks, it became fashionable to embrace the false notion that one could improve economic outcomes by trading a bit of inflation for growth.  As we should now know, a bit of inflation can get out of hand quickly, especially when consumers and businesses expect more price increases, waste time and effort trying to beat inflation, and then rush to spend more money in a vicious inflationary cycle.  The consequences of high inflation were and remain economically poisonous: increased uncertainty and risk, the added incentive to consume instead of invest, cost of living adjustments, and other marketplace distortions.\n\nDuring the early 1980s, Fed Chairman Paul Volcker and his Fed colleagues broke the back of high inflation by raising interest rates well into double digits.  The costs were huge—both in economic and human terms.  The U.S. economy endured two painful recessions.  And along with the run-up in bank failures that I just mentioned, entire industries such as homebuilding collapsed.   Because of our tough policy, the Fed was suddenly thrust into the public limelight.\n\nBy 1996, when I became Atlanta Fed president and part of the Fed policymaking group, inflation expectations were, once again, under control.  About that time, the federal budget deficits were reined in.  With the fortuitous convergence of low inflation and rapid growth, we enjoyed the longest economic expansion in U.S. history.  In hindsight, I may have been naïve, but I thought that Americans had truly learned the value of responsible fiscal and monetary policy working in tandem to foster economic growth for the long-term.\n\nThe last decade, under the leadership of former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, also brought about major changes in how the Federal Reserve communicates our monetary policy actions and thinking.  This transparency was and still is consistent with greater public scrutiny of the Fed and parallels the increase of financial information in the private sector that is central to today’s market-based approach to regulation.\n\nAs amazing as it may sound today, until 1994, there was no announcement about the direction of monetary policy—not even after Federal Open Market Committee meetings.  Market participants had to divine whether or not rates had changed by looking at conditions in money markets.  This “quiet” (or silent) approach to communications gave rise to a cottage industry of “Fed watchers” who were devoted to interpreting our policy actions and likely policy direction.\n\nNow, after each FOMC meeting, we not only announce our action but also provide brief comments on the economy and potential risks to the outlook.  For the last three years, we have even tried to signal the likely path of policy—in my view, an approach that’s worked well during this particular period.\n\nOur new Fed Chairman, Ben Bernanke, has talked about the need to make our policy goals even clearer.  Minutes of our recent FOMC meetings indicate that the Fed is studying and debating the limits to what we should say about the outlook and possible future policy actions.  My Fed colleagues and I have found that market reactions to our Fed comments can be surprising.  And, in an environment of seemingly endless data reports, it’s sometimes hard in the short run to distinguish meaningful economic signals from noise.\n\nThis thinking about transparency will evolve.  And I expect the Fed will keep trying new and different ways to communicate important views and actions, including perhaps establishing targets for acceptable levels of inflation.  Clearly, more central bank communications are helpful, but there is ample room to debate how to reflect the range of views and uncertainties that are inherent in the policymaking process.\n\nAn interconnected world\nWhile I’ve tried to make the case that our financial system and economy have gone through revolutionary changes in the past 40 years, I want to leave you with the notion that things will keep getting more complex and more interesting.\n\nFrom a payments perspective, our vision of an efficient, predominately electronic system is in sight.  There will be fewer and bigger banks, and competition will keep altering our financial marketplace.  We will all face more potential risks and rewards as the selection of financial products continues to multiply.\n\nOur financial system and our economy will continue to become more interconnected.  Every moment of every day, vast sums of money zip around the world.  Nine years ago a financial panic in Asia quickly led to financial market repercussions around the world.  And with the emergence of China and India and increasing U.S. indebtedness, the global flow of funds will continue to grow, and our economy will depend more and more on events and decisions that occur outside our national borders.\n\nMonetary policymakers must continue to account for all of these changes and others we can’t envision as technology advances and shocks occur.  We’ve been reminded over and over how adaptable and resilient our U.S. financial system and economy are, and no doubt we’ll be tested again.  I’m leaving the FOMC confident in the Fed’s commitment to keep inflation at bay.  I’m sure future policymakers will remember the lessons we learned in the past 40 years about what happens when you start down the slippery slope of trading inflation for growth.\n\nI wish my college buddies who gave me the green eye shade were here with us today.  Contrary to what they might have expected, my experience as a central banker has been fascinating and, at times, downright exciting.\n\nFor a long time, I’ve enjoyed an up close and personal view on banking and the economy, and pretty soon I’ll be watching from the bleachers.  Looking ahead to the next four decades, I think we all have good reason to expect our financial system and our economy will remain strong and continue to be the envy of the rest of the world.",

            "content": "It’s nice to be invited back here.  I last spoke to your group in April 2001, and at that time I focused my remarks on the sudden decline in economic growth we were seeing, a slowdown that turned out to be our last recession.  Now, five years later, we’re moving into the fourth year of an economic expansion.  As policymakers and business and community leaders, we’re all continuing to try to evaluate the economic forces that are currently at work and what they may suggest for both the local and national economies as well as for monetary policy over the period ahead.\n\nMy guess is you’re looking for me to offer my view of the U.S. economic outlook and how monetary policy might be expected to respond.  Over the next few minutes, I will take some time to provide you with my thoughts on those issues.  But I also want to devote part of my remarks to housing, which has been an important driver of economic activity during and after the last recession.  I know many of you in this room have a stake in the housing business, and the subject is especially important and fascinating to many of us here in the Atlanta area, where we’ve seen so much population growth and new home construction.\n\nRecent economic experience\n  Housing, of course, depends very much on underlying economic and demographic \n  fundamentals. So let me begin by providing you with a look at the current economic \n  climate. Some of us may fondly remember the 1990s, a decade that brought us \n  the longest economic expansion in U.S. history. Between 1993 and 2000, the U.S. \n  economy created an average of nearly 3 million jobs per year. And our broadest \n  measure of economic activity, gross domestic product (GDP), grew at an annual \n  rate of more than 3½ percent during that seven-year period.\n\nSince the economic downturn in 2001, we’ve been through terrorist attacks, two wars, and rising energy prices.  Yet, even with these and other economic shocks, it’s easy to overlook that our recent economic performance compares well to the late 1990s.  Since 2003, we’ve had average GDP growth of about 3¾ percent, and our expansion is getting support from almost all economic sectors.  Since job growth turned positive in late 2003, the U.S. economy has added nearly 5 million jobs.\n\nOver the past three years, consumer spending has been very strong.  Business profits have grown on average 16 percent per year, and spending on equipment and software has averaged about 11 percent.  Government spending also has contributed to growth.  I don’t want to spend time today discussing our nation’s federal deficit, but the long-term outlook for government spending is, in my view, worrisome.  Finally, residential investment between 2003 and 2005 was exceptionally strong.\n\nBut even as I think good growth will likely continue, I think it’s also \n  reasonable to expect adjustments in some sectors. In the first quarter of this \n  year, you’ll recall we had GDP growth of almost 5½ percent. After our May \n  10, 2006, Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, we issued a statement \n  that anticipated \"growth as likely to moderate to a more sustainable pace.\" \n  Personally, I agree with that consensus outlook, and I think the new data suggests \n  we are beginning to see the expected moderation.\n\nPart of this moderation in growth is coming from some easing in the extraordinary \n  pace of home construction, sales, and price appreciation—a development \n  we’ve been expecting for some time. Don’t get me wrong. I do not expect \n  a sharp residential real estate correction, but I believe we should recognize \n  that a slowdown in housing activity is very likely—and may have begun already.\n\nFactors behind the housing boom\nWe’re fortunate to live in a country with a housing stock that offers great selection and affordability.  The rate of homeownership in this country has climbed toward 70 percent—near-record levels.  For most of us, our home is our most valuable asset.  In a certain sense, housing is part of our economic DNA.\n\nAs I suggested a moment ago, the demand for housing depends on underlying demographic \n  trends and the overall economic climate. For the past 15 years, the sale of \n  new homes has climbed steadily. Since 2000, residential investment increased \n  at an average annualized quarterly growth rate of 5½ percent and increased slightly \n  even during the 2001 recession.\n\nClearly, a major contributor to increased housing activity in recent years has been the low cost of mortgage credit, which is influenced by the fed funds target rate.  From 2002 to 2004, the Fed kept short-term interest rates very low, at or just above 1 percent.  But even after the FOMC began raising short-term rates two years ago, mortgage rates stayed low and are still less than 7 percent, which by historical standards is relatively low.\n\nIn addition to the attractiveness of interest rates, the financial services industry in the past decade has introduced a wide range of new mortgage options with the potential to increase buying power.  For instance, we’ve seen the emergence of high loan-to-value mortgages, subprime mortgages, interest-only mortgages, pay-option mortgages, and most recently 40-year and even 50-year mortgages.  These so-called affordability products allow borrowers to qualify for a first home or a more expensive home they couldn’t have otherwise purchased.\n\nDemographics also have played a big role in the patterns of recent home purchases.  Recently, the oldest of some 70 million baby boomers began to reach retirement age—a trend that’s no doubt boosted the demand for second homes.  The market for vacation homes on the waterfront has been especially active.  To illustrate the dimensions of the second-home phenomenon, in 2000 about 7 to 8 percent of mortgage-financed home purchases were not owner-occupied.  In 2004, the percent of non-owner-occupied homes purchased and financed (including investment and vacation homes) had more than doubled to almost 16 percent of all home sales.\n\nIncluded in the non-owner-occupied homes data I just gave you are a large number of investment purchases, as many investors who left the stock market after its adjustment a few years ago turned to real estate as a vehicle for greater appreciation.  I suspect some of you in this room have bought condos or vacation properties strictly as investments, counting on strong price appreciation to provide you the opportunity to “flip” the properties for a nice gain.  For many seasoned and novice investors alike, that approach for the past few years has been profitable.\n\nNationally, home prices appreciated 13 percent in 2005, and that strong performance \n  followed a similar rate of growth in 2004. Going back a bit further, national \n  home price appreciation from 2000 to 2003 each year averaged about 7½ percent, \n  better than in the 1990s. By most any measure—price appreciation, home \n  sales, construction, you name it—2005 was a great year for housing.\n\nImplications of an adjustment in housing\nSo, now that we’re in the fifth year of a housing boom, can we expect this extraordinary performance to continue?  In my view, probably not.  And I say that because what we’ve been experiencing was driven by a confluence of the special circumstances that I described earlier.\n\nAlong with somewhat higher mortgage rates, the inventory of unsold new single-family homes has increased steadily to nearly six months at current sales rates.  Recently, I’ve heard reports of investors dumping properties for which they had contracted but not yet closed, especially in some coastal markets that were so attractive for many years.  And I’ve heard more stories of potential buyers “waiting out” sellers because they believe prices are likely to keep falling.   All of these developments have contributed to a slowing of house price appreciation—depending of course on the location.\n\nIn my 42 years at the Fed, I’ve seen a few real estate cycles, and I’m sure others here remember some of those ups and downs in the housing market.  Having lived through those times, I can point to some concerns that I believe warrant attention.\n\nFor instance, the mortgage credit innovations that have made homes more affordable \n  to buyers, at least, in the short run, have not been fully tested in a period \n  of rising interest rates and a moderating economy. I suspect—based on what \n  I’ve heard from anecdotal reports—that lenders and borrowers have \n  not always asked all the “what if” questions that are basic to risk \n  management. It’s quite likely that some borrowers will have a hard time \n  handling their payments in different circumstances. To underscore these concerns, \n  the banking regulators, including the Fed, has circulated “Interagency \n  Guidance on Nontraditional Mortgage Products” to remind bank lenders of \n  these risks.\n\nAnd there are the housing speculators. It’s probably fair to assume that \n  many of those speculators include high-wealth individuals who can afford the \n  risk of potential price adjustment. But other less sophisticated investors may \n  get stuck with properties they can’t sell for a decent profit or even have \n  to unload at a loss. Those investors who may never have intended to close on \n  their purchases may have to walk away from deposits for properties in developments \n  that only a few months ago appeared to be “nearly sold out.” In hindsight, \n  some speculators may wish they had paid closer heed to some pretty obvious warning \n  signs such as the emergence of Web sites designed strictly for “condo flippers.”\n\nFinally, and in some ways most basically, there’s the still unanswered question of how developers, builders, and lenders will respond to an adjustment in housing activity—if, in fact, that’s what is under way.  I remember a longtime Fed policymaker—a veteran observer of housing cycles—used to describe the housing industry as a big group of independent thinkers.  Regardless of the warning signs, he observed that each developer, builder, or lender would decide there’s room enough for one more project—his or her project, of course.  At the same time, dozens of others in the same business in the same markets were making the same decisions.  I tell this story not because I feel qualified to offer advice on how to run a residential development business but rather as commentary on how our market economy works.\n\nI don’t pretend for one minute to be able to judge the condition of your individual housing markets—nor do I know what special factors will influence future housing activity in each area.  Instead, I’m closely watching the larger housing market across our region and nation with the goal of understanding how developments in the residential business shape the larger economy and Fed policy.\n\nAnd let me say that on a macro level I believe the housing adjustment most likely will be orderly and with a limited impact on the overall economy.  I say this for a number of reasons.  For one thing, depository institutions in the United States are well capitalized and hence well positioned to absorb any housing lending losses they may incur.  Also, it’s worth mentioning recent changes with respect to capital markets and mortgage finance.  More and more of the credit- and interest-rate-related risks associated with mortgage finance can be easily traded and have gravitated to those institutions best positioned to manage the risks.  Today more than half of the nation’s $9 trillion in mortgage debt outstanding is securitized.\n\nIt’s also true that many jobs depend on home-related construction and mortgage businesses, and important industries in our regional economy such as durable goods and carpet production also rely on housing construction.  But even if there were no growth in housing construction, the level is high enough now to support strong ongoing demand for home products and related goods.  Furthermore, consumers will continue to remodel existing homes and replace worn-out appliances and furniture.  Looking at the broader context of our diverse and dynamic economy, direct residential investment is only about 6 percent of GDP.\n\nFinally, a slowdown in house price appreciation could affect consumer spending.  For example, higher interest rates have deterred refinancing and extraction of home equity for other spending.  For several years during the era of low interest rates, cash-strapped consumers used their homes like ATMs.  But, as home price escalation slows, consumers can be expected to feel less confident about gains in wealth and may well begin to feel inclined to save more and spend less.  These indirect effects of a housing slowdown are embedded in my forecast of some slowing in the growth of consumer spending.\n\nEvaluating monetary policy\n  With that digression on the housing business, let me return to my own beat—monetary \n  policy. I was trained as industrial engineer, and I spent some of my early years \n  working to develop banking technology. That was a pretty straightforward business \n  where you could often use formulas to get very specific answers to key questions. \n  But with monetary policy making, I find that answers are more often in shades \n  of gray instead of black and white. When it comes to monetary policy, uncertainty \n  and forecast “error bands” are a fact of our business.\n\nCongress has given the Fed a so-called dual mandate—to use monetary policy to help achieve sustainable growth but also to help achieve price stability, another term for low and steady inflation.  As policymakers, we make our best forecast of growth and inflation over the coming quarters, then choose a fed funds setting that we think is most likely to nudge the economy in the desired direction, with the realization that our policy actions impact the economy with a lag.  As my earlier discussion would suggest, we are shooting at a moving target as various new developments affect the economy in different ways.\n\nI have already talked about some factors—including a housing adjustment—that are likely to contribute to the moderation in the rate of growth we expect.  I have not yet talked about the outlook for our second objective: inflation.  There are many factors at any time that work either to hold down price pressures or add to the inflation risks we’ve noted in recent FOMC statements.\n\nHeadline measures of inflation of late have been bothersome, with higher oil prices contributing to much of the run-up in those broad readings.  Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, has moved into the upper end of—or beyond—the range I consider acceptable over time.  Global competitive forces and good U.S. productivity growth should help to ease further upward movement in inflation, and we may get some relief from stabilizing or possibly falling energy prices over time.\n\nStill, I view current inflation risks to be elevated for three reasons.  First, we have been expecting and have not yet seen secondary pass-through of energy prices to core inflation.  Secondly, some key components of core inflation such as services have been moving at rates that warrant continued concern.  Finally, some measures of inflation expectations recently have edged upward.\n\nIf we’re on target with our present forecast for growth to moderate to \n  a sustainable pace and for inflation to fall back within acceptable bounds, \n  I would say that monetary policy is now close to where it should be. But, as \n  I have already suggested, the FOMC’s job is to continue to update that \n  outlook as we get new data and anecdotal information. So we have to remain open \n  to rethinking our policy setting as that outlook changes. One of the challenges \n  of this process is interpreting new data and distinguishing between transitory \n  factors—or, in other words, “noise”—and the more significant \n  underlying trends.\n\nOn June 28, I will be among the 19 members of the FOMC, including Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, who will gather around the table in Washington to consider what we’ve learned since our last FOMC meeting.  During our discussions, we take account of the analysis by our respective teams of professional economists, and we will exchange anecdotal information gathered from business and community contacts around the country.  After taking account of new information and adjusting our forecasts if that is called for, we will vote on how to set our fed funds target rate to match that updated outlook.\n\nPutting it all together\nIn summary, I have tried to paint a picture of an economy that has performed quite well over the last four years, and one that I expect will continue to grow while moderating to a more sustainable pace.  And I have tried to get you to think with me about the particular contribution of housing to recent economic growth, and the adjustment that may be taking place as this economic expansion continues.\n\nDuring the past five years since I last spoke here, our economy has been tested on numerous occasions.  No one can predict the surprises the next five years will bring.  But we should remember that our economy had demonstrated amazing resilience.  Today—even with the inevitable adjustments we face—the economy is on a solid footing, and the Fed remains committed to its mission to foster an economic climate where inflation and inflation expectations are low and stable.",

            "content": "Wildhorse Saloon\nNashville, Tenn.\nMay 1, 2006\n\nIt’s a pleasure to be back in Nashville.  The last time I spoke here, my colleagues gave me a pretty rough time about speaking at some place called the Wildhorse Saloon.  Who knows what they imagined about this audience?  But I assured them I was honoring a request to speak to the top business and civic leaders of Nashville, which of course was and still is the case.\n\nAnd let me add that Paula Lovell has been a terrific representative of your community in her work with us at the Atlanta Fed.  For more than 10 and a half years serving on both the Nashville and Atlanta boards and as our 2003 chairman of the Atlanta board, she brought us invaluable grassroots insights on the local and national economies.  Her perspective—and the views from other business and community leaders who serve as Fed directors across the country—are vital to our monetary policymaking process.  So, Paula, thank you again for all the time you spent with us.\n\nIt’s been four years since I spoke to your group, and over that time, our economy has seen pretty dramatic changes—and challenges.  My intent today is to not only describe an economy that continues to show solid growth and momentum but also to talk about some of the uncertainties and risks that all of us—as business leaders and policymakers—need to follow and understand.\n\nEconomic activity strong\nJust last Friday, we got our first official measure of overall economic activity in the first quarter of this year.  The advance estimate of gross domestic product (GDP), which is our broadest and most familiar measure of economic output, came in at 4.8 percent.  That strong reading confirms our sense that the weakness in GDP growth in the last quarter of 2005 was not a turning point.  As it turned out, slowdowns in auto sales and government spending and some loss of activity following Hurricane Katrina were just temporary factors.\n\nIn evaluating the path of the U.S. economy, it’s more telling to realize that we are now in the fifth year of this economic expansion, with annual GDP growth averaging close to 4 percent over the past three years.  In fact today’s performance compares favorably to the long expansion of the 1990s.\n\nWhile it’s always helpful to reflect on the past, it’s more important—and challenging—to look ahead to the rest of 2006 and beyond.  In my remarks to other groups over the last few months, I have said that I expect the period ahead to bring us continued solid growth and favorable inflation experience.  And that’s still my outlook.  But, as I indicated earlier, there are some significant uncertainties that could shape our economic outlook and help to inform how Fed policy should evolve.\n\nLet me elaborate.  I like to begin my analysis of the economy with a look at consumer and household spending, which represents about two-thirds of GDP.  Consumer spending has grown steadily and was strong again for the first quarter of this year.  And this performance was achieved in spite of somewhat higher interest rates and the drag from higher energy prices—a point I’ll return to in a moment.  But these headwinds were buffered by strong growth in employment and personal income, which has helped to bolster consumer spending.\n\nDuring the first quarter, the monthly average for new job creation was nearly 200,000.  That rate of hiring is strong and follows nearly 4½ million new jobs created in 2004 and 2005.  The unemployment rate in March declined to 4.7 percent, a relatively low level by historical standards.  And recent unemployment claims data and surveys of business hiring plans suggest good job growth should continue.  In contrast to a few years ago, when people were concerned about a jobless recovery, some employers are now having a hard time filling many skilled jobs.\n\nThere are other important contributors to growth, such as business spending.  While this category accounts for only about 10 percent of GDP, it serves as an important contributor to both gains in productivity and employment.  You’ll recall the collapse of business spending was a big factor in the 2001 recession.  But in recent years business spending has been strong and after a bit of a lull late last year recovered in the first quarter of this year with a gain of more than 14 percent.  Growth in new orders for durable goods this year has been especially notable.\n\nIn today’s climate of strong aggregate demand and worldwide growth, businesses have not only the will but also the means to finance aggressive capital spending.  Corporate profits increased more than 16 percent in 2005, following gains during the prior year of more than 12 percent.  Also, financial markets are still relatively accommodative—despite some recent upward movement in longer-term interest rates—so the business climate is very supportive for capital spending.\n\nEvaluating uncertainties, including housing\n  While the outlook is favorable, I want to point out several risks that could \n  materially affect how the economy evolves. For the next few moments, I’d \n  like to talk about some of these risks, starting with the much-anticipated adjustments \n  in residential real estate.\n\nLast year was a record one for housing construction, sales, and price appreciation.  In fact, for the past few years, housing activity has been supported by low mortgage rates, job growth, and strong demand.  But in recent months, there is growing evidence of a cooling in many housing markets across the country.\n\nIn some of the hottest coastal markets in the Southeast, I’ve heard of sharp adjustments and sudden reversals of the frenzied speculation we saw earlier, with prices falling sharply in some of those markets.  Some projects have been canceled, and I’ve heard more reports of standoffs between buyers and sellers as buyers wait for prices to adjust further.\n\nClearly, higher mortgage rates, while still historically low, have muted housing activity.  In most markets, home sales are still relatively strong, but not strong enough to keep pace with properties coming on the market.  So the inventory of unsold homes has climbed steadily to about 5½ months’ supply at the current sales pace.\n\nLooking ahead, continued job growth and underlying demographics suggest the underpinning for housing over the longer term is solid.  But the market is changing, and the impact of the housing adjustment on overall economic activity is not yet fully evident.  Some slowdown in housing is built into almost everyone’s forecast.  But housing could turn out—once again—to be more resilient than expected, or the adjustment could turn out to be more extensive than anticipated.\n\nWhat’s also vexing for observers of housing is that longer-term interest rates have not responded to steady increases in short-term rates the way they have in the past.  A number of explanations have been offered for the nontraditional behavior of short- vs. long-term interest rates, but it is yet to be seen whether this worldwide development will persist.\n\nI can’t help but recall other unusual developments a few years ago that were described as a \"new economy,\" suggesting some fundamental economic principles had changed permanently.  In hindsight, we now know that historical relationships prevailed.  I won’t venture to predict the ultimate resolution of the short-term/long-term interest rate conundrum, but my staff is continuing to research the economic implications of a return to more familiar patterns with higher long-term interest rates.\n\nAdjusting to energy costs\nSince we’re on the subject of uncertainties, let me also share my thoughts on energy prices.  The last time I was here, four years ago, oil cost about $20 a barrel.  In fact, despite volatility in energy prices, we used to think that oil would settle back over time to around $25–$30 a barrel.\n\nBut our experience for the past two years has changed that expectation, at least in the view of futures markets.  With oil prices persistently above $70 a barrel, households and businesses face new costs that must be absorbed, offset, or passed along if possible.  Although difficult to measure, these higher energy costs have forced households to reallocate spending and could dampen consumer spending in the future.\n\nAt the same time, because of elevated energy prices, businesses face intense pressure to cut their other costs, raise prices, or both, depending on the circumstances.  While energy is increasingly cited as a justification for price increases, many businesses—especially goods producers—can’t or won’t pass along higher costs.  In part, that’s because global competition helps keep prices down and thus induces businesses to improve efficiency to maintain profits.  The result is higher productivity, which helps to offset increased costs, including energy.\n\nManufacturing and globalization\nThis trend is quite evident in manufacturing, which as you know is an important sector in middle Tennessee with the auto industry nearby.  Much has been written about the supposed demise of U.S. factories.  Yes, we have lost some four million manufacturing jobs in the past 15 years, and many of those lower-skilled jobs have moved overseas.\n\nPeople are quick to blame globalization for painful adjustments in nondurable manufacturing industries such as apparel, where overseas makers have the advantage of lower labor costs.  But you may find it surprising that, even with many factories shedding low-skilled jobs, manufacturing output in the United States is growing at about the same pace as the overall economy—even faster for makers of information technology equipment, aircraft, and other high-quality durables where skilled labor and technology are a necessary part of the process.\n\nIn fact, the United States remains the largest producer of manufactured goods in the world—bigger than even China or Japan.  And the total employment in manufacturing is still an important part of the U.S. employment base, with some 14 million workers still employed in manufacturing, or about 13 percent of the total work force.  Even as less-productive manufacturing jobs go away, the total wage bill in manufacturing is increasing as managers bid up wages for high-quality, technically skilled workers.\n\nKeeping an eye on inflation\n\tBidding up wages prompts me to consider another factor that’s critical for our central bank mission.  As monetary policymakers, our challenge is twofold: to provide a climate that is conducive to sustainable GDP growth and to create a financial environment that should sustain low and stable prices.\n\nOver the years, we’ve learned hard and painful lessons—both in the United States and elsewhere—about the disruptive and destabilizing nature of rising and unstable inflation.  Even more insidious at times has been the emergence of expectations of rising inflation, which leads to all sorts of irrational and unproductive marketplace decisions.  Some of you with gray hair like mine may recall the high inflation of the 1970s and the double-digit mortgage rates many of us carried.\n\nTrust me, we don’t want to go there again—and the Fed is firmly committed to resisting unwelcome rises in inflation.  My colleagues and I place a very high value on Fed credibility in the fight against inflation, which was earned through steadfast actions to ensure price stability.  Part of our job is to adjust monetary policy as needed to achieve that objective and to explain our actions in ways that inspire public confidence in our determination to lean against conditions that could lead to the increase of inflation expectations.\n\nLet’s talk about our recent inflation experience.  For the first three months of 2006, the familiar and frequently cited consumer price index (CPI) has increased at an annual rate of 4.3 percent.  This number includes food and energy prices and is a significant increase from 2005 CPI growth of 3.4 percent.  As I said earlier, a major factor in this unwelcome rise in overall inflation is, of course, energy, which has a direct bearing on the price of gasoline and natural gas, among other vital commodity inputs.\n\nThe core measures of inflation, excluding food and energy, have been less volatile.  Core CPI was 2.8 percent for the first three months of 2006, and another measure we often use, core personal consumption expenditures, or core PCE, was about 2 percent measured on a year-over-year basis.  On the other hand, three- and six-month measures have edged up recently.  While these measures are still relatively low, I don’t want to see inflation move measurably higher.\n\nLately, my staff and I have pored through reams of data and talked to many business contacts to try to determine the extent of energy cost pass-through.  We’re finding the impact on transportation costs is large, and the spillover effect of higher energy costs affects various industries in different ways.\n\nFor instance, as I mentioned earlier, most goods producers have found offsets for energy price increases.  Productivity improvements have been less of a factor for service providers, such as accountants or medical professionals, and so price increases have shown through more in the services sector than in the goods sector.\n\nWhile there’s every reason to believe that competitive pressures will remain a major factor in the global marketplace, we don’t know how long and how extensively these forces will continue to mute overall price increases.\n\nConsidering monetary policy\n\tI want to spend my last few minutes giving you my personal thoughts on the question, What’s the likely path for future Fed policy?  As you know, the Fed has been steadily raising short-term interest rates since June 2004.  Over this nearly two-year period, there have been 15 rate increases, taking the Fed funds target rate to its current 4¾ percent.  We have been able to stay on this steady and well-anticipated policy path as the economy has maintained momentum.\n\nWith demand increasing for several years, recent surveys suggest that wage gains are now becoming more widespread.  While I think it’s important to watch for cost pressures from wages, I’m not among those who subscribe to the theory that a certain level of low unemployment triggers an outbreak of wage-induced inflation.  In fact, our experience from the 1990s and more recently tells us that there’s little if any measurable correlation between tight labor markets and inflation.\n\nWhen calibrating monetary policy, the Fed takes account of various risks to its baseline forecasts.  Over the period ahead, as the full effects of the sequence of monetary policy moves plays out, I expect that output growth will settle on a path that is somewhat below what we saw in the first quarter of this year, probably growing at close to the economy’s potential.  I believe that monetary policy adjustments that have already been made, along with other factors such as continuing productivity improvements, should also help to contain elevated inflation pressures.\n\nIf—and I emphasize if—my most likely forecast of sustainable output growth and modest inflation is right, then I am of the view that we are very close to having Fed policy properly calibrated for now.  At the same time, we are at a point that requires careful analysis of new economic data, especially data that might signal an uptick of inflation or increase in inflation expectations that would affect our projections for the likely course for the economy.  And I will also give particular weight to the forward-looking anecdotal information we get from our many contacts—the Paula Lovells of the world, who help to keep us in touch with the real world of business decisions.\n\nDuring the last four years, our economy has evolved in unexpected ways and has been more stable than some might have predicted.  I expect the next four years will be no less fascinating.  One of the lessons we’ve learned—or at least relearned—is that surprises are inevitable.  We can’t know the shock of the next hurricane, terrorist attack, or political crisis in an oil-producing region.  Layered on top of these potential shocks are the risks I’ve just described: potential adjustments in housing, unknown consequences of high and volatile energy prices, and unprecedented global capital flows, among other uncertainties.  Given the wide range of possibilities ahead, I believe this is not a time for the Fed to precommit to a particular course of policy.\n\nBut the U.S. economy is flexible and resilient, and most of what we know suggests the outlook is positive.  So today I believe that growth is on track.  And furthermore I know—and I hope you know—that the Fed is committed to keeping inflation and inflation expectations anchored for the long term.",

            "content": "Atlanta History Center\nAtlanta, Georgia\nMarch 15, 2006\n\nIt’s a pleasure to be here this evening for the opening of “Old Money, New Money: The Rise of Southern Capitalism.” First, let me say that I’m delighted that the Atlanta Fed is working with the Atlanta History Center to tell the story of money from a Southern perspective.\n\nWe’ve all heard references to “old money” and “new money,” but in my experience people have a profound emotional connection to any kind of money that’s best summed up in the overused movie line, “Show me the money.” In fact, I can tell you that folks get pretty excited touring the Money Museum at our Fed office in Midtown, where you can see things like an uncut sheet of $100,000 bills (never in circulation), a solid gold bar, and millions of dollars in cold, hard cash. Unless I miss my guess, Atlanta History Center visitors will appreciate the hard work and energy that have gone into the fascinating new exhibit we’re celebrating here tonight.\n\nReflecting on your theme of money and Southern capitalism, our region has undergone a dramatic evolution from a mostly agrarian economy to a low-wage manufacturing economy and then into today’s multidimensional mix of businesses that generally mirrors the broader U.S. economy. This evening, I thought I would try to add some context to this exhibit by offering my own view on the current national economic outlook and the implications for monetary policy. I expect many of you may share my sense that—despite a lot of positives that I want to talk about—our economy is going through a very turbulent time. I’m going to suggest that some of that turbulence is related to the forces of globalization—powerful but not fully understood developments that are reshaping our economy in ways that are both exciting and sometimes unsettling.\n\nFirst, I’d like to begin with an overview of the current economy. Right now, the United States is in the fourth year of a solid and sustained economic expansion. Until the fourth quarter of 2005, we had 10 straight quarters of gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 3 percent or more. Since the beginning of 2004, the U.S. economy has created nearly 4.5 million jobs, averaging about 173,000 new jobs a month. Core inflation, putting aside the volatile food and energy components, has remained relatively low and stable, and, importantly, expectations for future inflation remain “well anchored,” as monetary policymakers say. So, by those basic measures, the U.S. economy is doing quite well, and I believe it’s also noteworthy that our economy has adjusted to the current period of rapid economic change in some new and surprising ways.\n\nBut before I proceed with my outlook, I need to reconcile the latest reading of GDP, our broadest measure of economic output. As you may recall, GDP grew at only about 1.6 percent in the fourth quarter last year—about half the pace of the previous 2 ½ years. The analysis done by my staff and others suggests this relatively weak reading was an aberration that does not imply a loss of momentum going forward. And I agree with this assessment. Part of the slowdown at the end of last year was because of auto and truck sales, which were soft in October and quite weak in November following a round of earlier incentive-led sales. But vehicle sales picked up in December, January, and February. Other consumer spending has been well maintained, and retail sales this quarter seem to be on a solid pace. Also in the fourth quarter, government spending declined sharply, but I don’t know anyone who’s ready to declare the start of a new era of fiscal discipline. In fact, the large and worrisome fiscal deficit seems certain to worsen not far down the road as the baby boomers begin to retire.\n\nAs we evaluate today’s economy, business spending remains strong. A prevailing theme for the past few years has been the quest for efficiency, and I see the trend of productivity enhancements continuing with intense global competitive pressures, which I’ll discuss more in a few moments. Today’s computer equipment, for instance, depreciates more quickly than ever. So, technological advancements lead to more spending on information technology equipment and software, and that pattern seems to be continuing.\n\nTaking into account these positive observations, private forecasts predict first quarter GDP growth of more than 4 percent. Looking beyond the current quarter, the fundamentals for continued growth appear to be in place. While we may not have seen the full adjustment in spending by businesses and households in the face of persistently higher energy costs, so far spending has not been significantly curtailed. In addition, the much-anticipated slowdown in housing activity appears to be playing out in an orderly way.\n\nAnother important contribution to economic growth has been employment. Last year, more than 2 million jobs were added, making 2005 the best year for hiring since 2000. Those new jobs, and the new income they provide, are vital to future growth in household spending. The unemployment rate is a very low 4.8 percent. In fact, there is growing concern about a shortage of skilled workers, especially in fields such as health care, finance, accounting and construction. But, even in tighter labor markets, I’m inclined to believe that with management ingenuity and the flexibility afforded by immigrant labor, businesses will continue to add new jobs over the months ahead at a pace similar to last year.\n\nIn judging the outlook for the economy, no central banker would focus on GDP and employment growth without taking into account inflation and inflation expectations. Our recent economic history clearly tells us that low and stable inflation—and expectations of ongoing price stability—are necessary preconditions for sustained economic growth and employment. We learned some tough lessons in the high-inflation period of the late 1960s and the 1970s, when some policymakers believed that by allowing inflation to creep higher we would get more growth and employment. But now we know from both experience and from a vast body of academic research that the costs of rising and unstable inflation far outweigh the benefits.\n\nAs I said earlier, we’ve been enjoying an extended period of generally low and stable core inflation. Of course, there have been some spikes in overall headline inflation measures that are primarily related to wide month-to-month swings in energy prices. Having characterized the recent inflation experience as generally favorable, I think it’s important to note that core measures of inflation in 2004 and early 2005 started drifting upward to around 2 percent—still moderate, but at the upper bound of what I would like to see over the long run.\n\nIn many ways, our recent inflation experiences have defied precedent. Higher energy prices have put significant pressure on businesses to raise prices. And we’ve seen many examples of pass-through of some costs in the form of energy surcharges. In addition, for more than a year, many of my business contacts have told me of plans to increase prices, and, in some cases, they’ve already made price increases stick. Yet, overall measures of inflation tell us that somewhere in the production chain many businesses have chosen to absorb significant input cost increases. Despite the factors that have helped to contain large inflation increases during the recent period, I share the notion conveyed in our last postmeeting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) statement that “possible increases in resource utilization as well as elevated energy prices have the potential to add to inflation pressures.”\n\nUnderstanding globalization\nA major factor permeating most every aspect of the economic outlook is globalization, which I mentioned earlier. The term has been in our vocabulary for a while now, but its usage seems to have accelerated lately. If you search on Google for “globalization,” you’ll find more than 100 million references. Not everyone welcomes globalization, but it’s a fact of life in this day and age. In fact, the market dynamics underlying globalization have been with us for some time and have played a key role in the economic development of the South featured in the History Center’s new exhibit.\n\nThink about some recent global developments and their possible implications. Clearly, strong growth in India and China has contributed to higher energy usage and elevated energy costs, which have shown through in higher measured headline inflation. Also, millions of new workers who have been brought into competitive markets—from Asia, Eastern Europe, Latin America, and elsewhere—have changed the dynamics of employment and put downward pressure on labor costs, both here and abroad. And more competitive global labor markets are forcing U.S. companies to rethink some costly employee benefits, including health care and pensions. The upside is that U.S. consumers have benefited through lower prices for many goods that are now being imported. But, whether we like it or not, the effects of a more global economy are inescapable; economic events in distant places have a profound impact close to home.\n\nToday, dramatic changes can occur at the speed of a mouse click, with financial markets bustling nonstop and vast sums of capital zipping around the world, every moment of every day.\n\nBut globalization involves both challenges and opportunities, often in tandem. Here in Georgia, for instance, an overseas business just this week committed significant investment to build a highly productive new automobile manufacturing facility. Some new jobs will be added, but at the same time older and more labor-intensive automobile factories in the area (that happened to be owned by domestic automakers) will soon begin to shut down.\n\nMoreover, global capital flows are having an increasingly important impact on our current economic climate. For example, we have not yet fully explained the long-term interest rate “conundrum” described last year by former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan. Longer-term interest rates have remained stubbornly low, despite the Fed raising short-term interest rates 350 basis points. And most people attribute at least part of this unusual structure of interest rates to large flows of capital from overseas into this country.\n\nWhat’s evident—and potentially disturbing—about this trend is that our federal deficits have been financed more and more by overseas lenders. While the availability of capital from overseas contributes to lower interest rates and stronger economic growth in this country, I’m concerned that this trend is unsustainable.\n\nIn many ways, our economy has entered uncharted waters when it comes to global imbalances, which is one reason I suspect many people feel uneasy about the economic outlook, despite the mostly positive economic data I’ve already described for you.\n\nEven our best and brightest economists cannot be sure of how all the effects of globalization play out in our economy. A large body of our economic forecasting is built on models—some with many variables and others that are less elaborate. By definition, economic modeling assumes one can learn from the past—predicting future outcomes according to prior relationships and previously observed behaviors. But the rapid pace of globalization has altered many of these variables, and our economy continues to adjust in unexpected ways.\n\nA policymaker’s view\nSo what does this economic outlook and my analysis of globalization suggest for monetary policy? First, let me provide some background on recent Fed actions. In the early stages of the solid economic expansion that’s now firmly established, the Fed began to remove the very accommodative monetary policy put in place from 2001 to 2003. The economy continued to gain momentum, and in fourteen consecutive steps going back to June 2004, we raised the fed funds target rate from an extraordinarily low 1 percent to its current rate of 4½ percent rate. This current rate, by the way, is still relatively low by some historical standards.\n\nDuring the past 20 or so months that the Fed has been steadily increasing short-term interest rates from unsustainably low levels, the FOMC was able to clearly communicate to financial markets the path of policy and the likely timing of recalibration. Based on the economic conditions at that time, the Fed had the latitude to be explicit in our communication with the public.\n\nWhile our various steps to enhance the transparency of policy actions have been helpful to both financial markets and to policymaking, it’s important to recognize that our policy path over the coming period is somewhat less certain. And, as I’ve said on other occasions, as policymakers we should resist the urge to say more than we know.\n\nI continue to think the most likely path for the economy is sustained GDP growth with inflation and inflation expectations contained within acceptable bounds. But I, like others, will be watching very carefully as events unfold.\n\nSeveral areas warrant close attention. As I suggested earlier, households and businesses seem to be coping with persistently higher energy prices without a major reallocation of spending. But it’s possible we haven’t yet seen the full adjustment to the new reality of elevated energy costs. Also, we don’t yet know the full effects of the potential transitions in residential real estate markets. Despite the removal of very accommodative Fed monetary policy, credit markets are still accommodative, in my view, and this liquidity could boost the economic expansion and contribute to stronger-than-expected inflationary pressures. The relative lack of broad pricing power that’s been observed in many competitive world markets could begin to change, especially if domestic demand increases beyond present forecasts.\n\nWhile we don’t yet know the full impact of the significant policy adjustments of the past twenty months, I believe these actions have made a favorable economic outcome much more likely. At present, my sense is the balance of risks to both growth and inflation forecasts is now close to being equal.\n\nClosing\nIn closing, I hope I’ve conveyed my view of today’s economic expansion as being well-grounded and likely to continue in the near future. And that outlook is good news for the Southern economy, which is a microcosm of the national economy. In my remarks, I also tried to be candid in suggesting that in today’s increasingly global environment there are some new uncertainties that we must continue to try to fully understand and learn how to take into account. Finally, I hope I’ve conveyed that a monetary policymaker’s job is to nurture sustainable economic growth in a steady, low-inflation environment over the long term. In my view, the Fed has made significant adjustments to policy with the aim of enabling favorable economic conditions that allow businesses to make rational decisions without interference from high and unstable inflation.\n\nNow, I’m no historian. But I was around for much of the 20th century, and I’ve had an up-close and personal view of economic change in the Southeast since I started working for the Atlanta Fed more than 40 years ago. Early in my career, I remember the Southeast economy lagged behind much of the rest of the country. But that was before the emergence of today’s postindustrial economy. Where do we go from here? There will be some ups and downs along the way. But it’s my hope and belief that the rise of Southern capitalism is only beginning and that our best days are still ahead as we adjust to a new set of economic circumstances for the 21st century.",

            "content": "Rotary Club of Atlanta\nCharles Loudermilk Center\nAtlanta, Ga.\nJanuary 9, 2006\n\nIt’s always my pleasure to return to this familiar podium, and of course it’s an honor to provide the Atlanta Fed’s New Year economic outlook—a tradition for me that now goes back a decade.\n\nToday, the U.S. economy is doing quite well, even better than many people seem to allow themselves to think.  And let me say up front that I think 2006 should bring us another year of solid expansion, with perhaps a slightly different mix of economic factors.  Over the next few minutes, I plan to give you my take on last year’s economic performance along with a high-level outlook for this year.  Then I want to talk about some long-term economic challenges before closing with some personal observations on inflation and monetary policy.\n\nA look back at 2005\nLet’s begin with a look at the past year.  As measured by gross domestic product (GDP), the most familiar gauge of broad economic growth, 2005 was a very good year overall.  During the third quarter (the latest available), GDP increased 4.1 percent—a very solid number that would have been even higher if not for last year’s terrible hurricanes.\n\nWhile fourth quarter growth may turn out to have been a bit slower, in all likelihood overall growth for 2005 was more than 3.5 percent. To put this economic performance into perspective, GDP growth over the last 10 quarters was on average 3.8 percent—comparable to the booming late 1990s.\n\nClearly, one key to this positive economic story is the American consumer.  During the first three quarters of 2005, personal consumption expenditures increased at an average rate of about 3.7 percent.  That solid growth may have moderated some recently, reflecting in part the impact of higher energy costs and adjustments to incentive programs for cars and trucks.  But overall consumer spending has been well maintained.\n\nImportantly, higher energy costs do not seem to have dampened businesses’ desire to hire new workers.  Indeed, labor markets are stronger now than a year ago.  The unemployment rate in 2005 declined from 5.4 to 4.9 percent, and the median duration of unemployment also declined.  Additional hiring was broad-based, from construction to leisure and hospitality to business services.  Late in the year, even manufacturing employment was positive.\n\nIn September, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita destroyed many jobs along the Gulf Coast, an area encompassing about half of 1 percent of the nation’s employment base at the time.  Based on what we’ve seen and heard, the negative impact on employment was confined to the Gulf Coast area.  During 2005, about 2 million new jobs were added for an average of about 168,000 per month.\n\nThe outlook for 2006\nWhen I spoke to you last January, payroll expansion was still uncertain.  But now, after two years of steady job creation, I’m expecting more of the same: nonfarm payroll growth averaging 150,000 to 200,000 per month in 2006, with the unemployment rate holding near its current level of 4.9 percent or perhaps moving a bit lower.\n\nLabor markets are always important to the economic outlook, but in 2006 another important factor is—once again—business spending.  In a climate of strong competitive pressures, spending on equipment and software for much of last year grew at annual rates of more than 10 percent—a pace that I think is realistic to expect in 2006.\n\nAt the same time, painful restructuring continues in some industries, and spending on new commercial construction hasn’t improved significantly.  But, in general, businesses across the United States not only are adding to their productive capacity but also are continuing to make the capital investments required to improve efficiency.  Moreover, most corporate balance sheets are flush with the cash needed to make these investments.  Since 2003, corporate profits from current production have climbed rapidly and during the first nine months of last year were up about 15 percent.\n\nAs we move into 2006, activity in housing markets remains very strong.  But there are signs that demand may be gradually returning to more normal and sustainable levels.   In November, existing home sales declined, and the inventory of unsold existing homes increased to about five months.  The pace of construction, especially condominiums, appears to have eased.  At the same time, mortgage rates are still low by historical standards.  While earlier forecasts of a housing slowdown turned out to have been premature, I expect to see more moderate growth of housing construction, sales, and price appreciation in 2006 compared with 2005.\n\nHere in the Southeast, insurance and government money is beginning to flow into parts of the Gulf Coast region devastated by last year’s hurricanes.  To put things in perspective, Katrina and Rita destroyed more than 350,000 dwellings, with another 145,000 suffering major structural damage, according to recent estimates.  Much of the spending so far has been for demolition and cleanup, which I saw firsthand during a visit to the area in October.  The immense shortage of housing impedes recovery, with so many residents and businesses still living in (and operating from) other places, including Atlanta.  For the hardest-hit areas, including New Orleans, where I spent more than 12 years of my Fed career, it pains me to say that substantial rebuilding may take longer than first thought—according to some estimates, perhaps five years or more.  Effective coordination of local, state, and federal policies and resources is especially important to the ongoing rebuilding efforts.\n\nFor the overall U.S. economy, as I mentioned a moment ago, I think the outlook remains quite favorable for 2006, and I expect we’ll enjoy a solid economic expansion for a third straight year.  But I also want to recognize a troubling disconnect between my mostly positive outlook and some less sanguine discourse on the economy.  In one recent survey, a majority of U.S. investors described the current economy as “in a slowdown” or “in recession.”  And despite the positive vital signs in the economy, a surprising number of our business contacts continue to express concern that trouble is lurking ahead.\n\nEnergy price volatility\nFor the next few moments I’d like to talk about three longer-range economic issues that seem to be gnawing at our public consciousness. And the first is energy.  During the 1970s, you’ll recall, energy price shocks were accommodated by monetary policy that led to high inflation, followed by back-to-back recessions in the early 1980s as policy was corrected.  Then, after new supplies of energy were found, oil prices fell to about $10 to $12 a barrel.  In this era of cheap oil, energy producers had little incentive to increase supplies, and energy users had little incentive to conserve.\n\nUntil recently, our experience was that oil would revert to the range of about $20–$30 a barrel.  But now, after two years of increasing energy prices, with strong worldwide demand and limits on new supply, oil futures markets and business decision makers seem to be concluding that the old equilibrium price no longer holds.  In short, we may have to get used to a new era of higher and more volatile energy prices.\n\nEnergy costs are not something we can control, but we can adjust our thinking and our behavior to conform to increased economic uncertainties.  Consumers can alter their energy consumption habits, and businesses can decide to invest in more fuel-efficient equipment.  Policymakers can do their part by developing forward-looking and well-grounded policies for sustainable energy development and consumption.  As for monetary policy, an important Fed imperative is to try to keep energy price increases from causing a general run-up of inflation, and I’ll have more to say in a few moments about our commitment to price stability.\n\nWorkforce issues\nIn addition to energy, a variety of workforce issues have confounded public opinion.  As I said earlier, the U.S. economy is now creating a solid number of new jobs, and I repeatedly hear of shortages of skilled workers in industries such as construction, with wages for some jobs going up significantly.\n\nBut many workers have seen their job security evaporate in recent years.  For instance, the U.S. apparel industry declined dramatically over the last decade because of competition from lower-paid workers in other countries.  But job insecurity is not just a matter of global competition for low-skilled manufacturing jobs.  U.S. airlines and automobile makers, for instance, confront cost pressures that have caused some employers to make deep cuts in payrolls—a development that hits home in the Atlanta area.\n\nWith businesses focused on cost cutting, there has been strong downward pressure on wage growth.  Since the 2001 recession, growth in the average wage, as measured by the Employment Cost Index, has slowed.  Moreover, employee and retiree benefit programs that have long been taken for granted are now being questioned.  Adding to the uncertainty about the future, the federal government could begin to feel pressure to address shortfalls in private-sector retiree health care and pension obligations just as Congress is confronting its own funding challenges.  And that brings me to the third source of perceived economic insecurity I want to discuss: the looming federal deficit.\n\nFiscal deficits\nLast year, after the election, I expressed hope that that our fiscal policymakers would make progress in reducing the federal budget deficit.  The 2005 deficit was $317 billion, much lower than the record high level of $412 billion in the prior year, according to the Congressional Budget Office.  So we’ve seen improvement, but our fiscal deficits have persisted during this time of solid economic growth, and the extended outlook is very worrisome.\n\nOur nation’s looming deficits are unlike anything we’ve seen before, with plausible baseline shortfalls measured not in billions but in trillions in the aggregate over the next decade.  We’ve been reminded over and over that costs for Medicare and Social Security are projected to increase dramatically over the next decade and threaten federal government balance sheets, with the big hits beginning about 2012 and thereafter.\n\nBut there’s more.  This year, a new and expanded Medicare prescription drug program takes effect at the same time that we face open-ended costs for ongoing wars, hurricane relief, and other spending programs.\n\nMy point is we need to make sure that deficits don’t get out of hand, especially with about 76 million baby boomers approaching retirement age.  It’s hard to prove empirically that fiscal deficits cause inflation.  Most research on the subject has looked at temporary deficits, not deficits due to permanent increases in entitlements like we are facing now.  But history—and common sense—tells us that most inflation problems arise in economies with large fiscal deficits.  In other countries, fiscal deficits have been associated with unwelcome rises in inflation.  This year, I’m hopeful that the gravity of our long-term fiscal imbalance will soon lead to some tough decisions that will bring forth viable long-term solutions.\n\nInflation and monetary policy\n\tAlong with fiscal policy, monetary policy is another key component of our economic foundation.  As you know, the Fed’s goal is to foster long-term economic growth and stable prices.  While fiscal policy tends to take effect quickly—like a shot of adrenaline—monetary policy works with a lag.  Both monetary and fiscal policy must be applied carefully and ideally should work together, as we saw in the 1990s, when fiscal deficits turned into surpluses and the economy enjoyed an extended period of solid growth and low and stable inflation.  Fiscal and monetary policy also worked in tandem to help cushion the pain of the 2001 recession.\n\nLet’s review our recent monetary policy path.  When I spoke to you last January, the economic expansion was well under way.  Our Federal Open Market Committee had raised the fed funds target from an extremely low 1 percent to 2¼ percent—and on several occasions last year I expressed uneasiness about the unintended consequences of leaving rates too low for too long.  Now, after eight more rate hikes in 2005, the fed funds target rate is 4¼ percent.\n\nSo for me, the overriding policy consideration in 2005 was to lean against potential inflationary pressures.  During the year, our business contacts suggested that elevated energy prices and other cost pressures were providing both the incentive and the determination to pass through those higher costs. As it turned out, the consumer price index did drift upward during the year.  The core inflation measures, which exclude food and energy, were more stable.  Core CPI on a year-over-year basis moved from about 1½ percent in early 2004 to 2¼ percent in 2005.\n\nThe good news is that core inflation measures have not moved noticeably higher in recent months.  In my view, adjustments in monetary policy have helped to limit these inflationary pressures.  Also, competitive market forces and strong productivity increases are contributing to our currently low inflationary environment.  In our extremely competitive global economy, businesses must continually find new and better ways of providing goods and services at lower cost, and in many cases these efforts are reflected in lower prices to consumers.\n\nEven more important than maintaining acceptable levels of current inflation is containing future inflation expectations, which influence the behavior of business decision makers and financial markets.  Deterioration in inflation expectations can be reflected quickly in current prices.  Once unleashed, expectations of higher inflation can distort business decision making and erode market confidence.  Once embedded in the marketplace, measurably higher inflation and inflation expectations are extremely hard and costly to reverse, as we experienced during the recession of 1981.  It’s vital that the Fed’s words and actions clearly communicate our commitment to lean against the emergence of expectations of rising inflation.\n\nIn the minutes from our Dec. 13 meeting, we acknowledged the potential risks of rising inflation expectations in an environment of elevated energy costs and following a period of monetary policy that had been accommodative for some time.  Also, we made it clear that considerable monetary accommodation had been removed and that we were approaching a more uncertain time in our process of recalibration.\n\nGiven the steady diet of “measured” rate hikes the Fed has provided in the past year and a half, many of you may be wondering when enough is enough.  Let me first respond by saying the closer we get, the less explicit we can be on that point.  One reason is that we don’t yet know the full economic effect of the policy moves we have already made.  So in the months ahead, we’ll have to watch the data very carefully to make sure that growth is still on track and inflation expectations are well anchored.\n\nFor some additional insight into the FOMC’s thinking, let me point to a phrase from our December meeting minutes, which were released last week.  In those minutes, we said that in looking ahead “the number of additional firming steps required probably would not be large.”  While our policy direction has been quite clear over the past 18 months, in the less certain period ahead it’s my personal opinion that as policymakers we should resist the temptation to say more than we know at any given time.  And so I think it’s appropriate that our post-meeting statements have come with the caveat that “the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed.”\n\nIn a perfect world, the economy would continue to grow at a pace about equal to its longer-term potential, with inflation in a range that is relatively low and stable, and with inflation expectations well-anchored.  And in the quarters ahead, we could experience such an ideal economic outcome.  But of course we don’t live in a perfect world.\n\nTen years ago, when I first spoke to this group, we were in what turned out to be the longest peacetime economic expansion in our nation’s history.  Since then, we’ve had some major economic setbacks.  But after each blow—no matter how nasty or surprising—our economy recovered and recovered quickly.  I believe one of the important lessons that has been reinforced is that monetary policy that is focused on low and stable inflation helps our economy stay resilient and strong.\n\nAnd so we begin 2006 with an economy that in my view looks set to continue on a good path of sustainable GDP growth in the range of 3 to 4 percent.  The economic fundamentals appear sound—consumer spending, business spending, and hiring should continue to grow at a solid pace.  And inflation expectations should remain anchored.\n\nToday, this economic strength gives us a crucial opportunity to respond effectively to the challenges of tomorrow: to develop sustainable energy policies, to build a workforce for the increasingly competitive economy of the 21st century, and to deal with our fiscal deficits.  Crises do not often lead to good long-term economic policies.  So let’s do the right thing for future generations and act now when our economy is strong.",

            "content": "Cobb Galleria Centre\nAtlanta, Georgia\nOctober 20, 2005\n\nI’m glad to be here, and I appreciate the chance to speak to this group of dynamic business and community leaders. As someone who’s spent more than 40 years working for one large public policy organization, I’m certainly no entrepreneur. But I admire those of you who are and who have the guts, tenacity, and work ethic to succeed while leading your organizations in a market economy that is continually changing and becoming more and more competitive.\n\nIn many ways, small businesses are the heart and soul of our economy. We hear a lot of news about big corporations. But small businesses do much of the cutting-edge work—the innovation, the risk taking, and, yes, the hiring. According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, half of all private sector jobs are created by small business.\n\nAll of us—no matter where we’re employed—have a stake in the \n  path of the overall economy. So for the next few minutes, I’d like to talk \n  about the broad economic outlook. First, I’d like us to recall the very \n  solid expansion leading up to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Then I’d like \n  to give you my views on the national economic impact of these costly natural \n  disasters. Finally, I’d like to share my personal observations on recent \n  developments and monetary policy.\n\nThe measure we call gross domestic product, or GDP, provides the best and most \n  familiar gauge of overall economic output. For the second quarter of this year, \n  ending in June, GDP growth was a solid 3.3 percent. In fact, GDP growth in the \n  United States for the past eight quarters averaged more than 4 percent—a \n  record that exceeds the boom years of the late 1990s. This most recent growth \n  reflects strong gains in business spending and steady advances in consumer spending—all \n  during a time of rising energy prices and other setbacks.\n\nLabor markets are another barometer of economic performance, and this year we saw a strong employment climate. In the 12 months from August 2004 to August 2005, the economy added more than 2.3 million jobs for an average of 194,000 new jobs per month. This steady pace of job growth was better than commonly acknowledged and enough to lower the unemployment rate for August to 4.9 percent, the lowest since 2001.\n\nTo complete the picture of our economy leading up to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, let’s recall this past summer’s inflation situation. Earlier this year, there were some notable increases in broad-based measures of inflation, and these higher costs related mostly to energy. The statement following the Federal Open Market Committee’s August 9 meeting took note of this trend, acknowledging that pressures on inflation stayed elevated. But the narrower core measures of inflation, excluding volatile food and energy prices, had increased only moderately from a very low base. Of course, by this time, the Fed was moving to guard against an unwelcome increase in inflation through a series of gradual steps to remove the extremely accommodative policy that was put in place to cushion the recession of 2001. Later, I’ll come back to some more thoughts on our monetary policy path.\n\nAfter the storms\nSo, all in all, the economy was in pretty good shape in late August. Then Hurricane Katrina roared through the Gulf of Mexico and wrecked a big part of our nation’s energy production and distribution network. A few weeks later, Hurricane Rita caused more damage. At this point, I think it’s fair to describe these two storms as a serious economic shock to the region, and many of us have worked hard to determine the impact of these hurricanes on our broader economy.\n\nThe sheer scope of the tragedy in Louisiana and Mississippi is huge. In addition \n  to human suffering and economic dislocation, there has been great loss of individual \n  and business capital. My organization has an office in New Orleans, so I have \n  seen first-hand the tough work of recovery. Our New Orleans branch escaped the \n  widespread flooding, and recently we restarted limited operations there. But \n  it took us a while to find our staff of 176 employees who had fled to more than \n  a dozen states. As of today, about half of our employees in the New Orleans \n  area still can’t inhabit their homes. And I’ve heard story after story \n  from other businesses with similar—or more difficult—problems trying \n  to restart operations.\n\nBecause our region is the hurricane-prone Southeast, the Atlanta Fed is familiar \n  with the pattern that follows these kinds of disasters. Immediately after these \n  storms there is significant loss of jobs, income, and spending in the affected \n  local area. But on a national basis, such storms—even the very big ones—typically \n  don’t take a big toll on the broad measures of national employment and spending. \n  Most economic forecasters guess that Katrina and Rita—because of the devastation—will \n  subtract approximately half a percentage point from the GDP growth we would \n  have seen in the third and fourth quarters of 2005, and I believe these estimates \n  are reasonable. But then federal government and insurance payments will flow \n  and begin to give the local economy a kick. I also concur with those who forecast \n  that post-hurricane reconstruction spending will boost national economic output \n  early next year by a comparable amount, maybe half a percentage point.\n\nSo I expect the negative economic impact of Katrina will be temporary, and \n  for the next few months we’ll also see an adverse effect on the data that \n  we rely on to judge economic performance. As you can imagine, it’s hard \n  to collect information in storm-ravaged areas, and in recent weeks economists \n  scrambled to make “best-guess Katrina adjustments” to a variety of \n  newly released economic statistics. As an example, the September payroll data \n  showed a small job loss after Katrina—less of an impact than some forecasters \n  estimated—but still a deviation from the pattern of growth we had seen. \n  At this point, however, we simply don’t know the true impact on employment. \n  In the coming months, I think we’ll need to be especially cautious about \n  how we interpret much of the incoming economic data.\n\nAnd the hurricanes added more doubts with regard to the availability and price \n  of energy. Before Katrina, U.S. refineries were near capacity, with demand for \n  refined petroleum products already high because of strong economic growth worldwide. \n  Then, the storms temporarily knocked out a big share of this country’s limited \n  refinery capacity, leading to an immediate run-up of gasoline and other petroleum \n  product prices. While gasoline supplies have improved recently, the outlook \n  for natural gas is still in question. As of last week, it was our understanding \n  that much of the oil and gas pipeline systems crisscrossing the affected areas \n  of the Gulf region was still being evaluated for damage or under repair.\n\nThere’s also a lot we don’t know about how individuals and businesses will adjust to the higher energy costs that are now working their way through the economy. From past experience, we have observed that rising energy prices in the short term tend to reduce spending on other goods and services. For the past three years, many households have managed to withstand additional energy expenses, and personal consumption expenditures have grown at rates comparable to GDP. I am reluctant to bet against the strength of the American consumer. But with gasoline at or near $3 a gallon recently and other energy costs such as natural gas almost doubling in the past year, consumers may face tough choices in how they allocate their spending. In the final months of 2005, consumer spending could slow a bit if caution causes households to reduce borrowing or increase the rate of savings.\n\nAnother important concern is how elevated energy costs might affect business spending. Nonresidential fixed investment has been a source of strength in the economy since 2003. But so far this year, this key measure of business spending has been a bit weaker than expected, especially given a favorable background of growing sales, strong business balance sheets, and high corporate profitability. I suspect higher energy prices may be causing a temporary spell of caution among businesses, leading them to protect profit margins during a time of uncertainty. But in the months ahead, with good global growth and other fundamentals in place, stronger business investment growth could very well resume.\n\nPrice pressures and inflation risks\n  As I noted earlier, for the past year, I have been concerned about a discernible \n  upward drift in some measures of inflation. The overall Consumer Price Index \n  (CPI) in September was 4.7 percent above the year-ago level—and up from about \n  3 percent early this year because of the steep increase in energy prices. On \n  the other hand, core CPI (excluding food and energy) increased 2 percent last \n  month, about the same as early this year. At present, core inflation is still \n  within the upper end of what I view as an acceptable range.\n\nNow, I have to admit that when it comes to inflation, I generally tend to worry—it’s \n  my job as a central banker. I’ve been telling people that our staff economists \n  at times have made forecasts that overestimate the risks of rising inflation. \n  You see, our forecasting models don’t always capture the relentless competitive \n  pressures that work beneath the surface to constrain price increases. Retailers \n  play an important role in the price equation by partnering with low-cost suppliers \n  and refusing to accept higher prices for finished goods. Also, manufacturers \n  continue to come up with new and ingenious ways to leverage technology and control \n  costs. These are deeply ingrained and permanent trends that help to ease inflationary \n  pressures.\n\nIn this recent climate of growing economic demand and shrinking excess capacity, \n  many businesses have tried to make price increases stick. After Katrina, I heard \n  more and more reports of businesses straining to cover higher shipping costs \n  with rail and truck networks near capacity. Fuel surcharges are yet another \n  budget buster. Moreover, prices for other materials, such as steel and plywood, \n  spiked significantly last month. At some point—and you in the audience \n  would know better than I do—businesses will likely reach the limit when \n  they can no longer absorb all of the higher costs, and there will be additional \n  pressure to increase prices.\n\nBut even more important than price readings is how individuals and businesses \n  perceive the likely path of inflation. Our research tells us that expectations \n  of future inflation are more important to the inflation outlook than short-term \n  rising prices. Rising energy costs probably won’t lead to a persistent \n  and broad-based rise in inflation if—as is the case, in my view—the \n  marketplace does not perceive the general price level to be increasing. So energy \n  prices have been rising, but other important prices have not. What we want to \n  avoid is the emergence of the perception that prices across the board are continually \n  rising faster and thus get embedded in the expectations of businesses and consumers. \n  Recent evidence shows that core inflation is relatively low. Although it’s \n  difficult to judge how much of the current inflation risks will ultimately become \n  realized in core inflation in the coming months, I’m reasonably confident \n  that today’s inflation pressures—as with much of the fallout from \n  the hurricanes—will turn out to be mostly temporary.\n\nMonetary policy implications\nGiven these issues, you can probably imagine that we faced some tough questions about inflation and inflation expectations as the FOMC met last month for the first time after Katrina. As you probably know, the Fed during that meeting voted to increase the fed funds target rate for the eleventh time in 15 months. I supported our decision to bump up this important short-term target rate to 3.75 percent, and I’d like to take a few moments to explain my thinking.\n\nLooking at the economic impact of the hurricanes and the daunting task of rebuilding \n  along the Gulf Coast, I believe our nation has a moral responsibility to lend \n  a hand to those victims who are trying to resume productive lives. In thinking \n  about how that support could best be provided, it was also clear that monetary \n  policy was not the best way to help. As they teach in college economics courses, \n  monetary policy is a blunt instrument—one that works with a time lag and \n  cannot quickly be directed to one particular economic sector or geographic region. \n  On the other hand, fiscal policy can be tailored to specific circumstances, \n  and the federal government has pledged to spend what’s necessary to rebuild \n  the Gulf region. The point I want to emphasize is that the shock from hurricanes \n  to aggregate demand is likely temporary, and growth should pick up again pretty \n  quickly as rebuilding starts and money flows to rebuild homes and infrastructure.\n\nWith indications emerging that the economic expansion would continue even after the hurricanes, the FOMC chose to take a longer-term view and to continue on the path of removing the monetary policy accommodation that was no longer needed. For those of you who try to anticipate our future actions, I believe it’s helpful to remember the fundamental role of Fed policy. Our mandate is to foster a climate of full employment and low and stable inflation. We can respond to economic weakness or financial market stress by lowering our fed funds target rate. And as satisfactory economic expansion resumes, we can return the target rate to a so-called “neutral” setting, which neither stimulates nor restrains the economy.\n\nLooking ahead, it’s my belief that—despite the effects of the hurricanes—the \n  most likely path of the economy for the next several quarters is ongoing respectable \n  growth of GDP, employment, and income. That pattern suggests to me that we should \n  continue to move toward a neutral setting for monetary policy. The Fed already \n  has moved interest rates a long way toward a more normal level consistent with \n  sustainable growth. By most conventional measures, however, policy is still \n  accommodative. So I believe the continued removal of that monetary accommodation \n  is appropriate for now. And I will submit that our gradual course has been far \n  preferable to pausing and risking more drastic—and painful—moves later.\n\nMonetary policy involves balancing risks, and we continually forecast the probability \n  that the economy will get a negative surprise on either output or inflation. \n  Then we have to weigh the consequences of such an unwelcome outcome—even \n  if the odds of either event happening are judged to be low. In evaluating the \n  costs of a potential drop in the rate of output growth or an unwelcome rise \n  in inflation, I believe that a significant acceleration of inflation would be \n  the larger and more troubling outcome in the period ahead. A rapid increase \n  in inflation can distort decisions in the marketplace and, once unleashed, become \n  extremely costly to the real economy and difficult to contain. This heavy toll \n  reinforces the importance in my mind of leaning against the possible emergence \n  of unwelcome inflation and inflation expectations so the marketplace is not \n  allowed to ratify continued rapid price increases.\n\nFor some time now we have provided reasonably specific guidance on the future \n  path of monetary policy, and we have seen the value in this more open approach \n  to communication with the public. Over the last few months, the guidance we \n  have been able to provide on the likely path of policy has been well received \n  in the marketplace. But we have moved into a new—and in some ways more \n  difficult—period of greater uncertainty, and all of us will have to be \n  ready to respond to new developments.\n\nI want to note that our recent post-FOMC meeting statements came with a caveat that reads: “The Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.” To me, this language means that while we’re working to gradually remove the remaining policy accommodation in this time of elevated inflation risks, we also must watch carefully for unexpected developments in the economy, especially how individuals and businesses respond to the continuing rise in energy costs.\n\nIn closing, let me briefly recap what I hope you’ll take away from my remarks. \n  The economy was in the midst of very solid growth midsummer before the hurricanes. \n  These storms were devastating to the Gulf region but, from a national perspective, \n  have not significantly altered our mostly positive economic path. In the wake \n  of the hurricanes, our economy faces new uncertainties related to higher energy \n  costs and economic data that may be harder to interpret. Clearly, the risks \n  to inflation are elevated, but I believe price increases are likely transitory \n  and will not significantly change the long-term inflation outlook. At this point, \n  I believe inflation and inflation expectations will be largely contained by \n  competitive market forces and continuing adjustments to the stance of monetary \n  policy.\n\nIt’s been said that liberty is granted to us on the condition of eternal vigilance. In many ways, I believe the same is true for monetary policy as we continually guard against economic threats. The U.S. economy is the most dynamic and resilient in the world, and there is good reason to believe our economy will keep adjusting in ways that make low and stable inflation and continuing growth the most likely outcomes. But in this time of change and uncertainty, we can take nothing for granted. Today and tomorrow, we’re committed to eternal vigilance.\n\n\n\nPress Release",

            "content": "Global Payments Conference\nSaint Paul de Vence, France\nOctober 5, 2005\n\nThis is a pivotal time in financial services, and I’m glad that we’re here to take a good, hard look at our industry as we transition to electronic payments. But before I begin to discuss the many implications of this change, let me clarify some important points about the Federal Reserve’s unique responsibilities. As the central bank of the United States, the Fed plays a lead role in running a safe and efficient payment system—a role few other central banks pursue. Although the Fed is not driven to maximize shareholder value, we are committed to promoting efficiency, both inside our organization and throughout the financial services industry.\n\nInternally, the Fed is accountable to Congress and is required to recover the actual and imputed costs of providing financial services in order to keep a level playing field with private-sector providers. But as the central bank, we are also expected to look after the greater good of the industry while serving more than 7,000 commercial banks scattered over some 3.5 million square miles. The Fed also plays a leadership role in responding to crisis situations. A few weeks ago, for instance, when Hurricane Katrina battered the Southeastern coast of the United States, the Fed was once again called upon to stay open and keep financial services running as smoothly as possible. Interestingly, I have noticed that organizations that have urged us in the past to withdraw from providing payment services often do not hesitate to use the Fed when other clearing channels are disrupted.\n\nAt the same time, we’re sensitive to market conditions, and I view our conference theme of running payments as a business as timely and relevant. To advance this notion, I’d like to begin my remarks by discussing change in the payments industry from my perspective as retail payments product director for the Federal Reserve System. Then, I want to examine some of the barriers to progress and look at why so many financial institutions are still bogged down in paper, especially those in the United States. Finally, I’d like to suggest some new models for running payments as a business and building a more efficient payments platform for the 21st century.\n\nWhen I look broadly at the payments industry in the United States, I see progress. But we can—and should—do better. Payments are still plagued by inefficiency, and financial institutions are not yet leveraging the true potential of electronic payments. Right now, it seems to me the payments industry is mired in a confusing transition that reminds me—as a parent of three children who are now adults—of a young person going through adolescence. Like a lot of teenagers, electronic payments are growing rapidly. But our industry is going through an awkward phase as financial institutions cling to revenue from paper-based transactions and are reluctant to commit to a future built on the efficiency of electronics.\n\nI understand the transition of payments to adulthood is tough for financial institutions, many of whom now find themselves with one foot in paper-based transactions of the past and another foot in the electronic payments of the future. Given this unsteady posture, more and more financial institutions find themselves burdened with hidden costs that may impede their overall performance. We all know payments are vital to revenue. And in the United States a key source of profitability is checks. While financial institutions in the United States are among the most innovative in the world, it’s unclear how banks will respond as people write fewer checks and the volume of checks cleared through the fee-generating clearing networks decrease. I foresee many financial institutions confronting tough choices as they try to sustain growth in a time of rapid innovation, regulatory change and shifting customer demands.\n\nOverview of payments\nAs we feel these growing pains, let me take just a moment to give you an overview of payments in the United States. According to the Fed’s research, approximately 36 billion checks were paid in 2003. Compared with many other countries, the United States still has a high volume of checks—about 45 percent of all noncash transactions. But check volume in the United States is declining by about 5 percent each year. Debit card usage is growing rapidly, and Web banking and other online financial services are moving from fringe to mainstream. For the first time ever, the number of electronic transactions in 2003 exceeded the number of checks processed.\n\nThe Fed processes about 35 percent of all checks in the United States, or 12.5 billion items annually. In response to this transition in payments, the Fed has standardized systems, reengineered functions, downsized operations, and increased paper check processing prices. In general, we’ve done what has been needed to maintain the financial viability of the paper business. But we cannot achieve our long-term financial goals by perpetuating our paper business indefinitely. We believe it’s imperative to aggressively speed the transition to electronic payments, including electronic check clearing.\n\nRecently, we took what I will describe as a big step forward in this direction with the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act, which most of you may know simply as “Check 21.” For those of you from other countries, the United States Congress passed Check 21 in 2003, and the program has been in effect for about a year. In short, this law facilitates the shift to electronic check collection by allowing—without requiring—collecting banks to create and send electronic images of the check. The law, however, also lets the paying bank choose whether to accept that electronic image or require paper. Thus, the Fed or other processors may need to convert check images back to a paper document called a substitute check, the legal equivalent of the original item.\n\nDoes Check 21 reach our goal of a completely electronic transaction from end to end? No. But the law moves us toward that goal and offers practical advantages. For example, banks may now speed the clearing of large-dollar checks by a day or more, particularly from the West Coast of the United States. This faster availability far outweighs the cost of producing substitute checks. According to some estimates, a typical customer that clears some $10 billion in checks per day could save some $250 million in improved availability over a year. When you compare this improved availability to our fees, the value proposition is pretty compelling. Today, less than a year after the implementation of the act, the Fed is processing on average more than 1.3 million Check 21 items each day.\n\nACH gains traction\n  And I’m pleased to report more progress toward electronic payments. Automated \n  clearinghouse, or ACH, volume increased 18 percent in the second quarter this \n  year, compared with the same period a year earlier. Growth has gained momentum \n  for about three years following a rule change that expanded the types of payments \n  eligible to become ACH items. As a result, businesses may now convert checks \n  to ACH debits at points of purchase or remittance processing locations that \n  are sometimes called lockboxes. Last year, financial institutions converted \n  1.1 billion checks to ACH entries, and this year we expect the number to exceed \n  2 billion.\n\nACH technology has been here for decades, but we have continued to improve the ACH system, making it more adaptable and secure. For instance, ACH is emerging as an important provider of e-commerce. During the past year, the number of ACH Internet-initiated payments increased by nearly 40 percent. And given growing concerns about identity theft and fraud, the Fed recently introduced a new risk management service that allows financial institutions to keep a close watch on customer ACH transactions.\n\nThe advantages of ACH are more evident as the service expands. During and after Hurricane Katrina last month, for instance, the Fed’s ACH system continued to function, although some banks that lost power in the region temporarily were unable to access the ACH system. But banks in the affected area quickly regained access to the ACH network and resumed electronic payments. By contrast, paper methods of payment were far more problematic. Weeks after the storm, some banks were still trying to recover and sort checks. Wet and contaminated checks were a serious problem that we managed to resolve by enabling paper check conversion to electronic ACH payments.\n\nSo I would say ACH has good traction in the United States, and we’re using our electronic payments network to try to lower barriers to some of our key trading partners. International payments are growing, but sending money across borders is still too costly, and the process can be lengthy. Fees for international payments vary widely. Large banks in the United States charge consumers anywhere from $20 to $40 for overseas transactions and similar amounts for euro-denominated checks. In response, the Fed has extended our low-cost ACH service from the United States into Europe and Canada, and we’ve been developing an ACH service south of our border that we’re calling Directo a Mexico. We believe that ACH in Mexico has great potential, and we’ll have a chance to discuss this topic further during our panel on international payments later in the conference.\n\nWe’ve learned a lot since the heady days of the 1970s—back when we naively \n  thought we were approaching a checkless society. But now we know that developing \n  the technology is just a first step and not the endgame. In hindsight, I think \n  we better appreciate the challenge of convincing the marketplace to adopt electronic \n  payments. And this lesson comes through in a book from a couple of years ago \n  titled “The Slow Pace of Fast Change.” The author’s main idea is, “Technology \n  almost always deceives us into thinking that we are going to progress further \n  than the fragmented reality of the market will allow.” So, for example, it took \n  a long time for the personal digital assistant to become an alternative to the \n  paper calendar and black book for contact information. And then, finally, many \n  years after the technology was available and affordable, people began to put \n  away their old Rolodexes and began to organize their lives with the aid of electronic \n  tools such as the Palm Pilot or Blackberry—a device that’s at my side just about \n  wherever I go. In fact, my wife refers to my Blackberry as my girlfriend.\n\nAdding to the flow of paper\nMy point is, innovation is an unpredictable thing, and it can take time—maybe decades—for the market to embrace even the most promising technologies. Our financial services industry in the United States gives another example of the slow pace of fast change. We enjoy all sorts of new products and services. But millions of consumers and businesses persist in their long-standing habit of writing paper checks, and it seems to me that many financial institutions policies promote this counterproductive behavior.\n\nDon’t get me wrong. There’s nothing wrong with writing checks. Indeed, checks provide certain advantages, especially for business-to-business transactions that need paper documentation. But looking at the big picture, our migration to electronic payments becomes problematic if banks persist in adding to the flow of paper. Some financial institutions clearly depend on a paper-based business model that involves charging customers fees for insufficient funds on paper checks or by capitalizing on float, which is the time required to settle and return a paper check to the originating bank. While this model may generate short-term profits, I would contend that a strategy that depends on revenue from a shrinking market such as paper checks does not enhance an organization’s long-term intrinsic value. In fact, float as a source of revenue could well be eliminated sooner rather than later as Check 21 speeds collection in remote locations.\n\nWith this backdrop, I must admit that I am continually astonished by the number of financial institutions in the United States that continue to offer free checking. I understand the need to increase customer “stickiness.” But the cold, hard truth is that check volume will continue to erode, and at some point customers who have grown accustomed to so-called free paper checking services may be in for a rude awakening. To accelerate the move to less resource-intensive electronic solutions, I believe that banks will have to begin passing along to their customers the true costs of paper processing.\n\nLet me illustrate my point. I remember when I used to pay 15 cents for each check cashed, and it seems to me that day may once again return, perhaps in the form of a new type of fee, similar to the fuel surcharges that are more and more common in the United States. For our part, the Fed has been raising paper prices significantly in recent years while offering more attractive prices on electronic services. The longer banks wait to adjust prices to reflect the real costs in the marketplace, the more painful this transition will be for the customer.\n\nIn addition to unleashing the invisible hand of the marketplace, banks could respond to our changing environment in other ways. To begin with, I would recommend taking a good hard look at your entire organization to find opportunities—however small—to lessen duplication and improve the payments process. Without efficient back-end payments, new products and innovation will prove difficult and expensive to implement.\n\nBreaking down silos\nAccording to the Economist Intelligence Unit, more than three out of every four banks are organized along product lines. But this silo-based organizational approach may cause problems during periods of rapid change, especially when your customers must decide for themselves which silo they need to contact. From mortgage lending to consumer finance to credit cards, vertical product silos are easily viewed independently. But it’s often hard to know when these silos operate at cross-purposes. If this problem sounds familiar, you may want to get a better view of what payments mean to the overall performance. For many organizations, it makes sense to hire a payments czar who is responsible for developing the big picture and forcing the institution to look at overall profitability. Today, many of these so-called czars are support positions—not senior management positions that are empowered to resolve disagreements that would address the needs for the entire organization.\n\nAlthough I hesitate to cite the Fed as an example because our situation is unique, it might be helpful to share with you how we have responded to these challenges. The Fed’s Retail Payments Office, or RPO, which is based in Atlanta, has some responsibilities that you might liken to a payments czar within the Federal Reserve System. Over the years, the Fed empowered the RPO with profit-and-loss responsibility and oversight for strategy for the ACH and check processing services of the Reserve Banks, which now operate under the RPO’s umbrella. As local districts don’t report to us in the conventional sense, this oversight job at times resembles herding cats. But we do have the responsibility and authority to promote efficiency and reconcile competing interests across the Fed system. And with the decline of checks, we’ve had to make tough decisions. Today we are in the process of reducing the number of check-processing facilities from 45 to 22.\n\nLooking at the broader industry, we would very much like to see a swift and painless transition to electronics. But we understand the reality is more complex. Too many organizations have duplicative processing platforms or confront excess capacity. And so it seems to me that quite a few financial services providers in the United States are stuck in the same holding pattern, struggling to carry the burden of inefficient payments operations as more nimble and aggressive nonbank competitors emerge to gain market share. If we don’t respond, I fear this holding pattern might well turn into a death spiral.\n\nAs we confront change, there’s a strong temptation to step back and wait to see how events unfold. But I think Teddy Roosevelt, the U.S. president 100 years ago, offered some pretty good advice on leadership when he said, “In a moment of decision, the best thing you can do is the right thing.” But, he added, “The worst thing you can do is nothing.”\n\nIn financial services, inaction is a dangerous course—especially now. Banks are no longer the sole owners of the payments franchise. More and more nonbank providers such as PayPal, CheckFree, and others selectively target the most promising revenue streams and are moving fast to separate commercial banks from their best customers. In this competitive jungle, it’s a matter of survival to align services with customers’ needs and thus provide low-cost and convenient services.\n\nIn closing, let me reiterate that our payments system is going through a difficult transition that those of you who are parents of teenagers may recognize. Today, the development of new technology and the rapidly changing needs and expectations of our customers have our industry in a tough spot. Yesterday’s business models will most likely fail under the pressures of tomorrow. Moreover, the wider scope of our payments operations—shifting from paper to electronics—demands that we get out of our comfort zones and become leaders across silos, looking for the best strategies and outcomes for our entire organizations.\n\nI want to leave you with an illustration of this transition. Let me assume that you have all seen the video segments of the space shuttle as it lifts off from its launch pad in Florida. For that first few moments, the shuttle seems to barely move. But as it gains altitude and jettisons its external fuel tanks, the shuttle seems to leap into outer space. When I think of our payments industry, I view our paper-based processing system as those external fuel tanks. True, we may have needed them to get off the ground. But the sooner we jettison those inefficient processing systems, the earlier we will reach our desired goal.",

            "highlights": "Remarks by Patrick K. Barron, First Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta; Retail payments conference hosted by the Chilean Superintendent of Banks and Financial Institutions and the Central Bank of Chile, Santiago, Chile, July 19, 2005",
            "content": "Retail payments conference hosted by the Chilean Superintendent of Banks and Financial Institutions and the Central Bank of Chile\nSantiago, Chile\nJuly 19, 2005\n\nThis is my first trip to Chile, and a few days ago I took a tour of your beautiful capital city. I was most impressed by Santiago’s vibrant public spaces and the level of commercial activity. As a visitor, in short, I have a distinct impression that Chile enjoys a strong and healthy business climate. This prosperity also is evident in the economic data and reports, and I would submit that Chile’s commercial success reflects well on the good work of your independent central bank and your sound policies with regard to payments and financial services.\n\nToday, I would like to speak about some of the key issues in the U.S. payments system while trying to address the increasingly global nature of financial services. After my prepared remarks, I will be glad to answer your questions and discuss payments, financial services, or central banking in general.\n\nAs a visitor from the United States, I am here in a collegial spirit, and I certainly don’t want to try to sell you on the virtues of the U.S. payments system. While our system has some advantages, there are certain aspects of the U.S. approach to payments that I would not recommend emulating. I hope that you will find my account of payments in the United States useful as you develop your policies. In turn, I hope to gain some insights from your policies that may lead to a more effective payments system in the United States.\n\nThis is an opportune time to speak because so much about the business of payments is changing. As is happening in Chile, the payments system in the United States is moving quickly from paper to electronics, and in both our countries this development presents many difficult and exciting new issues.\n\nThe importance of payments in central banking\nA few moments ago, you were told about my role with the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and the Federal Reserve System’s Retail Payments Office. In addition to having a complex and somewhat decentralized structure, the Fed also has broad responsibilities in our country, similar to your Superintendency and Central Bank combined. You might be asking, why is the central bank of the United States playing a leadership role in payments? That is a valid question, and let me try to respond because I believe the answer underscores our role as central bank policymakers.\n\nA recent report by the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems of the Bank for International Settlements effectively describes how a national payment system is essential to both the financial stability and the monetary policy goals of a central bank. Let me take just a moment to share with you a key passage of this report, and I quote: “By linking financial institutions together for the purpose of transferring monetary claims and settling payments obligations, a payment system becomes a channel through which financial risks can be transmitted across financial institutions and markets. In promoting a safe and efficient national payment system, central banks limit the prospect of financial contagion through this channel.” This report goes on to note that safe and efficient payments systems are also critical to effective implementation of monetary policy, and it describes a sound payments system as a “precondition” for monetary policy transactions.\n\nSo I hope you can see how payments are crucial to monetary policy and overall economic health. And while central bankers have a fixed mission, I strongly believe we also need to be flexible when it comes to strategy and tactics. New technologies and ideas are constantly reshaping our market economies, and I view keeping up with change as crucial to the job of any good central banker.\n\nChecks in transition\nLet me illustrate my point by talking for a little bit about check usage, which I know is a familiar topic in Chile. Consumers and businesses in both Chile and the United States rely on the check as a method of payment. In our country, around 36 billion checks are paid each year, but that number has begun to decline. The Fed acts as a processor of checks for financial institutions. And to cope with this flood of paper, the Fed contracts with private sector air carriers to fly paper checks between Federal Reserve offices so that checks can be settled and returned to the originating bank. This is not always possible as weather delays and other factors can often delay the collection of paper checks. For this and many other logistical reasons, the Fed for many years has tried to introduce new and better ways of enabling consumers and businesses to make payments.\n\nBy embracing change and pursuing a disciplined approach of research, development and experimentation, I believe the Fed has gained invaluable knowledge and better positioned our payments system for the future. These efforts, we believe, are now beginning to make a positive impact. A study completed in 2003 revealed that the total number of electronic transactions for all of 2003 was more than 44 billion, compared with some 36 billion checks. So, for the first time ever in the United States, the number of electronic payment transactions surpassed the number of check payments. This is an important milestone that I have described as a tipping point, or a fundamental shift in the way Americans make payments.\n\nSo what has the Fed done to adjust? Well, one initiative that you may have heard about is the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act, or Check 21, which became law in 2003. Basically, this legislation facilitates the move to electronic check collection by allowing collecting banks to stop the flow of paper by creating electronic images of the check. But Check 21 does not require paying banks to accept electronic images for payment. Consequently, such banks can require an intermediary to convert the image back to a paper document called a substitute check, which is the legal equivalent of the original check. While somewhat inefficient in the short term, this approach allows banks to move to electronics on the collection side while work continues on the ability to receive images.\n\nPresently, the Fed processes on average some 500,000 substitute checks per day through Check 21 with dollar values in excess of $7–$8 billion. To put this in perspective, Check 21 amounts to about 1 percent of the total volume of 50 million checks per day that the Fed processes.\n\nBy 2008, we expect about half of all U.S. financial institutions to have the capability to send and receive checks via Check 21. But looking to the long term, there are some unanswered questions about the role of Check 21 as image technology continues to advance and check volume keeps declining at a rate of about 5 percent per year. Some banks are taking a wait-and-see attitude, and I do not fault those who choose not to invest in technology to receive electronic images—as long as they’re open to something better coming along later. The substitute check is, in my opinion, not the ultimate solution for efficient electronic payments, and we continue to experiment with other payments technologies that have the potential to speed backroom processing. For instance, there are exciting possibilities with converting certain types of consumer to business payments from paper checks directly to ACH debit payments. More than 2 billion such conversions will take place this year. So, while Check 21 may not address all of the many logistical concerns with check clearing, I believe the legislation represents a big step forward and gives us a solid foundation for more efficient check payments over the long term, which is a Federal Reserve objective.\n\nFor any payments initiative to become successful, it must pass one critical test: It has to save or make money for the financial institutions that are organized to make a profit and are ultimately accountable to shareholders. That is a high standard because banks in the United States face relentless pressure to cut costs, and the need to adopt new technologies and other methods of improving efficiency has never been greater. Historically, the U.S. financial sector has been fragmented with many small institutions serving local markets. But that has changed somewhat with deregulation and improved technology, and in recent years we have seen the development of larger multinational banks while the number of commercial banks has declined from more than 12,000 in 1990 to about 7,600 in 2004.\n\nI expect those numbers still seem large here in Chile, where market forces have driven a consolidation trend resulting in 25 commercial banks, although I’m told there are more than 2,000 financial cooperatives in Chile. But in the United States every day new banks are created as others are purchased and subsequently consolidated. The U.S. financial services industry is very dynamic, and as you might expect the Fed has made substantial changes to keep pace with our customers. Instead of operating as independent entities when it comes to payments as we have done in the past, the 12 Reserve Banks in the United States collaborate more and more as a national network to improve efficiency. For instance, the Fed is in the process of cutting its number of check-processing locations from 45 in 2002 to 22 next year. For an organization geared to stability, these changes have not been easy. But they are essential to our long-term success.\n\nChallenges ahead\nWith a more streamlined organization, the Fed has not only lowered costs, but we have positioned our organization to respond more quickly and decisively to the changes in the marketplace. Still, we face many challenges. And chief among them is information security. Identity theft is a big concern, and you may have heard about recent thefts of credit card information and personal data. According to a 2004 survey, 75 percent of U.S. banks reported losses from check fraud, and that figure in recent years has been increasing. The Fed works closely with law enforcement and other government agencies to ensure that consumers and businesses are protected from thieves. And, as I’m sure you’re aware, fraud is not just limited to the United States. Information theft and payment fraud is increasingly organized, sophisticated, and global. I know financial institutions are working hard to upgrade internal security measures, and I expect that central banks around the world will need to cooperate actively and become more aggressive in efforts to build a payments system that is not only efficient but also secure.\n\nAnother challenge that we face in the United States is on the legal front. Our retail payments laws are antiquated, difficult to interpret and hard to change. Both technical innovation and the role of nonbank participants in U.S. retail payments systems have evolved much more quickly than the law has changed. Given our country’s complex legal climate, the Fed has tried to encourage payments experimentation wherever the current legal structure does not prohibit innovation, while supporting only those legal changes that are clearly necessary. From the point of view of the Retail Payments Office and the Reserve Banks, you might say we take a practical approach to innovation. Financial institutions in the United States have a big stake in improved payments processing because this back-end function is very expensive, and greater efficiency can lead to dramatically lower operational costs and improved profits. As a result, a slow and painful transition from paper to electronic payments is what we want to avoid, so we’ve worked to encourage progress, wherever it serves the marketplace.\n\nProgress in payments\nIn addition to the developments with Check 21 and check-imaging technology, the U.S. government had made substantial progress in moving its benefits payments programs from a paper to an electronic format. The Electronic Benefits Transfer program known as EBT has been an effective way to provide food stamp payments electronically to millions of Americans. The U.S. government uses many innovative ways of making payments electronically to personnel around the world. Also, the federal government’s Social Security program has done an effective job of providing pension payments electronically, in the process lowering processing costs and ensuring a more accurate delivery of funds.\n\nAnd I’m pleased with the progress of the Fed’s Automated Clearinghouse method of payment, or ACH. As I’m sure you’re aware, ACH enables businesses and consumers to inexpensively send money to each other, similar to your CCA. ACH volume increased about 17 percent in 2004 and today accounts for more than 11 percent of all noncash payments, totaling more than 9 billion transactions worth some $22 trillion.\n\nNow that ACH is gaining traction in the United States, the Fed is moving ahead with efforts to spread its reach. The Fed has extended ACH to Canada, and we’ve made inroads into Mexico with a new service that we’ve branded “Directo a Mexico.” We believe this service has great potential because of the growing volume of remittances sent by Mexican nationals living in the United States to relatives in their home country. And it provides a valuable service for a growing segment of our population who are not traditional banking customers.\n\nBanking accessibility is a challenge in the United States, and I know this topic is familiar to bankers in your country. Many of the people who send money from the United States to Mexico do not have bank accounts, and financial institutions have struggled to convince unbanked customers to deposit their hard-earned money in what are perceived as large and impersonal financial institutions. At the Fed, we encourage banks to serve a broader segment of the population, but the issue in the United States is complex, especially with the many new rules put in place following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.\n\nConfronting change\nWherever we live, we cannot escape change as international boundaries disappear and new ideas and financial products take root. For example, Internet banking has evolved in the United States to the point where a broad segment of the banking population expects easy and immediate access to Web-based banking services.\n\nAnd outside the traditional banking sector, the Web-based payments service Paypal has quickly emerged as a major player in international payments, handling 9 percent of U.S. and 5 percent of all global e-commerce transactions. With about 71 million accounts, Paypal is now targeting large merchants, competing directly against banks for the business of processing credit card payments. Provided there are adequate controls to prevent fraud and other risks, I view financial innovations such as Paypal not as a threat but as an opportunity with the potential to foster a stronger and more vibrant financial services industry.\n\nWith Chile on the forefront of the global economy, your financial services landscape will no doubt evolve. I am told that one of the issues you face is the rapid growth of nonbank credit cards and the movement of department stores into retail credit in Chile. I would very much like to hear your comments and concerns in this area.\n\nIn the United States, merchants also issue credit cards to customers, but this credit is mainly underwritten by existing banks, which makes it possible for bank examiners to monitor what is happening. Certainly, the United States’ marketplace for credit has been active. In recent decades, consumers have increased their use of revolving credit just as the volume of installment credit from retail stores and personal financial companies has declined. Today, consumers in the United States have many options for credit in a financial services marketplace that is crowded with new products.\n\nGiven these pressures, I believe the best approach for central bankers is to stay abreast of progress and wherever possible try to anticipate the marketplace. Personally, I believe the most hazardous course is to stand still and expect tomorrow to be the same as yesterday. We cannot ignore the future of payments, which is already unfolding in Korea, Finland, and other places, where people often use mobile phones to make purchases. There’s every reason to believe wireless and many other new and convenient transaction methods will take root in the United States, Chile, and elsewhere.\n\nOf course, change involves risk, and we must remember the importance of public confidence in our ability to provide a safe payments system. But let me add that the old way of shuffling around paper to make payments carries its own set of drawbacks in the way of security, with few corresponding benefits in efficiency. I believe it is imperative that businesses have the freedom to develop new ways of making payments, and it is incumbent on us as regulators and policymakers to encourage innovation without unnecessarily impeding progress. By way of example, the Fed recently has focused particular attention on minimizing risk and fraud in ACH. As ACH expands to include electronic payments via the Web and by telephone, we are actively monitoring payments and providing valuable payments information to banks as part of our new ACH risk management service.\n\nEventually, I believe the market largely will determine what succeeds, but that does not mean that everything familiar to us today will become obsolete tomorrow. I’ve already mentioned the decline of check volume. A large segment of the U.S. population loves to use checks and they will no doubt remain an important element in our payments system. Check writing is not going away—nor are other expedient forms of payments. Cash continues to grow in volume, and even the world’s oldest payment system, barter, is thriving. Barter is making a comeback through Web sites that allow the efficient exchange of goods and services. Old ideas continue to evolve as consumers and businesses evaluate the growing number of choices of the marketplace.\n\nWhat’s driving developments in financial services is technology. Some 40 years ago, a young engineer named Gordon Moore predicted that computing power would double approximately every 18 months. Over the years, “Moore’s Law” has withstood the test of time, and I wanted to mention this informal technology benchmark because I believe it helps to explain the swift and sometimes unsettling pace of change in our economy.\n\nWhat does this rapid pace of change mean for us as regulators and central bankers who are responsible for keeping payments running smoothly and preventing shocks that could hurt the economy? I’m a realist who recognizes the many risks we face. But I’m also an optimist who believes that central bankers are creative enough to overcome our challenges and devise new and better ways of doing things.\n\nLet me close by sharing with you some thoughts from business consultant Peter Drucker, who makes a distinction between a fad, which is something that people talk about, and change, which is something people do. Drucker continues, and I quote: “If you start out by looking at change as threat, you will never innovate. Don’t dismiss something because this is not what you had planned. The unexpected is often the best source of innovation.”\n\nIn our business, it’s always wise to expect the unexpected, and I think we all agree that electronic payment is not a fad—it’s a fact. And I believe we would all do well to heed Drucker’s call to stay open to change and embrace innovation as the most direct path to a bright future. I look forward to working with you on building a safer and more effective payments system for our increasingly interconnected world. Thank you for your time and attention, and at this point I welcome your comments and questions.\n\n",

            "content": "Certified Professional Home Builder Luncheon\nAtlanta, Georgia\nMay 25, 2005\n\nThanks, Bill [Grant], for your introduction. When Bill asked me to speak to your group, I was glad to accept the offer. He told me you all are the leading homebuilders in Atlanta, and I’m honored to join you. Moreover, with the way things have been going with residential construction, I figured this would be a pretty happy bunch. My son is a residential developer in north Atlanta, and like you he has enjoyed the robust housing market of the last several years. But I’m aware your line of work is not for the faint of heart. Residential development and home building can involve some big risks, and I know you all are especially sensitive to the general economic conditions and outlook, which is the topic I’d like to discuss here this afternoon.\n\nFirst, I want to lay the groundwork for my remarks with a look at the current economic performance. Then, I want to reflect on the discernible upward drift in inflation we’ve seen over the last two years. Finally, I want to share with you my personal thoughts about monetary policy and the Federal Reserve’s mission to foster sustainable growth, with low and stable inflation, and strong employment growth.\n\nThe economic fundamentals\nLet’s start by looking at the broadest measure of growth in economic output: gross domestic product. Given what seems to be a fixation with the latest piece of data, you might have overlooked that U.S. economic growth last year was 4.4 percent. And over the three and a half years since we came out of the relatively short and shallow 2001 recession, our economy has experienced GDP growth on average of 3.5 percent. About three weeks ago, we saw an advance estimate of first quarter 2005 GDP growth, which was 3.1 percent—below expectations, but still respectable. More recent data suggest that growth remains solid, and many analysts expect the first quarter GDP estimate to be revised upward. In any event, I am inclined to attribute at least some of the recent softness in growth to general skittishness about the springtime run-up of energy prices, which I’ll discuss in a moment.\n\nLooking ahead, I expect GDP growth will remain on a very positive path. I think the forecast I made early this year of growth for all of 2005 in the range of 3.5 to 4 percent still seems reasonable.\n\nLooking at the components of GDP growth, the data confirm what most of you already know—residential investment has remained strong, growing on a year-over-year basis during the first quarter by 6.7 percent. In fact, overall consumer spending growth during the first quarter was 3.5 percent—down slightly from a year ago—but still solid and roughly in line with overall economic output.\n\nAt the same time, business investment spending continues to underpin good economic growth. Some businesses during the early part of this year may have postponed certain investment spending decisions because of high energy costs. But there has been no sense of panic. Rather, more recent data suggest investment spending—and business spending plans—remain firm. It’s important to note that many businesses are flush with cash and motivated to improve their efficiency while growing their markets. This trend was evident as we saw equipment and software spending last quarter increase on a year-over-year basis by more than 14 percent, following very strong investment spending growth in 2004. I expect businesses will continue to upgrade equipment that helps them to leverage the talents of their employees so they can compete in global markets and capitalize on new business opportunities.\n\nAn important factor in the outlook is the job market. After a slow recovery in job growth following the 2001 recession, labor market developments have improved considerably. For the first four months of 2005, the U.S. economy added some 844,000 nonfarm jobs, or an average of more than 200,000 jobs per month. Looking at the characteristics of recent job growth, hiring has become broad based across most sectors of the economy. Construction has been especially strong, with 430,000 jobs added over the past 18 months. And we’ve seen solid job growth in business services, leisure and hospitality, and retail, among other industries. These additional paychecks are crucial to keeping growth on track.\n\nWhile prospects for job seekers have improved, the labor market still has some weaknesses. Manufacturing employment has declined by more than 3 million since 2000 and by another 6,000 jobs in April. But much of the loss over the past five years is what economists call “structural” changes, recognizing that some of that job loss is the result of firms moving manufacturing to other parts of the world. Also, the average duration of unemployment remains stubbornly high at about 20 weeks compared with less than 13 weeks during the hiring boom of the late 1990s. This information suggests that some people continue to have a hard time finding the right job. Still, it’s important to keep in mind that job growth has picked up nicely over the past 18 months and is now growing at a pace that I believe will continue to lower the unemployment rate.\n\nRelated to this point, there has been a lot of research and discussion on the amount of job growth needed to sustain economic growth and push the unemployment rate lower. Two key factors are the rate of increase in labor productivity and growth in the labor supply. And I’d like to share some analysis on the labor supply done by several of our Atlanta Fed economists. Since June 2003, the U.S. unemployment rate has declined from 6.3 percent to the present level of 5.2 percent. This substantial drop in the percentage of unemployed has occurred despite only modest payroll expansion of about 156,000 jobs per month. Previously, we would not expect that pace of job growth to lead to a decline in the unemployment rate. So, our staff asked, if the economy is creating only a modest number of new jobs per month, why has the unemployment rate continued to fall?\n\nPart of the answer, we believe, is found in something economists call the labor force participation rate. The participation rate, defined as the percent of the civilian population working or actively seeking work, climbed steadily during the 1990s, but then the pattern changed. Since 2000, the participation rate has declined by about a percentage point and currently stands at 66 percent. That slight decrease makes a big difference in how job growth affects the unemployment rate. It’s tough to say why fewer people are entering the job market, but experience suggests that in the early stages of an economic recovery some workers get discouraged by their job prospects, drop out of the labor force temporarily and are, therefore, not counted as unemployed. But new evidence suggests others may be leaving the job market due to social factors, such as women with young children deciding to stay at home. If the recent trends with the participation rate persist, the economy would need to create only 100,000 to 150,000 jobs per month to keep the unemployment rate moving downward.\n\nPrice pressures in context\nFor a monetary policymaker like me, I’m always looking at the pace of output growth in the economy, which I’ve been discussing. But I also have to watch price developments—or more precisely, inflation. And during the last two years, various price measures have been trending higher, thus signaling moderately rising inflation. Let’s consider some broad measures of inflation that reflect year-over-year price changes. The core personal consumption expenditure, or PCE, price index, which excludes volatile food and energy components, in March increased 1.7 percent. By comparison, the core PCE index in May 2003 increased just slightly more than 1 percent. And looking at a more familiar measure of inflation, the Consumer Price Index in April increased 3.5 percent. Two years ago, the CPI increased slightly more than 2 percent.\n\nAnd it’s a similar story with the more volatile Producer Price Index for inflation, which last month was up 4.8 percent. In May 2003, the PPI index was up just 2.5 percent. And while inflation data may fluctuate month to month, you can see more indications of rising prices by looking at various intermediate goods, which can affect the price of finished goods, such as housing. In the past 12 months, for instance, the price of gypsum (used in wallboard) is up more than 15 percent; scrap steel is up 22 percent; cement (if you can get it) is up 10 percent. Looking at a broad mix of construction materials, prices in the past year have increased 6.4 percent. And it now appears there has been more pass through of energy costs than I earlier expected. My point is that all of the inflation measures over the past seven or eight quarters show a similar—but distinct—upward tilt.\n\nUnderlying the price increases has been strong economic growth worldwide, which has boosted the demand for many commodities, and put pressure on their prices. For example, the energy story should be familiar to everyone. Starting in early 2004, the price of crude oil rose steadily from about $35 per barrel to more than $50 per barrel. Ordinarily, higher prices lead to more production and eventually greater supply and perhaps stabilizing and lower prices. But, when it comes to energy, the invisible hand of the market works in mysterious ways. China and other developing economies have become voracious consumers of energy, helping to drive up demand and in the process helping to push prices to current levels. But those businesses involved in the production of oil know that the world’s appetite for energy could decline in the event of a slowdown in global GDP growth. Oil exploration costs are huge, and businesses have been slow to invest in new energy production facilities. Adding to the uncertainty with respect to energy prices is this country’s continued reliance on oil imported from politically unstable regions such as the Persian Gulf, where more than half of the world’s proven oil reserves are found. Given these complex dynamics, oil futures markets are indicating that higher energy prices may well be with us for quite a while. And how businesses and individuals react to this energy price outlook—both short and long term—is a key economic uncertainty.\n\nOne factor that has helped to keep prices in check is expanded world trade. With the spread of lower tariffs and freer trade, our global economy has become more competitive. In response, businesses have continuously found new ways to leverage technology and lower costs. As consumers, we benefit from lower prices and a greater variety of goods and services. Global trade’s competitive pressures also have contributed to the past decade’s remarkable increase in U.S. productivity. Since 2002, U.S. productivity growth annually has averaged more than 4 percent. That figure compares with an average, which had prevailed for several decades, of less than 3 percent. So it’s important to remember we have external factors such as trade combining with related productivity gains to help keep inflation muted.\n\nKeeping an eye on housing\nThe recent period of moderately rising inflation has unfolded during an extended period of very low interest rates. Since we came out of the 2001 recession, we have seen rapid growth in a number of sectors of the economy. Residential construction has been strong for some time. In the past few years, the homeownership rate has climbed to nearly 70 percent nationwide, a record high level. And that situation is unlikely to change as long as mortgage rates remain attractive to homebuyers. Moreover, new jobs and income growth should lend additional support to our economy’s residential sector.\n\nIn this climate, it would be easy to take the housing market growth for granted. But many of you in this room have felt the woes of prior housing cycles, and you realize that problems can ensue when supply outpaces demand. Housing is a local business. And in several markets across the country, housing prices in the past year have appreciated more than 30 percent, a rate that in my view is unsustainable. There are submarkets in our Southeast region—notably in coastal Florida—where you hear about speculators buying housing units—sometimes multiple units—just to flip them for a quick profit. And it seems like every week brings new stories about aggressive financing arrangements that encourage and enable such real estate transactions. I have to tell you that some of these stories we’re hearing about residential speculation make me uncomfortable, and the potential imbalance of supply and demand in housing in some markets is something I have been speaking out about for more than a year. You all know better than I do that real estate is ultimately driven by fundamental factors such as general economic growth, demographics, and household income.\n\nMonetary policy implications\nOf course, residential construction is just one of many sectors we follow and discuss every six to eight weeks when the members of the Federal Open Market Committee meet in Washington. As you probably know, the FOMC earlier this month raised the federal funds rate target to 3 percent. Since last June when short-term rates were at a 40-year low of 1 percent, the FOMC has bumped up its rate target in eight consecutive meetings.\n\nWhile I doubt everyone in this room welcomes higher short-term interest rates, let me share with you some of my personal thoughts on the Fed’s recent policy moves. I have strongly supported the Fed’s actions to gradually remove our policy accommodation. I believe our strategy to act before the appearance of widespread price increases is sound and necessary to keep inflation and inflation expectations firmly in check. The gradual rate hikes at this stage of the economic recovery also reduce the chances that the Fed will later need to take a more painful path of steep hikes. The Fed is not raising rates to stifle economic growth, but to ensure an environment of stable prices and sustainable growth over the long term.\n\nI’m often asked what the end game is for the policy adjustment process. Going forward, we are approaching an increasingly uncertain time for monetary policy. The Fed’s goal is to achieve what’s often referred to as a neutral policy setting, where rates are at a level that promotes growth without the likelihood of a run-up in inflation. Of course, as economic fundamentals shift over time, our view of neutrality may change. Given my current outlook for the economy, my personal view is that we’ve not yet reached a neutral policy stance. While I see no signs of an imminent and substantial pickup in inflation, we will need to be especially sensitive to incoming data and new developments on prices.\n\nThere are other issues that warrant close attention. Although it is not something we can directly address through monetary policy, the growing federal deficit has become a long-term concern. Excessive fiscal spending tends to boost output in the short run but eventually adds risks to our economy and restricts the effectiveness of monetary policy. The fundamental issues of how to deal with Social Security and rising retiree health care costs only serve to complicate our challenges with fiscal policy.\n\nIn addition to our widening fiscal deficit, there’s the situation with private debt. As interest rates declined during and after the recession, many households were able to shore up balance sheets by consolidating credit card and other debt into lower-cost loans backed by home equity. This refinancing trend has boosted economic growth, mostly by encouraging consumer spending. But low interest rates are more conducive to consumption than savings, and in recent years we have seen plenty of the former and too little of the latter. Fortunately, the Fed’s policy of slowly raising short-term interest rates could have the desirable side effect of reducing the brisk pace of borrowing to fuel consumption while boosting savings.\n\nIn closing, let me emphasize that I believe the economy remains on a solid and sustainable path of growth. As I mentioned earlier, businesses continue to ramp up their investment spending. And consumer spending keeps chugging along. Labor markets are improving at a solid pace, and the additional paychecks will help fuel more growth. Taken as a whole, these and other factors suggest that our economy has ample strength to withstand further removal of accommodative monetary policy—in my view, a step that is needed to sustain economic growth.\n\nOver the past few years, our economy has demonstrated great resilience and growing balance. We have overcome several negative shocks and now have many factors working in our favor. And as economic momentum continues, I remain convinced that the best course is to stay on a monetary policy path that helps reduce the risks ahead and supports a continuing pattern of solid growth and low inflation.\n\n\n\nPress Release",

That speech to your predecessors took place during the Great Depression, and the new president delivered a call to change that resonates across the decades. He said that day, and I quote: “Yours is not the task of making your way in the world, but the task of remaking the world which you will find before you.”\n\nFortunately, today’s graduates face an economy that is nothing like it was in Roosevelt’s first term. Our economic outlook is solid. We live in the most dynamic economy in the world, and your possibilities are limited only by your imagination. But regardless of unexpected events that are surely ahead, and regardless of the particular path you chose, you will advance your own cause immeasurably if you demonstrate the characteristics of success that I just mentioned—hard work; dedication to lifelong learning; respect for others; and commitment to ethics.\n\nAnd as you make your life and make your living, be sure that your ultimate goal is to make a difference. More than ever, we need you to share your intelligence and your imagination, your talent and your enthusiasm. And as you apply your newly honed powers of reasoning, be skeptical, not cynical. It’s easy to stand back and criticize, but I want to call on you to step forward and respond to the world’s many problems. If something is broken, show us how to fix it. If something works, show us how to make it better.\n\nIn closing, I want to echo President Roosevelt’s message from many years ago by challenging today’s graduates to really “make a difference” by helping to remake the world.

            "content": "The Scott Symposium on Business Ethics at Bridgewater College, Bridgewater, Virginia\nApril 11, 2005\n\nThank you, Phil [Stone], for the nice introduction and for inviting me to be your speaker this evening for the Scott Symposium on Business Ethics. You have been a gracious host, and I can certainly sense why Bridgewater College has become even more special under your leadership.\n\nAs Dr. Stone mentioned, I grew up near Staunton, so it’s always a pleasure to come back to the Shenandoah Valley. My roots are here, and this is also where I got my first lessons in right and wrong. My parents were both public school teachers, and as I was growing up I had the sense that they were always looking for “teachable moments”—chances to give to their students, along with my brothers Jimmy, Doug and me, lessons in life to go with their academic teaching.\n\nI’m not sure where I heard it—maybe from a teacher or a Scout leader—but somewhere along the way in my early life I heard a simple test of ethical behavior that has stuck with me for all these years. And that is, “Do the right thing when nobody’s looking.”\n\nThat phrase was in the back of my mind as I went off for my freshman “rat” year to Virginia Tech. At that time, Tech was run like a military academy, and when a member of the corps of cadets broke the ethics code in a serious way he was “drummed out.” The drumming-out ritual was chilling. In the middle of the night, every cadet was rousted out of bed and marched in formation to the courtyard. With an eerie drum roll, we were commanded to turn our backs to the offending cadet as someone recited his honor code violations. It was an experience one never forgets.\n\nJust as I learned many important lessons during my years at Virginia Tech, I am sure that those of you who are Bridgewater students will reap many benefits from your education in this very special place. To make it to the top in today’s very competitive workplace, you’ll need a broad understanding of how the business world works. But if you want to stay there and remain successful over the long term, then you’ll need something even more important: a solid ethical foundation.\n\nNow that may seem like a surprising statement because, as I’m sure you’re aware, the picture of business ethics that has emerged over the past few years isn’t very pretty. It seems like every week we hear another story about corporate dishonesty, deception, or self-serving acts. Sometimes, it seems like we have a business culture that is ethically challenged.\n\nLet me say up front that I’m no expert on the academic study of business or economic ethics, and I certainly don’t want to place myself or my organization on an ethical pedestal. In my role at the Federal Reserve, our nation’s central bank, however, I interact with a wide cross section of business leaders. And in my role as a monetary policymaker, I have become especially sensitive to the health and integrity of our United States financial system. Let me emphasize that I believe that corruption in business is still the exception and not the norm. But I have seen how just a few instances of unethical behavior can seriously undermine our market economy and our broader society.\n\nIt’s from this perspective that I’m going to argue today that the ability to provide leadership in ethics is more important than ever—for current and future business managers.\n\nTo make my case about the importance of ethics, let me start by assessing the scope of the problem and the damage caused by recent lapses in business ethics. Then I’ll turn to some potential reasons for these problems, and finally share some thoughts on what steps we need to take as a society and as individuals to address today’s challenges to business ethics.\n\n\n\nThe scope of the problem\n\nBetween 2002 and the end of last year, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission brought more than 1,300 civil cases against businesses and obtained orders for penalties in excess of $5 billion. Those numbers are higher than for any comparable period in the agency’s history.\n\nFor many of us, the list of fallen corporate stars in recent times probably began with Enron. Then there was WorldCom, Tyco, Adelphia, and HealthSouth, to name just a few of the most notable companies that have been subjected to SEC enforcement actions. In addition, some of the top names in the mutual fund industry have settled SEC enforcement actions. And in October 2003, ten of the biggest firms on Wall Street paid a $1.4 billion settlement related to conflicts of interest between research and investment banking.\n\nThe nature of the ethical breaches has varied widely. Many cases involved accounting tricks used to inflate earnings and to protect the value of a company’s stock. Some cases involved efforts to defraud investors through misleading advice or schemes that broke the rules, such as after hours trading of mutual funds. And in other cases, the motive was to directly benefit the personal wealth and ego of the top executive—for instance, spending millions of dollars of company money on personal art work, lavish parties or home improvements. And according to a news story last week, a senior corporate executive may have used company money to pay for an expensive kennel for his hunting dogs. I would argue that whatever the motive, all are examples of greed, hubris and poor ethical conduct. And while all such actions may or may not be illegal, unethical behavior often imposes a cost not only on the victim and the wrongdoer, but also on countless others including, I expect, many of us in this room.\n\nAs we saw with Enron and WorldCom a few years ago, many long-time employees lost their jobs and their retirement pensions as well. Shareholders also have taken a beating in the aftermath of corporate scandals, and many of the investors who were burned were highly sophisticated. Going back to peak valuations, shareholders saw a loss of market capitalization of some $66 billion in the case of Enron and $177 billion in the case of WorldCom.\n\nBut it’s not just deep-pocketed investors and institutions that have suffered. Today, nearly half of all adult Americans participate in the stock market. That’s compared with only about 6 percent in 1952. Millions of households invest in employer-sponsored plans and in mutual funds. In the aftermath of recent scandals, I’ve heard a number of young people express skepticism about investing in equities. Given the huge losses in recent years, it’s understandable that folks are being more cautious in how they allocate their hard-earned savings.\n\nIn 2002, when many ethical scandals were coming to the surface, stock market investors saw years of gains vanish in a matter of months, in some cases in just days and weeks. In one survey taken in November 2003, 77 percent of investors reported they were less confident in the trustworthiness of corporate management, with 59 percent less confident in the safety of financial markets overall. These numbers jibe with my gut sense that the overall level of trust in businesses and financial markets has taken a big hit.\n\nMoreover, we can’t ignore the costs of new regulations that I believe were necessary to prevent such malfeasance in the future. In 2002, Congress overwhelmingly passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, a new law that is designed to tighten standards for accounting and require more disclosure on the part of public companies. The law also provides for much tougher penalties for executives and even directors who participate in or enable fraudulent behavior.\n\nWhen it passed three years ago, only three votes were cast against this sweeping and complex legislation. That decisive congressional action is a testament to the public outcry for reform in corporate governance.\n\nBut the legislation brings a very substantial cost. A top executive of a large company with annual revenues of about $37 billion told me recently that his company estimated that Sarbanes-Oxley had added approximately $16 million a year to expenses. Another executive with a company with about $12 billion in annual revenues put the added costs at about $40 million annually. And it’s not possible to quantify other indirect costs as senior executives shift their attention and resources from growing their businesses and creating new jobs to regulatory compliance. But based on anecdotal reports, I do have the sense that the extraordinary attention devoted to the new corporate governance rules very likely delayed strategic business decisions and capital investment decisions that we would have seen earlier as the economy recovered from the 2001 recession.\n\nClearly, corporate governance reform—while necessary—has been expensive. And that burden is being carried by the vast majority of businesses in our country that have always played by the rules. The money to pay for improved corporate governance comes out of corporate profits and represents another price we are all paying for corporate fraud and deception.\n\n\n\nReasons for ethical lapses\n\nAs we evaluate these costs, I think it’s important to explore the underlying factors in the recent spate of business scandals. You can’t blame it all on greed and hubris; these fundamental human flaws have been with us forever.\n\nSo what’s new? Well, I believe one difference is the complexity of many of today’s businesses. In the past decade or so, new technologies have spurred the evolution of our financial markets. New and innovative financial products enable transactions to occur more rapidly and efficiently than ever. The bad news is that this new automation has the potential to open new avenues for fraud.\n\nTake Enron, for example. With the help of Wall Street investment bankers, accountants, and complex derivative instruments, Enron engaged in transactions that were nearly impossible to understand and untangle. In fact, a special investigative committee of Enron’s board reviewed 430,000 pages of documents and interviewed scores of people about the so-called special purpose entities that were part of the Enron corporate hierarchy. Even with that intense level of scrutiny, I’ve read that they still haven’t gotten to the bottom of everything Enron was doing. If boards of directors and experienced financial analysts couldn’t figure out what’s going on, how were novice individual investors supposed to understand these transactions?\n\nA second factor that I believe makes ethical behavior more challenging is the intense competitive pressure of today’s global marketplace. The temptation to cheat rather than fail is timeless, but in recent years this ethical dilemma may have become even more widespread.\n\nOur most recent economic boom and bust cycle demonstrates how these pressures can play out and lead to a series of business scandals. During the late 1990s, people were investing huge sums of money based on extremely optimistic assumptions that rapid economic growth and market appreciation of corporate stock values would continue indefinitely.\n\nIt’s true that the late 1990s saw great technological innovation and productivity gains that brought real value to our economy. The potential of the Internet and other technologies generated great excitement on Wall Street, and analysts fueled the fire by hyping dot-com companies and other hot stocks. They predicted sharply rising profits, quarter after quarter. But then the market got ahead of itself as investors poured money into undisciplined businesses, which were then held to improbable short-term targets. In the end, businesses and entire industries imploded.\n\nLooking back at this climate of unrealistic expectations, we can see how these problems unfolded. Executives who were unable to meet their targets began to make use of confusing financial reporting, which helped to hide their actual performance. In some cases, businesses that reported clear and accurate numbers were actually at a competitive disadvantage.\n\nThe term “creative accounting” became a popular euphemism for non-standard accounting practices involving novel ways of characterizing income, assets and liabilities. Enron touted its own accounting wizardry, and even some business schools were reported to be teaching creative accounting—something I trust you never taught here at Bridgewater.\n\nA third factor contributing to the erosion of business ethics involves lapses in corporate governance. Starting at the top, businesses are designed with checks and balances to ensure management accountability and above-board operations, since in the modern corporation managers are distinct from owners, or stockholders.\n\nIf you’re a member of a board of directors, it’s your fiduciary duty to ask tough questions and intervene in questionable practices. But as businesses have become more complex and competitive, as I discussed a moment ago, these protections have not always sufficed and in some cases have broken down completely.\n\nAside from the additional analytical challenges, too many directors fell short on their core responsibilities. In some cases, there were conflicts of interest because directors had major deals pending with the businesses they were supposed to be overseeing on behalf of shareholders. In other cases, management gave themselves and their directors significant privileges and perks. As Abraham Lincoln once said, “Knavery and flattery are blood relations.”\n\nThe structure of executive compensation also has led to problems and in some cases is now being rethought. For the past decade or so, many directors have been granting stock options as an incentive for management to run their businesses in a way that increases the company’s stock price. While it makes sense to align performance with compensation, stock options have not always been carefully structured. In the worst cases, stock options actually motivated managers to do the wrong thing, such as manipulate short-term earnings to meet bonus targets or cash in on insider knowledge.\n\nSo, in addition to age-old traits such as fear of failure, greed, and pride, modern-day ethical challenges in business have been exacerbated by technologies that have spawned increasingly complex financial products and accounting techniques. Fierce global competition and more complex and demanding governance responsibilities are other factors. Since the underlying characteristics of these new developments are positive, we don’t want to attack them. But we also can’t ignore systemic flaws that lead to ethical lapses.\n\n\n\nSociety’s prescriptions\n\nI would like to spend my last few moments thinking with you about what I believe we can do to bolster the ethical foundation of our economy.  As I noted earlier, after the initial flare-up of corporate scandals a few years ago, Congress overwhelmingly passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to demand greater business accountability. So as a society, we’ve already taken steps to address some of the most glaring ethical weaknesses in our economy.\n\nDespite the expense of the legislation that I described to you earlier, I believe Sarbanes-Oxley has led to some positive developments in business. In my view, stricter and more uniform accounting standards were needed, and I applaud the work of former New York Fed President Bill McDonough, who is now in charge of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, an authority created by Sarbanes-Oxley.\n\nWith tougher oversight and penalties on the books, today’s boardroom culture seems to be changing. Corporate governance reform has weeded out some of the most egregious conflicts of interest.\n\nAs investors and board members become more skeptical and assertive, chief executives face more tough questions. In recent months, boards have “drummed out” several CEOs and senior executives for ethical lapses. I am optimistic that business leaders are becoming more accountable and are getting the message about ethics.\n\nMoreover, there is evidence that with of all the attention devoted to fraud and the risks in the marketplace, investors are doing more homework. In the same survey from November 2003 that I mentioned before, 79 percent of investors report being more interested in how corporations are governed, with 68 percent more likely to seek financial and accounting information about investments.\n\nI am encouraged that investors now seem to be getting more savvy. Markets are extremely sensitive to information flows, and they work best in a climate of accountability and transparency. With human nature as it is, secrecy is the enemy of ethical behavior. But transparency is an iterative process, not one that occurs all at once. Financial and commercial corporations are actively working on transparency and ethical behavior, and I believe they are making good progress to get it right.\n\nAs more information pours into the marketplace, we as individuals have obligations as well. It’s up to each one of us to take advantage of this new openness and bear more responsibility for our investments. Read the footnotes, check multiple sources of information and use common sense to recognize that higher returns generally entail higher risk. As they say, if something sounds too good to be true, then it probably is too good to be true.\n\n\n\nNext steps—individual actions\n\nClearly, as a society we’ve taken forceful measures to address recent corporate scandals. But make no mistake: It takes everybody acting in a spirit of trust to make markets work effectively. That’s why a strong ethical foundation is so important. Albert Einstein summed it up pretty well when he said, “Every kind of peaceful cooperation among men is primarily based on mutual trust and only secondarily on institutions such as courts of justice and police.”\n\nOf course we are a society of laws, and if you commit a corporate crime, you stand a high probability of getting caught and going to jail. That is certainly an incentive to behave ethically. But ethics requires obeying not just the letter of the law, but also the spirit of the law. As Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has observed, our economy functions smoothly in large part because we can generally rely on trust.\n\nOur first line of defense in preserving trust in our market economy should be a culture of ethics in all our organizations.  Ethical behavior is good business, and it needs to take place on a day-to-day basis. Formal controls that foster ethical behavior on the part of every employee are part of the process. Ethics needs to become a habit.\n\nAll CEOs have to set the right tone at the top. But management cannot see and do everything, and lofty words can only do so much to foster good ethical behavior. In fact, many if not most of the companies now being prosecuted had high-minded vision statements, and their executives made eloquent speeches about corporate values. But in addition to just talking about ethics from time to time, we have to instill ethics throughout the workplace culture and up and down the whole organization, day after day and year after year.\n\n\n\nSumming it all up\n\nThis evening, I have tried to think with you about some of the reasons behind the recent flare-up in corporate scandals. I also have tried to convey a sense of the costs that fraud and corruption have imposed on all of us.\n\nIn closing, let me say again that we are fortunate to live in a competitive free-market economy that thrives on self-interest and the pursuit of maximum profit. As the Scottish economist and philosopher Adam Smith observed back in the late 18th century, “It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest.”\n\nBut just as we are free to pursue our self-interests, individuals sometimes do bad things. And we live in a representative society where the public demands accountability and a reasonable degree of fairness. We have to acknowledge this tension between public and private interests without restraining the forces that make our economy strong. Above all, we must continually strengthen, and, when necessary, repair our ethical foundation to ensure trust in our financial markets and business enterprises.\n\nUnless I miss my bet, as I was thinking out loud earlier in my remarks about some of my own growing up experiences that occurred just down the road from here, you were thinking about your own ethical issues. To the students here, I would suggest that your ethical challenges will only become tougher as you move into the workforce and gain more responsibilities. Having a strong ethical foundation will serve you well throughout your life. To the faculty here, I encourage you to continue to look for those teachable moments when you can underscore the importance of how one achieves results. And to the business and civic leaders, I challenge you to make a culture of ethics one of your high-priority objectives not just in 2005 but every year.\n\nOne of the things that I learned growing up in the Valley is the value of your word and your name. Living in a small community, you see one another most every day, and I expect it’s still true that in many personal and business deals a handshake around here is as good as a notarized contract.\n\nNow, I know things are more complex in our fast-paced global economy. You have to watch your back, read the footnotes, and be realistic about balancing risk and reward. But I still think we’ll all be more successful, and ultimately happier with ourselves, if we practice that advice someone gave me many years ago somewhere along the way:  “Do the right thing when nobody is looking.”\n\n\n\n###\n\nPress Release",

            "content": "America’s Community Bankers National Operations,\nSecurity & Technology Conference and Marketplace\nDisney’s Contemporary Resort, Lake Buena Vista, Florida\n\nMarch 21, 2005\n\nToday, I want to talk about this extraordinary time in financial services from my vantage point as Retail Payments Director for the Federal Reserve System. I hope to give you a sense of the Fed’s stake in our nation’s payments system and offer a few thoughts for how community banks can grow and prosper at a time when the climate is changing rapidly in financial services.\n\nEarlier in my career, I managed the Atlanta Fed’s Miami Branch, and I still have a little sand in my shoes, as former Miamians are fond of saying. Our kids spent a lot of time on the beaches of South Florida, where, as you know, the weather can change suddenly. When the wind picks up and dark clouds begin to move in, it can get pretty uncomfortable. But even when the surf gets too rough you can still fly a kite in those high winds, if you’re open to new ways of doing things.\n\nWith respect to financial services, I understand that today’s business climate can be unsettling, particularly for community banks. But I want to suggest that the gale force winds blowing through our industry also bring exciting new prospects—or, if you will, opportunities to fly your kite higher.\n\nThe changing world of payments\nThe well-known business consultant Peter Drucker once said, “To manage in turbulent times means facing up to new realities. It means starting with the assertion: ‘What is the world really like?’ rather than with the assertions and assumptions that made sense only a few years ago.”\n\nLet me try to answer Drucker’s key question as it relates to payments: What is the world really like?\n\nFrom the viewpoint of the Federal Reserve, we have been aware of transition in the payments industry for several years. These changes include increased debit card usage, and our internal data have reflected the growth in automated clearinghouse, or ACH, volume. Also, Federal Reserve check volumes were increasing year-over-year as late as 1999. So in an effort to clarify a rather confusing picture, we sponsored a major market research effort that looked at year 2000 retail payments check and electronic data.\n\nBasically, we learned that check volume was much less than the industry had expected, that check volumes were probably falling, and that electronic payments usage—particularly debit card volume—was greater than expected. We learned that Federal Reserve check processing volume had been growing because of increased market share, not because of growing volume within the industry.\n\nLast year we repeated the study as a way to get a sense of the pace of change. The latest study revealed that between 2000 and 2003, the total number of checks paid decreased at an average annual rate of more than 4 percent, while retail payments in aggregate were growing around 3.8 percent, a growth rate faster than for gross domestic product over the same period. Specifically, the total number of electronic transactions for all of 2003 was more than 44 billion, compared with some 36 billion checks.\n\nIt is especially notable that the number of electronic payment transactions in the United States—for the first time—surpassed the number of check payments. This is a major milestone that underscores the dramatic change that is unfolding and suggests that the world of payments may be approaching what author Malcolm Gladwell described in his book “The Tipping Point.” In his introduction, Gladwell writes: “We need to prepare ourselves for the possibility that sometimes big changes follow from small events, and that sometimes these changes can happen very quickly.” One might logically pose the question, “Is the U.S. payments system now at a tipping point?”\n\nWell, we now have a better picture of how payments are moving from paper to electronic form, and I’d like to provide some background on how we got to this point and a sense of where I see things going.\n\nLooking back, you could trace many payments innovations to the 1960s. At that time, financial transaction volume was booming, and the manual processes of the day were unable to keep up. As we entered the 1970s, the Fed and some other banks began to improve the back-office payments function for handling paper. At the Fed, we also began to pilot new systems for electronic payments by collaborating with the industry to build a nationwide ACH network.\n\nIt was during this enthusiastic early phase of electronic payments that heady talk began to emerge about a cashless and checkless society by the end of the 20th century. As it turned out, these early predictions of doom for paper methods of payment were off the mark. Cash usage has continued to increase, and the checkless society became the “less checks” society.\n\nI even made a few speeches myself way back when predicting the decline of paper checks. My forecast was right, but I made the rookie forecasting error of attaching a specific year to the outcome within the same sentence.\n\nEven with the evidence that I’ve described for you today, I don’t want to overstate the scope of change. Although check volume has begun to decline, checks are still a critical form of payment in the United States, accounting for some $40 trillion in annual value (still more in terms of value than for all other retail electronic payments).\n\nGiven the caution that many consumers and businesses have shown in adopting new payments technology, some of you here today may be skeptical about the rapid transformation I’ve described. Indeed, many community banks have told me that much of their success has been from the traditional, paper-based approach to financial services.\n\nAnd looking ahead I don’t have any doubt that community banks have been and will continue to be successful. But I want to emphasize that the old formulas for success may not take you to the “Tomorrowland” of payments.\n\nYou don’t have to take the monorail to the Magic Kingdom or Epcot to get a glimpse into the future. Just look at the business-to-business marketplace, where about 80 percent of transactions are now check-based. According to a 2004 survey by the Association of Financial Professionals, 28 percent of treasury management executives believe that in the next three years their businesses are “very likely” to shift most payments to electronic systems. Four years ago, only 9 percent of executives in the same group were planning to shift the majority of payments from paper to electronic systems.\n\nEvery day, more and more of your customers—businesses and consumers—grow accustomed to making purchases with debit cards or handling transactions on the Web. Even fast-food restaurants are accepting credit and debit cards.\n\nI can’t tell you how to capture and keep the customers of tomorrow, but I can reasonably forecast that if you ignore the shifts that are occurring in the market you will have a hard time being successful in the future.\n\nThe role of the Fed\nAs for the Fed, we are here to serve the financial services industry, and in that industry community banks like yours play a vital role. In addition to providing central banking services, the Fed has a clear public policy interest in fostering efficiency, safety, and confidence of the payments system.\n\nWe are in the business of ensuring that payments glitches that could damage the economy do not occur. And on a routine basis our mission revolves around the smooth transfer of payments not just in this country but also across borders, day after day.\n\nAs financial innovations come on line, the Fed also has a responsibility to make sure customers are protected, that the new systems are safe and secure. Information security is a real and growing concern. As a result, we spend a lot of time and effort working with financial institutions to ensure that payments technology is protected from threats from within the industry and also from external elements.\n\nAnother recent development I want to mention is image technology, which relates to the passage in 2003 of the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Law, or Check 21. Contrary to some early predictions that had little or no basis in fact, Check 21 has not led to the elimination of check float in the payments system or a big percentage increase in overdrawn accounts. But I do believe that Check 21 gives us a solid foundation for more efficient check payments over the long term, which is a Federal Reserve objective.\n\nThe secret to the success of Check 21 will be the ability of paying banks to accept electronic image cash letters of items so that the end-to-end electronic clearing process can occur. Every day, the Fed System handles peak volume of about half a million Check 21 transactions worth more than $6 billion and average volume of about 300,000 transactions. These transactions result in the printing of a paper substitute check for presentment to the paying institution. And we have more than 200 customers in various states of readiness to come on line, including many that are preparing to accept electronic files.\n\nIt so happens that perhaps the most passionate receiver we have in queue is an independent banker from Iowa who is thrilled by Check 21’s potential for dramatically reducing costs and processing duplication.\n\nAnd as Check 21 gains a foothold, I want to acknowledge that the Fed is also sensitive to cost pressures. Because the Fed is accountable to Congress and is required to recover the actual and imputed costs of the financial services we provide, our organization has made several significant adjustments, some over the past few decades and others in the past few years. Instead of operating as independent entities when it comes to payments, the Reserve Banks now collaborate as a national network to reduce costs and improve efficiency. Last year, the Fed completed its first phase of check re-engineering that involved discontinuing operations of 13 check processing locations, including the one I used to supervise in Miami.\n\nCurrently, we’re in the next phase of check reorganization, going from 32 to 23 processing locations nationwide. For a workplace culture like ours that has been geared to stability, this process has been painful. But we recognize these changes are vital as we continue to move from a paper-based payments network to one that will be dominated by electronics.\n\nI know that you too are coping with these changes. And community banks are even more directly exposed to the “tender mercies“ of the free market and ever-changing customer demands. I understand that from your vantage point the outlook may appear daunting. Huge financial conglomerates that operate on a global scale continue to move into your markets. The pressure to cut costs and adopt new technologies that boost efficiency is relentless. No wonder the number of commercial banks keeps declining, from more than 12,000 in 1990 to about 7,600 in 2004.\n\nImplications for community banks\nBut there is more to the story of financial services than vanishing banks. So let me offer some ideas on how small and medium-sized institutions can not only survive but also thrive in today’s climate and why bigger is not necessarily better.\n\nPerhaps the most powerful agent of change in your industry is technology. This development is significant because technology, in my opinion, can be a great equalizer.\n\nYour larger competitors might be able to operate on a mass scale at a lower cost than you, but you too have advantages. I would submit that most of you are more flexible and are closer to your customer base. Also, because your organizations are smaller, I suspect you also have the edge of responsiveness, with less entrenched management silos and flatter organizational structures.\n\nRemember the independent banker I mentioned a moment ago who is so excited about Check 21? This banker was able to look quickly and decisively across his operation and customer base and see the net benefit of the changes ahead. By contrast, larger organizations tend to focus on the benefits to one aspect of their operation and end up battling across silos for individual preservation as opposed to corporate success.\n\nMy point is, be forward-looking and leverage your customer insights and knowledge to find a niche, then take it as far as you can go.\n\nAlthough Internet banking in the past has been hyped, it has evolved to the point where a broad segment of the banking population expects access to the Web’s 24–7 service and time-saving features. Today, everyone knows and uses the Web. The Internet is a powerful tool that is here to stay, so make it another one of your competitive advantages.\n\nFor a growing number of small and medium-sized institutions, the Web is a profitable way to build customer loyalty and add to your customer base, even in remote communities.\n\nGeography does not constrain the Internet. A bank in Oregon can offer online banking services to customers in Florida or most anywhere else.\n\nAnd if you want a sense of how e-commerce is evolving, take a look at retail. Many small mom-and-pop hardware stores have closed in the past decade because they were unable to compete against lower-cost retail conglomerates. But many niche businesses have emerged on the Web to sell specialized products to loyal customers around the world.\n\nThese organizations may be in your town, and my guess is that they probably need a bank that can support electronic payments or even global settlement.\n\nInternational banking is a growth business, and you don’t have to build expensive offices abroad to capitalize on globalization. In many communities in this country, there is an opportunity to develop underserved customers and offer them access to cross-border payment technology that is already in place.\n\nYou can offer international banking services from just about anywhere. The Fed for years has offered banks ACH links to Canada and more recently Mexico and Europe. Through ACH, a bank account holder in this country can send money to a bank account holder in another country. Each transaction costs about $1, which is much less expensive than alternative nonbank methods of making cross-border payments.\n\nGiven the large population of Hispanic workers in many parts of the United States who need a way to send money back to family members back home, we believe the Fed’s Mexico Service has tremendous potential. And it’s available for all banks, regardless of size.\n\nIn fact, it is not the nation’s large banks that are breaking new ground with this service. I would describe most early users of our international ACH services as modest-sized institutions at the community level that take care of small suppliers and small businesses.\n\nClearly, remittances are growing. In 2003, Latin American and Caribbean countries received $38 billion in remittances, compared with $23 billion just two years earlier. The value of remittances to Latin America now exceeds the value of direct business investment in this region, and the Fed is encouraging lower costs and fewer barriers to cross-border payments.\n\nAs financial services continue to evolve, I expect community banks will encounter more challenges and choices. And along the way I hope you’ll stay open to new ways of business, to be creative and test new ideas that may seem risky in the short term but could set your organization apart as a leader tomorrow.\n\nPlease don’t get me wrong. Managing change also takes discipline, and you may have to pull the plug on new initiatives that don’t work out as planned. But my point is, don’t be afraid to venture into new directions.\n\nIn today’s unstable environment, I believe the most dangerous course is to stay put. If you step back and watch the unfolding revolution in financial services, you are no longer a player. You’re a spectator. If you do not adequately address the changing needs of your customers, your competitors will do so gladly.\n\nLet me make one final suggestion. As you test new initiatives in the marketplace, make sure you give the reigns to fierce advocates for change. If your person responsible for piloting change lacks passion or is wedded to the current way of doing things, then even your best new ideas probably won’t take flight. Find a bold leader who believes in change, and let that person take charge.\n\nBelieve me, the Fed understands the pressures you face, day after day. We feel the same winds reshaping the payments industry. And looking at the horizon, I don’t envision a violent storm like the four hurricanes that hit Florida last year. But I do expect that today’s brisk pace of change will not ease any time soon.\n\nLet me close by leaving you with a thought from the philosopher and statesman Sir Francis Bacon. He lived in the relatively slow-paced world of early 17th century England, but understood well the perils of inaction. He said, “He who will not apply new remedies must expect new evils, for time is the greatest innovator.”\n\nTranslated into today’s less poetic terms, Bacon is telling us: You can either change or become obsolete. For the world of financial services that we are here to discuss, this message is especially timely, and it rings true to all of us across the centuries.",

            "content": "Rotary Club of Birmingham\n  February 23, 2005\n\nThank you for inviting me here today. I’m glad to be back at the Rotary Club \n  of Birmingham, and I’m honored that you asked me to speak on the 100th anniversary \n  of Rotary International. My own club in Atlanta is marking the same occasion \n  as I speak. Having 100-year-old Jim Head preside over this meeting makes it \n  a very special occasion. I don’t know what you do, Jim, to reach 100, but you \n  are amazing. I want to have a word with you and try to find out your secret \n  to living a long life.\n\nSpeaking of longevity, I want to discuss today a topic that is sometimes taken \n  for granted but is probably the single most important factor in our country’s \n  strong and long-lasting economic growth over the past two decades. And that \n  topic is durable low inflation, or price stability.\n\nOf course, our economy has experienced a number of significant shocks and surprises \n  in recent years, but we have come a long way since the last time I spoke to \n  you here in January 2002. And I want to begin my remarks with some background \n  on the present U.S. economic situation and outlook.\n\nThe economy today\n  And I think we have to be pretty pleased with the economic picture that’s \n  developing. Gross domestic product (or GDP) last year on an annual basis grew \n  4.4 percent, with growth in the fourth quarter easing a bit. But the real story \n  is the solid expansion of the past eight quarters, with output growing on average \n  more than 4 percent. As a point of comparison, GDP in the late 1990s grew at \n  about 4.5 percent.\n\nAlong with this solid growth in GDP, employment has now improved to the point \n  where I think we can stop talking about the so-called jobless recovery. That’s \n  because 2.3 million jobs have been added since the beginning of 2004, enough \n  to regain the employment losses since the onset of the 2001 recession.\n\nNonetheless, some people have been disappointed with our recent rate of job \n  creation, and I’d agree the pattern of hiring is different from the late 1990s, \n  when the pace of hiring for some industries resulted in acute labor shortages. \n  Nonfarm payrolls in January increased by an estimated 146,000. Manufacturing \n  employment last month was down, but new jobs were added in many other areas \n  such as education and health care—a now familiar side story. For the past year, \n  the labor market has been strong enough to absorb the steady stream of people \n  looking for work. As a result, the unemployment rate has declined from 5.7 percent \n  in January 2004 to 5.2 percent today.\n\nSo why is the labor market finally gaining traction? A major factor is stronger \n  business investment spending. You’ll remember that sharp business spending cutbacks \n  contributed to the 2001 recession.\n\nBut over the past few years businesses have reevaluated, reorganized and retooled \n  their operations in an effort to cut costs and remain competitive. And the tough \n  decisions in the business world have begun to pay off. In 2003, earnings for \n  S&P 500 businesses were up more than 18 percent, and 2004 was another good \n  year, with earnings for benchmark businesses growing at about 20 percent.\n\nProfit growth may ease somewhat this year, in part because businesses have been, \n  and will likely continue, ramping up their spending in the wake of strong capital \n  spending growth in 2004 of just over 10 percent. In their investments, businesses \n  have been focused on upgrading technology to improve competitiveness and cost \n  efficiency. In addition, it’s especially encouraging to me that a large share \n  of this investment spending now seems to be in anticipation of increasing sales \n  and growth. Overall, my sense is that new opportunities are emerging as businesses \n  continue to sort out imbalances and respond to global competitive pressure.\n\nOur regional economy illustrates the dynamics of economic change as textile \n  and apparel factories close, and we see the growth of a highly efficient automobile \n  industry, especially here in Alabama. Businesses that assemble vehicles in our \n  Sixth Federal Reserve District’s Southeast region are responsible for more than \n  34,000 direct jobs and thousands more related jobs.\n\nAs businesses evolve, consumers are holding up their end of the economy, which \n  accounts for about two-thirds of GDP. Consumer spending in recent quarters has \n  grown at rates roughly on par with GDP growth. As I told another group recently, \n  I am not inclined to bet against the American consumer.\n\nHere’s another way of looking at our current economic situation. After going \n  through a foggy stretch of road with potholes and sharp turns, the economy seems \n  to be in a stretch of more open highway. While there can always be surprises \n  around the next corner, I would add that my near-term forecast is for more of \n  the same: GDP growth in the 3 to 4 percent range, continued strong business \n  spending growth, steady employment gains along with a continuing decline in \n  the unemployment rates and low inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index \n  in the range of 2 ½ to 3 percent.\n\nRisks as always…\n  But there is more to this picture, and I think we should remind ourselves that \n  there are always risks on the road, and we should drive defensively. As examples, \n  I would like to point out three hazards, each with the potential at some point \n  to threaten our goal of sustainable and non-inflationary growth.\n\nLet’s start with the so-called twin deficits. On the private side, we face a \n  rapidly growing current account deficit, which basically means that the United \n  States is buying more goods and services from abroad than it’s selling to other \n  countries.\n\nOur country has financed this deficit by borrowing more and more from abroad \n  and using much of that debt to finance the purchase of consumer goods. Without \n  belaboring the issue, I’ll say that the accumulation of ever larger amounts \n  of debt entails a level of risk that makes me uncomfortable. I believe it’s \n  important to implement policies that encourage greater savings in our country \n  so that we do not overextend ourselves and weaken our bargaining power.\n\nSimilar concerns apply on the public side as the nation’s fiscal deficit continues \n  to climb. In testimony to Congress last week, Chairman Greenspan described “the \n  imperative to restore fiscal discipline” in the United States. It’s too \n  early to judge whether we’ll quickly get greater discipline, but I’m encouraged \n  that policymakers in Washington have started talking seriously about the nation’s \n  growing fiscal deficit. And the recent debate has emphasized that, without decisive \n  action, we face the threat of even wider imbalances in the future as shortfalls \n  in Social Security and national health care programs magnify the problem.\n\nA second hazard I would point out is the price of energy, a now familiar culprit \n  in dampening prior economic expansions. Last year, you’ll recall that oil prices \n  ran up to about $55 per barrel, and the price is now slightly more than $50. \n  Mainstream forecasts call for oil prices to fall back to below $40 a barrel \n  as supply conditions improve and global demand stabilizes.\n\nBut energy markets are hard to predict; and sustained high oil prices have a \n  negative impact on the economy. Even though energy prices are largely controlled \n  in the short term by others, we’ll have to continue to see how things develop.\n\nA third set of risks has to do with the usual tendency of an economy that’s \n  been expanding for a while to develop bottlenecks and imbalances. In the absence \n  of the appropriate policy response, these imbalances in turn can lead to unwelcome \n  inflationary pressures, the subject of most of the rest of my comments to you \n  today.\n\nThe Fed responds\n  These risks and others are taken into account as part of the Fed’s policy-making \n  process. Every six to eight weeks, the 19 members of the Federal Open Market \n  Committee meet in Washington, D.C., with Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan. We talk \n  about what recent data and grassroots insights seem to be telling us, and we \n  talk about the likely path of the economy and the emerging economic issues of \n  the day.\n\nThe FOMC’s mandate is to foster stable growth, full employment, and a climate \n  of low inflation. And our experience in this country and in other major economies \n  around the world in recent decades has taught us that price stability—defined \n  as low and stable inflation—should be a central bank’s primary focus because \n  inflation is most directly affected by monetary policy actions.\n\nBeginning with Fed Chairman Paul Volcker’s bold policy actions in the late 1970s \n  to break the back of high inflation and continuing through Chairman Greenspan’s \n  17-year tenure, the Fed has been effective in helping to create conditions that \n  have kept inflation low and relatively steady. During that time, the U.S. economy \n  has enjoyed strong economic growth and higher living standards. And I would \n  submit that much of this success was built on the bedrock of low inflation, \n  which I consider to be the state in which expected changes in the general price \n  level do not effectively alter business or household decisions.\n\nIn January, the overall consumer price index (or CPI) including the volatile \n  food and energy components, increased on a year-over-year basis by 3.0 percent. \n  The CPI a year earlier was 1.9 percent, so the rate of inflation has been rising \n  a bit, but it remains below where it was at the end of 2000, especially if you \n  look at the core inflation data. By most measures, overall inflation today continues \n  to be within the range I find consistent with the definition of price stability.\n\nWell, you might be wondering, if inflation is not a problem, why has the Fed \n  during the past 9 months been raising short-term interest rates?\n\nAnd that’s a fair question that I also have to ask myself as a participant in \n  the FOMC policy-setting process. To start, let’s briefly review the FOMC’s recent \n  policy actions. Last June, the Fed began to gradually increase the fed funds \n  target rate from an extremely accommodative level of 1 percent. In six consecutive \n  meetings, the FOMC bumped up the fed funds target rate to 2.5 percent. And the \n  real rate, or the nominal rate less core inflation, has risen to about ½ \n  percent.\n\nIn my opinion, the present fed funds rate is still accommodative, and with an \n  economic expansion that now seems to be well established I believe the FOMC \n  still has a ways to go in recalibrating monetary policy. But I won’t speculate \n  on future policy actions.\n\nThe situation with prices\n  Since last June, I believe the economy has adjusted well to the measured increases \n  in short-term rates. As I mentioned earlier, GDP growth remains strong. But \n  as one might expect at this point in the economic cycle, we now hear anecdotal \n  reports in some specific industries of some prices starting to rise.\n\nFor instance, I have heard that over the last few months equipment shortages \n  in truck and rail transportation have led to multiple price increases and that \n  fuel surcharges and other cost increases are frequently being passed on to customers. \n  I’ve been told that for the less profitable types of shipments some railroads \n  are beginning to decline renewal of contracts. As you might expect, costs for \n  shipping are felt in a wide range of industries.\n\nIn addition to higher shipping costs, prices of many industrial materials have \n  risen. For instance, prices for steel, copper and aluminum have all increased \n  dramatically in the last year as China and other developing countries have added \n  to demand as they move to expand their industrial capacity.\n\nWhile we still have many unemployed workers and pressures in unit labor costs \n  have continued to be modest, there have been some reports of significant wage \n  increases among higher-skilled and professional workers.\n\nAlso, rising health care costs are well known and show no sign of abatement \n  as medical innovations and new drugs continue to come on line and are being \n  used extensively. Of course, employers wind up paying for much of these higher \n  medical costs, further adding to overall business cost pressures.\n\nAs a policymaker, these anecdotal reports remind me to stay alert. But it’s \n  important to keep in mind that isolated price increases are not the same as \n  an unwelcome rise in average prices as measured by our inflation indexes. Because \n  of fierce competition, many businesses that compete globally are in fact reluctant \n  to pass along higher input costs. These pressures have made price increases \n  for domestic services more prevalent than those for consumer goods.\n\nIndeed, a low-price revolution has transformed many consumer markets. Because \n  of productivity improvements and global supply chain innovations, prices have \n  fallen and continue to decline for computers, electronics and many other mass-produced \n  goods available in your local discount store.\n\nMoreover, consumers always have the choice of responding to higher prices by \n  scaling back purchases of that product or buying an alternative. In our flexible \n  economy, this so-called substitution effect is a powerful deterrent to a broad-based \n  rise in inflation.\n\nStaying ahead of expectations\n  The trick to guarding against an unwelcome run-up of inflation is to prevent \n  the spread of price increases across sectors where they show up in a basket \n  of all prices. And that means preventing the emergence of the expectation of \n  rising inflation, an insidious cycle where people rush to buy before prices \n  rise further. In my view, the policy path we’ve been on has helped to restrain \n  inflationary pressures—at least for now.\n\nAs we keep an eye on prices, it’s important to keep in mind that monetary policy \n  acts with a considerable lag, and economic circumstances can and do change quickly. \n  If you wait to see concrete evidence that inflation has taken hold, then it’s \n  already too late to stop it.\n\nTo illustrate my point, let me use a football analogy. That is, the best defense \n  is a good offense that maintains control of the ball. What does that mean for \n  the Federal Reserve? I believe it means we must constantly anticipate and act \n  to prevent problems from emerging. And if we are successful, we should never \n  see problems with out-of-control rising prices. Our opponent is an unwelcome \n  level of inflation, and in that game we don’t want to play catch-up.\n\nAs price pressures begin to build, I believe appropriate increases in the fed \n  funds target rate will help to prevent rising inflation and encourage desirable \n  outcomes such as increased saving. The Fed must be willing to make the necessary \n  policy moves, and that’s what the FOMC has been doing since June of last year.\n\nThe era of low inflation\n  The era of low inflation has been with us for a while, so it’s tempting \n  to drift into complacency. And I must say that temptation concerns me. Certainly, \n  the Fed plays an important role in helping to prevent unwelcome inflation, but \n  we can’t do it alone. Influential people like you also need to understand \n  the high stakes involved.\n\nLow inflation is important for many reasons. For one thing, rising and unstable \n  prices erode business confidence and distort investment decisions. Unwelcome \n  inflation wastes real resources as people expend time and effort to preserve \n  their wealth, and it is an unfair tax. As the Nobel Prize–winning economist \n  Milton Friedman once said, “Inflation is the one form of taxation that \n  can be imposed without legislation.” You can’t find any examples of \n  economies that have enjoyed sustainable growth and prosperity in a climate of \n  steadily rising inflation.\n\nPlease don’t get me wrong. Today the U.S. economy has a lot working in its favor. \n  To recap the picture I have just tried to paint for you, I believe that on its \n  present course our economy should continue to grow at a solid rate, that employment \n  should strengthen and that inflation should remain under control.\n\nLet me close by suggesting that we appreciate and enjoy low and stable inflation \n  for what it is: the foundation supporting economic growth. And let’s make sure \n  we do what it takes to ensure price stability for the future.\n\n# # #",

            "content": "Rotary Club of Atlanta\nCharles Loudermilk Conference Center\nJanuary 10, 2005\n\nOnce again, it’s an honor for me to share my thoughts with you on the economic outlook at the start of the new year.\n\nOver the holidays, I spent some time with my children and grandchildren at \n  our family’s cabin in the North Georgia mountains. And while enjoying the \n  peace and quiet I began to reflect on comments from certain business leaders \n  in Atlanta including some of you in this room. We all know this city is a great \n  place for business. But the 2001 recession was tough on our community, and we \n  can all think of local industries and organizations that are still adjusting \n  to the 21st century. Business leaders in Atlanta and elsewhere value the importance \n  of making hard choices now to grow stronger later, and I was reminded that in \n  many ways this theme of understanding the ongoing changes in our economy and \n  thinking for the long term applies to policymakers as well.\n\nLooking at today’s economy, there is a lot of good news to report. Up front, I’m pleased to say that 2004 turned out to be a very solid year. We can look back on many positive developments in the real economy, including improved labor markets, strong business spending growth, and continuing low inflation. And I want to leave you with the impression that I expect this momentum to continue this year and beyond.\n\nAs a way of thinking about some of the most important economic forces at work, I want to discuss four key stories from 2004. In no particular order, these are: renewed employment growth, energy prices, our nation’s worsening current account and fiscal deficits, and the changing stance of monetary policy.\n\n2004 labor markets\n\tLet’s start with jobs:  2004 was the year that labor markets moved out of the rut of jobless recovery and onto the path of growth—finally. Over the past 12 months, the U.S. economy gained 2.2 million jobs, averaging about 186,000 jobs each month. And the unemployment rate declined from 5.7 to 5.4 percent.\n\nWhile job growth last year was less than we were accustomed to seeing in the late 1990s, we should remember how much the business climate has changed during the past five years. Some factors to keep in mind are the recession, terrorist attacks on U.S. soil and two subsequent wars, accounting scandals and greater scrutiny of corporate governance, and steep increases in energy and health care costs.\n\nTogether, these major developments have shaped business attitudes and help to explain lingering caution among business leaders. In today’s climate of unrelenting competition, it is understandable that businesses have been obsessed with efficiency and have been reluctant to hire at a pace that many had expected.\n\nOther structural factors have been at play in U.S. labor markets as well. Since 2000, growth in the number of people entering the labor force slowed to less than 1 percent a year, which is the lowest sustained rate of growth since World War II. By comparison during the 1970s, the labor force grew at more than twice that pace.\n\nOur Atlanta Fed economists have been analyzing the labor supply, which varies depending on many factors such as immigration and demographics. And in recent years these and other broad factors have acted to restrain labor force growth.\n\nAs a result, even though last year’s hiring was not up to the pace seen in the late 1990s, there were more than enough new jobs created to absorb the flow of people entering the labor force and to nudge down the unemployment rate.\n\nEnergy\n\tThe second big economic story of 2004 was energy.  You’ll recall that oil prices began 2004 at about $34 a barrel and by October had leaped to a record $55 a barrel. While oil prices have fallen back somewhat since that peak, they remain well above what many thought were long-term levels.\n\nFor much of last year, geopolitical troubles in the oil-rich Middle East altered energy supplies. Then, in the third quarter, Hurricane Ivan disrupted oil production in the Gulf of Mexico. On the demand side, strong economic growth in China and other major economies helped to boost energy consumption around the world.\n\nAll of these factors led to a run-up in energy prices that dampened overall economic growth last year, by some estimates subtracting approximately three quarters of a percentage point from last year’s GDP growth of about 4 percent.\n\nBut there was another story within the story of last year’s energy price shock, and that is the resilience of the U.S. economy. When higher gas prices took spending away from other goods and services, consumers did not panic.  And when many businesses were hit with unanticipated energy costs, most were able to absorb or offset the added costs without widespread price increases that could have fueled inflationary pressures.\n\nCertainly, energy costs remain a wild card as we go into 2005, even though it looks like the economy has and will continue to become more energy efficient and will adjust to new price levels. But if oil prices stay high as oil futures suggest, then I expect we will hear new calls to reform energy policies and invest in new energy technologies.\n\nMoreover, let’s keep in mind that many of our oil supplies and future oil reserves are found in parts of the world that are not the most politically stable. All of these factors suggest we continue to keep a wary eye on energy as a pivotal economic issue and potential source of risk.\n\nDeficits\n\tMy third big economic story of 2004 concerns the so-called twin deficits—the current account deficit and our fiscal deficit. Basically, the current account deficit is jargon that means the United States is buying more goods and services from abroad than it’s selling there.\n\nWhen such a deficit occurs, it has to be financed, and in recent years we have done so by borrowing from abroad. In 2004, total outstanding credit extended to the United States by foreigners was $4.5 trillion, up from $1.2 trillion in 1994. During the past decade, the percentage of total outstanding credit extended by foreign lenders in U.S. capital markets increased from 7 percent to almost 13 percent.\n\nNow, borrowing isn’t necessarily bad, especially when the proceeds are used to purchase capital goods. During the late 1990s, U.S. borrowing served to increase our country’s productive capacity and productivity. But I’m concerned to see this pattern has changed.\n\nFor the first half of the 1990s the United States’ current account deficit amounted to less than 2 percent of GDP.  Today the current account deficit is near 6 percent of GDP and rising. So our country is going deeper into debt to pay for consumption instead of investment, and in my view this trend is undesirable and at some point unsustainable.\n\nIf our current account deficit continues to grow, foreign investors can’t be counted on to keep lending to the United States on the same terms as in the past. Indeed, investors in 2004 began to diversify their dollar holdings. As they did so, from June through December the dollar fell about 10 percent relative to the euro.\n\nThese pressures are made even more worrisome because we are using part of the proceeds from borrowing abroad to finance our current account deficit while we are also using part to finance our growing domestic fiscal deficit—the other twin.\n\nIn 2005, our fiscal policymakers have an excellent chance to strengthen the nation’s economic foundations by demonstrating a renewed commitment to reducing the federal budget deficit. Also, we face the more daunting task to confront looming deficits for Social Security and even more costly medical programs.\n\nLarge fiscal deficit spending may boost the economy in the short-term. But history has not been kind to countries that run excessive fiscal deficits. At some point, too much fiscal deficit spending increases risks to economic growth and potentially constrains the effectiveness of monetary policy.\n\nSpeaking of monetary policy, I would add a fourth 2004 economic development that I am sure has not gone unnoticed—the Fed’s decision to begin the process of withdrawing some of the extraordinarily accommodative monetary policy that had been in place for the better part of 4 years. With the Fed funds rate at a 40-year low level of 1 percent, the Fed’s Open Market Committee last June announced the first 25 basis point increase. Then there were additional adjustments at our meetings in August, September, November and December, bringing the Fed funds target rate to its current 2 ¼ percent rate.\n\nThe movement back toward a more neutral interest rate environment should contribute to a more sustainable and balanced economic environment. I might describe our recent policy actions as a form of preventive maintenance that helps to ensure low inflation in the future while facilitating a transition toward other desirable outcomes such as less borrowing and more saving. The adjustment we began in 2004 so far has gone smoothly and, I would submit, has been much less disruptive than the alternative of waiting for risks to emerge and then having to move rates up more reactively and more aggressively.\n\n2005 outlook\n\tLooking into 2005, I think our economy is positioned nicely to continue solid growth. I’m comfortable with consensus forecasts for annualized GDP growth for this year of about 3 ½ to 4 percent. That projected output growth rate is in line with the past 11 quarters, although GDP growth has picked up recently and averaged about 4 ½  percent for the past 6 quarters—about the same as the late 1990s. I would say that our recent output growth has been and should remain pretty doggone good.\n\nLet me mention some of the other economic issues I’m watching in 2005. Consumer spending last year grew at just under 4 percent, and this year we’ll see how consumers adjust to interest rates consistent with a strengthening economy and high levels of household debt. But I am reluctant to bet against the American consumer, and I expect consumer spending growth for 2005 to keep supporting our economic expansion, especially if energy prices continue to moderate.\n\nEven if the growth in consumer spending eases a bit, most of corporate America is flush with cash. During the third quarter, non-financial corporations increased their liquid assets by 14 percent to more than $1.3 trillion.\n\nSlowly but surely, this liquidity will make its way into the economy. Business investment in equipment and facilities increased about 9 percent in 2004, and computer and software spending rose 16 percent. Forecasts of continued strong business spending growth in 2005 are, in my view, entirely plausible.\n\nAnd continued business spending growth should help sustain further employment growth.\n\nMonetary policy\n\tClearly, full employment is a desirable outcome, but it is not the Fed’s only objective. Indeed, most central bankers would argue that price stability should be their primary focus since inflation is most directly affected by monetary policy actions. In recent years, inflation has been well contained. For example, the core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) deflator increased at a 1.5 percent rate last year, compared with 1.3 percent in 2003.\n\nBut good central bankers stay alert to change in the inflation outlook. Although I do not think a significant pickup in inflation is imminent, I continue to be struck by talk of price increases that my business contacts say they are planning as the economy expands. Low capacity utilization is often cited as a factor that helps to keep prices down. But capacity utilization has been rising steadily and may be underestimated given the number of obsolete factories that have been shut down and are not expected to reopen. Moreover, there probably is a limit to how long businesses can leverage productivity gains to hold prices down.\n\nOther potential inflationary pressures in the year ahead could come from past energy cost increases and higher prices of some imported goods. Labor costs are yet another variable. Although we still have a large supply of unemployed workers, I am now hearing more about shortages of skilled workers and that wages for some of those jobs are beginning to climb. For all of these reasons, I will be closely watching prices and inflation expectations.\n\nCommunication changes\n\tYou may have noticed that markets have taken the Fed’s recent policy moves pretty much in stride. And I am inclined to think our recent steps to communicate more openly have eased the adjustment to our policy changes.\n\nThe Fed has not always been so transparent. Until 1994 there was no announcement after each FOMC meeting. This approach gave rise to a cottage industry of “Fed watchers” devoted to interpreting our policy actions and likely policy direction.\n\nNow, on the afternoon of each FOMC meeting, we announce our action and provide brief comments on the most important economic developments and economic outlook. And in 2003, our statements began offering some insights into the likely path of policy.\n\nThis forward-looking information is clearly helpful to financial markets. And \n  let me add that I support our movement toward greater transparency. But the \n  additional language has limitations and some potential drawbacks. First, the \n  short post-meeting statements cannot possibly convey the full range of views \n  expressed by 19 men and women who take part in the FOMC policy discussions.\n\nWe are aware of this limitation and recently moved to fill the potential information \n  gap. Just last week the Fed for the first time released the detailed minutes \n  3 weeks after a meeting instead of waiting 6–8 weeks. It is my hope that the \n  speedier release of our discussion will underscore the wide range of views and \n  vigorous debate that shape our monetary policy.\n\nBut the timing of the minutes is unlikely to redress a second drawback to the FOMC’s brief post-meeting statement. That is, the risk that some might perceive our forward-looking language on policy as a pre-commitment to some very specific policy path.\n\nAs we know well, we can be surprised by developments as they actually unfold. Even the best data often get revised.  Trends get misread. And economic shocks are a fact of life.  It is not possible for the Fed to remove all “policy risk” from financial markets. And with this potential for uncertainty the Fed in June added a phrase to our post-meeting statement that reads, “The Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to price stability.”\n\nStill, I read a report in the media just a few weeks ago that referred to the Fed “keeping its pledge” for a “measured pace” of rate increases. Guess what? I don’t think the Fed ever made such a pledge, and I think it’s unfortunate that our effort to offer some insight into our policy inclination is sometimes misconstrued.\n\nEven with a very capable staff of economists, the best forecasting models we know how to build, mountains of economic data and very helpful grassroots’ insights from business and community leaders, the FOMC like everyone else can be surprised by events. And it is vital that we maintain the flexibility to respond with the best policy action that comes from each FOMC discussion, even if sometimes that has the potential to surprise some in financial markets.\n\nFinally, let me say that I cannot and will not speculate on future policy moves. That’s why we hold our regular FOMC meetings. Although the basic direction of policy has been more obvious than usual for the last year or so, it will likely become less clear and perhaps more difficult to communicate as we approach the equilibrium or neutral interest rate that is consistent with economic activity at its potential and with low and stable inflation.\n\nThere has been a lot of talk about the neutral or equilibrium rate, and I expect many of you are asking, “Are we there yet?” My personal view is that if the economy stays on the present path of solid growth, then rates have not yet returned to equilibrium. As I noted earlier, I do not see an imminent threat of inflation, and I am comfortable with our gradual monetary policy adjustments—at least for now.\n\nFacing the future\nI hope that I have stressed that our future policy hinges on the performance of the real economy. And I hope I have left you with a broad picture of an economy moving into 2005 with steady output growth, with labor markets gaining strength, with solid business spending growth and with inflation under control.\n\nOf course, our work is never done. And as we are tested, I would also hope that fiscal and monetary policy will work in tandem, and I would urge policymakers to learn from business leaders who have already made hard choices to prepare for the long term.\n\nSpending time over the holidays with the kids and grandkids at our place in the Blue Ridge mountains really brought home to me what the future is all about. And as we move ahead let’s get the right things done to build a solid economic foundation for today and tomorrow.\n\nPress Release",

            "content": "TAPPI Decorative and Industrial Laminates Symposium\n  Omni Hotel at CNN Center\n  August 25, 2004\n\nThank you for the nice introduction. And good afternoon. Not long ago, Linn Yeager was kind enough to come by my office and talk to me about TAPPI and your symposium here in Atlanta. He tells me there are people in the audience not only from the United States but also from Austria, India and Chile, among many other countries. What I admire in particular is how you all compete in the global economy. Like the athletes in the Olympics, you contend with the best. And you must be in top condition every day.\n\nAs president of the Atlanta Fed and a participant in Federal Open Market Committee policy debates and decisions, I spend a lot of time meeting with economists and going over data about economic growth, prices and labor markets. It’s important work, and, frankly, the job is fascinating and quite satisfying. But sometimes the process of economic analysis and monetary policy can get theoretical and pretty far removed from the hard facts of business life.\n\nSo, when I’m away from the office, I sometimes like to work with my hands. I grew up in the mountains of Virginia, where my father was a high school teacher who taught the farm boys woodworking, among other subjects. And I spent a lot of time in his shop. While I won’t profess expertise in working with your laminate products, I still do a little woodworking when I get the chance. In fact, I plan to come back downtown this weekend to visit the woodworking show next door.\n\nIn a sense, I think of the big woodworking show as kind of a microcosm of our economy. You find terrific energy in one place, and the pace of innovation is relentless as people from around the world constantly devise new and better ways of doing things. The types of tools and materials on display now would have seemed unimaginable in my father’s day.\n\nWhen I think about the non-stop transition in our economy, I am reminded of a phrase coined by the late Joseph Schumpeter, an Austrian economist who taught at Harvard. The phrase I’m referring to is “creative destruction.”\n\nIn regard to manufacturing, we’ve heard a lot lately about destruction of jobs and industries, but not much about the creative part. We’ve been told that jobs are moving overseas. We’ve been told that Americans can’t compete in a world of low cost labor and that we risk becoming a nation of service providers.\n\nWell, some of these points are valid. China and other countries have emerged as manufacturing powerhouses. And in the United States roughly 3 million manufacturing jobs were lost between July 2000 and the low point of January 2004, and a lot of workers and their families in this country have languished as a result.\n\nBut there is more to the story. Despite the upheaval, I want to stress the point today that manufacturing remains vital to our nation’s economic health and balance. To borrow a phrase from Mark Twain, the news of manufacturing’s death has been greatly exaggerated. But we should not expect the future of manufacturing to resemble what we have seen in the past.\n\nI plan to say more about manufacturing in a moment. But to build a foundation for that discussion, I’d like to first take some time to discuss the U.S. and global economic outlook.\n\nEconomic outlook\nFor a while now, I’ve been talking about how our economy has steadily gained strength. During and after the recession of 2001, consumer spending provided a rock-solid foundation for the U.S. economy. And as growth resumed, business spending began to pick up, industry by industry. Then, last summer and fall output growth roared ahead. The only missing piece of the expansion was employment. And earlier this year, it looked like job growth, finally, was starting to gain a foothold.\n\nThis hopeful outlook, however, might seem at odds with some recent economic data. Output growth at 3 percent for the second quarter was below expectations, and job growth in July slowed to a trickle.\n\nLet me be clear: I don’t like to read too much into a month or two of data. But in light of recent reports, I would concede that it’s fair to question what’s ahead. You might ask if the economy is getting bogged down for an extended stretch of eroding growth. Or are we just going through another brief soft patch on our way to sustainable recovery?\n\nBefore I give you my answer to that question, let me acknowledge up front that persistently high energy prices have placed an unusual burden on consumers. And I suspect consumer spending has been slowed by heightened concern about terrorism related to the U.S. presidential election, the Olympics and other events. Certainly, these developments help to explain some of the recent loss of momentum.\n\nWith regard to employment, I take some comfort in looking back at monthly data over time. Even during the boom period of the 1990s, we saw fairly wide fluctuations in job growth from month to month. New job creation this spring was impressive, but over the summer it faltered. There are still more than a million fewer jobs than there were at the beginning of 2001. Clearly, we need more jobs to sustain growth.\n\nThe employment riddle can be explained in part by a return of caution among some business leaders. Certainly, if you look at corporate balance sheets and profits, the United States business sector is in remarkably good shape. But it appears that many leaders of large businesses remain uneasy about adding to payrolls. And this reluctance is understandable given the geopolitical developments and high energy price risks I just outlined, along with continued productivity gains. At this point, it appears businesses are still inclined to squeeze the last ounce out of existing staff while leveraging new technology to operate as efficiently as possible. Even with these constraints I think we should continue to get sufficient job growth to gradually push the unemployment rate lower, although we should not be surprised at large month-to-month fluctuations in the employment data.\n\nIf you look at the economy sector by sector, the likelihood of solid and sustainable growth looks good. Homebuilding is holding up well, and exports are growing nicely along with steadily rising world GDP. Here in the Southeast, tourists have returned and future bookings are reported to be strong. My contacts in commercial real estate, one of the last sectors to gain in the recovery, have become more optimistic, with more new projects in the planning stages.\n\nEven manufacturing, which in some industries was ill-equipped for global competition only 18 months ago, has become more lean and fit and is now contributing to growth. The Institute of Supply Management’s manufacturing index rose in July for the ninth straight month, and manufacturing production was up at a solid rate just over 7 percent during the second quarter. Manufacturing payrolls edged up 10,000 in July and so far this year have increased by 81,000.\n\nPrice pressures\nI’ve been saying for a while that this recovery would be unusual, and, sure enough, the twists keep coming. A few months ago, we started to hear frequent reports of price increases and the return of pricing power in a number of industries. An upward trend in broad inflation measures also was evident. But more recently there are signs that these price pressures may be starting to ease. At the same time, I am not yet willing to conclude that all of the price pressures we’ve seen will turn out to be transitory. While many of the increases associated with high prices for oil and other commodities should reverse in time, I continue to be struck by the extent of cost pass-through. In fields where demand is strong and growing, we are seeing price increases beginning to stick.\n\nAlthough troublesome inflation problems do not seem imminent, a continuation of accommodative monetary policy is not appropriate as the economic expansion gains momentum and breadth. And as you know, the FOMC this year raised the Fed funds target rate by a quarter of a percentage point at both our June and our August meetings. I would like to emphasize that these policy moves were not taken, as some have suggested, because policy makers believed the economy was growing too fast. Rather the data and anecdotal reports we have at this time continue to suggest we can work our way toward a more neutral interest rate setting in a “measured” way. The objective is to pave the way for sustainable growth. But it’s important to keep in mind that we can all be surprised by output and price developments as they unfold, and as our June and August statements noted, the FOMC has the flexibility and “will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed...”\n\nAs I mentioned a moment ago, the rise in energy prices has been an unwelcome \n  development. The cost of a barrel of oil has climbed by about a third this year \n  to about $45. Stronger economic growth around the world — especially in Asia — \n  has boosted demand for oil. At the same time, constraints in refinery capacity \n  coupled with geopolitical problems have disrupted supplies to an unusual extent. \n  I have no better basis than oil futures markets for speculating as to how long \n  this climate will continue. However, the longer oil prices remain at or near \n  these all-time high levels, the greater the shock to the economy.\n\nAs you know, rising oil prices ripple through our economy, forcing airlines, trucking companies and other businesses to adjust by looking for more ways to cut costs, by absorbing the added costs in their profits or by passing along those costs to their customers. As I noted earlier, consumers also take a hit. Because they are paying more for gasoline and for other essentials such as heating oil, they have less money to spend elsewhere.\n\nThere was clear evidence of slower consumer spending in June, but retail sales and housing starts bounced back in July. Looking ahead, my sense is that the recent softness in the economy, while somewhat disappointing, is more fleeting than fixed. I expect momentum to resume, and I think we’ll see good output and job growth over coming quarters. Consumers probably won’t open their wallets as wide as they did in 2003, but I anticipate a return to respectable consumer spending, consistent with an acceptable pace of growth in GDP.\n\nA key reason I believe the economy will stay on course is the increasing breadth of the expansion we’ve seen since last summer. Business spending growth is now comparable to the 1990s following a sharp decline in 2001. Industry by industry, businesses have resumed the trend of investing heavily in productivity enhancing technologies such as new computers and industrial equipment. And capacity is being expanded in industries where demand has come back strongly.\n\nAll of the money businesses are pouring into new equipment is helping to reinvigorate the manufacturing sector in particular. But as we look ahead, it’s important to understand how manufacturing is changing, and that’s what I’d like to discuss for the next few moments.\n\nManufacturing over the long run\nAmerican factories are more efficient than ever in terms of how labor is used. But this is not a new trend as manufacturers have employed fewer and fewer workers going back half a century. In 1955, more than 30 percent of American non-farm workers were employed in manufacturing. That figure was around 11 percent in 2003. Despite this, the U.S. share of the value of manufacturing output remains essentially unchanged. I expect you have seen and felt this sea change of improved productivity that has enabled businesses to cut payrolls and still boost output.\n\nIn certain ways, the plight of manufacturing employment is similar to what has already occurred in agriculture. Over many decades, farm production became largely automated. Since 1955, agricultural employment has declined steadily from more than 10 percent to less than 2 percent of total civilian employment in the United States.\n\nYet, as with manufacturing, agricultural output has continued to increase, along with the U.S. share of the value of agricultural output. And today, America remains a leading exporter of farm products.\n\nSo I think you can see how technical innovation applies over time to increase labor productivity. As these gains take hold, our standard of living improves through higher profits, increased wages and better and often cheaper goods.\n\nThe human consequences\nIt’s hard for me to be dispassionate about job losses, especially since manufacturing is part of the American identity and has supported so many workers and their families. As a policy maker, I believe it’s important to try to better grasp the human consequences of “creative destruction.”\n\nIn this regard, our Atlanta Fed economists have been analyzing restricted data from the Georgia Department of Labor. They examined how business cycles influence hiring and compensation for workers who have switched jobs. Our research found that workers who left manufacturing jobs during the 2001 recession wound up in worse shape, in terms of wages in their next job, than the folks who switched jobs during the long expansion of the 1990s. Notably, the ones who fared the worst were laid off by facilities that were shutting down completely. In part, this is because a plant shutting down floods the local labor market with new job seekers. These workers suffered a wage loss nearly twice as large as workers who left firms that were merely downsizing.\n\nI’m sharing this research with you because it casts light on some of the wounds inflicted by a weak economy. As economic growth improves, workers of all stripes face much brighter prospects. But, at the risk of oversimplifying, our job market still has trouble matching supply and demand for skills. There are job shortages in growing fields, such as health care and education. And there is demand for skilled tradesmen, such as electricians and plumbers. Typically, however, workers in these fields must have years of training.\n\nOne of the biggest problems in this country is the large number of people who want to work but don’t qualify for decent job openings. When I think about what can be done to help workers to cope with global competitive pressure, I am reminded again of my father. As I said earlier, he taught woodworking and other useful trades, and he encouraged learning as a lifelong process. I believe we would strengthen our society and our economy by investing more in programs to teach adults skills for the modern workplace.\n\nThe future of manufacturing\nNot long ago, I had a glimpse into the future of manufacturing in, of all places, Canton, Mississippi, just outside of Jackson. Canton is the site of a new Nissan plant, where they make Quest minivans and other vehicles. When I toured the facility, which cost $1.4 billion, I was really impressed by the use of technology. Wherever possible, Nissan installed robotics to enhance productivity. But a skilled workforce still is needed to run and maintain the machines, and some auto assembly processes remain labor intensive. Nissan employs about 4,000 full-time workers in Canton. Many of these jobs offer very good compensation and require higher education and advanced skills. This highly efficient and cost-effective manufacturing facility, along with other new auto-related facilities that have opened in the Southeast over the past decade, have helped to take the place of less skilled and more labor-intensive manufacturing that has moved to other parts of the world.\n\nTo compete in today’s economy, we have to play to our strengths. Here in the Southeast, many apparel plants have closed permanently because they have not been able to offset high-wage costs in a labor-intensive business. In various industries, companies are succeeding by filling specialty niches where the business model stresses quick delivery of unique products. You may see the same forces at work in your business, where some of the leading suppliers operate from high-wage markets in Europe.\n\nAs jobs and capital ebb and flow across borders, we hear more calls to manage trade and stop jobs from moving overseas. Maybe it’s possible to stem some of the job losses, at least for a while. But, in my nonpartisan view, I believe that in the long run barriers to capital and trade almost always prove futile, like building fences to keep out the crows.\n\nGiven the turbulence in our interconnected economy, you may have to look hard to find progress. But I assure you it’s there. Go to the woodworking show here in Atlanta, and you’ll see hundreds of professionals looking for ways to do their work better. Who knows? Maybe a cabinetmaker will learn about some new piece of equipment that enables him to do more refined work and finish jobs more quickly. His investment may pay for itself in a few months, and it could lead to a better standard of living for his family and lower prices and better products for his customers.\n\nIn our global economy, the innovation is relentless, while the opportunity is endless. I know change is hard. But the economic outlook continues to improve. And I hope you’ll agree that businesses and workers around the world are better off when they are free to compete with the best.\n\nThank you for allowing me to share these thoughts, and perhaps I’ll see some of you at the woodworking show.",

            "content": "Databank Real Estate Symposium\nAtlanta History Center\nJune 11, 2004\n\nGood morning, everyone. While preparing my remarks for you, I thought about some comments that I got in response to a speech I gave in March to, coincidentally, another Atlanta real estate audience. Maybe some of you were there. After I talked about the possible unintended consequences of keeping interest rates too low for too long, a number of people said to me, “Jack, we like rates just where they are, thanks. Please do what you can to keep them low.”\n\nAs always, I appreciate the feedback, and I expect many of you here this morning might agree with that suggestion. Taking a bit of license in interpreting these comments, what I’m hearing is advice about using monetary policy to help keep the economy growing at a healthy pace.\n\nWhile I share your concerns about sustaining growth, my perspective as a policymaker may be different from yours as a businessperson. Speaking only for myself, I will say more in a few moments about where I think we are in the current economic expansion. But at this point I would preface those remarks with the general observation that the economy now seems to have solid, broad-based momentum. This momentum brings with it a new set of issues that policymakers must understand and take into account.\n\nFinally, job growth\nFirst, let’s talk more about the path the economy seems to be taking. By far the biggest positive story for the economy so far this year is job growth. During the first five months of 2004, the U.S. economy added nearly 1.2 million jobs, with monthly gains for the past three months averaging about 315,000. Since last August, when payrolls were at their weakest level, the economy has netted 1.4 million new jobs, making up more than half of the jobs lost since employment peaked in March 2001.\n\nNow, don’t get me wrong. Finding a job is still tough, especially for those who don’t have skills in demand.  But I’m encouraged that employment gains this year have been fairly broad based across sectors, from business services to leisure and hospitality, along with the stalwarts of health care and education.\n\nEven the most beleaguered sectors of our economy appear to be on the mend. Despite all of the talk about jobs moving overseas, manufacturing employment actually has increased so far this year by 91,000, with particular strength in durable goods.\n\nYet despite the economy’s good progress, there are at least some sectors that have not yet worked through all of their economic imbalances. And you’re familiar with the still-elusive recovery in nonresidential construction, because of the relatively high vacancy rates for office and industrial space. But, as you know, commercial real estate is a business that tends to lag the overall economy.\n\nMoreover, much of the economy’s progress over the past two or three years has been driven by housing and consumer spending. And this growth was fueled not by business spending and job creation but instead by low-cost borrowing and increases in disposable income induced by tax cuts.\n\nThe economy finally began to gain traction in mid-2003. Increased business spending was a clear sign of progress. After two years of cutting costs and digesting technology investments from the late 1990s, business managers regained their confidence and began to look ahead to a new period of rising demand. Investment in equipment and software has been growing again for the past 8 quarters and increased on a year-to-year basis by 12.5 percent in the first quarter of 2004.\n\nAs business spending was picking up, the consumer also continued to spend at a surprisingly fast rate. With interest rates still very low, retailers offered cars and other big-ticket items with financing incentives including little or no money down. Consumers continued to open their wallets, which were flush with extra cash thanks to tax cuts and mortgage refinancing.\n\nThis new combination of consumer and business spending last fall gave us GDP growth of more than 8 percent in the third quarter, followed by GDP growth of 4.1 and 4.4 percent in the two most recent quarters. Over the past year, output has grown by 5 percent, exceeding the average rate of growth reached during the boom years of the mid and late 1990s.\n\nBut more than two years into the expansion following the 2001 recession, labor markets languished and observers of the economy, including me, struggled to explain why job growth was lagging strong GDP growth to such an extent. Fortunately, as I noted earlier, job growth has emerged following the improvement in business confidence and spending.\n\nWith broad-based economic expansion more solidly in place, most forecasters expect GDP growth of 4-5 percent over the rest of 2004 and into 2005.\n\nInflation outlook\nToday, we face a new challenge as our economy goes through yet another phase of adjustment. Over the first half of this year, an important shift in price movements and the inflation outlook has occurred.\n\nFor much of last year, core consumer prices (excluding food and energy) continued to move lower, maintaining a pattern of disinflation that took core inflation to about 1 percent. Extremely low inflation in the context of a weakening economy can be a concern because it puts policymakers, along with our economy, in unfamiliar territory. As disinflation continued to emerge after 2001, some commentators recalled the Great Depression, when the Fed’s efforts to stabilize the economy were ineffective. While such an extreme case of deflation was most unlikely during the past few years, I think it’s understandable why the Fed became concerned when the nominal interest rate fell toward zero.\n\nAbout a year ago, in June 2003, our Federal Open Market Committee lowered the Fed funds target rate for the thirteenth time in 30 months, bringing that rate to where it stands today at one percent, a 40-year low. At that time, the FOMC statement cited a minor probability of an “unwelcome substantial fall in inflation.”\n\nThis year, a measurably different picture has emerged. Our strengthening economic expansion has brought a flurry of price increases and the apparent return of pricing power in some industries. That shift — from a period of disinflation to upward price movements — can be seen in various inflation measures, in anecdotal reports coming from our various contacts and in some measures of future inflation expectations. It is important for us to understand these forces, which help to shape our policy deliberations.\n\nThe price index for personal consumption expenditures, one of our preferred measures of inflation, has risen from 1.8 percent on average last year to a rate of about 3 percent so far this year. Over this same period, the core PCE index, which excludes the volatile food and energy components, moved from about .8 percent to 1.7 percent this year.\n\nIn addition to the formal measures of inflation, our Reserve Bank directors and other contacts have shared with us a growing list of higher prices, reduced discounts and newly found pricing power. For instance, over the past year, the price of lumber is up 22 percent, plywood has increased 52 percent and fabricated wire is up 22 percent. Some residential developers, where business has been so strong, have been able to pass along these higher prices to buyers, while those of you in commercial development with longer lead times have tended to absorb the increased costs.\n\nThe price of food also has increased sharply, with dairy products up 22 percent from a year ago and meats, poultry and fish increasing by an average of 10 percent. The list goes on: carbon scrap steel is up 65 percent, and with the price of oil up about 20 percent this year shipping and logistics costs have risen substantially. In many parts of the country including Atlanta, hotel room rates are higher.\n\nSo how are consumers and businesses supposed to react? Well, as buyers of goods and services, we have choices. We can buy fewer of the now-pricey items and substitute other purchases from other providers. For instance, underlying demand for larger SUVs has softened since last year as the price of gasoline has risen.  At the same time, demand for smaller fuel-efficient vehicles has increased. And I’ve read reports that the waiting list for hybrid fuel cars has lengthened considerably.\n\nMoreover, we often hear of price increases that don’t “stick” with consumers. For instance, major airlines have been trying to raise fares but have often been unsuccessful because of competition from low-cost carriers. And so there are some forces that will work to resist price increases.\n\nSo, taking the statistical reports and anecdotal data together, where are we on the inflation front?  When viewed in the historical context and measured in the aggregate, the rate of inflation we are currently seeing appears to be comparable to rates observed just prior to 2001. In my mind, these are acceptable levels for inflation and fall within my own definition of price stability.\n\nAt the same time, I don’t want to dismiss the compelling evidence of rising prices. As I have tried to suggest, a great deal depends on how much of the recent spate of price increases turns out to be transitory. And I would conclude that these recent developments on the price front warrant significant attention in our analysis and policy debates.\n\nAlso critical is the human factor that economists refer to as inflation expectations. Following our May 4 FOMC meeting, our statement noted that long-term inflation expectations remain well contained. Simply put, financial markets and business decision makers do not seem to expect inflation to move appreciably higher over the longer term.\n\nOn the other hand, various near-term inflation forecasts have increased, suggesting there is some expectation that recent price pressures may persist, at least for a while. Not only is it important that we prevent appreciable price increases from taking hold, but it is vital that we maintain the Fed’s credibility for following a policy path that keeps inflation in check over the long haul.\n\nPolicy implications\nPolicymakers on the FOMC are responsible for sorting out all of the developments I have just discussed as we continue to try to use monetary policy to help advance our long-run objective. And that objective, by the way, is sustainable economic growth with price stability and employment growth that contributes to a continuing improvement in our standard of living.\n\nWith my early career training in engineering, I still sometimes find myself wishing our economic forecasts and our understanding of the key variables were more concrete — more black and white, if you will. We have more economic data and more analytical tools than ever, but our economy today is more complex than ever.\n\nFor one thing, markets continue to become increasingly global and interconnected. In addition, technologies continue to improve at breakneck speed, with implications for improved productivity. And of course there is the ever-present risk of unexpected shocks of one kind or another. We cannot forecast oil shocks, terrorist attacks or geopolitical developments. But we must always be thinking about how wild-card events might affect our economy and be prepared for any contingencies.\n\nIn many ways I think it’s appropriate to reflect, without gloating, on our economy’s positive recent developments. We have worked our way through the 2001 recession with a relatively short and shallow falloff in output; we have returned to what looks like broad-based output growth; we are now getting decent employment growth; and we have inflation within the range most of us would define as acceptable. The trick now is to do what we can to stay on that path to sustainable growth and long-term price stability.\n\nI, along with some others, have been talking for a while about the need to know when to say when. In my view, it has become increasingly clear that the economy is becoming less dependent on the extraordinary monetary policy stimulus of low interest rates. I will spare you this morning a repeat on my views on potential unintended consequences of policy that remains too accommodative for too long. At this point, I judge that financial markets, business leaders and consumers have a good sense of the need to get back to a more neutral monetary policy setting.\n\nYes, individual policymakers can have somewhat different ways of taking into account key elements of the economy. That range of views is, in fact, one of the strengths of our FOMC mechanism for policymaking. There is more than one way to think about productivity, capacity utilization, economic slack and other economic variables. Clearly, there is room at this point for different views on the likely persistence of recent price pressures. But, importantly, I believe the individual public statements and speeches of Fed policymakers underscore a broad and unwavering commitment to price stability.\n\nMost of us are old enough to remember the disastrous consequences of high inflation of the 1970s and early 1980s. And in recent decades all of us have reaped the benefits of a more disciplined monetary policy geared toward price stability.\n\nGiven the economic growth and rising prices now unfolding, the general direction of our next policy move should be clear — barring any unexpected events. But there has been a lot of speculation about one of the statements coming from our last FOMC meeting — that “policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.”\n\nIn my personal view, the word “measured” is more of a plan than a pledge. Based on what I know today, I’m comfortable with the notion that our path is unlikely to mirror 1994’s policy moves, when the Fed funds rate was raised sharply from 3 to 6 percent over 12 months. It’s important to keep in mind the differences between then and now, including a higher rate of inflation in 1994 and a healthier financial sector today.\n\nI want to emphasize that I personally would not want our most recent FOMC statement to be construed as a rigid precommitment to any particular path. I believe our policy response should be dictated by how things eventually unfold, along with our best forecasts for the policy horizon.\n\nThe business of economics and monetary policymaking can get pretty academic and drab. Perhaps that’s why it’s sometimes called the dismal science. So I like to find other ways to make my point.\n\nLet’s pretend you’re the driver of a car that’s rapidly moving along an unfamiliar highway, and there are patches of fog. Because your vision is partially obscured and you can’t be sure what hazards lie ahead, you don’t want to drive on cruise control. Also, you might want to slow down and maybe tap on the brakes so that you don’t roar ahead and then abruptly have to slam on the brakes, leaving skid marks and forcing others to swerve out of the way and possibly losing control of your direction.\n\nI hope this traffic analogy helps to illustrate our economy’s somewhat unpredictable journey. I think it also reminds us that as Fed policymakers we need to stay alert and respond appropriately to what’s happening around us. The economy is moving forward nicely, and I’m feeling good about the last few miles on the road to sustainable growth.",

            "content": "Center for Banking at East Tennessee State University \n  Johnson City, Tennessee \n  March 24, 2004\n\nThanks, Steven, for inviting me here this morning. I’m especially pleased to speak in an academic setting, at the Center for Banking at East Tennessee State University. Standing here this morning I find myself reflecting back on my college days, which, as Steven just mentioned, were spent just up Interstate 81 in Blacksburg, Virginia. I can remember the excitement and, yes, the anxiety that those of you who are students may be experiencing as you get ready to start your careers.\n\nAfter the record long period of economic expansion in the late 1990s, the U.S. economy went through a “soft patch,” to borrow a phrase from Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan. For the past few years, manufacturing job losses have been especially hard on many areas, including yours here in east Tennessee, where offsetting jobs gains have been somewhat slow to materialize. But the U.S. economy is now improving and changing, with new opportunities emerging, particularly in banking, finance, health care and other service industries.\n\nTo the students here who will soon be joining an increasingly global workforce, I would suggest it’s a good idea to stay flexible and build your career for the long term so that you’re able to adjust to the inevitable changes that will come along over the course of your career. No matter where you go, I’m sure you’ll find the investment you’ve made in your education will pay off immeasurably.\n\nI understand some business people also are here this morning. Whether you’re a student preparing to enter the workforce or you’re sitting across the desk as an employer, one of the things we all have in common is the importance of understanding the economic environment we face together. My plan over the next few moments is to share with you my outlook for the U.S. economy. And, speaking for myself as a participant on the Federal Open Market Committee, I want to say a few words about the role of monetary policy in helping to reach our broad goals for the economy in this time of unusually low interest rates.\n\n2004 economic outlook\nThis is an opportune time to assess the economy. We’re nearly three months into 2004, and there now appears to be a clearer pattern of solid and sustainable growth. According to the latest available numbers, 2003 turned out to be a pretty good year, economically speaking, with year-over-year gross domestic product growth (GDP) in the fourth quarter of about 4.3 percent. To put the situation in context, this output growth in 2003 was better than the 3.6 percent average rate during the historic expansion of the 1990s.\n\nWhile last year’s economic momentum appears to be carrying forward, I expect the composition of growth to be somewhat different in 2004. Residential investment and consumer spending on durable goods — cars, refrigerators, furniture and other kinds of items that are sensitive to interest rates — shouldered a disproportionately large share of last year’s overall growth. And it’s clear that low interest rates, tax cuts and tax refunds helped to fuel spending by households. While I see no reason to expect a sharp falloff in housing and durable goods spending this year, I don’t think we can expect to see these sectors continue to grow at the rates we saw in some quarters last year.\n\nSo far this year, early indications are that business investment spending will be stronger and may account for a larger proportion of overall growth. Renewed business investment is vital because it plants the seeds for future growth in productivity, output and employment. The key to robust investment spending lies in corporate profits, which are the major source of funding for investment.\n\nCorporate profits have been remarkably strong in recent quarters — growing 21 percent and an estimated 28 percent year over year in the third and fourth quarters of 2003, respectively. Analysts at First Call, a financial information company, are estimating an increase of about 15 percent year over year during the first half of 2004. Businesses have been more profitable in large part because they cut costs relentlessly and in many industries have worked off much of the excess capacity from the late 1990s. But more recently there are signs that demand growth is beginning to help boost profits as well.\n\nYou might recall that rising business investment spending in the latter half of the 1990s spurred the acceleration of growth in output and employment. With that investment also came extraordinary acceleration in productivity. What’s been unusual is that productivity growth actually picked up during the 2001 recession and continues today. I’ll talk more about productivity in a moment, but at this point I want to stress that business investment is once again playing a critical role in our recovery, and its recent resurgence suggests the entrepreneurial spirit that is so important to growth remains alive and well.\n\nLooking for job growth\nWhile businesses now have become aggressive again when it comes to upgrading equipment, they remain cautious when it comes to human capital. By far the biggest disappointment in our still unfolding economic recovery remains job growth. Historically, employment growth has lagged an upturn in the economy coming out of a recession, and we clearly saw that trend after the previous recession in 1990–91. But this time the lag is turning out to be even longer. The payroll numbers finally turned positive in September 2003 and have held that positive tone marginally through February. During the past six months, the U.S. economy managed to add a total of 364,000 jobs, averaging about 61,000 new payroll jobs per month.\n\nOur FOMC statement from last week noted that “new hiring has lagged.” \n  Yet, even with weak job growth and the constant influx of new job seekers, the \n  current unemployment rate of 5.6 percent is lower than it was at this same point \n  in the recovery from the previous recession in 1990–91. And the unemployment \n  rate is slightly below the average unemployment rate we experienced over the \n  decade of the 1990s.\n\nBut I think it’s important to acknowledge that part of the reason for the relatively low unemployment rate is the recent decline in the rate of participation in the labor market, which was on an upward trend in the 1990s. Indeed, labor force participation in February of this year was at its lowest level since 1988. People have left the labor market for various reasons, such as continuing education or retraining. And there’s an increasing percentage of people who have become discouraged about near-term job prospects.\n\nAs we try to understand today’s murky employment picture, I think it’s helpful to think about how productivity continues to reshape our labor markets. Simply put, if output per worker hour is increasing faster than final demand there is less pressure to add to the workforce.\n\nProductivity gains have touched many sectors of the economy, but perhaps none more so than manufacturing. Average labor productivity growth in U.S. manufacturing is higher than most other sectors of the economy, because many of the jobs are easily automated. And as we have observed in recent decades, and especially over the last few years, production has shifted to other regions of the world where labor costs and productivity are relatively low. Going forward, I expect that manufacturers will continue to leverage new technology to control costs and operate more efficiently. I’m willing to venture that a decade from now, when all of you students here are established in your careers, we’ll see a much higher value of manufacturing output in the United States, but the actual number of manufacturing jobs might not have returned to levels we saw before the 2001 recession.\n\nIn contrast, the service-producing sectors of the economy, such as education, health care, tourism, and so on, tend to require the addition of more people as service demand increases. As a result, growth in services tends to translate fairly directly into increased demand for labor. So, as you might expect, much of the job growth over the past two years has been in service-producing industries.\n\nI think that ongoing gains in labor productivity could act to constrain the overall pace of new hiring for a little while longer — but not indefinitely.\n\nAlthough it’s difficult to judge when we’ll see a significant broad pickup in new job creation, there’s evidence some businesses are beginning to expand payrolls and final demand is growing. For instance, we’re seeing some businesses starting to rebuild inventories. And the economies of many of our trading partners are now improving nicely, so exports appear poised to grow further after a strong fourth quarter. Overall, I think 2004 will be another good year for the U.S. economy.\n\nImportance of low inflation\nOne of the main reasons I’m optimistic about the outlook for the economy is low inflation. Low inflation ushered in the era of high productivity growth in the 1990s that I mentioned earlier, and it continues to drive innovation in subtle ways. For example, low inflation allows firms to focus on long-run projects, raising real returns because investments are allowed ample time to bear fruit. One of the Fed’s goals with regard to inflation is to remove it as a factor in the economy so that you don’t have to think about it or adjust your plans because of large and unexpected changes in inflation or interest rates.\n\nBut, as a practical matter, monetary policy sometimes can help to ease the adjustment process when unforeseen shocks hit the economy or a downturn occurs. I expect most of you remember the Fed intervened aggressively beginning in 2001. There were 13 policy-easing moves in all that brought the fed funds target rate from 6-1/2 percent in mid-2000 to its present and unusually low rate of 1 percent. The evidence is pretty convincing that these actions helped to measurably ease the pain of a weak economy. Certainly, lower interest rates have bolstered interest-sensitive sectors like housing and consumer durables. And the strength in those sectors helped to keep the recession, at least as measured by GDP growth, both short and shallow.\n\nIn large part, the Fed was able to ease policy decisively because of low inflation. For the past two years, core inflation has declined consistently to where it now hovers just above 1 percent, at the lowest rate since the 1960s. In contrast to the erratic and troublesome inflationary period of the 1970s, our economy now has a track record of low and stable inflation. And the general expectation is that low inflation will continue because the Fed is perceived to be committed to a long-term policy of price stability.\n\nBut price stability does not mean that prices won’t change. Some prices will increase at the same time others decrease. Recently, I’ve heard anecdotal reports of increased prices in service industries such as trucking, tourism and auditing. And as you probably have noticed, health care and insurance prices have been rising for some time now.\n\nOn the commodity side, prices for steel and other metals have risen sharply \n  in recent months, and the prices of some finished goods dependent on these inputs \n  have been increasing as well. In addition, energy prices have moved up, leading \n  to higher costs for fuel, chemicals and fertilizers, among other items.\n\nAs a central banker, my focus is on avoiding conditions that contribute to \n  persistent and widespread price increases across sectors. At this time, I do \n  not believe the kinds of isolated price increases I have just described threaten \n  low overall inflation. But, as always, I think it’s important to watch \n  price developments.\n\nThe role for monetary policy\nWe’ve seen how accommodative monetary policy can cushion the downside of an economic cycle, and policy has been especially accommodative for a while now. The steep interest rate cuts of 2001 and 2002 were not neutral monetary policy; rates were reduced in response to a substantially weakened economy. As the economy returns to more normal rates of growth, market interest rates should adjust in response to more robust conditions and policy will need to adjust as well.\n\nI expect the Fed’s accommodative policy, and the low interest rates it has helped to engender, is popular with many in this room. Following last week’s FOMC meeting, our statement again concluded by saying, “the Committee believes it can be patient in removing its policy accommodation.” Yet as rates remain low and I think about the future path of policy, I remind myself it is also important to watch for unintended consequences of keeping monetary policy too accommodative for too long. Indeed, some of my contacts in various industries have stressed to me that at some point it will be appropriate, and helpful, to allow interest rates to return to more normal levels so that markets can sort themselves out in an orderly way and return to balance.\n\nPut another way, just as I don’t want concerns about future inflation to play a major role in business decision-making, I also don’t want businesses to build their plans on expectations of a continuation of accommodative monetary policy without regard to prospective economic conditions or the necessary policy changes that may need to accompany them.\n\nTo illustrate what I’m talking about, let me tell you about my son, Mike, who has been developing lots for residential builders in the Atlanta area since 1997. If I think about the years Mike has been in residential real estate, I realize he has not seen a downturn in the business and in fact has been riding the wave of low mortgage rates and historic rates of home building. As you might guess, Mike and I have had some interesting father-son talks about the seductive lures of such an extraordinary period. I think, at least I hope, Mike understands that, as rates move back to more typical levels at some point, some part of his business may be vulnerable — that part induced by temporarily low rates alone. I hope he and others in business have not assumed in their long-term plans that this extraordinary period will continue indefinitely.\n\nAnother way to think about our monetary policy situation is in medical terms. When a patient is seriously ill, the situation may call for prescribing a strong dose of medication. As the patient begins to recover, however, there is a need to recalibrate the dosage or to stop prescribing it entirely to avoid potential side effects.\n\nOf course, as I mentioned earlier, our prompt response in 2001 to an emerging economic downturn, and the strong dose of monetary policy easing we administered, was appropriate. But just as a doctor shouldn’t overmedicate the patient, one should always be sensitive to the potential for creating imbalances, which could be costly to correct. The same concerns apply to monetary policy. Over the longer run, I believe that monetary policy works best when it stays out of the way of the real work of building and growing our economy.\n\nGiven disappointing employment growth, slack resource use and muted increases in core consumer prices, the Fed has good reason to maintain its accommodative policy, at least for now. But if my forecast for more robust economic growth materializes, then, at some point, a fed funds rate of 1 percent will no longer be the best policy.\n\nGetting to balanced growth and reasonable expectations\nI began my remarks with an optimistic 2004 outlook for the U.S. economy. And I’ve shared my views as to why we have reason to expect more balanced growth ahead. I’ve addressed the role of monetary policy in cushioning a recessionary period and have cited the evidence that low rates have worked well in this economic cycle. I’ve also said it’s important to eventually return to more normal interest rates as the economy gains strength.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, I’ve tried to emphasize that low and stable inflation, and the dynamic business climate it engenders, has fueled many of the gains that we’ve enjoyed, from high productivity to continued strength in housing.\n\nIt is indeed a luxury to have an inflation environment in which policymakers can be patient in ensuring the economy has gained a solid footing. That said, luxury comes with a price tag, and patience is not unlimited. The old truism that “there’s no such thing as a free lunch” applies today, as always.\n\nThe same advice I offered earlier to the students here — to stay flexible and forward looking — I think applies to all of us, as individuals, business leaders and policymakers. While we should keep one eye on today’s issues and challenges, we should also look ahead for the path that leads to the best outcome over the longer term.",

You’re a special group because, without your vision, creativity, and risk taking, the Atlanta area would not be what it is today. The Atlanta real estate market is one of the nation’s 10 largest, with well over a half million square feet of office and industrial space. As you well know, commercial real estate, perhaps more than almost any sector of our economy, is subject to wild swings — from great booms to painful adjustments. And I know there’s a lot of vacant space out there now. But in a popular and growing place like Atlanta, your investments serve a larger purpose. The abundance of quality real estate in this market is a big draw for businesses that are willing and able to relocate and make Atlanta their new home.\n\nI’ll come back to real estate during my remarks, but I think you would agree that an expanding and vibrant economy is key to ensuring that your industry can continue to grow and prosper. My plan this evening is to share with you my outlook for the U.S. economy, and, speaking for myself as a participant on the Federal Open Market Committee, I want to discuss the role of monetary policy in helping to reach our broad goals for the economy in this time of unusually low interest rates.\n\n2004 economic outlook\nThis is an opportune time to talk about the economy because, two months into 2004, there now appears to be a clear pattern of solid and sustainable growth. According to the latest available numbers, 2003 turned out to be a decent year, economically speaking, with year-over-year gross domestic product growth (GDP) of about 4.3 percent — better than the average rate during the expansion of the 1990s.\n\nProbably the most important economic story of 2003 was the resurgence of business investment spending in the second half of the year. While the consumer continued to carry us in the first six months, spending on equipment and software in the second half rose sharply, at double-digit rates. Capital investment registered a nice gain of about 7 percent for the year overall, and equipment and software increased about 10 percent.\n\nWhile last year’s economic momentum appears to be carrying forward, I expect the composition of growth to be somewhat different in 2004. Residential investment and spending on durable goods — cars, refrigerators, furniture and other kinds of items that are sensitive to interest rates — shouldered a disproportionately large share of last year’s overall growth.

But more recently there are increasing signs that demand growth is beginning to contribute importantly to profits as well.\n\nYou’ll recall that rising business investment spending in the latter half of the 1990s spurred the acceleration of growth in output and employment. With that investment also came acceleration in productivity growth that has been extraordinary by historical standards. What is unusual is that productivity growth picked up during the recession and continues to accelerate today. Since 2000, productivity increased an average of about 4 percent per year. To put this in perspective, productivity gains averaged about 3 percent during the 25-year period from 1948 to 1973 and then fell to 1.4 percent over 23 years between 1973 and 1996. Productivity gains between 1996 and 2000 were 2.6 percent, still well short of what we’ve seen lately.\n\nRising productivity ultimately leads to a higher standard of living, but it also helps explain the slow progress we’ve made on the job front so far. As output per hour increases, there is less pressure to add to the workforce.\n\nAlthough the 2001 recession was largely a story of the pullback of business investment, which includes technology and software spending, I must say that I’m encouraged by the recent trends of business spending. Businesses over the last two quarters have poured money back into operations in a way that suggests they have not forgotten how to plan for the future and that the entrepreneurial spirit is still very much alive and well.\n\nLooking for job growth\nWhile businesses have become aggressive when it comes to upgrading machinery, they’ve been cautious when it comes to human capital. I think the biggest disappointment in our still unfolding economic recovery remains job growth. Growth in employment has historically lagged an upturn in the economy coming out of a recession, and we clearly saw that trend after the previous recession in 1990–91. But this time the lag is turning out to be even longer. The payroll numbers turned positive in September 2003 and held that positive tone through the end of the year. But the U.S. economy managed to add an average of little more than 60,000 new jobs per month over the last four months of the year.\n\nBecause we typically average 120,000 to 150,000 new entrants into the job market each month, we’ll need monthly gains to exceed those numbers before we begin to replace the jobs lost since 2001.  My own view is that job growth will pick up in coming months, and the unemployment rate will continue to drop. At the same time, I don’t foresee a dramatic slowing of productivity gains, and therefore I expect that businesses may add new employees at a pace somewhat less rapid than in other recent cycles.\n\nDespite the uncertain pace of job growth, there’s evidence that businesses are feeling more pressure to expand payrolls. On top of continued strength in consumer spending and renewed vigor in business capital spending, we’re starting to see rebuilding of inventories — a sign of expanding final demand. Exports also appear poised to grow further after a strong fourth quarter. The economies of many of our trading partners are now improving nicely. Overall, I think 2004 will be a good year.\n\nThe role for monetary policy\nOne of the main reasons I’m optimistic about the outlook for the economy is low inflation.  Low inflation ushered in the era of high productivity growth in the 1990s that I mentioned earlier, and it continues to drive innovation in subtle ways. For example, low inflation allows firms to focus on long-run projects, raising real returns because investments are allowed ample time to bear fruit. One of the Fed’s goals with regard to inflation is to remove it as a factor in the economy so that you don’t have to think about it or adjust your plans because of large and unexpected changes in inflation or interest rates.\n\nIn theory, monetary policy works best when it stays out of the way of the real work of building and growing our economy. But as a practical matter, monetary policy sometimes can help to ease the adjustment process.\n\nI’m sure you remember the Fed intervened aggressively beginning in 2001. There were 13 policy-easing moves in all that brought the fed funds target rate from 6-1/2 percent in mid-2001 to its present and unusually low rate of 1 percent. The evidence is pretty convincing that these actions helped measurably to ease the pain of a weak economy.  Lower interest rates have undoubtedly bolstered interest-sensitive sectors like housing and consumer durables. And the strength in those sectors helped to keep the recession, at least as measured by GDP growth, both short and shallow.\n\nIn large part, the Fed was able to ease policy decisively because of low inflation. For the past two years, core inflation has declined consistently to where it now hovers just above one percent, at the lowest rate since the 1960s. In contrast to the erratic and troublesome inflationary period of the 1970s, our economy now has a track record of stable prices. The general expectation is that low inflation will continue because the Fed is perceived to be committed to a long-term policy of price stability.\n\nMonetary policy has been accommodative for a while. While we’ve seen how accommodative monetary policy can cushion the downside of an economic cycle, it will be appropriate at some point to get back to a more neutral policy setting consistent with an expanding economy.  The steep interest rate cuts of 2001 and 2002 were not neutral monetary policy; rates were reduced in response to a substantially weakened economy. As the economy returns to more normal rates of growth, interest rates will adjust in response to more robust conditions.\n\nPut another way, just as I don’t want concerns about future inflation to play a major role in business decision making, I also don’t want businesses to build their plans on expectations of a continuation of accommodative monetary policy without regard to prospective economic conditions.\n\nFollowing our last FOMC meeting, our statement said, “With inflation quite low and resource use slack, the committee believes it can be patient in removing its policy accommodation.”  Because of low inflation and low inflation expectations, the FOMC has more leeway in calibrating monetary policy. Yet as rates remain low and I think about the future path of policy, I remind myself it is also important to watch for unintended consequences of keeping monetary policy too accommodative for too long.\n\nI think it might be helpful to describe the monetary policy situation in medical terms. When a patient is seriously ill, the situation may call for prescribing a strong dose of medication. As the patient begins to recover, however, there is a need to recalibrate the dosage or to stop prescribing it entirely to avoid potential side effects.\n\nThe same concerns apply to monetary policy. A prompt response to the possibility of an economic downturn, such as the FOMC made around the time of the onset of the 2001 recession, was appropriate. But just as a doctor shouldn’t overmedicate the patient, one always should be sensitive to the potential for unintended side effects of maintaining an accommodative policy for too long. Put differently, if my forecast for robust economic growth materializes, then, at some point, a fed funds rate of 1 percent will no longer be the best policy.\n\nAt the risk of bringing this caution closer home to you and your businesses, let’s think about commercial real estate. Coming off the building boom of the late 1990s, the economic downturn in 2001 was an unpleasant surprise. Office vacancy rates in the Atlanta area swelled to well over 20 percent as businesses began to slash payrolls and emptied large amounts of office and industrial space.\n\nAs it happened, low interest rates eased carrying costs and encouraged ongoing investment despite the high vacancies. I expect the Fed’s accommodative policy is popular with many in this room, but some in your industry have stressed to me that at some point it will be appropriate, and helpful, to allow interest rates to return to more normal levels so that the market sorts itself out in an orderly way and returns to balance. As I said earlier, I want to avoid a situation where businesses begin to assume that policy, which was put in place to deal with a temporary economic circumstance, mistakenly becomes incorporated into business planning as the normal policy environment.\n\nAnother example strikes even closer to home for me. My son, Mike, after some terrific years with Charlie Brown and Rick O’Brien in commercial real estate development, moved into residential development in 1997. If I think about the six years Mike has now been in residential development, I realize he has not seen a downturn in the business and in fact has been riding the wave of low mortgage rates and historical rates of home building. As you might guess, Mike and I have had some interesting father-son talks about the seductive lures of such an extraordinary period. I think, at least I hope, Mike understands that, as rates move back to more typical levels at some point, some part of his business may be vulnerable — that part induced by temporarily low rates alone. I hope he and others in the business have not assumed in their long-term business plans that this extraordinary period will continue indefinitely. And let’s hope they are not creating new pockets of excess capacity that will have to be worked off as conditions return to normal.\n\nGetting to balanced growth and reasonable expectations\nI began my remarks with what I intended to be an optimistic 2004 outlook for the U.S. economy. And I’ve shared my views as to why we have good reason to expect more balanced growth and a sustainable period of expansion in the quarters ahead. I’ve addressed the role of monetary policy in cushioning a recessionary period and have cited the evidence that low rates have worked well in this economic cycle. I’ve also suggested it is important to eventually return to more normal interest rates as the economy gains strength.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, I’ve tried to emphasize that low and stable inflation, and the dynamic business climate it engenders, has fueled many of the gains that we’ve enjoyed, from high productivity to continued strength in housing.\n\nIt is indeed a luxury to have an inflation environment in which policymakers can be patient in ensuring the economy has gained a solid footing. That said, luxury comes with a price tag, and patience is not unlimited. The old truism that “there’s no such thing as a free lunch” applies today, as always.\n\nThe same advice I mentioned earlier to my son Mike I think applies to all of us — as individuals, business leaders and policymakers. I suggest we keep our heads up and follow a path that leads to the best outcome over the longer term.\n\nPress release text",

            "content": "What I’d like to talk about tonight is the U.S. economic outlook. GDP, our shorthand for gross domestic product, roared ahead at 7.2 percent in the third quarter, a rate that is faster than at any time since 1984. I’m inclined to view this past summer’s surge of output as an exclamation point in a sequence of eight straight quarters of rising GDP, a period when output growth averaged over 3 percent. As my remarks over the next few minutes will suggest, I expect output growth will continue, although probably at a pace less dramatic than reported for the third quarter. While the economic trends clearly are favorable, employment growth remains stagnant, far below levels of the late 1990s. Holding this economy up for inspection, it looks as though it’s gaining strength and stamina overall, but with some sectors still working off their excesses and imbalances.\n\nFor the past few months, I’ve been saying that growth appears to be gaining momentum. After looking at recent data and talking to business folks like you, I want to stress this evening the now broad-based character of growth that’s unfolding. I believe the economy is gaining a stronger foothold as weaknesses become increasingly confined. What we’re seeing is growth that is spreading across industries and sectors, becoming more balanced.\n\nWhat do I mean by balanced? Well, the World Series Champion Florida Marlins come to mind as a useful illustration. After the team won the Series in 1997, the owner dismantled the roster to unload payroll and hired young talent with potential for the future. The team suffered through five straight losing seasons. But this year they pulled together and made the playoffs as a Wild Card team. In October, they beat the mighty Yankees through a combination of clutch hitting, speed, defense and pitching. In other words, they won through balance.\n\nThe Marlins’ approach to building a championship team is instructive, I think, because it shows the importance of preparing for the future and performing well in a number of different areas. As growth spreads through the economy, a sequence of additional positive events becomes increasingly likely. Among those is employment. Job destruction should ease, and job creation should intensify. The unemployment rate, now 6.1 percent, should begin to fall. What’s happening in our economy now? Let’s grab a clipboard and consider a range of factors.\n\nConsumers continue their heavy hitting\n I’ll start with consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of GDP. For the past three years, consumers have done the heavy hitting for the economy. You’ll recall growth in the broad economy began to falter in late 2000, just before the declared start of the recession in the first quarter of 2001. Companies retrenched and the stock market plummeted. But, in a very uncharacteristic pattern, consumer spending, on a quarterly basis, didn’t contract during the recession. And in the third quarter this year, consumer spending grew at a whopping 6.6 percent. For the household side of the ledger, it has been “let the good times roll,” or “laissez les bon temps rouler,” as folks say in Cajun country.\n\nConsumer spending at last quarter’s torrid pace is unusual and unlikely to continue. Certainly, the tax cuts and cash-outs from mortgage refinancing during the extremely low mortgage rates this summer added a kick to spendable income. Some of this strong spending was leveraged, but we do not appear to be in the danger zone when it comes to debt. As a percentage of income, household debt payments for obligations such as autos, credit cards and mortgages have actually fallen a bit since they rose to peak levels in 2001. Many families have managed to keep spending with the help of very low interest rates. At the Federal Open Market Committee meeting two weeks ago, we left the overnight funds rate at 1 percent, with inflation remaining in check and consumer prices rising at an annualized rate of 1.2 percent.\n\nIt’s difficult to judge how long the boost from tax cuts will last or to measure the additional stimulus that will come from the still accommodative monetary and fiscal policy. But I do have the sense that retailers will have reason to be upbeat about the coming holiday season. Businesses, for their part, have done an excellent job of luring consumers through attractive pricing and financing terms. Sales of durables have been strong, and I see few reasons why the trend should abate. For instance, truck and auto sales this year have been generally solid. Appliances, electronics and furniture also are on a lengthening list of goods that are selling well. The pace of growth in consumer spending may ease somewhat in the coming quarters but is likely to remain strong, providing critical ongoing support for the economy.\n\nConsumer spending is supported by a strong housing market. During the past few years, housing starts and sales have climbed in much of the country, and the rate of homeownership has increased. I’m sure many of you in this room have purchased homes or refinanced to take advantage of mortgage rates that earlier this year reached 40-year lows. Mortgage rates have moved a bit higher since June but are still quite attractive by historical standards. Looking ahead, I expect the large proportion of the population born between 1946 and 1964 will continue to fuel a strong demand for primary residences and vacation homes.\n\nBusinesses begin to bulk up\n Perhaps the most important story now in the economy is the rebound in business spending. Although business investment spending accounts for only about 10 percent of total GDP, a sharp drop in investment spending was a big factor leading to the 2001 recession. Business fixed investment plunged by 5 percent each year in 2001 and 2002, but this downward trend appears to have been reversed. Business spending on equipment and software grew in five of the last six quarters and surged 15 percent in the third quarter at the highest rate since early 2000.\n\nCommercial borrowing is another good indicator of business spending. Over the last two years, bank corporate loan demand has been weak even though banks have been ready to lend and terms have been favorable. But at least some bankers are telling us that their customers are beginning to talk about new projects, with new loans in the application phase. When viewed along with recent activity in the market for initial public offerings and relatively good business in the bond market, the picture of a more vigorous corporate sector has begun to emerge.\n\nThrough hard decisions and perseverance, businesses have strengthened their balance sheets. Careful cost control has paid off in the form of improved productivity. Total revenues for publicly traded companies have increased for three straight quarters, and profits are at the highest level since the third quarter of 2000. And as businesses decide to shift from a hunkered-down defensive posture to offense, they will be more competitive than ever.\n\nGrowth spreads by industry\nMany companies are now seeing improvements, but imbalances remain in some industries, such as telecom. All of the tough decisions and recalibrations are by no means behind us. The breakneck pace of change in the 1990s did not stop when the dot-com bubble burst. In this turbulent climate, successful managers are proving to be those who are not afraid to throw out old assumptions and try new ones.\n\nCompanies continue to collectively retool, and some are farther along than others. It will take time to get back to an economy that exhibits sustainable strength across all sectors, just as it took a while for the rebuilt Marlins to field a team capable of winning another World Series. But almost all recent data suggest the economy is rebuilding successfully.\n\nPerhaps no part of the economy has undergone more turbulence than travel and hospitality. Following the double whammy of recession and the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, several major air carriers filed for bankruptcy protection. Low-cost upstarts have added a new dimension to the air travel shakeout as they have expanded aggressively. My contacts in the airline business tell me they are moving quickly to adjust. As they do so, my sense is that airlines will be aided by growing domestic passenger traffic as both business and leisure travel pick up. As an aside, recovery in tourism is one reason why the Southeast as a region is now at the front of the national pack when it comes to growth and new job creation.\n\nA rebound in technology spending is another sign of broad-based growth. The information industry continues to provide many valuable innovations. For instance, new advances in supply chain and inventory management and electronic communications have fueled rapid productivity gains. While the Nasdaq index remains far below peak levels, this year’s recovery of technology stocks reflects the expectation of future growth in this area.\n\nAs the economy shifts, manufacturing has had an especially tough time. In a speech I made in September, I noted that many domestic manufacturers appear to be shedding jobs permanently as low-skill operations move to lower-wage countries around the world. While manufacturing remains weak relative to 1999 levels, some signs are encouraging. Rail and truck shipments have increased, along with orders for packaging materials. Manufacturing production in the United States increased in four of the last five months and is up 1.2 percent since its April low. Recent manufacturing surveys also have been more favorable.\n\nDuring this time of manufacturing upheaval, Americans have been buying more and more imports. The U.S. trade imbalance is probably with us for a while, but surviving exporters have become stronger. Exports grew 9.3 percent at an annualized rate in the most recent quarter, up from 1 percent during the prior three-month period. Export growth has improved along with economic conditions among our major trading partners in Asia, Europe and the Americas.\n\nTo complete the picture of broadening economic growth, I’d like to point to a couple of other developments. In multifamily housing, I’m hearing that in some areas of the Southeast apartment owners are offering fewer concessions and nudging rental rates upward as vacancy rates improve. Increased government spending for the military also has been felt in many places, including the shipyards in this region.\n\nUncertainties remain\nThe economy in recent years has been full of surprises, and I expect there will be more. Although major combat in Iraq is over, shaky geopolitics and the prospect of terrorism remain risks. The increase in health care costs is another concern that I’ve mentioned in the past. And ahead of us is the growing federal deficit and its future direction. The unusual expenses associated with the military action in Iraq and the reduction in federal government revenue associated with the countercyclical tax actions should abate with time. But there are other large fiscal policy issues associated with Social Security and Medicare that have yet to be resolved.\n\nEmployment is yet another uncertainty. The economy lost approximately 2.7 million jobs since the start of the recession and half a million jobs since January. But I think it’s worth reminding ourselves that job growth usually follows GDP growth. A net jobs gain of 57,000 was reported for September, and the number of new claims for unemployment insurance has come down in recent weeks.\n\nHave labor markets begun to stabilize? Layoffs continue, but new jobs have been created in fields such as health care and education that require specific training and skills. Broader job growth to date also has been reported in residential construction and the service sector. But much of the hiring in recent months has been by firms seeking temporary workers, an important first step before adding to full-time payrolls. I expect to see additional hiring for permanent jobs as we move into 2004 and companies reach the limits of what they can accomplish by leveraging productivity gains and existing staff.\n\nTraining never ends\n The key to sustainable economic growth, as with building a winning baseball team, is balance. You can’t win in the big leagues with a lineup of only power hitters. Success on the field requires players with diverse and complementary skills performing at peak levels.\n\nBut there is no off-season for the economy. We need to remind ourselves to be patient — and realistic. A crash program of quick fixes is not what it takes to succeed as we recover from the excesses of the past and some bad unforeseen shocks that have come our way. In hindsight, we realize the growth of the late 1990s was not sustainable. Bulked-up technology spending led to excess capacity and other problems that we’re still working off.\n\nThe dynamics of today’s economy are different, with growth driven by consumer spending and businesses motivated by efficiency and cost control. We live in a free market economy. There always will be tough decisions to make, lessons to be learned and risks to be taken. But with the better balance we are seeing now in this economic expansion, my confidence is growing that the economy will be in shape for the demanding contests of the future.\n\nText of press release",
