I've had the privilege of leading this institution for a number of years now, and it has been a rewarding experience to observe and participate in the fruitful relationship that exists between the Bank and the University.\nWorking together, the University's economics department and the Bank's research department—and you would be forgiven if you think those are one and the same—have produced research that has sparked revolutions in economic theory and monetary policymaking, and has even helped spawn a Nobel Prize or two along the way. In addition, this academic partnership—which is further realized by the Bank's cooperation with the University's Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs, its Journalism and Law schools, and other departments—has generated educational programs and influenced public policy initiatives, often in surprising ways. In that regard, perhaps none is more surprising than forming an Early Childhood Research Collaborative and holding research conferences on the subject of early childhood development.\nI use the word \"surprising\" because when you think of the Federal Reserve and its research and policy responsibilities, the first topic that comes to mind is likely not early childhood development. Frankly, it is unlikely to be even the second or third topic that comes to mind. But that's changing. Increasingly, state and local governments are looking to their Federal Reserve banks for support on this emerging issue—and not just the Minneapolis Fed. Why is this happening? Let me begin to answer that question by citing some recent speeches by my colleagues in the Fed:\nSandy Pianalto said that when she became president of the Cleveland Fed, she asked her research department to put a sharper focus on the issues that are shaping her district. Education was at the top of the list. \"We all should care about this issue,\" Sandy said, \"and I am convinced that it begins with early childhood education.\"\nJanet Yellen, president of the San Francisco Fed, has noted that \"skill acquisition is a cumulative process that works most effectively when a solid foundation has been provided in early childhood. As such, programs to support early childhood development, such as preschool programs for disadvantaged children, not only appear to have substantial payoffs early but also are likely to continue paying off throughout the life cycle.\"\nFinally, a few words from Jeff Lacker at Richmond: \"On many issues, the economics of the question are not decisive, though economics does tend to spotlight the often-overlooked costs associated with many otherwise seemingly attractive ideas. On some questions, however, economic research sends a fairly clear message. I believe that early childhood development is such an issue.\"\nSo as you can see, other Federal Reserve banks have also been out front on this seemingly un-Fed-like topic. But let me step back and put these statements in a broader context that will further explain why the Federal Reserve has taken an active interest in early childhood development.\nAs all of you know, this country's central banking system includes 12 district banks and a Board of Governors in Washington, D.C. While the role and purpose of those 12 district banks could be the subject of a separate speech, one clear function of those banks is to understand what makes their regional economies tick. This recalls Sandy Pianalto's charge to her research department: Tell me what issues matter most to our district's economy.\nThis charge is one shared by all Federal Reserve banks, and it is a responsibility that has attained a sharper focus in recent decades as Congress has passed a series of laws, beginning with the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, to ensure equal access to financial services and equal opportunity for all citizens. More than just supervising banks to ensure that they are upholding the letter of the law, Federal Reserve banks are working with their local communities on issues ranging from housing to credit availability to education.\nBut it's not just our district economies and our legal mandates that have motivated us to take a hard look at education: This topic circles back to core economic research, the very kind that the Bank and University have contributed to over the years. One such field of investigation is that which compares the economies of various countries and tries to answer one of the most vexing questions in economics: Why are some nations rich and others poor?\nBob Lucas has made important contributions to this line of research, especially on the issue of human capital. In a 2003 Annual Report essay for the Minneapolis Fed, Lucas made a key point that has relevance for the work done by many of you in this room: \"It is a unique feature of human capital that it yields returns that cannot be captured entirely by its ‘owner.' … These pervasive external effects introduce a kind of feedback into human capital theory: Something that increases the return on human capital will stimulate greater accumulation, in turn stimulating higher returns, stimulating still greater accumulation and so on.\" The key words there are \"and so on.\" To all of you familiar with the benefit/cost ratio attributed to certain early childhood development programs, the \"and so on\" of these programs adds up to some serious positive external effects.\nOn the question of the comparative wealth of nations, Lucas famously said that once you start thinking about that question, it's hard to think of anything else. I would suggest that the same is true at a more micro level for the United States: When you start thinking about why some states and cities are richer than others, it's hard to think of anything else. It's a motivating question that, when you come right down to it, frames much of the economic and policy debate in this country. And if the answer to this question involves human capital, then the next question follows: Why are some states and cities better educated, or better at education, than others? These are the types of questions that perplex policymakers and economists, and also Federal Reserve banks, and that's why we keep asking them.\nAnd, of course, there are no easy answers, which is why all of you made the questionable decision to travel to Minnesota in December. You would think that with all of that intellectual firepower that I referred to at the beginning of this speech, we would have picked a more temperate month for you to pay a visit. Or maybe this just reveals how serious we are about this topic, and how seriously all of you take this issue.\nBefore I close, I want to briefly describe the current efforts under way here at the Minneapolis Fed on this issue. As many of you know, Art Rolnick and Rob Grunewald, following on the work of some of you in this room, have been making the economic case for early childhood programs for at-risk children for a number of years. Over this time, they have been challenged by skeptics to bring their ideas to scale. It's one thing to cite focused studies with relatively small numbers of families and tout the high returns, these skeptics say, but it's quite another to actually implement those ideas in a broad way.\nArt and Rob accepted that challenge and drafted a proposal that, in effect, puts the market to work to stimulate demand and create a supply of quality child care programs. I won't go into the details here, but I will add that Art and Rob's plan—as adopted by the Minnesota Early Learning Fund, a unique nonprofit funded mostly by corporate donations—will get its first real test in St. Paul beginning in January, when 1,200 at-risk families will receive scholarships for high-quality child care. Additionally, other Twin Cities school districts, as well as those in rural Minnesota and other parts of the country, have begun programs that incorporate Art and Rob's market-based approach. Will the skeptics be proved wrong? Time will tell, but as an economist, I can say that I'm hopeful. Finally, I would like to end with a fitting quote from Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, who gave a talk earlier this year on this very subject:\n\"Although education and the acquisition of skills is a lifelong process, starting early in life is crucial. Recent research—some sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis in collaboration with the University of Minnesota—has documented the high returns that early childhood programs can pay in terms of subsequent educational attainment and in lower rates of social problems, such as teenage pregnancy and welfare dependency. The most successful early childhood programs appear to be those that cultivate both cognitive and noncognitive skills and that engage families in stimulating learning at home.\"\nThere's that partnership again. And in that quote, Bernanke also makes reference to the academic work underpinning this conference, for he cites research by Jim Heckman, who of course is in attendance. And speaking of Jim, I would be remiss not to acknowledge the huge debt that the profession owes him for almost single-handedly establishing the economic bona fides of this issue. His research was the foundation for the work produced at this Bank and by the University and has influenced every serious economic and policy research project on this issue, which means he has also had a vicarious hand in many of the policy reforms taking place across the country—however nervous that makes him feel.\nThank you very much.\n\nNB: The italics in this talk are from the original speeches.\n\nLet me begin by welcoming you, once again, to the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis and also by telling you what a pleasure it is to sponsor this conference with the University of Minnesota.

        "content": "Introduction\nThe overarching theme of my remarks this morning is that regulators of the financial services industry are likely, perhaps inevitably, to confront difficult tradeoffs in designing policies responsive to the recent tumult in financial markets.  As a general statement, this may seem self-evident, but specific cases illustrate the challenging nature of such tradeoffs and strongly suggest that the correct course of action, when put to a cost/benefit test, may be far from obvious. Policymakers have faced such tradeoffs before; indeed, the transition from Basel I to Basel II can be viewed as a move from a relatively simple, low cost regime with limited ability to link bank capital to institutional risk-taking to a more complex framework with the potential to establish a stronger connection between capital and risk.\nIn these remarks, I plan to consider recent events in credit markets and to explore lessons we might take from them and policy choices we might make. Let me emphasize at the outset that, as always, I am speaking only for myself and not for others in the Federal Reserve.  Further, let me remind you that it is exceptionally early to begin a retrospective of recent experience: certainly some situations are far from resolved, and thus identification of principal lessons learned from the disruption will necessarily be incomplete and probably prioritized inadequately as well. Nevertheless, I think we can say something meaningful about potential reforms and about the tradeoffs inherent in their adoption. These are important matters; if I am right about tradeoffs, then some reforms might impose significant costs and contribute to outcomes we would prefer to avoid.  Ultimately, policymakers could find themselves relearning old lessons rather than improving social welfare.\nThese comments are organized along the following lines. I will begin by identifying an issue raised by the recent financial turbulence and consider a potential policy response, highlighting the tradeoffs embodied in the response. I will consider four such issues. These discussions are at a fairly high level, but I would expect the tradeoffs to hold at the micro-level as well. \nPolicymakers will certainly find opportunities to improve current regulations and practices; the status quo will need to change in some areas. But, as we will see, and as foreshadowed previously, tradeoffs suggest that policymakers will want to be extraordinarily careful in addressing perceived inadequacies in the current environment.\nThe Originate to Distribute Model\nHigher than expected losses on subprime mortgages were the proximate catalyst for the recent turmoil in credit markets. And many observers have attributed poor performance of these mortgages to the \"originate to distribute\" model commonplace in the mortgage market.  With originate to distribute, the steps underlying the production of a mortgage are divided into distinct activities, frequently with different entities carrying out each. For example, mortgage brokers might market various mortgage products to customers, another firm might purchase mortgages and pool them, and still other investors might ultimately fund them, with another firm servicing the mortgages after origination.\nBecause of the many hand-offs in the process—and the terms of the contracts between at least some of the firms—a number of the firms involved in the process did not have a clear stake in the longer-run performance of the mortgage. The incentives in this model, then, may have encouraged large-scale production of low-quality mortgages.  Moreover, this system distributes mortgage risk to a wide range of investors, many of whom do not have to reveal in detail (or at all) their holdings. Diffuse distribution of risk follows in this context because the original funders of the mortgages likely have modified their exposures through sales of structured financial products, some of which, by the way, may be difficult to understand and to evaluate.\nWide distribution, and the complexity of structured products, may obscure where risks truly reside. In these circumstances, should ultimate investors decide that they want to reduce their exposure to subprime mortgages, they may be unsure about which assets to sell or from which firms to pull funding, leading them as a defensive measure to curtail exposures to a wide range of assets and firms, some of which may in fact have little to do with the subprime market.\nBy implication, this litany of issues and concerns may commend the \"vertically integrated\" approach to lending, wherein a bank takes the loan and its risk on its balance sheet and earns all the revenue and pays all the expenses associated with it. In this world, the residence of the risk would be relatively clear. \nHowever, having a single institution carry out all the activities associated with mortgage lending, or similarly with other loans, does not eliminate principal-agent problems. We all know that, even within firms, it is essential to get the incentives and contracts right so that all work to achieve the same goal.\nAnd the alternative—the originate to distribute model—has a core and fundamental economic advantage propelling it: specialization. Over time, firms have developed that specialize in the distinct steps of the lending process, from originating the loan to funding it. Such specialization contributes importantly to cost efficiencies, innovation, and a broadening of access to financial capital.  Another advantage of the model is diversification; the originate to distribute process allows a firm to significantly diversity the asset side of its balance sheet.\nIn short, these benefits are valuable in that they facilitate effective use of resources.  Actions to limit specialization and diversification would therefore likely to be costly, with adverse consequences for economic performance and living standards over time. Policymakers would need to consider such costs in assessing reforms proposed to constrain the originate to distribute model.\nReliance of External Credit Analysis\nSome observers have identified reliance on the work of credit rating agencies as a dramatic case of the downside of specialization—of separating out aspects of the credit extension process. In particular, it is asserted that investors gave too much credence to the views of the rating agencies and failed to do enough independent credit analysis.  While not an expert in this area, I think it important that we think critically about what constitutes excessive reliance on external credit analysis in these circumstances.\nIf critics mean that there is some systematic failing in the existing rating process and that this is not apparent to those who use the ratings, then reforms in this area may be fully appropriate. But if instead observers are concerned that the rating agencies simply got expected outcomes wrong in some sense (as they have before), then reforms that might subvert the agencies and the information they provide may simultaneously impose significant costs.\nTo be specific, it could be exceptionally costly for each investor to build the infrastructure required to conduct serious credit analysis, and these costs need to be weighed against the losses suffered by investors in the current regime. Moreover, were the agencies unique in underestimating the losses in, say, the subprime mortgage market?  It is not obvious that a different infrastructure will produce better results.\nMore positively, the rating agencies represent one way of economizing on the production of information on credit instruments. And by charging issuers, they also try to address the public nature of this information for, once the information is produced, there is almost no cost to distributing it and hence it is otherwise difficult to get paid. Absent these charges, there could be too little credit information produced.  Overall then, reforms that might compromise the viability of the agencies or discourage use of ratings present the tradeoff of potentially raising costs and ultimately requiring another solution to the issues the agencies help to address.\nExcessive \"Liquidity\"\nPrior to this summer's experience, some commentators had noted that both the volume of subprime lending and the returns required on risky assets had moved into the tails of historic experience (or even beyond historic experience). Some interpreted this observation to suggest that the level of risk taking, both by investors and home buyers, was not sustainable. Moreover, some observers attributed outsized risk taking to provision of \"excessive liquidity,\" an evocative but highly imprecise term, on the part of central banks. Others attributed the situation to the so-called savings glut.\nIn either case, some have asserted that preemptive action on the part of central banks—and particularly the Federal Reserve—could have cooled the credit markets and at least damped the excesses and losses suffered by subprime mortgage borrowers and investors. This argument deserves serious consideration, but it should be recognized that such preemptive action is not without costs.\nTo wit, we cannot pretend that actions which effectively curtail subprime lending won't have a negative effect on homeownership since, after all, many subprime borrowers continue to meet their financial obligations and reside in their homes. As advertised in previous comments, there is a tradeoff here that requires careful calibration as policies are considered; foreclosures might well have been avoided if subprime lending were reined in, but in all likelihood homeownership would have been lower than otherwise as well.\nMore broadly, most of the tools which central banks have at their disposal are blunt instruments which do not permit policymakers to narrowly target their effects. An increase in interest rates designed, say, to address excessive liquidity will likely have restrictive effects on a wide range of households and businesses. Again, we shouldn't pretend that these consequences don't exist; they must be part of the cost-benefit calculation of policy alternatives.\nInterestingly, the excesses in asset prices perceived in recent years seem related, at least casually, to innovation. Consider the run-up in prices of technology stocks in the late 1990's and this year's turbulence linked to pricing of structured financial products and subprime mortgages.  It may be costly to try to address these situations ex ante if, in fact, such actions would inhibit the underlying innovation. Common to all of these concerns is the difficulty of appropriately valuing financial assets.  It is quite plausible that, in pursuing preemptive action, the unintended consequences rival or exceed the desired outcomes.\nRisk Taking and Government Support\nA classic tradeoff facing policymakers concerns financial stability and market discipline. Greater reliance on market disciple runs the risk of less stability. And stability can seemingly be assured through government support which overrides the occasionally harsh dictates of the market.\nBut as we know, government support involves substantial costs of its own. Elimination of market discipline encourages excessive risk taking on the part of financial institutions which, in turn, makes financial disruptions both potentially more likely and more costly.  It would seem, then, that an appropriate balance has to be struck here, and that policymakers have to determine their tolerance for the tradeoff between market discipline and instability.\nWhile true in general, I do think that the market discipline—instability tradeoff has been exaggerated.  In fact, by taking steps to reduce the threat that the failure of a large bank, or decline in asset values in one market, will spillover to other institutions or markets, policymakers can actually increase market discipline and simultaneously achieve greater financial stability.\nLet me expand on how we might approach this happy state of affairs.  Right now, uninsured credits or large banks likely expect government support in the event of problems at such institutions. This is the \"too big to fail\" problem which arises because creditors know full well that policymakers worry about so-called contagion effects—the possibility that weakness at one bank will spillover to other banks and other markets and perhaps ultimately to the real economy. Protection of uninsured creditors forestalls or at least limits the costs of such spillovers.\nBut if policymakers act in advance to reduce the probability and/or magnitude of spillovers, they also reduce the incentive to protect creditors. And if creditors accurately perceive the change in circumstances, they then have greater incentive to appropriately apply market discipline.\nWhat kind of proposals might accomplish these ends? I have co-authored a book which addresses these matters in detail; suffice it to say here that constructive proposals range from limiting the size of losses in the first place (a form of effective prompt corrective action) to reducing the degree to which exposures on payments systems can act as the conduit for spillovers. One specific option we discuss in the book is scenario planning, which might usefully simulate, for example, a failing bank situation. Policymakers can, in the simulation exercise, consider if they have or can get adequate information, if they have adequate powers to address the situation, and what if any changes may be advisable prior to the development of a real problem. \nThe collapse of Northern Rock—a large mortgage lender in the United Kingdom—provides evidence of the potential importance of such simulations. There are ongoing discussions in the U.K. about the adequacy of stress tests and contingency planning in light of Northern Rock. Without claiming to know the preparatory steps the British authorities took, one might imagine that recent experiences might contribute to potential improvements in regulators' simulations.\nIf and as authorities take steps to reduce potential contagion effects and thereby lay the foundation for enhanced market discipline, timely communication of such activities becomes important. Policymakers need to assure that creditors understand that prospects for protection are diminishing, so that they in turn can act accordingly. It may be difficult to communicate effectively in the midst of turmoil, as the Northern Rock case suggests. The Bank of England hoped that its announced support of Northern Rock would stem the run on the bank but the initial communication appeared to have the opposite effect. A lesson here is that it is important to communicate credible intentions and plans prior to the onset of a crisis.\nConclusion\nMy comments this morning are not intended to defend the regulatory and financial status quo, although I can understand that some may interpret them in that way. Rather, they are meant to suggest that there is likely little, if any, \"low hanging fruit\" to harvest and that, specifically, reforms may well impose inefficiencies and other costs of their own. The message is thus one of caution but not of inaction:  we should take considerable care in drawing conclusions about the origins of the recent bout of financial turbulence and about the implications for public policy.\n\nThe overarching theme of my remarks this morning is that regulators of the financial services industry are likely, perhaps inevitably, to confront difficult tradeoffs in designing policies responsive to the recent tumult in financial markets.  As a general statement, this may seem self-evident, but specific cases illustrate the challenging nature of such tradeoffs and strongly suggest that the correct course of action, when put to a cost/benefit test, may be far from obvious.

In this world, the residence of the risk would be relatively clear.\n\nHowever, having a single institution carry out all the activities associated with mortgage lending, or similarly with other loans, does not eliminate principal-agent problems. We all know that, even within firms, it is essential to get the incentives and contracts right so that all work to achieve the same goal.\n\nAnd the alternative—the originate to distribute model—has a core and fundamental economic advantage propelling it: specialization. Over time, firms have developed that specialize in the distinct steps of the lending process, from originating the loan to funding it. Such specialization contributes importantly to cost efficiencies, innovation, and a broadening of access to financial capital.  Another advantage of the model is diversification; the originate to distribute process allows a firm to significantly diversity the asset side of its balance sheet.\n\nIn short, these benefits are valuable in that they facilitate effective use of resources.  Actions to limit specialization and diversification would therefore likely to be costly, with adverse consequences for economic performance and living standards over time. Policymakers would need to consider such costs in assessing reforms proposed to constrain the originate to distribute model.\n\nSome observers have identified reliance on the work of credit rating agencies as a dramatic case of the downside of specialization—of separating out aspects of the credit extension process. In particular, it is asserted that investors gave too much credence to the views of the rating agencies and failed to do enough independent credit analysis.  While not an expert in this area, I think it important that we think critically about what constitutes excessive reliance on external credit analysis in these circumstances.\n\nIf critics mean that there is some systematic failing in the existing rating process and that this is not apparent to those who use the ratings, then reforms in this area may be fully appropriate. But if instead observers are concerned that the rating agencies simply got expected outcomes wrong in some sense (as they have before), then reforms that might subvert the agencies and the information they provide may simultaneously impose significant costs.\n\nTo be specific, it could be exceptionally costly for each investor to build the infrastructure required to conduct serious credit analysis, and these costs need to be weighed against the losses suffered by investors in the current regime. Moreover, were the agencies unique in underestimating the losses in, say, the subprime mortgage market?  It is not obvious that a different infrastructure will produce better results.\n\nMore positively, the rating agencies represent one way of economizing on the production of information on credit instruments. And by charging issuers, they also try to address the public nature of this information for, once the information is produced, there is almost no cost to distributing it and hence it is otherwise difficult to get paid. Absent these charges, there could be too little credit information produced.  Overall then, reforms that might compromise the viability of the agencies or discourage use of ratings present the tradeoff of potentially raising costs and ultimately requiring another solution to the issues the agencies help to address.\n\nPrior to this summer's experience, some commentators had noted that both the volume of subprime lending and the returns required on risky assets had moved into the tails of historic experience (or even beyond historic experience). Some interpreted this observation to suggest that the level of risk taking, both by investors and home buyers, was not sustainable. Moreover, some observers attributed outsized risk taking to provision of \"excessive liquidity,\" an evocative but highly imprecise term, on the part of central banks. Others attributed the situation to the so-called savings glut.\n\nIn either case, some have asserted that preemptive action on the part of central banks—and particularly the Federal Reserve—could have cooled the credit markets and at least damped the excesses and losses suffered by subprime mortgage borrowers and investors. This argument deserves serious consideration, but it should be recognized that such preemptive action is not without costs.\n\nTo wit, we cannot pretend that actions which effectively curtail subprime lending won't have a negative effect on homeownership since, after all, many subprime borrowers continue to meet their financial obligations and reside in their homes. As advertised in previous comments, there is a tradeoff here that requires careful calibration as policies are considered; foreclosures might well have been avoided if subprime lending were reined in, but in all likelihood homeownership would have been lower than otherwise as well.\n\nMore broadly, most of the tools which central banks have at their disposal are blunt instruments which do not permit policymakers to narrowly target their effects. An increase in interest rates designed, say, to address excessive liquidity will likely have restrictive effects on a wide range of households and businesses. Again, we shouldn't pretend that these consequences don't exist; they must be part of the cost-benefit calculation of policy alternatives.\n\nInterestingly, the excesses in asset prices perceived in recent years seem related, at least casually, to innovation. Consider the run-up in prices of technology stocks in the late 1990's and this year's turbulence linked to pricing of structured financial products and subprime mortgages.  It may be costly to try to address these situations ex ante if, in fact, such actions would inhibit the underlying innovation. Common to all of these concerns is the difficulty of appropriately valuing financial assets.  It is quite plausible that, in pursuing preemptive action, the unintended consequences rival or exceed the desired outcomes.\n\nA classic tradeoff facing policymakers concerns financial stability and market discipline. Greater reliance on market disciple runs the risk of less stability. And stability can seemingly be assured through government support which overrides the occasionally harsh dictates of the market.\n\nBut as we know, government support involves substantial costs of its own. Elimination of market discipline encourages excessive risk taking on the part of financial institutions which, in turn, makes financial disruptions both potentially more likely and more costly.  It would seem, then, that an appropriate balance has to be struck here, and that policymakers have to determine their tolerance for the tradeoff between market discipline and instability.\n\nWhile true in general, I do think that the market discipline—instability tradeoff has been exaggerated.  In fact, by taking steps to reduce the threat that the failure of a large bank, or decline in asset values in one market, will spillover to other institutions or markets, policymakers can actually increase market discipline and simultaneously achieve greater financial stability.\n\nLet me expand on how we might approach this happy state of affairs.  Right now, uninsured credits or large banks likely expect government support in the event of problems at such institutions. This is the \"too big to fail\" problem which arises because creditors know full well that policymakers worry about so-called contagion effects—the possibility that weakness at one bank will spillover to other banks and other markets and perhaps ultimately to the real economy. Protection of uninsured creditors forestalls or at least limits the costs of such spillovers.\n\nBut if policymakers act in advance to reduce the probability and/or magnitude of spillovers, they also reduce the incentive to protect creditors. And if creditors accurately perceive the change in circumstances, they then have greater incentive to appropriately apply market discipline.\n\nWhat kind of proposals might accomplish these ends? I have co-authored a book which addresses these matters in detail; suffice it to say here that constructive proposals range from limiting the size of losses in the first place (a form of effective prompt corrective action) to reducing the degree to which exposures on payments systems can act as the conduit for spillovers. One specific option we discuss in the book is scenario planning, which might usefully simulate, for example, a failing bank situation. Policymakers can, in the simulation exercise, consider if they have or can get adequate information, if they have adequate powers to address the situation, and what if any changes may be advisable prior to the development of a real problem.\n\nThe collapse of Northern Rock—a large mortgage lender in the United Kingdom—provides evidence of the potential importance of such simulations. There are ongoing discussions in the U.K. about the adequacy of stress tests and contingency planning in light of Northern Rock. Without claiming to know the preparatory steps the British authorities took, one might imagine that recent experiences might contribute to potential improvements in regulators' simulations.\n\nIf and as authorities take steps to reduce potential contagion effects and thereby lay the foundation for enhanced market discipline, timely communication of such activities becomes important. Policymakers need to assure that creditors understand that prospects for protection are diminishing, so that they in turn can act accordingly. It may be difficult to communicate effectively in the midst of turmoil, as the Northern Rock case suggests. The Bank of England hoped that its announced support of Northern Rock would stem the run on the bank but the initial communication appeared to have the opposite effect. A lesson here is that it is important to communicate credible intentions and plans prior to the onset of a crisis.\n\nMy comments this morning are not intended to defend the regulatory and financial status quo, although I can understand that some may interpret them in that way. Rather, they are meant to suggest that there is likely little, if any, \"low hanging fruit\" to harvest and that, specifically, reforms may well impose inefficiencies and other costs of their own. The message is thus one of caution but not of inaction:  we should take considerable care in drawing conclusions about the origins of the recent bout of financial turbulence and about the implications for public policy."

        "content": "Good afternoon. As President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, I regularly hear from the directors of our branch in Helena, who keep me informed of economic developments in Montana. All the same, I appreciate the opportunity to see for myself and meet face-to-face with business and community leaders at events like this. Through these meetings, the regional structure of the Federal Reserve System, with its 12 independent district banks and their regional branches, contributes to a healthy two-way flow of information between Federal Reserve officials and the American people, and in a few minutes I?ll come back to why that?s valuable. But, first, let me talk about the status of economic education in the United States. Although this may seem to be a completely different topic, I?ll explain why I see connections that are important to all of us.\nYesterday I had the privilege of making some remarks in Washington, D.C., as part of the official release of Nation?s Report Card on Economics. This Report Card is part of a series of similar assessments of elementary and secondary educational achievement that the U.S. Department of Education has conducted for many years in subjects like reading, mathematics, science, and more. However, they had never assessed economics education. That changed in 2006, when over 11,000 twelfth-grade students from 590 public and private schools nationwide were tested on their knowledge of how markets and national and international economies work.\nI was happy to take part on the panel marking the release of the Report Card on economics education, for at least three reasons. First, I clearly think that economic knowledge, and hence economics education, are important. Although I am speaking only for myself and not for the Federal Reserve, I will argue that policymaking becomes easier and more effective the better the general public understands economics. Second, like many economists, I think that incentives, and thus accountability, matter. For that reason, I welcomed the Department of Education?s decision to extend its program of educational assessment to include economics.\nFinally, and especially, I was pleased that the results of the assessment were better than I had expected. Seventy-nine percent of the students demonstrated at least a basic knowledge of high school economics, and 42 percent performed at a proficient level, including 3 percent who demonstrated advanced knowledge. The assessment also showed that most 12th graders get at least some economics education in high school. Sixteen percent said they?d had an advanced economics course, such as Advanced Placement (AP) economics, and an additional 49 percent had taken general economics. About a quarter of the students had taken a business course, a personal finance course, or a course, such as government, that included a unit in economics. Only 13 percent said they?d had no formal instruction in economics.\nOf course, I still see ample room for improvement, and I hope to see even better marks in the next economics report card in 2012. I also hope that the disparities revealed in this Report Card in the achievement levels of students from different backgrounds will shrink and, before long, disappear. Nonetheless, as an economic policymaker, I was encouraged that even now a large majority of American high school seniors have at least a basic understanding of economic principles and that many have achieved a degree of proficiency in economic reasoning. That?s a good base to build on and a credit to the teachers, parents, and others who guide our nation?s youth.\nSeveral of those leaders in economics education are in the room today. I?d particularly like to recognize one of them, our Helena Branch Manager, Sam Gane. You may know that Sam will be retiring soon, after a long and distinguished career with the Federal Reserve in Cleveland, Minneapolis, and Helena. What you may not know is that since 1999 Sam has been a member of the board of directors of the Montana Council on Economic Education and served as the board?s president from 2002 to 2004. At the Branch, he maintained a tradition of partnering with the Council to sponsor the Montana High School Economics Challenge, a statewide economics knowledge competition that completed its 12th year last February. Under Sam?s leadership, the Helena Branch and the Council also co-sponsored last year?s first ever Montana Economic Education Summit, and they are working together on next month?s second annual Summit in Helena as well. Sam, in addition to noting your many other contributions, I want to express a special ?thank you? for your leadership in economic education.\nSam?s upcoming retirement prompts me to make a few comments about our plans for the Helena Branch. First of all, the Branch will remain in good hands. We recently announced that Sam?s successor as Branch Manager will be Paul Drake, the current AVP at the Branch. Paul has a proven record of leadership, having worked closely with Sam for many years and having played a leading role in the difficult but necessary downsizing and restructuring of the Branch over the past two years.\nThis restructuring is part of an overall Federal Reserve System plan to bring our check processing business not only into the 21st century but also into the black. As one who has been very close to this effort, I can assure you that Helena was not singled out. Due to the rapid decline in the volume of paper checks since 1995, the Federal Reserve has reduced its check processing sites from 45 in 2003 to 19 by the end of this year, and we expect to be down to about 4 sites by 2010. As part of our ongoing national restructuring, we recently announced that check processing at the Federal Reserve Bank in Minneapolis, a large volume site, will be phased out as well, in the fourth quarter of 2009.\nAlthough leaner than before, the Helena Branch will retain key functions in areas such as banking supervision, cash processing, and community outreach and economic education. In addition, the Branch will have a full slate of directors who will continue to play important roles in providing information on economic and banking conditions in Montana and helping us reach the people of the State. In other words, we are committed to maintaining the Branch?s role in the two-way flow of information that I mentioned earlier.\nIn this regard, I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge and genuinely thank two Helena Branch directors who will be leaving the Board at the end of the year, namely Joy Ott and Larry Simkins. Thank you for your service, and for the quality of the information you brought to the ?table.? One of the strengths of policymaking in the Federal Reserve is the first-hand, timely economic intelligence provided by directors like Joy and Larry. Their information and anecdotes mean that we are not wholly captive of statistics published with a lag that necessarily provide a somewhat dated picture of business activity.\nOn that note, let me try to bring some of the strands of my remarks together by reviewing how the public?s understanding of economic principles contributes to good policymaking. As I have discussed at greater length in other contexts, enduring economic progress and prosperity depend on public institutions? ability to commit to policies that are optimal over the long haul, across the temporary ups and downs of the business cycle. In a democracy, such policy commitments can only be sustained with broad public support, and public support for good policies depends, in turn, on voters? competence in basic economic reasoning.\nTangible evidence of the connection between good policies and public understanding can be found in our experience with monetary policy during and after the 1970s. From 1973 to 1981, the U.S. economy experienced a period of sustained high inflation; consumer prices rose by about 9 percent per year, on average, over that period. These high inflation rates distorted economic decisions, hindered growth, pushed interest rates to record levels, and weakened our financial system. Adding to the problem was the widespread view that high inflation was here to stay, a ?fact of life? to be accepted and adjusted to. Today we know that this view was too pessimistic. Under Paul Volcker, the Federal Reserve made a commitment to get inflation down and keep it down. Chairman Volcker kept that commitment, and it has been unambiguously extended by his successors, Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke.\nAlthough the Federal Reserve?s firm commitment to a policy of long-term low inflation was essential in this process, support from the public was just as critical. This was especially so during Chairman Volcker?s tenure, when the shift to a consistent anti-inflationary policy entailed painful adjustments for many consumers and businesses. Chairman Volcker?s public statements helped guide the public to a consensus that inflation hurts economic growth and thereby, over time, most citizens. Inflation has now been reasonably well contained for roughly two decades or so, and the firm consensus in favor of price stability has been sustained. One reason, I think, is that under Chairman Greenspan, the Federal Reserve took a series of steps in an effort to communicate more clearly with the public, including financial market participants, about its objectives and its policies. Chairman Bernanke has embraced and extended that effort. As a result, the public continues to understand the long-term benefits of low inflation and thus to support the Federal Reserve?s pursuit of this objective as one element of our dual mandate. I think this is an excellent example of the value of economic knowledge.\nThe Fed?s commitment to a low-inflation policy, and its increased emphasis on clearly communicating both that commitment and the decisions taken to implement it, are part of a world-wide trend. As explained in an essay by V.V. Chari and Patrick Kehoe in the Minneapolis Fed's 2006 annual report, central banks around the world seem to have learned some of the key lessons of modern macroeconomic theory. This theory stresses that policymakers must always consider how their current policy choices will affect expectations of future policies. In a sense, this is an old lesson—that policymakers can?t say one thing and do another, and that actions speak louder that words. But modern macroeconomic theory has clarified how these adages specifically apply to monetary policy.\nThere is insufficient time this afternoon to review the arguments provided in the Annual Report in detail, and I do not want to try your patience excessively. By the way of summary, let me just say that, in effect, modern macroeconomic theory stresses the importance of a high degree of communication and mutual understanding between the central bank and the public. The central bank needs to convincingly convey to the public the substance and logic of a credible long-term commitment to low inflation. Credibility and transparency also require it to explain its other objectives, such as the maximum employment objective that is the second part of the dual mandate of the Federal Reserve.\nFrom this perspective, the importance of economic education is clear. The public?s understanding of basic economic concepts and principles is vital to sustaining sound long-term policies in a democracy. Although citizens can come to a basic level of economic knowledge through many channels, high-quality elementary and secondary instruction in at least basic economic concepts is probably the most efficient and effective method for achieving widespread understanding.\nThe importance of clear communication about monetary policy also helps us understand some of the advantages of the Federal Reserve System?s regional structure of district banks and branches. On the one side, having directors, advisory councils, meetings like this, and other contacts in our districts (and outside of Washington D.C.) improves both the Federal Reserve?s understanding of economic conditions and the public?s views of our policies and of our credibility. On the other side, a regional presence helps us communicate the substance and rationale of our policy decisions effectively.\nSo far, I have focused on monetary policy and the benefits of an economically educated citizenry, but the benefits extend to other aspects of Federal Reserve responsibilities. Today we are witnessing some painful and belated learning, by policymakers and consumers alike, in our consumer financial markets. As you are probably well aware, consumers today have access to a wide array of borrowing and savings options. In itself, variety is good, because it expands opportunities and choice. However, variety also fosters complexity, which challenges both consumers in their decision making and financial regulators in their writing and enforcement of rules.\nThis is not the occasion to go into the details of how the Fed and the other financial regulators are responding, but I would like to use some simple economics to make a connection between financial regulation and economic education. In short, I view regulation aimed at protecting consumers and consumer education as substitutes. If consumers are more educated and able to make good decisions on their own, regulations can be narrower and more focused on clearly abusive practices such as deceit and fraud.\nThis is valuable, because as the scope of regulation widens, so does the cost. I?m not just referring to enforcement costs, which are high enough. More significant, in my view, are the extra compliance burdens that broad regulations impose on legitimate transactions and the opportunities forgone when legitimate potential transactions are prevented outright. Don?t get me wrong. In some cases it is necessary and appropriate that we bear these costs in order to prevent even greater abuses elsewhere. However, regulation involves a tradeoff between preventing harm to some and allowing innovation, gains from trade, and free choice for others. At any given time, we write our regulations as best we can to balance that trade off. Over time, however, we hope that better economic education will soften the trade off and allow us to rely more on consumers? informed decision making and less on broad, formal restrictions. I see the Economics Report Card that I discussed earlier as setting a good benchmark for measuring progress toward that goal.\nI hope my remarks and the examples I have discussed highlight the importance of economic education to good policymaking. I, Sam Gane, and many other Federal Reserve staff are actively involved in supporting economic education. We know that clear communication about public policy and an economically well-educated public are crucial in sustaining good monetary and regulatory policies and, in turn, a prosperous economy. Thank you.\nTop\n\nGood afternoon.

In short, I view regulation aimed at protecting consumers and consumer education as substitutes. If consumers are more educated and able to make good decisions on their own, regulations can be narrower and more focused on clearly abusive practices such as deceit and fraud.\n\nThis is valuable, because as the scope of regulation widens, so does the cost. I?m not just referring to enforcement costs, which are high enough. More significant, in my view, are the extra compliance burdens that broad regulations impose on legitimate transactions and the opportunities forgone when legitimate potential transactions are prevented outright. Don?t get me wrong. In some cases it is necessary and appropriate that we bear these costs in order to prevent even greater abuses elsewhere. However, regulation involves a tradeoff between preventing harm to some and allowing innovation, gains from trade, and free choice for others. At any given time, we write our regulations as best we can to balance that trade off. Over time, however, we hope that better economic education will soften the trade off and allow us to rely more on consumers? informed decision making and less on broad, formal restrictions. I see the Economics Report Card that I discussed earlier as setting a good benchmark for measuring progress toward that goal.\n\nI hope my remarks and the examples I have discussed highlight the importance of economic education to good policymaking. I, Sam Gane, and many other Federal Reserve staff are actively involved in supporting economic education. We know that clear communication about public policy and an economically well-educated public are crucial in sustaining good monetary and regulatory policies and, in turn, a prosperous economy. Thank you.\n\nTop"

        "content": "I am pleased to join you this morning for release of the first Nation's Report Card on economics for at least three reasons. First, I clearly think that economic knowledge, and hence economics education, are very important. Although I am speaking only for myself today and not for the Federal Reserve System, it seems clear to me that economic policy-making becomes easier and more effective the better the general public understands economics, and I will return to this theme shortly.\nSecond, like many economists, I think that incentives, and thus accountability, matter. For that reason, I welcome the decision of the National Assessment Governing Board to extend their program of educational assessment to include economics. Assessment programs can be costly, for the assessors and the assessed alike. By drawing on its broad experience in educational assessment, the National Assessment can minimize these costs, so that they are outweighed by the benefits of enhanced incentives and accountability.\nFinally, and especially, I am pleased to see that our nation's economics report card is perhaps a bit better than I would have guessed. As a member and former chair of the board of directors of the National Council on Economic Education, I certainly see plenty of room for improvement, and I think this assessment can help guide our efforts toward more effective education in economics. As a result, I hope to see even better results, and smaller disparities among students of different backgrounds, in the next economics report card in 2012.\nBut as an economic policy maker, I am encouraged that even now a large majority of American high school seniors have at least a basic understanding of economic principles and that over 40 percent have reached the Proficient achievement level set by the Governing Board. That's a good base to build on and a credit to the teachers, parents, and others who guide our nation's youth and need our support to achieve even better results.\nI'd like to draw on my experience as a Federal Reserve Bank president to expand a bit on how the public's understanding of economic principles contributes to good policy-making. As I have discussed at greater length elsewhere (Top of the Ninth, The Region, June 2006), enduring economic progress and prosperity depend on public institutions' ability to commit to policies that are optimal over the long haul, across the temporary ups and downs of the business cycle. In a democracy, such policy commitments can only be sustained with broad public support, and public support for good policies depends, in turn, on voters' competence in basic economic reasoning.\nTangible evidence of the connection between good policies and public understanding can be found in our experience with monetary policy during and after the 1970s. Over a decade before today's high school seniors were born, the U.S. economy experienced a period of sustained high inflation. From 1973 to 1981, consumer prices rose by about 9 percent per year, on average. These high inflation rates distorted economic decisions, hindered growth, pushed interest rates to record levels, and weakened our financial system. Adding to the problem was the widespread view that high inflation was here to stay, a \"fact of life\" to be accepted and adjusted to. Today we know that this view was too pessimistic.\nUnder Paul Volcker, the Federal Reserve made a commitment to get inflation down and keep it down. Chairman Volcker kept that commitment, and it has been unambiguously extended by his successors, Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke.\nAlthough the Federal Reserve's firm commitment to a policy of long-term low inflation was essential in this process, support from the public was critical as well. This was especially so during Chairman Volcker's tenure, when the shift to a consistent anti-inflationary policy entailed painful adjustments for many consumers and businesses. Chairman Volcker's public statements helped guide the public to a consensus that inflation hurts economic growth and thereby, over time, most citizens.\nInflation has now been reasonably well contained for roughly two decades or so, and the consensus in favor of price stability has been sustained. One reason, I think, is that under Chairman Greenspan, the Federal Reserve took a series of steps to communicate more clearly with the public, including financial market participants, about its objectives and its policies. Chairman Bernanke has embraced and extended that effort. As a result, the public continues to understand the long-term benefits of low inflation and thus to support the Federal Reserve's pursuit of this objective as one important element of our dual mandate. I think this is an excellent example of the value of economic knowledge.\nThe public was educated about inflation at a high price, amidst the economic dislocations of the 1970s and early 1980s. I prefer that economic education be pursued more benignly, in the classroom and the press, and more proactively, before rather than after it is needed. So I regret to note that today we are again witnessing some painful and belated learning, by policy-makers and consumers alike, in our consumer financial markets.\nAs you are probably well aware, consumers today have access to a wide array of borrowing and savings options. In itself, variety is good, because it expands choice and opportunity. However, variety also fosters complexity, which challenges both consumers in their decision-making and financial regulators in their writing and enforcement of rules.\nThis is not the time to go into the details of how the Federal Reserve and the other financial regulators are responding, but I would like to use some simple economics to make a connection between financial regulation and economic education.

        "content": "Good afternoon. It is a distinct pleasure to join you in Dayton and to have the opportunity to speak at this forum. I have titled these remarks \"Perspectives on the Economy\" but a better description might actually be how to think about the U.S. economy. Since I gather that all of you share a keen interest in investments, the ability to accurately understand the economy, and its prospects, could be a significant asset in your human capital portfolio.\nThe U.S. economy is large, diverse, and complex with lots of moving parts, so it is not necessarily easy to gauge what is going on. Still, I think there are lessons from recent history, as well as implications from economic theory, that can aid our understanding and keep us grounded in an environment of exceedingly rapid transmission of data and almost instantaneous analysis, only some of which is of value. Accordingly, my plan today is to interweave a description of the current state of business activity with the performance of the economy over the past 2 ½ decades or so to elucidate some principles appropriate to understanding the economy and assessing its future course. Specifics will be forthcoming momentarily; first, though, let me remind you that I am speaking only for myself and not for others in the Federal Reserve.\nThe current economic expansion began in the fourth quarter of 2001, so it has now proceeded for about 5 ½ years. In itself, this duration is unremarkable; the expansions of the 1980s and 1990s (about which I'll have more to say shortly) lasted about 8 ½ and nearly 10 years, respectively. The latest extended period of growth may appear more impressive, however, when we recall all the concern expressed about its fragility just a few years ago. So, one question relevant to thinking about the economy and, by implication, its likely performance: is the U.S. economy fragile?\nI think the evidence of the past 25 years addresses this issue convincingly. The economy grew uninterruptedly from late 1982 until the middle of 1990, with a substantial net increase in employment economy-wide, diminishing inflation, and strong financial markets. Growth resumed in the spring of 1991, following a mild recession, and persisted, again uninterruptedly, through 2000. Again, the expansion of 1990s was accompanied by sizable job creation, healthy financial markets, and generally low inflation.\nOn the surface, these episodes don't depict a particularly fragile economy, and, if we look a little deeper, concerns about fragility seem even less compelling. Remember that during the 1980s and the 1990s there were on occasion material economic problems at some of our largest trading partners, including Mexico and Japan, and there was the stock market crash of 1987, the Asian financial and Russian debt problems of 1997-98, the demise of many domestic savings and loan institutions and major problems in commercial banking in the late 1980s-early 1990s. Note also that employment in the manufacturing sector peaked in 1979 and has been declining persistently if unevenly since. I'm sure I've excluded some of the shocks to which the economy responded, but the point is that the expansions proceeded largely unimpeded. Rather than fragile, the economy appears resilient and flexible, and these are the characteristics I would emphasize in thinking about the future.\nBut, you might object, didn't monetary or other policies play an important role in stabilizing the economy during these decades and, therefore, doesn't policy deserve credit for the record just described? There are two responses. First, I do think that policy played a constructive role over much of the period but, having said that, I do not think it deserves the lion's share of the credit, much as we policymakers might like to claim it. Rather, the relevant history is largely a testament to the fundamental soundness of our market-based system. Second, and in any event, if in thinking about the future you choose to assign a significant role to monetary policy rest assured that policy, too, will remain sound.\nSo, we have before us a flexible, resilient economy demonstrably capable of sustained economic growth even in the face of disruptions, characterized at the moment by persistent gains in employment and consumer spending, generally liquid financial conditions, and improving activity abroad. In these circumstances, the outlook would seem to be positive as, indeed, I think it is. To be sure, the housing sector has been a drag on activity and is of concern but I suspect that the bulk, although not all, of the adjustment in residential construction is behind us.\nAll of this is not to say that the business cycle has become an historical curiosity. Downturns in business activity will no doubt occur but, as I have learned from hard experience, their timing is exceedingly difficult to forecast accurately. And there may be comfort in recognizing that, overall, the economy appears to have become more stable since the mid-1980's, when the low inflation regime was established.\nAs you no doubt know, there is a virtually continuous flow of statistics on the economy over the course of a month and this \"high frequency data,\" as economists like to say, may assist in identifying changes in conditions. While paying attention to the weekly and monthly reports, I would caution against putting considerable weight on any one of them. Most of the data are notoriously noisy and subject to revision; moreover, they frequently provide inconsistent, if not contradictory, signals. It is valuable, I think, in assessing incoming high frequency reports, to ask whether they are basically in line with your fundamental long-run outlook for the economy or if, alternatively, they represent a significant departure from expectations? To the extent that Federal Reserve communications leave the impression that high frequency observations are of great value, then this is something which I think we need to address. In my experience, a considerable accumulation of evidence usually is required before it is wise to change your view.\nThis warning might provide a convenient place to conclude these remarks, but there is another issue I want to call to your attention because it has important implications for thinking about the economy of the future. Broadly speaking, the issue is demographics and, in particular, the implications of the aging of the population for the labor market and for economic growth. To be sure, demographics also have significant implications for entitlement programs and the Federal budget, but those are matters for another day.\nIn this country, we have become accustomed to (net) increases in employment of at least 150,000-160,000 workers per month on average, roughly equal to the average monthly addition to the labor force. But labor force growth is projected to slow appreciably over the next ten years as the baby boom generation retires; depending on which reputable set of projections you select, we should probably expect monthly increments to the labor force of 110,000 on the low end to 150,000 on the high side. Increases in employment will adjust down similarly, other things equal, since people who are not available cannot be hired. Moreover, to the extent that labor force participation rates level off or decline—and this is widely anticipated in part because of the end of the run-up of participation rates of women—increases in the labor force will be even smaller than the estimates I just cited, probably by several tens of thousands per month.\nDiminution of growth of the labor force could have pronounced implications for economic performance, since the volume of labor input is a major determinant of the aggregate supply of goods and services. Other things equal, slow expansion of the labor force would imply slow growth of the overall economy, at least relative to the experience of the past several decades. But other things may not be equal.\n\nAn acceleration in productivity, for example, could offset (or conceivably more than offset) the moderation in the increase in the labor force and sustain economic growth. Is such a development likely? It is difficult, to put it mildly, to answer this question definitively, but there are reasons to think that productivity may fill at least some of the gap. The fact that people on average live longer than formerly provides an additional incentive to investment in human capital, suggesting that skills, and therefore productivity, should benefit. Returns to education have been substantial for some time and this incentive works in the same direction. Business may also adopt more capital-intensive production processes over time.\nMoreover, it is probably worth taking the labor force projections with a grain of salt. To the extent that the demographics make labor relatively scarce, we would expect compensation to rise more rapidly than otherwise, thereby inducing some to stay in the labor force longer than they otherwise would have, some to enter the labor force earlier than they would have, and some to work longer hours. Employers may also become increasingly flexible about work schedules and locations, for example, in order to improve the attractiveness of participation. Note, also, that I would not expect inflation to accelerate even if compensation does, as long as the Federal Reserve remains committed to a stable, low inflation policy.\nIt seems doubtful that these labor market adjustments will offset fully the effects of changing demographics; nevertheless, they serve to illustrate the inherent flexibility of a market economy in responding to such factors. And, of course, the U.S. participates in a dynamic global economy, suggesting other avenues for flexible adjustment.\nLet me, in wrapping up, briefly summarize the theme of these remarks. Taking a step back, I have essentially been advocating the adoption of a long-run view of the U.S. economy—one that does not put inordinate emphasis on weekly or monthly developments. This longer-run perspective is appropriate to investors and reveals, I think, an economy anything but fragile; instead, a resilient and flexible economy is observed. And, even though demographic trends associated with the labor force might suggest slower growth in prospect over, say, the next ten years, the flexibility inherent in a market economy like ours suggests the likely emergence of changes which will work to moderate, and possibly eliminate, this prospect.\n\nGood afternoon. It is a distinct pleasure to join you in Dayton and to have the opportunity to speak at this forum. I have titled these remarks \"Perspectives on the Economy\" but a better description might actually be how to think about the U.S. economy.

And, of course, the U.S. participates in a dynamic global economy, suggesting other avenues for flexible adjustment.\n\nLet me, in wrapping up, briefly summarize the theme of these remarks. Taking a step back, I have essentially been advocating the adoption of a long-run view of the U.S. economy—one that does not put inordinate emphasis on weekly or monthly developments. This longer-run perspective is appropriate to investors and reveals, I think, an economy anything but fragile; instead, a resilient and flexible economy is observed. And, even though demographic trends associated with the labor force might suggest slower growth in prospect over, say, the next ten years, the flexibility inherent in a market economy like ours suggests the likely emergence of changes which will work to moderate, and possibly eliminate, this prospect."

        "content": "In these brief remarks, I'm going to explore the implications of two significant developments in financial markets for central bank, and in particular Federal Reserve, responsibilities. The two phenomena I intend to consider are: 1) heightened competition in the domestic financial environment, as evidenced by a proliferation of institutions, instruments, and new markets; and 2) the growing global integration of financial markets. These topics are in the spirit of the conference because I have had the sense that the organizers were interested in subjects that may not be captured altogether neatly in standard macroeconomic models.\nBy the way, both developments seem related to the observed increase in the liquidity of a wide range of assets, a trend which in turn derives from the reduction in information and transaction costs stemming from technological change. Liquidity is a concept the conference organizers also suggested might be worthy of attention, and I am happy to oblige; although the term is notoriously difficult to define, I would hazard that at its core the concept relates to the ease with which an asset can be converted to cash. And I do think that liquidity helps to explain the importance of the developments I will discuss. Finally, let me be clear at the outset that I make no claim for the originality of much of this commentary. I am explicitly drawing on well-established strands in the literature. And, of course, the usual Federal Reserve caveat applies; I am speaking for myself and not for others in the Federal Reserve.\nLet me start with the first phenomenon just noted and describe some of its implications more explicitly. The proliferation we have witnessed in institutions, instruments, and markets presumably allows, on average, both for improved diversification in finance and for greater flexibility in an institution's choice of its risk profile. There are other ramifications as well. As many have reported, investment banks, private equity firms, and hedge funds, among others, have invaded the traditional turf of commercial banks, increasing competition and thereby serving customers increasingly effectively. As financial innovation has progressed, banks—at least many of the largest, most sophisticated institutions—have responded by securitizing and selling off their most standard, commodity-like credits, leaving their balance sheets with a preponderance of relatively heterogeneous, information intensive, illiquid assets.\nSome might think that in this process, and particularly in view of heightened competition, commercial banks have become less important in the financial system overall. John Boyd and Mark Gertler carefully examined this issue about 15 years ago, when there were similar assertions about the diminishing importance of banks.1 Their results, which adjusted for banks' off balance sheet activities and so forth, indicated no quantitative change in banks' role in finance, and recent work by staff at the Minneapolis Federal Reserve, updating Boyd-Gertler, appears to confirm the earlier conclusions, although I should note that the recent work is still quite preliminary.\nNevertheless, I suspect that there has been a significant, qualitative change in the position of large banks as they have adapted to challenges in the environment. In particular, and as foreshadowed a moment ago, as banks have disposed of plain-vanilla, readily securitized assets, their balance sheets may have become more risky.2 Coupled with expansion of off balance sheet activities and growing reliance on trading in a range of instruments and markets, large institutions, and their exposures to various counterparties, likely have become more difficult to manage and to assess.\nThe policy prescriptions stemming from this situation seem relatively straightforward. Concern about the possible vulnerability of, say, hedge funds or the credit derivatives market is well taken, but it shouldn't distract supervisors and policymakers from appropriate focus on more \"familiar\" commercial banks. As I have argued previously, in the context of the too-big-to-fail issue, problems at one or more large, complex commercial banks could potentially have systemic repercussions, and recent developments in banking have not assuaged this concern.3\nSome have made a different argument for continued supervisory focus on commercial banks, suggesting that by assuring that banks have taken appropriate precautions in their lending to, and other transactions with, say, hedge funds and the like, adequate discipline will have been brought to bear on this latter group of institutions. But I'm not confident of this result for, as I implied a moment ago, to the extent that large banks do not face sufficient market discipline, we can't expect them to act altogether effectively as the levee against excessive risk taking outside the banking sector.\nNow, let me move on to the second phenomenon identified in my introductory comments, namely, increasing global financial integration. This is a trend which has received lots of attention and deservedly so. There appears to be a general perception that in fact financial markets worldwide have become more closely intertwined and that financial capital flows more readily across borders than formerly. There is statistical evidence quantifying this development and, from the perspective of resource allocation, such a development is clearly welcome.4\nAt the same time, growing capital market integration has raised some concern about the potential effectiveness of domestic (Federal Reserve) monetary policy. The argument seems to be—and let me emphasize that what follows is for illustrative purposes only—that the effects on long-term interest rates of a Federal Reserve-engineered increase in short-term rates could be largely offset by financial inflows from abroad. Thus, so the story goes, a larger-than-anticipated increase in the Federal funds rate would be required to achieve a given degree of policy restraint or, put more mildly, policymakers would necessarily be more uncertain about the appropriate level of the funds rate in view of the potential for a global response of financial flows.\nAll this strikes me as logical enough, but I am unsure if it is of much moment. In my experience, there is always some, usually considerable, uncertainty attending the appropriate level of and potential changes in the Federal funds rate. An international channel may complicate the analysis incrementally, but there is ample uncertainty in any event. Further, and also to conclude, it seems to me that policy ultimately must be judged against the background of the achievement of the well-recognized dual mandate. Relative to this metric, results look pretty good for the past two decades or so and, relevant to the issue at hand, this record has been established, skillfully or with a lot of good fortune, in an ever-changing environment.\nEndnotes\n1John H.
