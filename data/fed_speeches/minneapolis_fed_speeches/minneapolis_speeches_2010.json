It is a pleasure and an honor to be with you here today and to address this symposium established to commemorate the professional careers and the intellectual interests of Howard and Darrel Alkire, who have meant so much to Hamline University. It is especially an honor to give this talk knowing the prestigious line-up of speakers that precedes me, including Nobel laureate economists and prominent policymakers.\nI became president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis last October. During the preceding 22 years, I was a professor of economics at a variety of institutions. I did research in a number of areas, including public finance. My main area of interest, though, was macroeconomics. There has been a lot of conversation over the past year or two about what we have and haven’t learned from macroeconomics. For myself, I believe that one of the most important developments in the field is the use of tools from public finance to answer key macroeconomic policy questions. To my knowledge, this line of research dates back to the work of Robert Lucas and Nancy Stokey in the 1980s. It continues to be a vital area of investigation almost 30 years later—and it will play a key role in my remarks today.\nI’ll begin by discussing current macroeconomic conditions and the Federal Open Market Committee’s recent actions taken in response to those conditions. That discussion will make clear that the committee took those actions because it is not able to cut its interest rate target any further. Motivated by this difficulty, I will pose and answer the following question: What actions can other policymakers take to approximate the impact of an interest rate cut? In addressing this question, I will rely on recent research being done at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis by staff researcher Juan Pablo Nicolini and several co-authors. Throughout, I’ll be speaking on behalf of myself and no other participant in FOMC meetings.\nLet me start with some basic context about how monetary policy gets made in the United States. The Federal Open Market Committee meets eight times per year to determine the path of monetary policy over the next six to seven weeks. The governors of the Federal Reserve Board and the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York are permanent members of the committee. Four other presidents of Reserve banks are on the committee, but this group rotates annually. While they do not vote, the other presidents are invited to the FOMC meeting and contribute to the committee’s deliberations. Right now, I’m a meeting participant, but I will rotate onto the committee in 2011.\nThe foundation of the committee’s discussions is what is called its dual mandate. By statute, the Federal Reserve is required to follow policies that promote effectively the goals of price stability and maximum employment. The former objective of price stability is generally understood as keeping inflation in a range of around 1.5 to 2.5 percent. The second part of the mandate—maximum employment—is more of a moving target, because employment is shaped by many determinants beyond the Fed’s control: demographics, social custom, taxes, technology, and so on.\nWith that context, let me describe the economic situation that confronted the committee at its meeting in November. Over the first three quarters of this year, personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price inflation has averaged roughly 1 percent at an annualized rate. This rate is low relative to the FOMC’s target of 2 percent. More troublingly, the inflation rate is drifting downward. Over the preceding two-year period (from the fourth quarter of 2007 through the fourth quarter of 2009), PCE inflation averaged 1.6 percent per year. Just to be clear, the measure of PCE inflation that I’m describing includes all goods, including food and energy.\nAt the same time, unemployment is high: In October, it was 9.6 percent. Here, too, the trend is not comforting. The recession officially ended in June 2009, and in that month, unemployment was 9.5 percent. Unemployment has actually risen slightly during the course of the recovery.\nSufficient growth in output can steadily lower unemployment. But growth has been low in this recovery compared with most. As I mentioned, the recession officially ended in June 2009 and so has been over for five quarters. Over those five quarters, real gross domestic product (GDP) has grown at an annualized rate of 2.9 percent. More troublingly, growth has been decelerating: In the past two quarters, it has averaged 2.1 percent at an annualized rate. And here, I should note that I’m reporting data on real GDP growth that have actually been revised upward since the November meeting.\nThis is the economic situation that confronted the FOMC in its November meeting. Inflation and employment are both too low, and the rate of improvement in these variables is too slow. Economic growth has been low and has recently decelerated still further. I think it is safe to say that, given this situation, the FOMC would have liked to have been able to cut its target interest rate. But this option is not available. The FOMC’s target interest rate is already essentially at zero (more precisely, in a range between 0 and 25 basis points).\nBut the FOMC does have another policy instrument available: its balance sheet. As of the beginning of this month, the FOMC had a portfolio of roughly $2.3 trillion. Over 2 trillion of those dollars are invested in Treasury securities or government-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and other government-sponsored enterprises. At its November 3 meeting, the FOMC announced that it plans to buy $600 billion of long-term Treasuries in the open market by mid-2011. In exchange for those securities, it will credit the sellers’ accounts at the Fed with more reserves. This kind of action is known as quantitative easing, or QE.\nThe main goal of QE is to lower the long-run real interest rate. Here, by real interest rate, I’m referring to the interest rate net of expected inflation. More specifically, suppose that the interest rate on a 10-year bond is about 2.5 percent and that people expect inflation to be around 2 percent per year over the next 10 years. Then, the real interest rate is about 0.5 percent per year for the next 10 years.\nA low long-term real interest rate stimulates an economy in a number of ways. It spurs consumer spending by allowing consumers to borrow and refinance more cheaply. It makes capital expenditures and hiring more profitable for corporations. Stock prices and house prices rise because those assets become relatively more attractive as investments. Households with these assets become wealthier and demand more consumption. All of these effects should lead to less unemployment and upward pressure on prices.\nHow does QE go about lowering long-term real interest rates? QE is a sufficiently novel monetary policy tool that different economists may well give different answers to this question. In my view, QE lowers long-term real interest rates in two distinct ways. The first is that QE is a form of nonverbal communication about the FOMC’s future plans. Here’s what I mean. The November FOMC statement says that the committee will keep the fed funds target range exceptionally low for as long as economic conditions warrant. The statement also predicts that exceptionally low fed funds rates are likely to be warranted for an “extended period” of time. In this way, the statement provides explicit communication about the FOMC’s future plans for short-term rates and so also shapes the level of current longer-term interest rates.\nQE provides a significant supplement to this explicit verbal communication. The use of QE indicates that the FOMC is likely to keep its target interest rate lower for an even longer period of time. Indeed, one could readily argue that buying $600 billion of Treasuries is a much more convincing form of communication of the FOMC’s plans than any words could ever be.\nThus, QE lowers long-term real interest rates by signaling the FOMC’s intentions about future short-term rates. However, QE also lowers long-term real interest rates in a second, more direct, way. The holder of a long-term Treasury is exposed to interest rate risk, because the value of that bond fluctuates as interest rates vary. When the Fed buys $600 billion of long-term bonds, the bond portfolio of the private sector is now less exposed to this kind of risk. As a consequence, private investors will demand a lower premium for holding other bonds that are exposed to interest rate risk, and all long-term yields fall.\nIn this way, the change to the asset side of the Fed’s balance sheet provides stimulus to the economy. But what about the liability side of its balance sheet? QE creates more reserves in banks’ accounts with the Fed. The standard intuition is that this kind of reserve creation is inflationary. Banks can only offer checkable deposits in proportion to their reserves. Economists view checkable deposits as a form of money because, like cash, checkable deposits make many transactions easier. In this sense, bank reserves held with the Fed are licenses for banks to create a certain amount of money. By giving out more licenses, the FOMC is allowing banks to create more money. More money chasing the same amount of goods—voila, inflation.\nGiven some of the criticisms of the Fed that have been voiced over the past two weeks, it is important to understand that this basic logic isn’t valid in current circumstances. Banks have nearly $1 trillion of excess reserves. This means that they are not using a lot of their existing licenses to create money. QE gives them $600 billion of new licenses to create money, but I do not see why they would suddenly start to use the new ones if they weren’t using the old ones.\nSome observers have expressed concerns that $1 trillion—which will shortly become over $1.5 trillion—of excess reserves represent what they term “kindling” for some future inflationary fire. I believe that these concerns are misplaced for two reasons. First, the Fed has several tools with which to combat incipient inflationary pressures. Most obviously, it can raise the interest rate on excess reserves as a form of tightening. Second, in recent public statements, Chairman Ben Bernanke has explicitly and firmly committed the FOMC to maintaining low inflation. To use his exact words, he said that he has “rejected any notion that we are going to try to raise inflation to a super-normal level.”\nAs I mentioned before, I do not currently vote on FOMC decisions. I did express support for the FOMC’s decision at the recent meeting. I believe that QE is a move in the right direction. However, as I have discussed on earlier occasions, I also think there are good reasons to suspect that the ultimate effects of any amount of QE are likely to be relatively modest. That’s why I would have greatly preferred for the committee to have been able to cut its target rate rather than using QE. The problem is that its target rate is already essentially at zero, and so it was not possible to cut the target rate any further.\nGiven this constraint on monetary policy, I believe it is important to ask if it is possible to synthesize the effects of a one-year interest rate cut of, say, 100 basis points using fiscal policy tools. In his current and past work, Minneapolis Fed staff researcher Juan Pablo Nicolini and his co-authors have answered this question in the affirmative.2 Their key insight is that there is a broad equivalence between monetary and fiscal policy. They argue that the essence of an FOMC interest rate cut is that it makes current consumption cheaper relative to future consumption. With that in mind, the fiscal authorities can use the time path of consumption taxes to accomplish this same change in relative prices.\nIn the remainder of my remarks, I’ll illustrate this insight by describing one particular fiscal policy plan that is equivalent to a 100-basis-point cut by the Fed. The proposal has three parts. The first part is a permanent consumption tax of 100 basis points, instituted with a one-year delay.3 The second part is a permanent decrease in labor income taxes of 100 basis points, also instituted with a one-year delay. The third part is an investment tax credit undertaken in 2011. The Nicolini et al. results demonstrate that, in a wide class of economic models, the effects of this three-part plan would be equivalent to the effects of a 100-basis-point interest rate cut.\nIt’s useful to explain the underlying mechanism using the kind of example that all Econ I students know and loathe—I mean, love. Suppose widgets cost $1 each in 2011. Suppose, too, that you can earn 1 percent interest over the coming year, but that inflation is also expected to be 1 percent. With that interest rate, and that inflation rate, any dollar that you save from 2011 into 2012 can also buy a widget. So, with each dollar, you face the trade-off of buying a widget today or buying a widget next year.\nNext, let’s understand how an interest rate cut affects this baseline trade-off. Suppose the Fed were able to cut its target interest rate by 100 basis points, without affecting expected inflation all that much. The bank would pass that interest rate cut along, and that means that your bank interest rate would fall from 1 percent to zero. Widgets still cost $1 in 2011, and they still cost $1.01 in 2012. But with the interest rate of zero, you would now have to save $1.01 to be able to buy a widget in 2012. The cut in the interest rate has made buying widgets in 2011 cheaper relative to buying widgets in 2012.\nThus, if the Fed were able to cut its target interest rate, saving would become less attractive and borrowing more attractive. Consumers would demand more widgets today. Firms would hire workers to produce more widgets today. Unemployment would decline.\nBut now let’s go back to the benchmark case without the interest rate cut. Recall that expected inflation is 1 percent and that your bank is paying you an interest rate of 1 percent. In that context, think about the three-pronged fiscal policy change that I described earlier. The first part is that the fiscal authorities institute a 1 percent tax on consumption goods that starts in 2012 and lasts for the foreseeable future. Widgets still cost $1 in 2011. Inflation is 1 percent and the tax is 1 percent, and so widgets cost $1.02 in 2012. Given the interest rate of 1 percent, you must save $1.01 in 2011 to get a widget in 2012. Just as with the interest rate cut, widgets have become 1 percent cheaper today relative to the future.\nThis change in relative prices means that the increase in the consumption tax will stimulate consumption demand in 2011. Why, then, do we need a labor income tax reduction in 2012? The problem is that a consumption tax that begins in 2012 distorts labor supply decisions in a way that interest rate cuts don’t. Consider a worker who makes $20 an hour in 2012 after the various taxes on labor income. If the consumption tax goes up, that worker can buy fewer widgets with each hour of work. Hence, the consumption tax distorts that worker’s decision about how much labor to supply to the market.\nThat’s why we need the second part of the plan, under which the fiscal authorities lower taxes on labor income by one percentage point beginning in 2012. With this tax decrease, the worker makes 1 percent more per hour after taxes. The increase in after-tax wages exactly offsets the decrease in purchasing power generated by the consumption tax, and a worker can again buy 20 widgets with each hour of work. As a result, the new plan makes consumption goods cheaper in 2011, but does not provide any additional distortion to labor supply decisions.\nAt this point, I’ve talked through the first two parts of the proposal—the permanent increase in consumption taxes and the permanent decrease in labor income taxes. Why do we need a third tax change? Unlike an interest rate cut, the consumption tax that begins in 2012 will deter investment in 2011. The third prong of the proposal is that the fiscal authority should correct this problem by offering an appropriately sized temporary investment tax credit in 2011. The key is that the tax credit need only apply in 2011. In 2012 and thereafter, there is no disincentive effect on investment because the consumption tax is constant.\n To summarize, I have described how to construct a three-pronged fiscal policy that is designed to have the same economic effects as a 100-basis-point cut by the Fed. The 1 percent permanent consumption tax that begins in 2012 stimulates consumption demand in 2011. The permanent reduction in labor income taxes ensures that this new consumption tax does not deter labor supply. Finally, the investment tax credit makes sure that the new consumption tax does not deter investment in 2011.\nI’ll make two additional comments about this plan. First, how much would this three-pronged change in taxes cost the American taxpayer? The exact answer to this question would depend on a host of details. But let me offer a very rough calculation. Annual consumption is about $10 trillion, and annual labor income is about $8 trillion. I’ve sketched a plan that involves increasing the tax rate on consumption by 1 percentage point and lowering labor income taxes by 1 percentage point. So, the first two parts of the plan would add about $20 billion per year to government revenue beginning in 2012.\nThe plan also involves an appropriately sized investment tax credit. Private gross investment is about $2 trillion. To offset the effect of the consumption tax in 2012, the fiscal authority needs to provide a 1 percent subsidy to this entire amount. Hence, the investment tax credit involves a one-time cost in 2012 of $20 billion. These calculations, while obviously very rough, do indicate that the plan has the potential to be fiscally responsible.4\nSecond, I’ve not discussed distributional considerations. Raising consumption taxes by 1 percentage point and lowering labor income taxes by 1 percentage point for all Americans would tend to redistribute the burden of taxes toward lower-income citizens. For this reason, I believe that it would be desirable to redesign the labor income tax reduction to make it more progressive.\nI want to be clear that there may be other types of fiscal policy interventions that would be helpful in the current situation. I have deliberately focused on a rather narrow aspect of fiscal policy: How can it be used to mimic monetary policy? I’ve done so for a couple of reasons. First, I’m a monetary policymaker, not a fiscal policymaker. Second, as has become clear over the past three years, the efficacy of many kinds of fiscal policy interventions is still very much an open question among macroeconomists. There is considerably more professional consensus about the effectiveness of monetary policy. In the case of my three-pronged fiscal intervention, it is specifically designed to be effective, as long as monetary accommodation itself would be effective.\nFrom an intellectual point of view, the analysis demonstrates the remarkable power of public finance in addressing important macroeconomic questions. This last lesson is hardly new. Over the past 30 years, macroeconomists have used the tools and methods of public finance to address a host of important questions, ranging from optimal stabilization policy to optimal unemployment insurance. I’m proud to say that a great deal of that work has been done at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.\nThanks for your attention. I’ll be happy to take your questions.\n1 I thank Ron Feldman, Terry Fitzgerald, and Juan Pablo Nicolini for their comments.\n2 See Correia, Isabel, Juan Pablo Nicolini, and Pedro Teles, “Optimal Fiscal and Monetary Policy: Equivalence Results,” Journal of Political Economy 116 (February 2008), pp. 141-70. (Also available online at http://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/sr/SR403.pdf.) See also Correia, Isabel, Emmanuel Farhi, Juan Pablo Nicolini, and Pedro Teles, “Policy at the Zero Bound,” working paper (October 2010), online at http://economics.uchicago.edu/ZeroBoundChicagoNov2010-1_nicolini.pdf.\n3 My scheme makes current consumption cheaper by imposing a permanent tax on future consumption. In contrast, in late 2008, Robert Hall and Susan Woodward proposed making consumption goods cheaper in 2009 than in future years by eliminating all state sales taxes for one year. They suggested that this reduction could be financed by the federal government. (See http://woodwardhall.wordpress.com/2008/12/).\n4 I’ve focused on a one-year interest rate cut. How can the fiscal authorities mimic the impact of a two-year interest rate cut? The rule is that the yearly interest rate equals the size of the change in the consumption tax rate. In particular, suppose that the fiscal authorities acted in 2010 to implement a 1 percent tax on consumption in 2012, with a subsequent more permanent 2 percent tax that begins in 2013. This path of taxes, combined with the appropriate labor income tax reductions and investment tax credits, functions like a two-year interest rate cut that begins in 2011.\n\nNote1\n\nThank you very much for that generous introduction. It is a pleasure and an honor to be with you here today and to address this symposium established to commemorate the professional careers and the intellectual interests of Howard and Darrel Alkire, who have meant so much to Hamline University.

With that in mind, the fiscal authorities can use the time path of consumption taxes to accomplish this same change in relative prices.\n\nIn the remainder of my remarks, I’ll illustrate this insight by describing one particular fiscal policy plan that is equivalent to a 100-basis-point cut by the Fed. The proposal has three parts. The first part is a permanent consumption tax of 100 basis points, instituted with a one-year delay.3 The second part is a permanent decrease in labor income taxes of 100 basis points, also instituted with a one-year delay. The third part is an investment tax credit undertaken in 2011. The Nicolini et al. results demonstrate that, in a wide class of economic models, the effects of this three-part plan would be equivalent to the effects of a 100-basis-point interest rate cut.\n\nIt’s useful to explain the underlying mechanism using the kind of example that all Econ I students know and loathe—I mean, love. Suppose widgets cost $1 each in 2011. Suppose, too, that you can earn 1 percent interest over the coming year, but that inflation is also expected to be 1 percent. With that interest rate, and that inflation rate, any dollar that you save from 2011 into 2012 can also buy a widget. So, with each dollar, you face the trade-off of buying a widget today or buying a widget next year.\n\nNext, let’s understand how an interest rate cut affects this baseline trade-off. Suppose the Fed were able to cut its target interest rate by 100 basis points, without affecting expected inflation all that much. The bank would pass that interest rate cut along, and that means that your bank interest rate would fall from 1 percent to zero. Widgets still cost $1 in 2011, and they still cost $1.01 in 2012. But with the interest rate of zero, you would now have to save $1.01 to be able to buy a widget in 2012. The cut in the interest rate has made buying widgets in 2011 cheaper relative to buying widgets in 2012.\n\nThus, if the Fed were able to cut its target interest rate, saving would become less attractive and borrowing more attractive. Consumers would demand more widgets today. Firms would hire workers to produce more widgets today. Unemployment would decline.\n\nBut now let’s go back to the benchmark case without the interest rate cut. Recall that expected inflation is 1 percent and that your bank is paying you an interest rate of 1 percent. In that context, think about the three-pronged fiscal policy change that I described earlier. The first part is that the fiscal authorities institute a 1 percent tax on consumption goods that starts in 2012 and lasts for the foreseeable future. Widgets still cost $1 in 2011. Inflation is 1 percent and the tax is 1 percent, and so widgets cost $1.02 in 2012. Given the interest rate of 1 percent, you must save $1.01 in 2011 to get a widget in 2012. Just as with the interest rate cut, widgets have become 1 percent cheaper today relative to the future.\n\nThis change in relative prices means that the increase in the consumption tax will stimulate consumption demand in 2011. Why, then, do we need a labor income tax reduction in 2012? The problem is that a consumption tax that begins in 2012 distorts labor supply decisions in a way that interest rate cuts don’t. Consider a worker who makes $20 an hour in 2012 after the various taxes on labor income. If the consumption tax goes up, that worker can buy fewer widgets with each hour of work. Hence, the consumption tax distorts that worker’s decision about how much labor to supply to the market.\n\nThat’s why we need the second part of the plan, under which the fiscal authorities lower taxes on labor income by one percentage point beginning in 2012. With this tax decrease, the worker makes 1 percent more per hour after taxes. The increase in after-tax wages exactly offsets the decrease in purchasing power generated by the consumption tax, and a worker can again buy 20 widgets with each hour of work. As a result, the new plan makes consumption goods cheaper in 2011, but does not provide any additional distortion to labor supply decisions.\n\nAt this point, I’ve talked through the first two parts of the proposal—the permanent increase in consumption taxes and the permanent decrease in labor income taxes. Why do we need a third tax change? Unlike an interest rate cut, the consumption tax that begins in 2012 will deter investment in 2011. The third prong of the proposal is that the fiscal authority should correct this problem by offering an appropriately sized temporary investment tax credit in 2011. The key is that the tax credit need only apply in 2011. In 2012 and thereafter, there is no disincentive effect on investment because the consumption tax is constant.\n\nTo summarize, I have described how to construct a three-pronged fiscal policy that is designed to have the same economic effects as a 100-basis-point cut by the Fed. The 1 percent permanent consumption tax that begins in 2012 stimulates consumption demand in 2011. The permanent reduction in labor income taxes ensures that this new consumption tax does not deter labor supply. Finally, the investment tax credit makes sure that the new consumption tax does not deter investment in 2011.\n\nI’ll make two additional comments about this plan. First, how much would this three-pronged change in taxes cost the American taxpayer? The exact answer to this question would depend on a host of details. But let me offer a very rough calculation. Annual consumption is about $10 trillion, and annual labor income is about $8 trillion. I’ve sketched a plan that involves increasing the tax rate on consumption by 1 percentage point and lowering labor income taxes by 1 percentage point. So, the first two parts of the plan would add about $20 billion per year to government revenue beginning in 2012.\n\nThe plan also involves an appropriately sized investment tax credit. Private gross investment is about $2 trillion. To offset the effect of the consumption tax in 2012, the fiscal authority needs to provide a 1 percent subsidy to this entire amount. Hence, the investment tax credit involves a one-time cost in 2012 of $20 billion. These calculations, while obviously very rough, do indicate that the plan has the potential to be fiscally responsible.4\n\nSecond, I’ve not discussed distributional considerations. Raising consumption taxes by 1 percentage point and lowering labor income taxes by 1 percentage point for all Americans would tend to redistribute the burden of taxes toward lower-income citizens. For this reason, I believe that it would be desirable to redesign the labor income tax reduction to make it more progressive.\n\nI want to be clear that there may be other types of fiscal policy interventions that would be helpful in the current situation. I have deliberately focused on a rather narrow aspect of fiscal policy: How can it be used to mimic monetary policy? I’ve done so for a couple of reasons. First, I’m a monetary policymaker, not a fiscal policymaker. Second, as has become clear over the past three years, the efficacy of many kinds of fiscal policy interventions is still very much an open question among macroeconomists. There is considerably more professional consensus about the effectiveness of monetary policy. In the case of my three-pronged fiscal intervention, it is specifically designed to be effective, as long as monetary accommodation itself would be effective.\n\nFrom an intellectual point of view, the analysis demonstrates the remarkable power of public finance in addressing important macroeconomic questions. This last lesson is hardly new. Over the past 30 years, macroeconomists have used the tools and methods of public finance to address a host of important questions, ranging from optimal stabilization policy to optimal unemployment insurance. I’m proud to say that a great deal of that work has been done at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.\n\nThanks for your attention. I’ll be happy to take your questions."

It is a pleasure and an honor to be with you here today and to address this symposium established to commemorate the professional careers and the intellectual interests of Howard and Darrel Alkire, who have meant so much to Hamline University. It is especially an honor to give this talk knowing the prestigious line-up of speakers that precedes me, including Nobel laureate economists and prominent policymakers.\nI became president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis last October. During the preceding 22 years, I was a professor of economics at a variety of institutions. I did research in a number of areas, including public finance. My main area of interest, though, was macroeconomics. There has been a lot of conversation over the past year or two about what we have and haven’t learned from macroeconomics. For myself, I believe that one of the most important developments in the field is the use of tools from public finance to answer key macroeconomic policy questions. To my knowledge, this line of research dates back to the work of Robert Lucas and Nancy Stokey in the 1980s. It continues to be a vital area of investigation almost 30 years later—and it will play a key role in my remarks today.\nI’ll begin by discussing current macroeconomic conditions and the Federal Open Market Committee’s recent actions taken in response to those conditions. That discussion will make clear that the committee took those actions because it is not able to cut its interest rate target any further. Motivated by this difficulty, I will pose and answer the following question: What actions can other policymakers take to approximate the impact of an interest rate cut? In addressing this question, I will rely on recent research being done at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis by staff researcher Juan Pablo Nicolini and several co-authors. Throughout, I’ll be speaking on behalf of myself and no other participant in FOMC meetings.\nLet me start with some basic context about how monetary policy gets made in the United States. The Federal Open Market Committee meets eight times per year to determine the path of monetary policy over the next six to seven weeks. The governors of the Federal Reserve Board and the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York are permanent members of the committee. Four other presidents of Reserve banks are on the committee, but this group rotates annually. While they do not vote, the other presidents are invited to the FOMC meeting and contribute to the committee’s deliberations. Right now, I’m a meeting participant, but I will rotate onto the committee in 2011.\nThe foundation of the committee’s discussions is what is called its dual mandate. By statute, the Federal Reserve is required to follow policies that promote effectively the goals of price stability and maximum employment. The former objective of price stability is generally understood as keeping inflation in a range of around 1.5 to 2.5 percent. The second part of the mandate—maximum employment—is more of a moving target, because employment is shaped by many determinants beyond the Fed’s control: demographics, social custom, taxes, technology, and so on.\nWith that context, let me describe the economic situation that confronted the committee at its meeting in November. Over the first three quarters of this year, personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price inflation has averaged roughly 1 percent at an annualized rate. This rate is low relative to the FOMC’s target of 2 percent. More troublingly, the inflation rate is drifting downward. Over the preceding two-year period (from the fourth quarter of 2007 through the fourth quarter of 2009), PCE inflation averaged 1.6 percent per year. Just to be clear, the measure of PCE inflation that I’m describing includes all goods, including food and energy.\nAt the same time, unemployment is high: In October, it was 9.6 percent. Here, too, the trend is not comforting. The recession officially ended in June 2009, and in that month, unemployment was 9.5 percent. Unemployment has actually risen slightly during the course of the recovery.\nSufficient growth in output can steadily lower unemployment. But growth has been low in this recovery compared with most. As I mentioned, the recession officially ended in June 2009 and so has been over for five quarters. Over those five quarters, real gross domestic product (GDP) has grown at an annualized rate of 2.9 percent. More troublingly, growth has been decelerating: In the past two quarters, it has averaged 2.1 percent at an annualized rate. And here, I should note that I’m reporting data on real GDP growth that have actually been revised upward since the November meeting.\nThis is the economic situation that confronted the FOMC in its November meeting. Inflation and employment are both too low, and the rate of improvement in these variables is too slow. Economic growth has been low and has recently decelerated still further. I think it is safe to say that, given this situation, the FOMC would have liked to have been able to cut its target interest rate. But this option is not available. The FOMC’s target interest rate is already essentially at zero (more precisely, in a range between 0 and 25 basis points).\nBut the FOMC does have another policy instrument available: its balance sheet. As of the beginning of this month, the FOMC had a portfolio of roughly $2.3 trillion. Over 2 trillion of those dollars are invested in Treasury securities or government-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and other government-sponsored enterprises. At its November 3 meeting, the FOMC announced that it plans to buy $600 billion of long-term Treasuries in the open market by mid-2011. In exchange for those securities, it will credit the sellers’ accounts at the Fed with more reserves. This kind of action is known as quantitative easing, or QE.\nThe main goal of QE is to lower the long-run real interest rate. Here, by real interest rate, I’m referring to the interest rate net of expected inflation. More specifically, suppose that the interest rate on a 10-year bond is about 2.5 percent and that people expect inflation to be around 2 percent per year over the next 10 years. Then, the real interest rate is about 0.5 percent per year for the next 10 years.\nA low long-term real interest rate stimulates an economy in a number of ways. It spurs consumer spending by allowing consumers to borrow and refinance more cheaply. It makes capital expenditures and hiring more profitable for corporations. Stock prices and house prices rise because those assets become relatively more attractive as investments. Households with these assets become wealthier and demand more consumption. All of these effects should lead to less unemployment and upward pressure on prices.\nHow does QE go about lowering long-term real interest rates? QE is a sufficiently novel monetary policy tool that different economists may well give different answers to this question. In my view, QE lowers long-term real interest rates in two distinct ways. The first is that QE is a form of nonverbal communication about the FOMC’s future plans. Here’s what I mean. The November FOMC statement says that the committee will keep the fed funds target range exceptionally low for as long as economic conditions warrant. The statement also predicts that exceptionally low fed funds rates are likely to be warranted for an “extended period” of time. In this way, the statement provides explicit communication about the FOMC’s future plans for short-term rates and so also shapes the level of current longer-term interest rates.\nQE provides a significant supplement to this explicit verbal communication. The use of QE indicates that the FOMC is likely to keep its target interest rate lower for an even longer period of time. Indeed, one could readily argue that buying $600 billion of Treasuries is a much more convincing form of communication of the FOMC’s plans than any words could ever be.\nThus, QE lowers long-term real interest rates by signaling the FOMC’s intentions about future short-term rates. However, QE also lowers long-term real interest rates in a second, more direct, way. The holder of a long-term Treasury is exposed to interest rate risk, because the value of that bond fluctuates as interest rates vary. When the Fed buys $600 billion of long-term bonds, the bond portfolio of the private sector is now less exposed to this kind of risk. As a consequence, private investors will demand a lower premium for holding other bonds that are exposed to interest rate risk, and all long-term yields fall.\nIn this way, the change to the asset side of the Fed’s balance sheet provides stimulus to the economy. But what about the liability side of its balance sheet? QE creates more reserves in banks’ accounts with the Fed. The standard intuition is that this kind of reserve creation is inflationary. Banks can only offer checkable deposits in proportion to their reserves. Economists view checkable deposits as a form of money because, like cash, checkable deposits make many transactions easier. In this sense, bank reserves held with the Fed are licenses for banks to create a certain amount of money. By giving out more licenses, the FOMC is allowing banks to create more money. More money chasing the same amount of goods—voila, inflation.\nGiven some of the criticisms of the Fed that have been voiced over the past two weeks, it is important to understand that this basic logic isn’t valid in current circumstances. Banks have nearly $1 trillion of excess reserves. This means that they are not using a lot of their existing licenses to create money. QE gives them $600 billion of new licenses to create money, but I do not see why they would suddenly start to use the new ones if they weren’t using the old ones.\nSome observers have expressed concerns that $1 trillion—which will shortly become over $1.5 trillion—of excess reserves represent what they term “kindling” for some future inflationary fire. I believe that these concerns are misplaced for two reasons. First, the Fed has several tools with which to combat incipient inflationary pressures. Most obviously, it can raise the interest rate on excess reserves as a form of tightening. Second, in recent public statements, Chairman Ben Bernanke has explicitly and firmly committed the FOMC to maintaining low inflation. To use his exact words, he said that he has “rejected any notion that we are going to try to raise inflation to a super-normal level.”\nAs I mentioned before, I do not currently vote on FOMC decisions. I did express support for the FOMC’s decision at the recent meeting. I believe that QE is a move in the right direction. However, as I have discussed on earlier occasions, I also think there are good reasons to suspect that the ultimate effects of any amount of QE are likely to be relatively modest. That’s why I would have greatly preferred for the committee to have been able to cut its target rate rather than using QE. The problem is that its target rate is already essentially at zero, and so it was not possible to cut the target rate any further.\nGiven this constraint on monetary policy, I believe it is important to ask if it is possible to synthesize the effects of a one-year interest rate cut of, say, 100 basis points using fiscal policy tools. In his current and past work, Minneapolis Fed staff researcher Juan Pablo Nicolini and his co-authors have answered this question in the affirmative.2 Their key insight is that there is a broad equivalence between monetary and fiscal policy. They argue that the essence of an FOMC interest rate cut is that it makes current consumption cheaper relative to future consumption. With that in mind, the fiscal authorities can use the time path of consumption taxes to accomplish this same change in relative prices.\nIn the remainder of my remarks, I’ll illustrate this insight by describing one particular fiscal policy plan that is equivalent to a 100-basis-point cut by the Fed. The proposal has three parts. The first part is a permanent consumption tax of 100 basis points, instituted with a one-year delay.3 The second part is a permanent decrease in labor income taxes of 100 basis points, also instituted with a one-year delay. The third part is an investment tax credit undertaken in 2011. The Nicolini et al. results demonstrate that, in a wide class of economic models, the effects of this three-part plan would be equivalent to the effects of a 100-basis-point interest rate cut.\nIt’s useful to explain the underlying mechanism using the kind of example that all Econ I students know and loathe—I mean, love. Suppose widgets cost $1 each in 2011. Suppose, too, that you can earn 1 percent interest over the coming year, but that inflation is also expected to be 1 percent. With that interest rate, and that inflation rate, any dollar that you save from 2011 into 2012 can also buy a widget. So, with each dollar, you face the trade-off of buying a widget today or buying a widget next year.\nNext, let’s understand how an interest rate cut affects this baseline trade-off. Suppose the Fed were able to cut its target interest rate by 100 basis points, without affecting expected inflation all that much. The bank would pass that interest rate cut along, and that means that your bank interest rate would fall from 1 percent to zero. Widgets still cost $1 in 2011, and they still cost $1.01 in 2012. But with the interest rate of zero, you would now have to save $1.01 to be able to buy a widget in 2012. The cut in the interest rate has made buying widgets in 2011 cheaper relative to buying widgets in 2012.\nThus, if the Fed were able to cut its target interest rate, saving would become less attractive and borrowing more attractive. Consumers would demand more widgets today. Firms would hire workers to produce more widgets today. Unemployment would decline.\nBut now let’s go back to the benchmark case without the interest rate cut. Recall that expected inflation is 1 percent and that your bank is paying you an interest rate of 1 percent. In that context, think about the three-pronged fiscal policy change that I described earlier. The first part is that the fiscal authorities institute a 1 percent tax on consumption goods that starts in 2012 and lasts for the foreseeable future. Widgets still cost $1 in 2011. Inflation is 1 percent and the tax is 1 percent, and so widgets cost $1.02 in 2012. Given the interest rate of 1 percent, you must save $1.01 in 2011 to get a widget in 2012. Just as with the interest rate cut, widgets have become 1 percent cheaper today relative to the future.\nThis change in relative prices means that the increase in the consumption tax will stimulate consumption demand in 2011. Why, then, do we need a labor income tax reduction in 2012? The problem is that a consumption tax that begins in 2012 distorts labor supply decisions in a way that interest rate cuts don’t. Consider a worker who makes $20 an hour in 2012 after the various taxes on labor income. If the consumption tax goes up, that worker can buy fewer widgets with each hour of work. Hence, the consumption tax distorts that worker’s decision about how much labor to supply to the market.\nThat’s why we need the second part of the plan, under which the fiscal authorities lower taxes on labor income by one percentage point beginning in 2012. With this tax decrease, the worker makes 1 percent more per hour after taxes. The increase in after-tax wages exactly offsets the decrease in purchasing power generated by the consumption tax, and a worker can again buy 20 widgets with each hour of work. As a result, the new plan makes consumption goods cheaper in 2011, but does not provide any additional distortion to labor supply decisions.\nAt this point, I’ve talked through the first two parts of the proposal—the permanent increase in consumption taxes and the permanent decrease in labor income taxes. Why do we need a third tax change? Unlike an interest rate cut, the consumption tax that begins in 2012 will deter investment in 2011. The third prong of the proposal is that the fiscal authority should correct this problem by offering an appropriately sized temporary investment tax credit in 2011. The key is that the tax credit need only apply in 2011. In 2012 and thereafter, there is no disincentive effect on investment because the consumption tax is constant.\n To summarize, I have described how to construct a three-pronged fiscal policy that is designed to have the same economic effects as a 100-basis-point cut by the Fed. The 1 percent permanent consumption tax that begins in 2012 stimulates consumption demand in 2011. The permanent reduction in labor income taxes ensures that this new consumption tax does not deter labor supply. Finally, the investment tax credit makes sure that the new consumption tax does not deter investment in 2011.\nI’ll make two additional comments about this plan. First, how much would this three-pronged change in taxes cost the American taxpayer? The exact answer to this question would depend on a host of details. But let me offer a very rough calculation. Annual consumption is about $10 trillion, and annual labor income is about $8 trillion. I’ve sketched a plan that involves increasing the tax rate on consumption by 1 percentage point and lowering labor income taxes by 1 percentage point. So, the first two parts of the plan would add about $20 billion per year to government revenue beginning in 2012.\nThe plan also involves an appropriately sized investment tax credit. Private gross investment is about $2 trillion. To offset the effect of the consumption tax in 2012, the fiscal authority needs to provide a 1 percent subsidy to this entire amount. Hence, the investment tax credit involves a one-time cost in 2012 of $20 billion. These calculations, while obviously very rough, do indicate that the plan has the potential to be fiscally responsible.4\nSecond, I’ve not discussed distributional considerations. Raising consumption taxes by 1 percentage point and lowering labor income taxes by 1 percentage point for all Americans would tend to redistribute the burden of taxes toward lower-income citizens. For this reason, I believe that it would be desirable to redesign the labor income tax reduction to make it more progressive.\nI want to be clear that there may be other types of fiscal policy interventions that would be helpful in the current situation. I have deliberately focused on a rather narrow aspect of fiscal policy: How can it be used to mimic monetary policy? I’ve done so for a couple of reasons.

I’m proud to say that a great deal of that work has been done at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.\nThanks for your attention. I’ll be happy to take your questions.\n1 I thank Ron Feldman, Terry Fitzgerald, and Juan Pablo Nicolini for their comments.\n2 See Correia, Isabel, Juan Pablo Nicolini, and Pedro Teles, “Optimal Fiscal and Monetary Policy: Equivalence Results,” Journal of Political Economy 116 (February 2008), pp. 141-70. (Also available online at http://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/sr/SR403.pdf.) See also Correia, Isabel, Emmanuel Farhi, Juan Pablo Nicolini, and Pedro Teles, “Policy at the Zero Bound,” working paper (October 2010), online at http://economics.uchicago.edu/ZeroBoundChicagoNov2010-1_nicolini.pdf.\n3 My scheme makes current consumption cheaper by imposing a permanent tax on future consumption. In contrast, in late 2008, Robert Hall and Susan Woodward proposed making consumption goods cheaper in 2009 than in future years by eliminating all state sales taxes for one year. They suggested that this reduction could be financed by the federal government. (See http://woodwardhall.wordpress.com/2008/12/).\n4 I’ve focused on a one-year interest rate cut. How can the fiscal authorities mimic the impact of a two-year interest rate cut? The rule is that the yearly interest rate equals the size of the change in the consumption tax rate. In particular, suppose that the fiscal authorities acted in 2010 to implement a 1 percent tax on consumption in 2012, with a subsequent more permanent 2 percent tax that begins in 2013. This path of taxes, combined with the appropriate labor income tax reductions and investment tax credits, functions like a two-year interest rate cut that begins in 2011.\n\nNote1\n\nThank you very much for that generous introduction. It is a pleasure and an honor to be with you here today and to address this symposium established to commemorate the professional careers and the intellectual interests of Howard and Darrel Alkire, who have meant so much to Hamline University.

This rate is low relative to the FOMC’s target of 2 percent. More troublingly, the inflation rate is drifting downward. Over the preceding two-year period (from the fourth quarter of 2007 through the fourth quarter of 2009), PCE inflation averaged 1.6 percent per year.

All of these effects should lead to less unemployment and upward pressure on prices.\n\nHow does QE go about lowering long-term real interest rates? QE is a sufficiently novel monetary policy tool that different economists may well give different answers to this question. In my view, QE lowers long-term real interest rates in two distinct ways. The first is that QE is a form of nonverbal communication about the FOMC’s future plans. Here’s what I mean. The November FOMC statement says that the committee will keep the fed funds target range exceptionally low for as long as economic conditions warrant. The statement also predicts that exceptionally low fed funds rates are likely to be warranted for an “extended period” of time. In this way, the statement provides explicit communication about the FOMC’s future plans for short-term rates and so also shapes the level of current longer-term interest rates.\n\nQE provides a significant supplement to this explicit verbal communication. The use of QE indicates that the FOMC is likely to keep its target interest rate lower for an even longer period of time. Indeed, one could readily argue that buying $600 billion of Treasuries is a much more convincing form of communication of the FOMC’s plans than any words could ever be.\n\nThus, QE lowers long-term real interest rates by signaling the FOMC’s intentions about future short-term rates. However, QE also lowers long-term real interest rates in a second, more direct, way. The holder of a long-term Treasury is exposed to interest rate risk, because the value of that bond fluctuates as interest rates vary. When the Fed buys $600 billion of long-term bonds, the bond portfolio of the private sector is now less exposed to this kind of risk. As a consequence, private investors will demand a lower premium for holding other bonds that are exposed to interest rate risk, and all long-term yields fall.\n\nIn this way, the change to the asset side of the Fed’s balance sheet provides stimulus to the economy. But what about the liability side of its balance sheet? QE creates more reserves in banks’ accounts with the Fed. The standard intuition is that this kind of reserve creation is inflationary. Banks can only offer checkable deposits in proportion to their reserves. Economists view checkable deposits as a form of money because, like cash, checkable deposits make many transactions easier. In this sense, bank reserves held with the Fed are licenses for banks to create a certain amount of money. By giving out more licenses, the FOMC is allowing banks to create more money. More money chasing the same amount of goods—voila, inflation.\n\nGiven some of the criticisms of the Fed that have been voiced over the past two weeks, it is important to understand that this basic logic isn’t valid in current circumstances. Banks have nearly $1 trillion of excess reserves. This means that they are not using a lot of their existing licenses to create money. QE gives them $600 billion of new licenses to create money, but I do not see why they would suddenly start to use the new ones if they weren’t using the old ones.\n\nSome observers have expressed concerns that $1 trillion—which will shortly become over $1.5 trillion—of excess reserves represent what they term “kindling” for some future inflationary fire. I believe that these concerns are misplaced for two reasons. First, the Fed has several tools with which to combat incipient inflationary pressures. Most obviously, it can raise the interest rate on excess reserves as a form of tightening. Second, in recent public statements, Chairman Ben Bernanke has explicitly and firmly committed the FOMC to maintaining low inflation. To use his exact words, he said that he has “rejected any notion that we are going to try to raise inflation to a super-normal level.”\n\nAs I mentioned before, I do not currently vote on FOMC decisions. I did express support for the FOMC’s decision at the recent meeting. I believe that QE is a move in the right direction. However, as I have discussed on earlier occasions, I also think there are good reasons to suspect that the ultimate effects of any amount of QE are likely to be relatively modest. That’s why I would have greatly preferred for the committee to have been able to cut its target rate rather than using QE. The problem is that its target rate is already essentially at zero, and so it was not possible to cut the target rate any further.\n\nGiven this constraint on monetary policy, I believe it is important to ask if it is possible to synthesize the effects of a one-year interest rate cut of, say, 100 basis points using fiscal policy tools. In his current and past work, Minneapolis Fed staff researcher Juan Pablo Nicolini and his co-authors have answered this question in the affirmative.2 Their key insight is that there is a broad equivalence between monetary and fiscal policy. They argue that the essence of an FOMC interest rate cut is that it makes current consumption cheaper relative to future consumption. With that in mind, the fiscal authorities can use the time path of consumption taxes to accomplish this same change in relative prices.\n\nIn the remainder of my remarks, I’ll illustrate this insight by describing one particular fiscal policy plan that is equivalent to a 100-basis-point cut by the Fed. The proposal has three parts. The first part is a permanent consumption tax of 100 basis points, instituted with a one-year delay.3 The second part is a permanent decrease in labor income taxes of 100 basis points, also instituted with a one-year delay. The third part is an investment tax credit undertaken in 2011. The Nicolini et al. results demonstrate that, in a wide class of economic models, the effects of this three-part plan would be equivalent to the effects of a 100-basis-point interest rate cut.\n\nIt’s useful to explain the underlying mechanism using the kind of example that all Econ I students know and loathe—I mean, love. Suppose widgets cost $1 each in 2011. Suppose, too, that you can earn 1 percent interest over the coming year, but that inflation is also expected to be 1 percent. With that interest rate, and that inflation rate, any dollar that you save from 2011 into 2012 can also buy a widget. So, with each dollar, you face the trade-off of buying a widget today or buying a widget next year.\n\nNext, let’s understand how an interest rate cut affects this baseline trade-off. Suppose the Fed were able to cut its target interest rate by 100 basis points, without affecting expected inflation all that much. The bank would pass that interest rate cut along, and that means that your bank interest rate would fall from 1 percent to zero. Widgets still cost $1 in 2011, and they still cost $1.01 in 2012. But with the interest rate of zero, you would now have to save $1.01 to be able to buy a widget in 2012. The cut in the interest rate has made buying widgets in 2011 cheaper relative to buying widgets in 2012.\n\nThus, if the Fed were able to cut its target interest rate, saving would become less attractive and borrowing more attractive. Consumers would demand more widgets today. Firms would hire workers to produce more widgets today. Unemployment would decline.\n\nBut now let’s go back to the benchmark case without the interest rate cut. Recall that expected inflation is 1 percent and that your bank is paying you an interest rate of 1 percent. In that context, think about the three-pronged fiscal policy change that I described earlier. The first part is that the fiscal authorities institute a 1 percent tax on consumption goods that starts in 2012 and lasts for the foreseeable future. Widgets still cost $1 in 2011. Inflation is 1 percent and the tax is 1 percent, and so widgets cost $1.02 in 2012. Given the interest rate of 1 percent, you must save $1.01 in 2011 to get a widget in 2012. Just as with the interest rate cut, widgets have become 1 percent cheaper today relative to the future.\n\nThis change in relative prices means that the increase in the consumption tax will stimulate consumption demand in 2011. Why, then, do we need a labor income tax reduction in 2012? The problem is that a consumption tax that begins in 2012 distorts labor supply decisions in a way that interest rate cuts don’t. Consider a worker who makes $20 an hour in 2012 after the various taxes on labor income. If the consumption tax goes up, that worker can buy fewer widgets with each hour of work. Hence, the consumption tax distorts that worker’s decision about how much labor to supply to the market.\n\nThat’s why we need the second part of the plan, under which the fiscal authorities lower taxes on labor income by one percentage point beginning in 2012. With this tax decrease, the worker makes 1 percent more per hour after taxes. The increase in after-tax wages exactly offsets the decrease in purchasing power generated by the consumption tax, and a worker can again buy 20 widgets with each hour of work. As a result, the new plan makes consumption goods cheaper in 2011, but does not provide any additional distortion to labor supply decisions.\n\nAt this point, I’ve talked through the first two parts of the proposal—the permanent increase in consumption taxes and the permanent decrease in labor income taxes. Why do we need a third tax change? Unlike an interest rate cut, the consumption tax that begins in 2012 will deter investment in 2011. The third prong of the proposal is that the fiscal authority should correct this problem by offering an appropriately sized temporary investment tax credit in 2011. The key is that the tax credit need only apply in 2011. In 2012 and thereafter, there is no disincentive effect on investment because the consumption tax is constant.\n\nTo summarize, I have described how to construct a three-pronged fiscal policy that is designed to have the same economic effects as a 100-basis-point cut by the Fed. The 1 percent permanent consumption tax that begins in 2012 stimulates consumption demand in 2011. The permanent reduction in labor income taxes ensures that this new consumption tax does not deter labor supply. Finally, the investment tax credit makes sure that the new consumption tax does not deter investment in 2011.\n\nI’ll make two additional comments about this plan. First, how much would this three-pronged change in taxes cost the American taxpayer? The exact answer to this question would depend on a host of details. But let me offer a very rough calculation. Annual consumption is about $10 trillion, and annual labor income is about $8 trillion. I’ve sketched a plan that involves increasing the tax rate on consumption by 1 percentage point and lowering labor income taxes by 1 percentage point. So, the first two parts of the plan would add about $20 billion per year to government revenue beginning in 2012.\n\nThe plan also involves an appropriately sized investment tax credit. Private gross investment is about $2 trillion. To offset the effect of the consumption tax in 2012, the fiscal authority needs to provide a 1 percent subsidy to this entire amount. Hence, the investment tax credit involves a one-time cost in 2012 of $20 billion. These calculations, while obviously very rough, do indicate that the plan has the potential to be fiscally responsible.4\n\nSecond, I’ve not discussed distributional considerations. Raising consumption taxes by 1 percentage point and lowering labor income taxes by 1 percentage point for all Americans would tend to redistribute the burden of taxes toward lower-income citizens. For this reason, I believe that it would be desirable to redesign the labor income tax reduction to make it more progressive.\n\nI want to be clear that there may be other types of fiscal policy interventions that would be helpful in the current situation. I have deliberately focused on a rather narrow aspect of fiscal policy: How can it be used to mimic monetary policy? I’ve done so for a couple of reasons. First, I’m a monetary policymaker, not a fiscal policymaker. Second, as has become clear over the past three years, the efficacy of many kinds of fiscal policy interventions is still very much an open question among macroeconomists. There is considerably more professional consensus about the effectiveness of monetary policy. In the case of my three-pronged fiscal intervention, it is specifically designed to be effective, as long as monetary accommodation itself would be effective.\n\nFrom an intellectual point of view, the analysis demonstrates the remarkable power of public finance in addressing important macroeconomic questions. This last lesson is hardly new. Over the past 30 years, macroeconomists have used the tools and methods of public finance to address a host of important questions, ranging from optimal stabilization policy to optimal unemployment insurance. I’m proud to say that a great deal of that work has been done at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.\n\nThanks for your attention. I’ll be happy to take your questions."

        "content": "Note1\nThank you for that generous introduction, Harvey. It’s a huge honor for me to be addressing you, and I certainly want to thank Wojciech and Karl for inviting me. Ironically enough, your luncheon speaker tomorrow—Doug Elmendorf—and I lived in the same college dorm back in our freshman year of 1979-80. I’ll leave it to you to decide who has aged better—although I caution you that you’re handicapped by not knowing the relevant initial conditions.\nI became president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis last October. During the preceding 22 years, I was a professor of economics at a variety of institutions. I did research in a number of areas, including public finance. My main area of interest, though, was macroeconomics.\nThere has been a lot of conversation over the past year or two about what we have and haven’t learned from macroeconomics. For myself, I believe that one of the most important developments in the field is the use of tools from theoretical public finance to answer key policy questions. To my knowledge, this line of research dates back to the work of Robert Lucas and Nancy Stokey in the 1980s, although I’m sure that some of you might be able to point to even earlier sources. It continues to be a vital area of investigation almost 30 years later—and it will play a key role in my remarks today.\nI’ll begin by discussing current macroeconomic conditions and the Federal Open Market Committee’s recent actions taken in response to those conditions. That discussion will make clear that the committee took those actions because it is not able to cut its interest rate target any further. Motivated by this difficulty, I will pose and answer the following question: What actions can other policymakers take to approximate the impact of an interest rate cut? In addressing this question, I will rely on recent research being done at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis by staff researcher Juan Pablo Nicolini and several co-authors. Throughout, I’ll be speaking on behalf of myself and no other participant in FOMC meetings.\nLet me start with some basic context about how monetary policy gets made in the United States. The Federal Open Market Committee meets eight times per year to determine the path of monetary policy over the next six to seven weeks. The governors of the Federal Reserve Board and the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York are permanent members of the committee. Four other presidents of Reserve banks are on the committee, but this group rotates annually. While they do not vote, the other presidents are invited to the FOMC meeting and contribute to the committee’s deliberations. Right now, I’m a meeting participant, but I will rotate onto the committee in 2011.\nThe foundation of the committee’s discussions is what is called its dual mandate. By statute, the Federal Reserve is required to follow policies that promote effectively the goals of price stability and maximum employment. The former objective of price stability is generally understood as keeping inflation in a range of around 1.5 to 2.5 percent. The second part of the mandate—maximum employment—is more of a moving target, because employment is shaped by many determinants beyond the Fed’s control: demographics, social custom, taxes, technology, and so on.\nOver the first three quarters of this year, personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price inflation has averaged roughly 1 percent at an annualized rate. This rate is low relative to the FOMC’s target of 2 percent. More troublingly, the inflation rate is drifting downward. Over the preceding two-year period (from the fourth quarter of 2007 through the fourth quarter of 2009), PCE inflation averaged 1.6 percent per year.\nAt the same time, unemployment is high: In October, it was 9.6 percent. Here, too, the trend is not comforting. The recession officially ended in June 2009, and in that month, unemployment was 9.5 percent. Unemployment has actually risen slightly during the course of the recovery.\nSufficient growth in output can steadily lower unemployment. But growth has been low in this recovery compared with most. As I mentioned, the recession officially ended in June 2009 and so has been over for five quarters. Over those five quarters, real gross domestic product (GDP) has grown at an annualized rate of under 3 percent. More alarmingly, growth has been decelerating: In the past two quarters, it has averaged less than 2 percent at an annualized rate.\nThis is the economic situation that confronted the FOMC in its November meeting. Inflation and employment are both too low, and the pace of recovery is too slow. Economic growth is low and softening further. I think it is safe to say that, given this situation, the FOMC would have liked to have been able to cut its target interest rate. But this option is not available. The FOMC’s target interest rate is already essentially at zero (more precisely, in a range between 0 and 25 basis points).\nBut the FOMC does have another policy instrument available: its balance sheet. As of the beginning of this month, the FOMC had a portfolio of roughly $2.3 trillion. Over 2 trillion of those dollars are invested in Treasury securities or government-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and other government-sponsored enterprises. At its November 3 meeting, the FOMC announced that it plans to buy $600 billion of long-term Treasuries in the open market by mid-2011. In exchange for those securities, it will credit the sellers’ accounts at the Fed with more reserves. This kind of action is known as quantitative easing, or QE.\nThe main goal of QE is to lower the long-run real interest rate. As you all know, by real interest rate, I’m referring to the interest rate net of expected inflation. More specifically, suppose that the interest rate on a 10-year bond is about 2.5 percent and that people expect inflation to be around 2 percent per year over the next 10 years. Then, the real interest rate is about 0.5 percent per year for the next 10 years.\nA low long-term real interest rate stimulates an economy in a number of ways. It spurs consumer spending by allowing consumers to borrow and refinance more cheaply. It makes capital expenditures and hiring more profitable for corporations. Stock prices and house prices rise because those assets become relatively more attractive as investments. Households with these assets become wealthier and demand more consumption. All of these effects should lead to less unemployment and upward pressure on prices.\nHow does QE go about lowering long-term real interest rates? QE is a sufficiently novel monetary policy tool that different economists may well give different answers to this question. In my view, QE lowers long-term real interest rates in two distinct ways. The first is that QE is a form of nonverbal communication about the FOMC’s future plans. Here’s what I mean. The November FOMC statement says that the committee will keep the fed funds target range exceptionally low for as long as economic conditions warrant. The statement also predicts that exceptionally low fed funds rates are likely to be warranted for an “extended period” of time. In this way, the statement provides explicit communication about the FOMC’s future plans for short-term rates and so also shapes the level of current longer-term interest rates.\nQE provides a significant supplement to this explicit verbal communication. The use of QE indicates that the FOMC is likely to keep its target interest rate lower for an even longer period of time. Indeed, one could readily argue that buying $600 billion of Treasuries is a much more convincing form of communication of the FOMC’s plans than any words could ever be.\nThus, QE lowers long-term real interest rates by signaling the FOMC’s intentions about future short-term rates. However, QE also lowers long-term real interest rates in a second, more direct, way. The holder of a long-term Treasury is exposed to interest rate risk, because the value of that bond fluctuates as interest rates vary. When the Fed buys $600 billion of long-term bonds, the bond portfolio of the private sector is now less exposed to this kind of risk. As a consequence, private investors will demand a lower premium for holding other bonds that are exposed to interest rate risk, and all long-term yields fall.\nIn this way, the change to the asset side of the Fed’s balance sheet provides stimulus to the economy. But what about the liability side of its balance sheet? QE creates more reserves in banks’ accounts with the Fed. The standard intuition is that this kind of reserve creation is inflationary.

With that in mind, the fiscal authorities can use the time path of consumption taxes to accomplish this same change in relative prices.\nIn the remainder of my remarks, I’ll illustrate this insight by describing one particular fiscal policy plan that is equivalent to a 100-basis-point cut by the Fed. The proposal has three parts. The first part is a permanent consumption tax of 100 basis points, instituted with a one-year delay.3 The second part is a permanent decrease in labor income taxes of 100 basis points, also instituted with a one-year delay. The third part is an investment tax credit undertaken in 2011. The Nicolini et al. results demonstrate that, in a wide class of economic models, the effects of this three-part plan would be equivalent to the effects of a 100-basis-point interest rate cut.\nIt’s useful to explain the underlying mechanism using the kind of example that all Econ I students have grown to love. Suppose widgets cost $1 each in 2011. Suppose, too, that you can earn 1 percent interest over the coming year, but that inflation is also expected to be 1 percent. With that interest rate, and that inflation rate, any dollar that you save from 2011 into 2012 can also buy a widget. So, with each dollar, you face the trade-off of buying a widget today or buying a widget next year.\nNext, let’s understand how an interest rate cut affects this baseline trade-off. Suppose the Fed were able to cut its target interest rate by 100 basis points, without affecting expected inflation all that much. The bank would pass that interest rate cut along, and that means that your bank interest rate would fall from 1 percent to zero. Widgets still cost $1 in 2011, and they still cost $1.01 in 2012. But with the interest rate of zero, you would now have to save $1.01 to be able to buy a widget in 2012. The cut in the interest rate has made buying widgets in 2011 cheaper relative to buying widgets in 2012.\nThus, if the Fed were able to cut its target interest rate, saving would become less attractive and borrowing more attractive. Consumers would demand more widgets today. Firms would hire workers to produce more widgets today. Unemployment would decline.\nBut now let’s go back to the benchmark case without the interest rate cut. Recall that expected inflation is 1 percent and that your bank is paying you an interest rate of 1 percent. In that context, think about the three-pronged fiscal policy change that I described earlier. The first part is that the fiscal authorities institute a 1 percent tax on consumption goods that starts in 2012 and lasts for the foreseeable future. Widgets still cost $1 in 2011. Inflation is 1 percent and the tax is 1 percent, and so widgets cost $1.02 in 2012. Given the interest rate of 1 percent, you must save $1.01 in 2011 to get a widget in 2012. Just as with the interest rate cut, widgets have become 1 percent cheaper today relative to the future.\nThis change in relative prices means that the increase in the consumption tax will stimulate consumption demand in 2011. Why, then, do we need a labor income tax reduction in 2012? The problem is that a consumption tax that begins in 2012 distorts labor supply decisions in a way that interest rate cuts don’t. Consider a worker who makes $20 an hour in 2012 after the various taxes on labor income. If the consumption tax goes up, that worker can buy fewer widgets with each hour of work. Hence, the consumption tax distorts that worker’s decision about how much labor to supply to the market.\nThat’s why we need the second part of the plan, under which the fiscal authorities lower taxes on labor income by one percentage point beginning in 2012. With this tax decrease, the worker makes 1 percent more per hour after taxes. The increase in after-tax wages exactly offsets the decrease in purchasing power generated by the consumption tax, and a worker can again buy 20 widgets with each hour of work. As a result, the new plan makes consumption goods cheaper in 2011, but does not provide any additional distortion to labor supply decisions.\nAt this point, I’ve talked through the first two parts of the proposal—the permanent increase in consumption taxes and the permanent decrease in labor income taxes. Why do we need a third tax change? Unlike an interest rate cut, the consumption tax that begins in 2012 will deter investment in 2011. The third prong of the proposal is that the fiscal authority should correct this problem by offering an appropriately sized temporary investment tax credit in 2011. The key is that the tax credit need only apply in 2011. In 2012 and thereafter, there is no disincentive effect on investment because the consumption tax is constant.\n To summarize, I have described how to construct a three-pronged fiscal policy that is designed to have the same economic effects as a 100-basis-point cut by the Fed. The 1 percent permanent consumption tax that begins in 2012 stimulates consumption demand in 2011. The permanent reduction in labor income taxes ensures that this new consumption tax does not deter labor supply. Finally, the investment tax credit makes sure that the new consumption tax does not deter investment in 2011.\nI’ll make two additional comments about this plan. First, how much would this three-pronged change in taxes cost the American taxpayer? The exact answer to this question would depend on a host of details—details that many of you know a lot more about than I do. But let me offer a very rough calculation. Annual consumption is about $10 trillion, and annual labor income is about $8 trillion. I’ve sketched a plan that involves increasing the tax rate on consumption by 1 percentage point and lowering labor income taxes by 1 percentage point. So, the first two parts of the plan would add about $20 billion per year to government revenue beginning in 2012.\nThe plan also involves an appropriately sized investment tax credit. Private gross investment is about $2 trillion. To offset the effect of the consumption tax in 2012, the fiscal authority needs to provide a 1 percent subsidy to this entire amount. Hence, the investment tax credit involves a one-time cost in 2012 of $20 billion. These calculations, while obviously very rough, do indicate that the plan has the potential to be fiscally responsible.4\nSecond, I’ve not discussed distributional considerations. Raising consumption taxes by 1 percentage point and lowering labor income taxes by 1 percentage point for all Americans would tend to redistribute the burden of taxes toward lower-income citizens. For this reason, I believe that it would be desirable to redesign the labor income tax reduction to make it more progressive.\nOverall, I believe that this analysis has both policy and intellectual aspects. From a policy point of view, I’ve deliberately focused on a rather narrow aspect of fiscal policy—namely, how it can be used to mimic monetary policy. That narrow focus seems appropriate to me, given my role in the policy process. I find the resultant policy to be attractive because may be able to generate macroeconomic stimulus without increasing the deficit.\nFrom an intellectual point of view, the analysis demonstrates the remarkable power of public finance in addressing important macroeconomic questions. Of course, this last lesson is hardly new. As I mentioned at the beginning of my talk, over the past 30 years, macroeconomists have used the tools and methods of public finance to address a host of important questions, ranging from optimal stabilization policy to optimal unemployment insurance. I’m proud to say that a great deal of that work has been done at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.\nThanks for your attention. I’ll be happy to take your questions.\n1 I thank Ron Feldman, Terry Fitzgerald, and Juan Pablo Nicolini for their comments.\n2 See Correia, Isabel, Juan Pablo Nicolini, and Pedro Teles, “Optimal Fiscal and Monetary Policy: Equivalence Results,” Journal of Political Economy 116 (February 2008), pp. 141-70. (Also available online at minneapolisfed.org.) See also Correia, Isabel, Emmanuel Farhi, Juan Pablo Nicolini, and Pedro Teles, “Policy at the Zero Bound,” working paper (October 2010).\n3 My scheme makes current consumption cheaper by imposing a permanent tax on future consumption. In contrast, in late 2008, Robert Hall and Susan Woodward proposed making consumption goods cheaper in 2009 than in future years by eliminating all state sales taxes for one year. They suggested that this reduction could be financed by the federal government. (See http://woodwardhall.wordpress.com/2008/12/).\n4 I’ve focused on a one-year interest rate cut. How can the fiscal authorities mimic the impact of a two-year interest rate cut? The rule is that the yearly interest rate equals the size of the change in the consumption tax rate. In particular, suppose that the fiscal authorities acted in 2010 to implement a 1 percent tax on consumption in 2012, with a subsequent more permanent 2 percent tax that begins in 2013. This path of taxes, combined with the appropriate labor income tax reductions and investment tax credits, functions like a two-year interest rate cut that begins in 2011.\n\nNote1\n\nThank you for that generous introduction, Harvey. It’s a huge honor for me to be addressing you, and I certainly want to thank Wojciech and Karl for inviting me. Ironically enough, your luncheon speaker tomorrow—Doug Elmendorf—and I lived in the same college dorm back in our freshman year of 1979-80. I’ll leave it to you to decide who has aged better—although I caution you that you’re handicapped by not knowing the relevant initial conditions.\n\nI became president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis last October. During the preceding 22 years, I was a professor of economics at a variety of institutions. I did research in a number of areas, including public finance. My main area of interest, though, was macroeconomics.\n\nThere has been a lot of conversation over the past year or two about what we have and haven’t learned from macroeconomics. For myself, I believe that one of the most important developments in the field is the use of tools from theoretical public finance to answer key policy questions. To my knowledge, this line of research dates back to the work of Robert Lucas and Nancy Stokey in the 1980s, although I’m sure that some of you might be able to point to even earlier sources. It continues to be a vital area of investigation almost 30 years later—and it will play a key role in my remarks today.\n\nI’ll begin by discussing current macroeconomic conditions and the Federal Open Market Committee’s recent actions taken in response to those conditions. That discussion will make clear that the committee took those actions because it is not able to cut its interest rate target any further. Motivated by this difficulty, I will pose and answer the following question: What actions can other policymakers take to approximate the impact of an interest rate cut? In addressing this question, I will rely on recent research being done at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis by staff researcher Juan Pablo Nicolini and several co-authors. Throughout, I’ll be speaking on behalf of myself and no other participant in FOMC meetings.\n\nLet me start with some basic context about how monetary policy gets made in the United States. The Federal Open Market Committee meets eight times per year to determine the path of monetary policy over the next six to seven weeks. The governors of the Federal Reserve Board and the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York are permanent members of the committee. Four other presidents of Reserve banks are on the committee, but this group rotates annually. While they do not vote, the other presidents are invited to the FOMC meeting and contribute to the committee’s deliberations. Right now, I’m a meeting participant, but I will rotate onto the committee in 2011.\n\nThe foundation of the committee’s discussions is what is called its dual mandate. By statute, the Federal Reserve is required to follow policies that promote effectively the goals of price stability and maximum employment. The former objective of price stability is generally understood as keeping inflation in a range of around 1.5 to 2.5 percent. The second part of the mandate—maximum employment—is more of a moving target, because employment is shaped by many determinants beyond the Fed’s control: demographics, social custom, taxes, technology, and so on.\n\nOver the first three quarters of this year, personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price inflation has averaged roughly 1 percent at an annualized rate. This rate is low relative to the FOMC’s target of 2 percent. More troublingly, the inflation rate is drifting downward. Over the preceding two-year period (from the fourth quarter of 2007 through the fourth quarter of 2009), PCE inflation averaged 1.6 percent per year.\n\nAt the same time, unemployment is high: In October, it was 9.6 percent. Here, too, the trend is not comforting. The recession officially ended in June 2009, and in that month, unemployment was 9.5 percent. Unemployment has actually risen slightly during the course of the recovery.\n\nSufficient growth in output can steadily lower unemployment. But growth has been low in this recovery compared with most. As I mentioned, the recession officially ended in June 2009 and so has been over for five quarters. Over those five quarters, real gross domestic product (GDP) has grown at an annualized rate of under 3 percent. More alarmingly, growth has been decelerating: In the past two quarters, it has averaged less than 2 percent at an annualized rate.\n\nThis is the economic situation that confronted the FOMC in its November meeting. Inflation and employment are both too low, and the pace of recovery is too slow. Economic growth is low and softening further. I think it is safe to say that, given this situation, the FOMC would have liked to have been able to cut its target interest rate. But this option is not available. The FOMC’s target interest rate is already essentially at zero (more precisely, in a range between 0 and 25 basis points).\n\nBut the FOMC does have another policy instrument available: its balance sheet. As of the beginning of this month, the FOMC had a portfolio of roughly $2.3 trillion. Over 2 trillion of those dollars are invested in Treasury securities or government-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and other government-sponsored enterprises. At its November 3 meeting, the FOMC announced that it plans to buy $600 billion of long-term Treasuries in the open market by mid-2011. In exchange for those securities, it will credit the sellers’ accounts at the Fed with more reserves. This kind of action is known as quantitative easing, or QE.\n\nThe main goal of QE is to lower the long-run real interest rate. As you all know, by real interest rate, I’m referring to the interest rate net of expected inflation. More specifically, suppose that the interest rate on a 10-year bond is about 2.5 percent and that people expect inflation to be around 2 percent per year over the next 10 years. Then, the real interest rate is about 0.5 percent per year for the next 10 years.\n\nA low long-term real interest rate stimulates an economy in a number of ways. It spurs consumer spending by allowing consumers to borrow and refinance more cheaply. It makes capital expenditures and hiring more profitable for corporations. Stock prices and house prices rise because those assets become relatively more attractive as investments. Households with these assets become wealthier and demand more consumption. All of these effects should lead to less unemployment and upward pressure on prices.\n\nHow does QE go about lowering long-term real interest rates? QE is a sufficiently novel monetary policy tool that different economists may well give different answers to this question. In my view, QE lowers long-term real interest rates in two distinct ways. The first is that QE is a form of nonverbal communication about the FOMC’s future plans. Here’s what I mean. The November FOMC statement says that the committee will keep the fed funds target range exceptionally low for as long as economic conditions warrant. The statement also predicts that exceptionally low fed funds rates are likely to be warranted for an “extended period” of time. In this way, the statement provides explicit communication about the FOMC’s future plans for short-term rates and so also shapes the level of current longer-term interest rates.\n\nQE provides a significant supplement to this explicit verbal communication. The use of QE indicates that the FOMC is likely to keep its target interest rate lower for an even longer period of time. Indeed, one could readily argue that buying $600 billion of Treasuries is a much more convincing form of communication of the FOMC’s plans than any words could ever be.\n\nThus, QE lowers long-term real interest rates by signaling the FOMC’s intentions about future short-term rates. However, QE also lowers long-term real interest rates in a second, more direct, way. The holder of a long-term Treasury is exposed to interest rate risk, because the value of that bond fluctuates as interest rates vary. When the Fed buys $600 billion of long-term bonds, the bond portfolio of the private sector is now less exposed to this kind of risk. As a consequence, private investors will demand a lower premium for holding other bonds that are exposed to interest rate risk, and all long-term yields fall.\n\nIn this way, the change to the asset side of the Fed’s balance sheet provides stimulus to the economy. But what about the liability side of its balance sheet? QE creates more reserves in banks’ accounts with the Fed. The standard intuition is that this kind of reserve creation is inflationary. Banks can only offer checkable deposits in proportion to their reserves. Economists view checkable deposits as a form of money because, like cash, checkable deposits make many transactions easier. In this sense, bank reserves held with the Fed are licenses for banks to create a certain amount of money. By giving out more licenses, the FOMC is allowing banks to create more money. More money chasing the same amount of goods—voila, inflation.\n\nGiven some of the criticisms of the Fed that have been voiced over the past two weeks, it is important to understand that this basic logic isn’t valid in current circumstances. Banks have nearly $1 trillion of excess reserves. This means that they are not using a lot of their existing licenses to create money. QE gives them $600 billion of new licenses to create money, but I do not see why they would suddenly start to use the new ones if they weren’t using the old ones.\n\nSome observers have expressed concerns that $1 trillion—which will shortly become over $1.5 trillion—of excess reserves represent what they term “kindling” for some future inflationary fire. I believe that these concerns are misplaced for two reasons. First, the Fed has several tools with which to combat incipient inflationary pressures. Most obviously, it can raise the interest rate on excess reserves as a form of tightening. Second, in recent public statements, Chairman Ben Bernanke has explicitly and firmly committed the FOMC to maintaining low inflation. To use his exact words, he said that he has “rejected any notion that we are going to try to raise inflation to a super-normal level.”\n\nAs I mentioned before, I do not currently vote on FOMC decisions. I did express support for the FOMC’s decision at the recent meeting. I believe that QE is a move in the right direction. However, as I have discussed on earlier occasions, I also think there are good reasons to suspect that the ultimate effects of any amount of QE are likely to be relatively modest. That’s why I would have greatly preferred for the committee to have been able to cut its target rate rather than using QE. The problem is that its target rate is already essentially at zero, and so it was not possible to cut the target rate any further.\n\nGiven this constraint on monetary policy, I believe it is important to ask if it is possible to synthesize the effects of a one-year interest rate cut of, say, 100 basis points using fiscal policy tools. In his current and past work, Minneapolis Fed staff researcher Juan Pablo Nicolini and his co-authors have answered this question in the affirmative.2 Their key insight is that there is a broad equivalence between monetary and fiscal policy. They argue that the essence of an FOMC interest rate cut is that it makes current consumption cheaper relative to future consumption. With that in mind, the fiscal authorities can use the time path of consumption taxes to accomplish this same change in relative prices.\n\nIn the remainder of my remarks, I’ll illustrate this insight by describing one particular fiscal policy plan that is equivalent to a 100-basis-point cut by the Fed. The proposal has three parts. The first part is a permanent consumption tax of 100 basis points, instituted with a one-year delay.3 The second part is a permanent decrease in labor income taxes of 100 basis points, also instituted with a one-year delay. The third part is an investment tax credit undertaken in 2011. The Nicolini et al. results demonstrate that, in a wide class of economic models, the effects of this three-part plan would be equivalent to the effects of a 100-basis-point interest rate cut.\n\nIt’s useful to explain the underlying mechanism using the kind of example that all Econ I students have grown to love. Suppose widgets cost $1 each in 2011. Suppose, too, that you can earn 1 percent interest over the coming year, but that inflation is also expected to be 1 percent. With that interest rate, and that inflation rate, any dollar that you save from 2011 into 2012 can also buy a widget. So, with each dollar, you face the trade-off of buying a widget today or buying a widget next year.\n\nNext, let’s understand how an interest rate cut affects this baseline trade-off. Suppose the Fed were able to cut its target interest rate by 100 basis points, without affecting expected inflation all that much. The bank would pass that interest rate cut along, and that means that your bank interest rate would fall from 1 percent to zero. Widgets still cost $1 in 2011, and they still cost $1.01 in 2012. But with the interest rate of zero, you would now have to save $1.01 to be able to buy a widget in 2012. The cut in the interest rate has made buying widgets in 2011 cheaper relative to buying widgets in 2012.\n\nThus, if the Fed were able to cut its target interest rate, saving would become less attractive and borrowing more attractive. Consumers would demand more widgets today. Firms would hire workers to produce more widgets today. Unemployment would decline.\n\nBut now let’s go back to the benchmark case without the interest rate cut. Recall that expected inflation is 1 percent and that your bank is paying you an interest rate of 1 percent. In that context, think about the three-pronged fiscal policy change that I described earlier. The first part is that the fiscal authorities institute a 1 percent tax on consumption goods that starts in 2012 and lasts for the foreseeable future. Widgets still cost $1 in 2011. Inflation is 1 percent and the tax is 1 percent, and so widgets cost $1.02 in 2012. Given the interest rate of 1 percent, you must save $1.01 in 2011 to get a widget in 2012. Just as with the interest rate cut, widgets have become 1 percent cheaper today relative to the future.\n\nThis change in relative prices means that the increase in the consumption tax will stimulate consumption demand in 2011. Why, then, do we need a labor income tax reduction in 2012? The problem is that a consumption tax that begins in 2012 distorts labor supply decisions in a way that interest rate cuts don’t. Consider a worker who makes $20 an hour in 2012 after the various taxes on labor income. If the consumption tax goes up, that worker can buy fewer widgets with each hour of work. Hence, the consumption tax distorts that worker’s decision about how much labor to supply to the market.\n\nThat’s why we need the second part of the plan, under which the fiscal authorities lower taxes on labor income by one percentage point beginning in 2012. With this tax decrease, the worker makes 1 percent more per hour after taxes. The increase in after-tax wages exactly offsets the decrease in purchasing power generated by the consumption tax, and a worker can again buy 20 widgets with each hour of work. As a result, the new plan makes consumption goods cheaper in 2011, but does not provide any additional distortion to labor supply decisions.\n\nAt this point, I’ve talked through the first two parts of the proposal—the permanent increase in consumption taxes and the permanent decrease in labor income taxes. Why do we need a third tax change? Unlike an interest rate cut, the consumption tax that begins in 2012 will deter investment in 2011. The third prong of the proposal is that the fiscal authority should correct this problem by offering an appropriately sized temporary investment tax credit in 2011. The key is that the tax credit need only apply in 2011. In 2012 and thereafter, there is no disincentive effect on investment because the consumption tax is constant.\n\nTo summarize, I have described how to construct a three-pronged fiscal policy that is designed to have the same economic effects as a 100-basis-point cut by the Fed. The 1 percent permanent consumption tax that begins in 2012 stimulates consumption demand in 2011. The permanent reduction in labor income taxes ensures that this new consumption tax does not deter labor supply. Finally, the investment tax credit makes sure that the new consumption tax does not deter investment in 2011.\n\nI’ll make two additional comments about this plan. First, how much would this three-pronged change in taxes cost the American taxpayer? The exact answer to this question would depend on a host of details—details that many of you know a lot more about than I do. But let me offer a very rough calculation. Annual consumption is about $10 trillion, and annual labor income is about $8 trillion. I’ve sketched a plan that involves increasing the tax rate on consumption by 1 percentage point and lowering labor income taxes by 1 percentage point. So, the first two parts of the plan would add about $20 billion per year to government revenue beginning in 2012.\n\nThe plan also involves an appropriately sized investment tax credit. Private gross investment is about $2 trillion. To offset the effect of the consumption tax in 2012, the fiscal authority needs to provide a 1 percent subsidy to this entire amount. Hence, the investment tax credit involves a one-time cost in 2012 of $20 billion. These calculations, while obviously very rough, do indicate that the plan has the potential to be fiscally responsible.4\n\nSecond, I’ve not discussed distributional considerations. Raising consumption taxes by 1 percentage point and lowering labor income taxes by 1 percentage point for all Americans would tend to redistribute the burden of taxes toward lower-income citizens. For this reason, I believe that it would be desirable to redesign the labor income tax reduction to make it more progressive.\n\nOverall, I believe that this analysis has both policy and intellectual aspects. From a policy point of view, I’ve deliberately focused on a rather narrow aspect of fiscal policy—namely, how it can be used to mimic monetary policy. That narrow focus seems appropriate to me, given my role in the policy process. I find the resultant policy to be attractive because may be able to generate macroeconomic stimulus without increasing the deficit.\n\nFrom an intellectual point of view, the analysis demonstrates the remarkable power of public finance in addressing important macroeconomic questions. Of course, this last lesson is hardly new. As I mentioned at the beginning of my talk, over the past 30 years, macroeconomists have used the tools and methods of public finance to address a host of important questions, ranging from optimal stabilization policy to optimal unemployment insurance. I’m proud to say that a great deal of that work has been done at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.\n\nThanks for your attention. I’ll be happy to take your questions."

Just as with the interest rate cut, widgets have become 1 percent cheaper today relative to the future.\nThis change in relative prices means that the increase in the consumption tax will stimulate consumption demand in 2011. Why, then, do we need a labor income tax reduction in 2012? The problem is that a consumption tax that begins in 2012 distorts labor supply decisions in a way that interest rate cuts don’t. Consider a worker who makes $20 an hour in 2012 after the various taxes on labor income. If the consumption tax goes up, that worker can buy fewer widgets with each hour of work. Hence, the consumption tax distorts that worker’s decision about how much labor to supply to the market.\nThat’s why we need the second part of the plan, under which the fiscal authorities lower taxes on labor income by one percentage point beginning in 2012. With this tax decrease, the worker makes 1 percent more per hour after taxes. The increase in after-tax wages exactly offsets the decrease in purchasing power generated by the consumption tax, and a worker can again buy 20 widgets with each hour of work. As a result, the new plan makes consumption goods cheaper in 2011, but does not provide any additional distortion to labor supply decisions.\nAt this point, I’ve talked through the first two parts of the proposal—the permanent increase in consumption taxes and the permanent decrease in labor income taxes. Why do we need a third tax change? Unlike an interest rate cut, the consumption tax that begins in 2012 will deter investment in 2011. The third prong of the proposal is that the fiscal authority should correct this problem by offering an appropriately sized temporary investment tax credit in 2011. The key is that the tax credit need only apply in 2011. In 2012 and thereafter, there is no disincentive effect on investment because the consumption tax is constant.\n To summarize, I have described how to construct a three-pronged fiscal policy that is designed to have the same economic effects as a 100-basis-point cut by the Fed. The 1 percent permanent consumption tax that begins in 2012 stimulates consumption demand in 2011. The permanent reduction in labor income taxes ensures that this new consumption tax does not deter labor supply. Finally, the investment tax credit makes sure that the new consumption tax does not deter investment in 2011.\nI’ll make two additional comments about this plan. First, how much would this three-pronged change in taxes cost the American taxpayer? The exact answer to this question would depend on a host of details—details that many of you know a lot more about than I do. But let me offer a very rough calculation. Annual consumption is about $10 trillion, and annual labor income is about $8 trillion. I’ve sketched a plan that involves increasing the tax rate on consumption by 1 percentage point and lowering labor income taxes by 1 percentage point. So, the first two parts of the plan would add about $20 billion per year to government revenue beginning in 2012.\nThe plan also involves an appropriately sized investment tax credit. Private gross investment is about $2 trillion. To offset the effect of the consumption tax in 2012, the fiscal authority needs to provide a 1 percent subsidy to this entire amount. Hence, the investment tax credit involves a one-time cost in 2012 of $20 billion. These calculations, while obviously very rough, do indicate that the plan has the potential to be fiscally responsible.4\nSecond, I’ve not discussed distributional considerations. Raising consumption taxes by 1 percentage point and lowering labor income taxes by 1 percentage point for all Americans would tend to redistribute the burden of taxes toward lower-income citizens. For this reason, I believe that it would be desirable to redesign the labor income tax reduction to make it more progressive.\nOverall, I believe that this analysis has both policy and intellectual aspects. From a policy point of view, I’ve deliberately focused on a rather narrow aspect of fiscal policy—namely, how it can be used to mimic monetary policy. That narrow focus seems appropriate to me, given my role in the policy process. I find the resultant policy to be attractive because may be able to generate macroeconomic stimulus without increasing the deficit.\nFrom an intellectual point of view, the analysis demonstrates the remarkable power of public finance in addressing important macroeconomic questions. Of course, this last lesson is hardly new. As I mentioned at the beginning of my talk, over the past 30 years, macroeconomists have used the tools and methods of public finance to address a host of important questions, ranging from optimal stabilization policy to optimal unemployment insurance. I’m proud to say that a great deal of that work has been done at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.\nThanks for your attention. I’ll be happy to take your questions.\n1 I thank Ron Feldman, Terry Fitzgerald, and Juan Pablo Nicolini for their comments.\n2 See Correia, Isabel, Juan Pablo Nicolini, and Pedro Teles, “Optimal Fiscal and Monetary Policy: Equivalence Results,” Journal of Political Economy 116 (February 2008), pp. 141-70. (Also available online at minneapolisfed.org.) See also Correia, Isabel, Emmanuel Farhi, Juan Pablo Nicolini, and Pedro Teles, “Policy at the Zero Bound,” working paper (October 2010).\n3 My scheme makes current consumption cheaper by imposing a permanent tax on future consumption. In contrast, in late 2008, Robert Hall and Susan Woodward proposed making consumption goods cheaper in 2009 than in future years by eliminating all state sales taxes for one year. They suggested that this reduction could be financed by the federal government. (See http://woodwardhall.wordpress.com/2008/12/).\n4 I’ve focused on a one-year interest rate cut. How can the fiscal authorities mimic the impact of a two-year interest rate cut? The rule is that the yearly interest rate equals the size of the change in the consumption tax rate. In particular, suppose that the fiscal authorities acted in 2010 to implement a 1 percent tax on consumption in 2012, with a subsequent more permanent 2 percent tax that begins in 2013. This path of taxes, combined with the appropriate labor income tax reductions and investment tax credits, functions like a two-year interest rate cut that begins in 2011.\n\nNote1\n\nThank you for that generous introduction, Harvey. It’s a huge honor for me to be addressing you, and I certainly want to thank Wojciech and Karl for inviting me. Ironically enough, your luncheon speaker tomorrow—Doug Elmendorf—and I lived in the same college dorm back in our freshman year of 1979-80. I’ll leave it to you to decide who has aged better—although I caution you that you’re handicapped by not knowing the relevant initial conditions.\n\nI became president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis last October. During the preceding 22 years, I was a professor of economics at a variety of institutions. I did research in a number of areas, including public finance. My main area of interest, though, was macroeconomics.\n\nThere has been a lot of conversation over the past year or two about what we have and haven’t learned from macroeconomics. For myself, I believe that one of the most important developments in the field is the use of tools from theoretical public finance to answer key policy questions. To my knowledge, this line of research dates back to the work of Robert Lucas and Nancy Stokey in the 1980s, although I’m sure that some of you might be able to point to even earlier sources. It continues to be a vital area of investigation almost 30 years later—and it will play a key role in my remarks today.\n\nI’ll begin by discussing current macroeconomic conditions and the Federal Open Market Committee’s recent actions taken in response to those conditions. That discussion will make clear that the committee took those actions because it is not able to cut its interest rate target any further. Motivated by this difficulty, I will pose and answer the following question: What actions can other policymakers take to approximate the impact of an interest rate cut? In addressing this question, I will rely on recent research being done at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis by staff researcher Juan Pablo Nicolini and several co-authors. Throughout, I’ll be speaking on behalf of myself and no other participant in FOMC meetings.\n\nLet me start with some basic context about how monetary policy gets made in the United States. The Federal Open Market Committee meets eight times per year to determine the path of monetary policy over the next six to seven weeks. The governors of the Federal Reserve Board and the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York are permanent members of the committee. Four other presidents of Reserve banks are on the committee, but this group rotates annually. While they do not vote, the other presidents are invited to the FOMC meeting and contribute to the committee’s deliberations. Right now, I’m a meeting participant, but I will rotate onto the committee in 2011.\n\nThe foundation of the committee’s discussions is what is called its dual mandate. By statute, the Federal Reserve is required to follow policies that promote effectively the goals of price stability and maximum employment. The former objective of price stability is generally understood as keeping inflation in a range of around 1.5 to 2.5 percent. The second part of the mandate—maximum employment—is more of a moving target, because employment is shaped by many determinants beyond the Fed’s control: demographics, social custom, taxes, technology, and so on.\n\nOver the first three quarters of this year, personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price inflation has averaged roughly 1 percent at an annualized rate. This rate is low relative to the FOMC’s target of 2 percent. More troublingly, the inflation rate is drifting downward. Over the preceding two-year period (from the fourth quarter of 2007 through the fourth quarter of 2009), PCE inflation averaged 1.6 percent per year.\n\nAt the same time, unemployment is high: In October, it was 9.6 percent. Here, too, the trend is not comforting. The recession officially ended in June 2009, and in that month, unemployment was 9.5 percent. Unemployment has actually risen slightly during the course of the recovery.\n\nSufficient growth in output can steadily lower unemployment. But growth has been low in this recovery compared with most. As I mentioned, the recession officially ended in June 2009 and so has been over for five quarters. Over those five quarters, real gross domestic product (GDP) has grown at an annualized rate of under 3 percent. More alarmingly, growth has been decelerating: In the past two quarters, it has averaged less than 2 percent at an annualized rate.\n\nThis is the economic situation that confronted the FOMC in its November meeting. Inflation and employment are both too low, and the pace of recovery is too slow. Economic growth is low and softening further. I think it is safe to say that, given this situation, the FOMC would have liked to have been able to cut its target interest rate. But this option is not available. The FOMC’s target interest rate is already essentially at zero (more precisely, in a range between 0 and 25 basis points).\n\nBut the FOMC does have another policy instrument available: its balance sheet. As of the beginning of this month, the FOMC had a portfolio of roughly $2.3 trillion. Over 2 trillion of those dollars are invested in Treasury securities or government-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and other government-sponsored enterprises. At its November 3 meeting, the FOMC announced that it plans to buy $600 billion of long-term Treasuries in the open market by mid-2011. In exchange for those securities, it will credit the sellers’ accounts at the Fed with more reserves. This kind of action is known as quantitative easing, or QE.\n\nThe main goal of QE is to lower the long-run real interest rate. As you all know, by real interest rate, I’m referring to the interest rate net of expected inflation. More specifically, suppose that the interest rate on a 10-year bond is about 2.5 percent and that people expect inflation to be around 2 percent per year over the next 10 years. Then, the real interest rate is about 0.5 percent per year for the next 10 years.\n\nA low long-term real interest rate stimulates an economy in a number of ways. It spurs consumer spending by allowing consumers to borrow and refinance more cheaply. It makes capital expenditures and hiring more profitable for corporations. Stock prices and house prices rise because those assets become relatively more attractive as investments. Households with these assets become wealthier and demand more consumption. All of these effects should lead to less unemployment and upward pressure on prices.\n\nHow does QE go about lowering long-term real interest rates? QE is a sufficiently novel monetary policy tool that different economists may well give different answers to this question. In my view, QE lowers long-term real interest rates in two distinct ways. The first is that QE is a form of nonverbal communication about the FOMC’s future plans. Here’s what I mean. The November FOMC statement says that the committee will keep the fed funds target range exceptionally low for as long as economic conditions warrant. The statement also predicts that exceptionally low fed funds rates are likely to be warranted for an “extended period” of time. In this way, the statement provides explicit communication about the FOMC’s future plans for short-term rates and so also shapes the level of current longer-term interest rates.\n\nQE provides a significant supplement to this explicit verbal communication. The use of QE indicates that the FOMC is likely to keep its target interest rate lower for an even longer period of time. Indeed, one could readily argue that buying $600 billion of Treasuries is a much more convincing form of communication of the FOMC’s plans than any words could ever be.\n\nThus, QE lowers long-term real interest rates by signaling the FOMC’s intentions about future short-term rates. However, QE also lowers long-term real interest rates in a second, more direct, way. The holder of a long-term Treasury is exposed to interest rate risk, because the value of that bond fluctuates as interest rates vary. When the Fed buys $600 billion of long-term bonds, the bond portfolio of the private sector is now less exposed to this kind of risk. As a consequence, private investors will demand a lower premium for holding other bonds that are exposed to interest rate risk, and all long-term yields fall.\n\nIn this way, the change to the asset side of the Fed’s balance sheet provides stimulus to the economy. But what about the liability side of its balance sheet? QE creates more reserves in banks’ accounts with the Fed. The standard intuition is that this kind of reserve creation is inflationary. Banks can only offer checkable deposits in proportion to their reserves. Economists view checkable deposits as a form of money because, like cash, checkable deposits make many transactions easier. In this sense, bank reserves held with the Fed are licenses for banks to create a certain amount of money. By giving out more licenses, the FOMC is allowing banks to create more money. More money chasing the same amount of goods—voila, inflation.\n\nGiven some of the criticisms of the Fed that have been voiced over the past two weeks, it is important to understand that this basic logic isn’t valid in current circumstances. Banks have nearly $1 trillion of excess reserves. This means that they are not using a lot of their existing licenses to create money. QE gives them $600 billion of new licenses to create money, but I do not see why they would suddenly start to use the new ones if they weren’t using the old ones.\n\nSome observers have expressed concerns that $1 trillion—which will shortly become over $1.5 trillion—of excess reserves represent what they term “kindling” for some future inflationary fire. I believe that these concerns are misplaced for two reasons. First, the Fed has several tools with which to combat incipient inflationary pressures. Most obviously, it can raise the interest rate on excess reserves as a form of tightening. Second, in recent public statements, Chairman Ben Bernanke has explicitly and firmly committed the FOMC to maintaining low inflation. To use his exact words, he said that he has “rejected any notion that we are going to try to raise inflation to a super-normal level.”\n\nAs I mentioned before, I do not currently vote on FOMC decisions. I did express support for the FOMC’s decision at the recent meeting. I believe that QE is a move in the right direction. However, as I have discussed on earlier occasions, I also think there are good reasons to suspect that the ultimate effects of any amount of QE are likely to be relatively modest. That’s why I would have greatly preferred for the committee to have been able to cut its target rate rather than using QE. The problem is that its target rate is already essentially at zero, and so it was not possible to cut the target rate any further.\n\nGiven this constraint on monetary policy, I believe it is important to ask if it is possible to synthesize the effects of a one-year interest rate cut of, say, 100 basis points using fiscal policy tools. In his current and past work, Minneapolis Fed staff researcher Juan Pablo Nicolini and his co-authors have answered this question in the affirmative.2 Their key insight is that there is a broad equivalence between monetary and fiscal policy. They argue that the essence of an FOMC interest rate cut is that it makes current consumption cheaper relative to future consumption. With that in mind, the fiscal authorities can use the time path of consumption taxes to accomplish this same change in relative prices.\n\nIn the remainder of my remarks, I’ll illustrate this insight by describing one particular fiscal policy plan that is equivalent to a 100-basis-point cut by the Fed. The proposal has three parts. The first part is a permanent consumption tax of 100 basis points, instituted with a one-year delay.3 The second part is a permanent decrease in labor income taxes of 100 basis points, also instituted with a one-year delay. The third part is an investment tax credit undertaken in 2011. The Nicolini et al. results demonstrate that, in a wide class of economic models, the effects of this three-part plan would be equivalent to the effects of a 100-basis-point interest rate cut.\n\nIt’s useful to explain the underlying mechanism using the kind of example that all Econ I students have grown to love. Suppose widgets cost $1 each in 2011. Suppose, too, that you can earn 1 percent interest over the coming year, but that inflation is also expected to be 1 percent. With that interest rate, and that inflation rate, any dollar that you save from 2011 into 2012 can also buy a widget. So, with each dollar, you face the trade-off of buying a widget today or buying a widget next year.\n\nNext, let’s understand how an interest rate cut affects this baseline trade-off. Suppose the Fed were able to cut its target interest rate by 100 basis points, without affecting expected inflation all that much. The bank would pass that interest rate cut along, and that means that your bank interest rate would fall from 1 percent to zero. Widgets still cost $1 in 2011, and they still cost $1.01 in 2012. But with the interest rate of zero, you would now have to save $1.01 to be able to buy a widget in 2012. The cut in the interest rate has made buying widgets in 2011 cheaper relative to buying widgets in 2012.\n\nThus, if the Fed were able to cut its target interest rate, saving would become less attractive and borrowing more attractive. Consumers would demand more widgets today. Firms would hire workers to produce more widgets today. Unemployment would decline.\n\nBut now let’s go back to the benchmark case without the interest rate cut. Recall that expected inflation is 1 percent and that your bank is paying you an interest rate of 1 percent. In that context, think about the three-pronged fiscal policy change that I described earlier. The first part is that the fiscal authorities institute a 1 percent tax on consumption goods that starts in 2012 and lasts for the foreseeable future. Widgets still cost $1 in 2011. Inflation is 1 percent and the tax is 1 percent, and so widgets cost $1.02 in 2012. Given the interest rate of 1 percent, you must save $1.01 in 2011 to get a widget in 2012. Just as with the interest rate cut, widgets have become 1 percent cheaper today relative to the future.\n\nThis change in relative prices means that the increase in the consumption tax will stimulate consumption demand in 2011. Why, then, do we need a labor income tax reduction in 2012? The problem is that a consumption tax that begins in 2012 distorts labor supply decisions in a way that interest rate cuts don’t. Consider a worker who makes $20 an hour in 2012 after the various taxes on labor income. If the consumption tax goes up, that worker can buy fewer widgets with each hour of work. Hence, the consumption tax distorts that worker’s decision about how much labor to supply to the market.\n\nThat’s why we need the second part of the plan, under which the fiscal authorities lower taxes on labor income by one percentage point beginning in 2012. With this tax decrease, the worker makes 1 percent more per hour after taxes. The increase in after-tax wages exactly offsets the decrease in purchasing power generated by the consumption tax, and a worker can again buy 20 widgets with each hour of work. As a result, the new plan makes consumption goods cheaper in 2011, but does not provide any additional distortion to labor supply decisions.\n\nAt this point, I’ve talked through the first two parts of the proposal—the permanent increase in consumption taxes and the permanent decrease in labor income taxes. Why do we need a third tax change? Unlike an interest rate cut, the consumption tax that begins in 2012 will deter investment in 2011. The third prong of the proposal is that the fiscal authority should correct this problem by offering an appropriately sized temporary investment tax credit in 2011. The key is that the tax credit need only apply in 2011. In 2012 and thereafter, there is no disincentive effect on investment because the consumption tax is constant.\n\nTo summarize, I have described how to construct a three-pronged fiscal policy that is designed to have the same economic effects as a 100-basis-point cut by the Fed. The 1 percent permanent consumption tax that begins in 2012 stimulates consumption demand in 2011. The permanent reduction in labor income taxes ensures that this new consumption tax does not deter labor supply. Finally, the investment tax credit makes sure that the new consumption tax does not deter investment in 2011.\n\nI’ll make two additional comments about this plan. First, how much would this three-pronged change in taxes cost the American taxpayer? The exact answer to this question would depend on a host of details—details that many of you know a lot more about than I do. But let me offer a very rough calculation. Annual consumption is about $10 trillion, and annual labor income is about $8 trillion. I’ve sketched a plan that involves increasing the tax rate on consumption by 1 percentage point and lowering labor income taxes by 1 percentage point. So, the first two parts of the plan would add about $20 billion per year to government revenue beginning in 2012.\n\nThe plan also involves an appropriately sized investment tax credit. Private gross investment is about $2 trillion. To offset the effect of the consumption tax in 2012, the fiscal authority needs to provide a 1 percent subsidy to this entire amount. Hence, the investment tax credit involves a one-time cost in 2012 of $20 billion. These calculations, while obviously very rough, do indicate that the plan has the potential to be fiscally responsible.4\n\nSecond, I’ve not discussed distributional considerations. Raising consumption taxes by 1 percentage point and lowering labor income taxes by 1 percentage point for all Americans would tend to redistribute the burden of taxes toward lower-income citizens. For this reason, I believe that it would be desirable to redesign the labor income tax reduction to make it more progressive.\n\nOverall, I believe that this analysis has both policy and intellectual aspects. From a policy point of view, I’ve deliberately focused on a rather narrow aspect of fiscal policy—namely, how it can be used to mimic monetary policy. That narrow focus seems appropriate to me, given my role in the policy process. I find the resultant policy to be attractive because may be able to generate macroeconomic stimulus without increasing the deficit.\n\nFrom an intellectual point of view, the analysis demonstrates the remarkable power of public finance in addressing important macroeconomic questions. Of course, this last lesson is hardly new. As I mentioned at the beginning of my talk, over the past 30 years, macroeconomists have used the tools and methods of public finance to address a host of important questions, ranging from optimal stabilization policy to optimal unemployment insurance. I’m proud to say that a great deal of that work has been done at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.\n\nThanks for your attention. I’ll be happy to take your questions."

        "content": "Thanks for the generous introduction, Howard. I’m delighted to have this opportunity to speak with all of you today, and especially to make my first official visit to Fargo as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. Of course, as someone who grew up in Winnipeg, I am very familiar with Fargo and the Red River Valley. My family made many trips down here over the years. I found in Wikipedia that the West Acres Mall opened on August 2, 1972. I can’t remember for sure, but it’s certainly possible that we visited the mall on August 3!\nI’m especially pleased that one of the members of our Minneapolis Board of Directors, Howard Dahl, was here today to introduce me. As you just heard from Howard, he and other members of our board play an important role in the Federal Reserve System, as do members of our advisory councils on agriculture, and small business and labor. I won’t mention all the members of those groups, past and present, who are in attendance today, for the list is long, but I thank you for your service.\nAs Howard just mentioned, I became president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis last October. Here’s the start of a rather typical conversation that I would have had with my friends and relatives last fall. “Congratulations! That’s fantastic. Now, what is it that you will do exactly?”\nAs it turns out, the job has a lot of interesting aspects. But I think I’ve been invited to speak here today because I help formulate monetary policy for the United States. So what I plan to do is give you some feel for how this part of my job works. In doing so, I’ll highlight the Federal Reserve’s quintessentially American structure. Unlike the central banks of other countries, you’ll see that ours is specifically designed to draw upon the insights of small-town businesses, farmers and ranchers, and large manufacturers, among others, to formulate monetary policy. Before I proceed, I must remind you that any views I express here today are my own, and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\nWhat do I mean by an American structure? Well, relative to its counterparts around the world, the U.S. central bank is highly decentralized. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is one of 12 regional Reserve banks that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System. Our bank represents the ninth of the 12 Federal Reserve districts and includes Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, northwestern Wisconsin, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.\nEight times per year, the Federal Open Market Committee—the FOMC—meets to set the path of short-term interest rates over the next six to seven weeks. All 12 presidents of the various regional Federal Reserve banks—including me—and the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board contribute to these deliberations. (Actually, in the September meeting, there were only four governors. The good news is that we are back up to six governors, and the White House has nominated Peter Diamond—who just won the Nobel Prize in economics—for the remaining vacancy.) However, the committee itself consists only of the governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and a rotating group of four other presidents (currently Cleveland, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Boston). I’ll be on the committee in 2011.\nIn this way, the structure of the FOMC mirrors the federalist structure of our government. Representatives from different regions of the country—the various presidents—have input into FOMC deliberations. The input from the presidents relies critically on information they receive from their districts about local economic performance. We obtain this information through the work of our research staffs—but we also obtain it from business leaders in industries and towns, in my case, across the Upper Midwest. The Federal Reserve System is deliberately designed so that the residents of Main Street are able to have a voice in monetary policy.\nSo how exactly do the FOMC meetings work? In the remainder of my remarks, I’ll take you inside an FOMC meeting. Its structure provides a perfect vehicle to communicate the key considerations confronting monetary policymakers in the United States.\nThe typical FOMC meeting features two so-called go-rounds, in which every president and every governor has a chance to speak without interruption. The first go-round is referred to as the economics go-round. The meeting participants describe their views on current economic conditions and their outlook for future economic conditions. The presidents’ remarks will typically include references to their own local economies, as well as the national and global situation.\nAs part of my contributions to the economics go-round in the last couple of meetings, I discussed my outlook for GDP, inflation, and unemployment. In terms of GDP, I believe that a modest recovery is under way and is likely to continue. In terms of inflation, I expect a slight but welcome uptick over the next 18 months. Finally, in terms of unemployment, I see ongoing problems in labor markets.\nI’ll talk first about GDP. Real GDP growth has been positive in each of the past four quarters, and the government’s final estimate is 1.7 percent for the second quarter of this year. Based on forecasts from our Minneapolis model, I expect that GDP growth will be around 2.4 percent in the second half of 2010 and around 2.5 percent in 2011. Together over 2010 and 2011, I expect that GDP will grow around 2.5 percent per year. In contrast, in my first speech about seven months ago, I predicted that GDP would grow around 3.0 percent per year over 2010 and 2011. There is a recovery under way in the United States. But it is a distinctly modest one—and even more modest than I expected at the beginning of this year.\nLet me turn now to inflation. From the fourth quarter of 2009 through the second quarter of 2010, the change in the PCE price level was just over 0.5 percent, which works out to an annual rate of just over 1 percent. The Fed’s price stability mandate is generally interpreted as maintaining an inflation rate of 2 percent, and 1 percent inflation is often considered to be too low relative to this stricture. I expect inflation to remain at about this level during the rest of this year. However, our Minneapolis forecasting model predicts that it will rise back into the more desirable 1.5-2 percent range by the second half of 2011.\nSo the news about inflation and GDP is in the “OK, but certainly could be better” category. However, the lack of vitality in the U.S. labor market can only be termed disturbing. The national unemployment rate remained at 9.6 percent in September. Private sector job creation remains weak—only 64,000 net private sector jobs were created in September. I do not expect the unemployment rate to decline rapidly, and so I expect it to be above 8.0 percent well into 2012.\nIf one digs deeper into the data, the situation seems even more troubling. The National Bureau of Economic Research dates the end of the recession as having occurred in June 2009. Correspondingly, from June 2009 through August 2010, the demand for labor among employers seemed to rise modestly. Since December 2000, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has been keeping data on the job openings rate, which is defined as the number of job openings divided by the sum of job openings and employment. It has also been keeping track of the layoffs/discharges rate, which is the fraction of employed people who have been laid off or discharged in a given month. From June 2009 to August 2010, the job openings rate rose by 26 percent. Over the same period, the layoffs/discharges rate fell by nearly 18 percent.\nNonetheless, despite this apparent increase in the demand for labor from employers, the unemployment rate actually went up slightly from June 2009 to August 2010, from 9.5 percent to 9.6 percent. And other measures of labor market performance actually tell an even bleaker story. From June 2009 to August 2010, the employment/population ratio fell from 59.4 percent to 58.5 percent. At the same time, the seasonally adjusted labor force participation rate fell from 65.7 percent to 64.7 percent.\nThat was essentially my input into the economics go-round of the FOMC at the last two meetings. GDP is growing, but more slowly than we would like. Inflation is a little low, but only temporarily. The failure of unemployment—and the labor market more generally—to respond to the modest increase in labor demand is deeply troubling.\nAfter the economics go-round, the FOMC meeting then transitions to its second phase, the policy go-round. Again, the meeting participants have a chance to speak in turn about what they perceived to be the appropriate policy choices for the committee. We all are committed to achieving the Fed’s dual mandate to attain both price stability and maximum employment. The former objective is generally understood as keeping inflation in a tight range around 2 percent. The second part of the mandate is much more of a moving target. Employment is shaped by many determinants beyond the Fed’s control: demographics, social custom, taxes, and so on. The Fed’s job is to keep employment as high as possible, given these other factors.\nCurrently, the FOMC has two quite distinct tools: short-term interest rates and balance sheet management. In terms of the former, the FOMC has set its target range for the fed funds rate at between 0 and 25 basis points. It has committed to keeping the rate in that range for “an extended period,” contingent on economic conditions being appropriate. The FOMC is also maintaining a portfolio of roughly $2.3 trillion. Over 2 trillion of those dollars are invested in Treasury securities or government-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and other government-sponsored enterprises.\nIn his address at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s annual policy forum in August, Chairman Bernanke described three ways to use these tools if the FOMC chooses to provide further stimulus. The first is to buy more long-term securities. The second is to offer more forward guidance in the FOMC statement. The third is to reduce the interest on excess reserves (IOER) by 15 or even 25 basis points. As Chairman Bernanke indicated, using these tools does not come without costs, and due consideration must be made of both costs and benefits. Along those lines, I will discuss my thoughts on how these tools impact the economy. Again, I must underscore that my thoughts are my own and do not represent the views of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nLet me talk first about forward guidance. In part, firms make their decisions about capital expenditures and hiring by comparing the returns to those internal projects to the inflation-adjusted yields available in financial markets for investments of similar horizon. Thus, the real yields on medium-term and long-term government bonds matter for firm investment decisions. Those yields are, in part, shaped by current expectations of future short-term interest rates. The current FOMC statement shapes those expectations by providing forward guidance about its future plans for the behavior of the fed funds target.\nRight now, the FOMC states that it will keep the fed funds target range exceptionally low for as long as economic conditions warrant. The statement also predicts that exceptionally low fed funds rates are likely to be warranted for an “extended period” of time. In this way, the statement influences current expectations of future short-term rates and thereby shapes current medium- and long-term interest rates. The FOMC could provide stimulus by saying that it predicts that low rates are likely to be warranted for an even longer period of time than an “extended period.” This kind of stronger language should lead to a decline in medium-term and long-term interest rates.\nI view lowering the IOER as another form of forward guidance. I think that it is unlikely that lowering the IOER by 15 or 25 basis points will have much direct effect on loan markets. However, it is likely that investors would view this move as a signal that the FOMC is planning to keep its target rate even lower for an even longer period of time. In that way, lowering the IOER would serve to lower medium-term and long-term interest rates.\nSo, the FOMC can influence the economy through various forms of forward guidance about how long it plans for the fed funds rate to be so low. However, the FOMC has another tool at its disposal: what is often termed quantitative easing—QE for short. Under quantitative easing, the FOMC buys long-term securities in the open market. In exchange for those securities, it credits the sellers’ accounts at the Fed with more reserves. The upshot is that there are fewer long-term securities being held by private investors, and banks hold more reserves.\nJust to be clear on one point: The FOMC is only authorized by Congress to buy a limited set of securities. Ideas like “the FOMC should buy corporate bonds” would require a change to the Federal Reserve Act—a change that I for one would view as undesirable. In meetings earlier this year, FOMC participants indicated their strong preference to return to an all-Treasury portfolio. So, I’ll proceed in this speech under the presumption is that any new purchases would take the form of long-term Treasuries. But, as I’ll discuss, the idea behind QE is that the yields on those long-term Treasuries will affect yields on all long-term securities.\nI see QE as affecting the economy in four main ways. I’ll first discuss them from a theoretical perspective and then discuss what’s known about these effects empirically.\nThe first effect of QE is that it represents another form of forward guidance about the path of the fed funds rate. It is a way for the FOMC to signal—in a perhaps more striking way—that it plans to keep the fed funds rate low for an even longer time to come.\nSecond, QE creates more reserves in banks’ accounts with the Fed. The standard intuition is that this kind of reserve creation is inflationary. Banks can only offer checkable deposits in proportion to their reserves. Economists view checkable deposits as a form of money because, like cash, checkable deposits make many transactions easier. In this sense, bank reserves held with the Fed are licenses for banks to create a certain amount of money. By giving out more licenses, the FOMC is allowing banks to create more money. More money chasing the same amount of goods—voila, inflation.\nThis basic logic isn’t valid in current circumstances, because reserves are paying interest equal to comparable market interest rates. Banks have nearly $1 trillion of excess reserves. This means that they are not using a lot of their existing licenses to create money. QE gives them new licenses to create money, but I do not see why they would suddenly start to use the new ones if they weren’t using the old ones. With that said, I have indicated in earlier speeches that $1 trillion of excess reserves does create a potential for high inflation at some point in the future if the FOMC does not react sufficiently fast when it starts to see inflationary pressures. But I do not see this risk as being heightened in any meaningful way by banks holding even more excess reserves than what they are holding today.\nThe third effect of QE is the one that is usually stressed: It reduces the exposure of the private sector to interest rate risk. The holder of a long-term Treasury is exposed to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the price of the bond falls, and the bondholder is less wealthy. Now think about an example of QE in which the Fed buys $1 billion of 10-year Treasuries. On the margin, the bond portfolio of the private sector is now less exposed to interest rate risk. As a consequence, private investors will demand a lower premium for holding other bonds that are exposed to interest rate risk. All long-term yields fall, and so firms should be more willing to undertake long-term capital expansions or hire permanent employees.\nThe fourth effect of QE is less widely discussed. The Fed cannot literally eliminate the exposure of the economy to the risk of fluctuations in the real interest rate. It can only shift that risk among people in the economy. So, where did that risk go when the Fed bought the long-term bond? The answer is to taxpayers.\nTo see this more clearly, suppose hypothetically that the Treasury wants to borrow $1 billion today and is choosing between two ways of doing so. One way is to issue a 20-year, zero-coupon, inflation-indexed bond. The bond requires the Treasury to repay $1.5 billion in real terms in 20 years (roughly a 2 percent real yield). Under this plan, taxpayers face no tax risk, but the buyers of the bond can lose a lot if real interest rates rise greatly. The other way is to issue $1 billion of one-year indexed bonds and then keep rolling over that debt for 20 years. Now, taxpayers have to repay a lot more than $1.5 billion in 20 years if short-term real interest rates end up being high.\nBasically, if the government uses short-term debt, it exposes taxpayers to interest rate risk. If it uses long-term government debt, it exposes the bondholders to interest rate risk. QE is a special case of this general principle: When the Fed buys long-term government debt from the private market, it shifts interest rate risk from bondholders to taxpayers.\nWhat is the ultimate impact on the overall economy of this shift in risk? In the baseline models used by central banks, all bondholders are taxpayers. In these models, QE is essentially shifting risk from one pocket to another. As a result, the increase in tax risk (what I’m calling the fourth effect of QE) completely undoes the decrease in interest rate risk (the third effect of QE). QE ends up having no effects, except for those associated with any new forward guidance that it signals.1\nQE will have nontrivial effects over forward guidance in the context of a more realistic model in which people differ from one another in some relevant way. Along those lines, we might think that some people are active participants in the Treasury markets. Others are not. Then, if the Fed buys long-term Treasuries, it takes risk from the former group and imposes it on the second group. The ultimate macroeconomic impact of QE depends on the extent to which the extra tax risk deters economic activity on the part of this second group. We know little about this effect, either theoretically or empirically.\nTo this stage, my discussion of QE has been purely theoretical in nature. The Fed engaged in QE from January 2009 through March 2010 by buying over $1.5 trillion worth of agency debt, agency mortgage-backed securities, and Treasuries. How did this operation—termed the Large-Scale Asset Purchase, or LSAP program—affect the economy? We don’t know as much as we would like as yet. However, I think that the best empirical work on the question of how the LSAP affected long-term Treasury yields has been done by Gagnon, Raskin, Remache, and Sack (2010). The paper is a thorough investigation of this key issue. My conclusion from their work is that the LSAP reduced the term premium on 10-year Treasury bonds relative to 2-year Treasury bonds by about 40-80 basis points (on an annualized basis). (The term premium is a measure of the difference in yields that is not explained by the expected path of short-term interest rates.) This fall in term premia led to a slightly smaller fall in the term premia of corporate bonds.\nThese estimates are extremely useful benchmarks. My own guess is that further uses of QE would have a more muted effect on Treasury term premia. Financial markets are functioning much better in late 2010 than they were in early 2009. As a result, the relevant spreads are lower, and I suspect that it will be somewhat more challenging for the Fed to impact them.\nI’ve talked about three possible tools—lowering the IOER, strengthening the forward guidance in the FOMC statement, and quantitative easing. As I mentioned earlier, Chairman Bernanke observed in his August 27 speech that each of these tools has benefits and drawbacks that must be balanced against each other. With QE, I would say that the multiple novel effects make the calculus even more difficult than usual.\nSo, I’ve taken you through a typical FOMC meeting and the monetary policy situation in the United States. My discussion may have struck you as somewhat technical, and this is no accident. The FOMC meeting participants are a group of unabashed technocrats, seeking to solve an unabashedly technical problem: How do we manage monetary policy so as to ensure lower unemployment and maintain inflation at an appropriate rate? We certainly disagree with one another on occasion. But our disagreements ultimately stem from different assessments of the complicated economic situation and not from political differences.\nI believe that the apolitical nature of the FOMC’s work hinges critically on another aspect of central bank structure, and that has to do with the Federal Reserve’s relationship with the U.S. Congress. On the one hand, the Federal Reserve is a creation of Congress. It has the power to amend the Fed’s responsibilities, as the recent financial reform legislation certainly attests. The Senate approves the presidential appointments to the Board of Governors. Both chambers receive regular reports from the Board of Governors on the conduct of monetary policy, financial supervision, and the payments system. In addition, the Federal Reserve undergoes regular audits of its finances and various operations.\nOn the other hand, Congress has intentionally removed itself from the direct conduct of monetary policy by granting the Federal Reserve the independence to perform this function on its own. In effect, Congress has said that it does not want monetary policy unduly affected by political considerations. This independence is not only a hallmark of this country’s central bank, but is also a characteristic of developed economies worldwide.\nSo I’ve talked about a lot of issues today, and I could certainly talk about a lot more. But I have a feeling that you’ve got plenty of questions, and we are likely to hit on many key topics. So I will stop here and happily take your questions.\nThank you once again for this opportunity.\n1 For example, Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) prove that QE has no real or inflationary impact over forward guidance in their representative agent New Keynesian model. In their proof, they assume that taxes are not distorting.\nReferences\nEggertsson, Gauti B., and Michael Woodford. 2003. “The Zero Bound on Interest rates and Optimal Monetary Policy.” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity 1, 139–211.\nGagnon, Joseph, Matthew Raskin, Julie Remache, and Brian Sack. 2010. “Large-Scale Asset Purchases by the Federal Reserve: Did They Work?” Staff Report 441. Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nThanks for the generous introduction, Howard. I’m delighted to have this opportunity to speak with all of you today, and especially to make my first official visit to Fargo as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. Of course, as someone who grew up in Winnipeg, I am very familiar with Fargo and the Red River Valley. My family made many trips down here over the years. I found in Wikipedia that the West Acres Mall opened on August 2, 1972. I can’t remember for sure, but it’s certainly possible that we visited the mall on August 3!\n\nI’m especially pleased that one of the members of our Minneapolis Board of Directors, Howard Dahl, was here today to introduce me. As you just heard from Howard, he and other members of our board play an important role in the Federal Reserve System, as do members of our advisory councils on agriculture, and small business and labor. I won’t mention all the members of those groups, past and present, who are in attendance today, for the list is long, but I thank you for your service.\n\nAs Howard just mentioned, I became president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis last October. Here’s the start of a rather typical conversation that I would have had with my friends and relatives last fall. “Congratulations! That’s fantastic. Now, what is it that you will do exactly?”\n\nAs it turns out, the job has a lot of interesting aspects. But I think I’ve been invited to speak here today because I help formulate monetary policy for the United States. So what I plan to do is give you some feel for how this part of my job works. In doing so, I’ll highlight the Federal Reserve’s quintessentially American structure. Unlike the central banks of other countries, you’ll see that ours is specifically designed to draw upon the insights of small-town businesses, farmers and ranchers, and large manufacturers, among others, to formulate monetary policy. Before I proceed, I must remind you that any views I express here today are my own, and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWhat do I mean by an American structure? Well, relative to its counterparts around the world, the U.S. central bank is highly decentralized. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is one of 12 regional Reserve banks that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System. Our bank represents the ninth of the 12 Federal Reserve districts and includes Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, northwestern Wisconsin, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.\n\nEight times per year, the Federal Open Market Committee—the FOMC—meets to set the path of short-term interest rates over the next six to seven weeks. All 12 presidents of the various regional Federal Reserve banks—including me—and the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board contribute to these deliberations. (Actually, in the September meeting, there were only four governors. The good news is that we are back up to six governors, and the White House has nominated Peter Diamond—who just won the Nobel Prize in economics—for the remaining vacancy.) However, the committee itself consists only of the governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and a rotating group of four other presidents (currently Cleveland, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Boston). I’ll be on the committee in 2011.\n\nIn this way, the structure of the FOMC mirrors the federalist structure of our government. Representatives from different regions of the country—the various presidents—have input into FOMC deliberations. The input from the presidents relies critically on information they receive from their districts about local economic performance. We obtain this information through the work of our research staffs—but we also obtain it from business leaders in industries and towns, in my case, across the Upper Midwest. The Federal Reserve System is deliberately designed so that the residents of Main Street are able to have a voice in monetary policy.\n\nSo how exactly do the FOMC meetings work? In the remainder of my remarks, I’ll take you inside an FOMC meeting. Its structure provides a perfect vehicle to communicate the key considerations confronting monetary policymakers in the United States.\n\nThe typical FOMC meeting features two so-called go-rounds, in which every president and every governor has a chance to speak without interruption. The first go-round is referred to as the economics go-round. The meeting participants describe their views on current economic conditions and their outlook for future economic conditions. The presidents’ remarks will typically include references to their own local economies, as well as the national and global situation.\n\nAs part of my contributions to the economics go-round in the last couple of meetings, I discussed my outlook for GDP, inflation, and unemployment. In terms of GDP, I believe that a modest recovery is under way and is likely to continue. In terms of inflation, I expect a slight but welcome uptick over the next 18 months. Finally, in terms of unemployment, I see ongoing problems in labor markets.\n\nI’ll talk first about GDP. Real GDP growth has been positive in each of the past four quarters, and the government’s final estimate is 1.7 percent for the second quarter of this year. Based on forecasts from our Minneapolis model, I expect that GDP growth will be around 2.4 percent in the second half of 2010 and around 2.5 percent in 2011. Together over 2010 and 2011, I expect that GDP will grow around 2.5 percent per year. In contrast, in my first speech about seven months ago, I predicted that GDP would grow around 3.0 percent per year over 2010 and 2011. There is a recovery under way in the United States. But it is a distinctly modest one—and even more modest than I expected at the beginning of this year.\n\nLet me turn now to inflation. From the fourth quarter of 2009 through the second quarter of 2010, the change in the PCE price level was just over 0.5 percent, which works out to an annual rate of just over 1 percent. The Fed’s price stability mandate is generally interpreted as maintaining an inflation rate of 2 percent, and 1 percent inflation is often considered to be too low relative to this stricture. I expect inflation to remain at about this level during the rest of this year. However, our Minneapolis forecasting model predicts that it will rise back into the more desirable 1.5-2 percent range by the second half of 2011.\n\nSo the news about inflation and GDP is in the “OK, but certainly could be better” category. However, the lack of vitality in the U.S. labor market can only be termed disturbing. The national unemployment rate remained at 9.6 percent in September. Private sector job creation remains weak—only 64,000 net private sector jobs were created in September. I do not expect the unemployment rate to decline rapidly, and so I expect it to be above 8.0 percent well into 2012.\n\nIf one digs deeper into the data, the situation seems even more troubling. The National Bureau of Economic Research dates the end of the recession as having occurred in June 2009. Correspondingly, from June 2009 through August 2010, the demand for labor among employers seemed to rise modestly. Since December 2000, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has been keeping data on the job openings rate, which is defined as the number of job openings divided by the sum of job openings and employment. It has also been keeping track of the layoffs/discharges rate, which is the fraction of employed people who have been laid off or discharged in a given month. From June 2009 to August 2010, the job openings rate rose by 26 percent. Over the same period, the layoffs/discharges rate fell by nearly 18 percent.\n\nNonetheless, despite this apparent increase in the demand for labor from employers, the unemployment rate actually went up slightly from June 2009 to August 2010, from 9.5 percent to 9.6 percent. And other measures of labor market performance actually tell an even bleaker story. From June 2009 to August 2010, the employment/population ratio fell from 59.4 percent to 58.5 percent. At the same time, the seasonally adjusted labor force participation rate fell from 65.7 percent to 64.7 percent.\n\nThat was essentially my input into the economics go-round of the FOMC at the last two meetings. GDP is growing, but more slowly than we would like. Inflation is a little low, but only temporarily. The failure of unemployment—and the labor market more generally—to respond to the modest increase in labor demand is deeply troubling.\n\nAfter the economics go-round, the FOMC meeting then transitions to its second phase, the policy go-round. Again, the meeting participants have a chance to speak in turn about what they perceived to be the appropriate policy choices for the committee. We all are committed to achieving the Fed’s dual mandate to attain both price stability and maximum employment. The former objective is generally understood as keeping inflation in a tight range around 2 percent. The second part of the mandate is much more of a moving target. Employment is shaped by many determinants beyond the Fed’s control: demographics, social custom, taxes, and so on. The Fed’s job is to keep employment as high as possible, given these other factors.\n\nCurrently, the FOMC has two quite distinct tools: short-term interest rates and balance sheet management. In terms of the former, the FOMC has set its target range for the fed funds rate at between 0 and 25 basis points. It has committed to keeping the rate in that range for “an extended period,” contingent on economic conditions being appropriate. The FOMC is also maintaining a portfolio of roughly $2.3 trillion. Over 2 trillion of those dollars are invested in Treasury securities or government-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and other government-sponsored enterprises.\n\nIn his address at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s annual policy forum in August, Chairman Bernanke described three ways to use these tools if the FOMC chooses to provide further stimulus.

As Chairman Bernanke indicated, using these tools does not come without costs, and due consideration must be made of both costs and benefits. Along those lines, I will discuss my thoughts on how these tools impact the economy.

I’m delighted to have this opportunity to speak with all of you today, and especially to make my first official visit to Fargo as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. Of course, as someone who grew up in Winnipeg, I am very familiar with Fargo and the Red River Valley. My family made many trips down here over the years. I found in Wikipedia that the West Acres Mall opened on August 2, 1972. I can’t remember for sure, but it’s certainly possible that we visited the mall on August 3!\nI’m especially pleased that one of the members of our Minneapolis Board of Directors, Howard Dahl, was here today to introduce me. As you just heard from Howard, he and other members of our board play an important role in the Federal Reserve System, as do members of our advisory councils on agriculture, and small business and labor. I won’t mention all the members of those groups, past and present, who are in attendance today, for the list is long, but I thank you for your service.\nAs Howard just mentioned, I became president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis last October. Here’s the start of a rather typical conversation that I would have had with my friends and relatives last fall. “Congratulations! That’s fantastic. Now, what is it that you will do exactly?”\nAs it turns out, the job has a lot of interesting aspects. But I think I’ve been invited to speak here today because I help formulate monetary policy for the United States. So what I plan to do is give you some feel for how this part of my job works. In doing so, I’ll highlight the Federal Reserve’s quintessentially American structure. Unlike the central banks of other countries, you’ll see that ours is specifically designed to draw upon the insights of small-town businesses, farmers and ranchers, and large manufacturers, among others, to formulate monetary policy. Before I proceed, I must remind you that any views I express here today are my own, and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\nWhat do I mean by an American structure? Well, relative to its counterparts around the world, the U.S. central bank is highly decentralized. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is one of 12 regional Reserve banks that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System. Our bank represents the ninth of the 12 Federal Reserve districts and includes Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, northwestern Wisconsin, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.\nEight times per year, the Federal Open Market Committee—the FOMC—meets to set the path of short-term interest rates over the next six to seven weeks. All 12 presidents of the various regional Federal Reserve banks—including me—and the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board contribute to these deliberations. (Actually, in the September meeting, there were only four governors. The good news is that we are back up to six governors, and the White House has nominated Peter Diamond—who just won the Nobel Prize in economics—for the remaining vacancy.) However, the committee itself consists only of the governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and a rotating group of four other presidents (currently Cleveland, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Boston). I’ll be on the committee in 2011.\nIn this way, the structure of the FOMC mirrors the federalist structure of our government. Representatives from different regions of the country—the various presidents—have input into FOMC deliberations. The input from the presidents relies critically on information they receive from their districts about local economic performance. We obtain this information through the work of our research staffs—but we also obtain it from business leaders in industries and towns, in my case, across the Upper Midwest. The Federal Reserve System is deliberately designed so that the residents of Main Street are able to have a voice in monetary policy.\nSo how exactly do the FOMC meetings work? In the remainder of my remarks, I’ll take you inside an FOMC meeting. Its structure provides a perfect vehicle to communicate the key considerations confronting monetary policymakers in the United States.\nThe typical FOMC meeting features two so-called go-rounds, in which every president and every governor has a chance to speak without interruption. The first go-round is referred to as the economics go-round. The meeting participants describe their views on current economic conditions and their outlook for future economic conditions. The presidents’ remarks will typically include references to their own local economies, as well as the national and global situation.\nAs part of my contributions to the economics go-round in the last couple of meetings, I discussed my outlook for GDP, inflation, and unemployment. In terms of GDP, I believe that a modest recovery is under way and is likely to continue. In terms of inflation, I expect a slight but welcome uptick over the next 18 months. Finally, in terms of unemployment, I see ongoing problems in labor markets.\nI’ll talk first about GDP. Real GDP growth has been positive in each of the past four quarters, and the government’s final estimate is 1.7 percent for the second quarter of this year. Based on forecasts from our Minneapolis model, I expect that GDP growth will be around 2.4 percent in the second half of 2010 and around 2.5 percent in 2011. Together over 2010 and 2011, I expect that GDP will grow around 2.5 percent per year. In contrast, in my first speech about seven months ago, I predicted that GDP would grow around 3.0 percent per year over 2010 and 2011. There is a recovery under way in the United States. But it is a distinctly modest one—and even more modest than I expected at the beginning of this year.\nLet me turn now to inflation. From the fourth quarter of 2009 through the second quarter of 2010, the change in the PCE price level was just over 0.5 percent, which works out to an annual rate of just over 1 percent. The Fed’s price stability mandate is generally interpreted as maintaining an inflation rate of 2 percent, and 1 percent inflation is often considered to be too low relative to this stricture. I expect inflation to remain at about this level during the rest of this year. However, our Minneapolis forecasting model predicts that it will rise back into the more desirable 1.5-2 percent range by the second half of 2011.\nSo the news about inflation and GDP is in the “OK, but certainly could be better” category. However, the lack of vitality in the U.S. labor market can only be termed disturbing. The national unemployment rate remained at 9.6 percent in September. Private sector job creation remains weak—only 64,000 net private sector jobs were created in September. I do not expect the unemployment rate to decline rapidly, and so I expect it to be above 8.0 percent well into 2012.\nIf one digs deeper into the data, the situation seems even more troubling. The National Bureau of Economic Research dates the end of the recession as having occurred in June 2009. Correspondingly, from June 2009 through August 2010, the demand for labor among employers seemed to rise modestly. Since December 2000, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has been keeping data on the job openings rate, which is defined as the number of job openings divided by the sum of job openings and employment. It has also been keeping track of the layoffs/discharges rate, which is the fraction of employed people who have been laid off or discharged in a given month. From June 2009 to August 2010, the job openings rate rose by 26 percent. Over the same period, the layoffs/discharges rate fell by nearly 18 percent.\nNonetheless, despite this apparent increase in the demand for labor from employers, the unemployment rate actually went up slightly from June 2009 to August 2010, from 9.5 percent to 9.6 percent. And other measures of labor market performance actually tell an even bleaker story. From June 2009 to August 2010, the employment/population ratio fell from 59.4 percent to 58.5 percent. At the same time, the seasonally adjusted labor force participation rate fell from 65.7 percent to 64.7 percent.\nThat was essentially my input into the economics go-round of the FOMC at the last two meetings. GDP is growing, but more slowly than we would like. Inflation is a little low, but only temporarily. The failure of unemployment—and the labor market more generally—to respond to the modest increase in labor demand is deeply troubling.\nAfter the economics go-round, the FOMC meeting then transitions to its second phase, the policy go-round. Again, the meeting participants have a chance to speak in turn about what they perceived to be the appropriate policy choices for the committee. We all are committed to achieving the Fed’s dual mandate to attain both price stability and maximum employment. The former objective is generally understood as keeping inflation in a tight range around 2 percent. The second part of the mandate is much more of a moving target. Employment is shaped by many determinants beyond the Fed’s control: demographics, social custom, taxes, and so on. The Fed’s job is to keep employment as high as possible, given these other factors.\nCurrently, the FOMC has two quite distinct tools: short-term interest rates and balance sheet management. In terms of the former, the FOMC has set its target range for the fed funds rate at between 0 and 25 basis points. It has committed to keeping the rate in that range for “an extended period,” contingent on economic conditions being appropriate. The FOMC is also maintaining a portfolio of roughly $2.3 trillion. Over 2 trillion of those dollars are invested in Treasury securities or government-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and other government-sponsored enterprises.\nIn his address at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s annual policy forum in August, Chairman Bernanke described three ways to use these tools if the FOMC chooses to provide further stimulus. The first is to buy more long-term securities. The second is to offer more forward guidance in the FOMC statement. The third is to reduce the interest on excess reserves (IOER) by 15 or even 25 basis points. As Chairman Bernanke indicated, using these tools does not come without costs, and due consideration must be made of both costs and benefits. Along those lines, I will discuss my thoughts on how these tools impact the economy. Again, I must underscore that my thoughts are my own and do not represent the views of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nLet me talk first about forward guidance. In part, firms make their decisions about capital expenditures and hiring by comparing the returns to those internal projects to the inflation-adjusted yields available in financial markets for investments of similar horizon. Thus, the real yields on medium-term and long-term government bonds matter for firm investment decisions. Those yields are, in part, shaped by current expectations of future short-term interest rates. The current FOMC statement shapes those expectations by providing forward guidance about its future plans for the behavior of the fed funds target.\nRight now, the FOMC states that it will keep the fed funds target range exceptionally low for as long as economic conditions warrant. The statement also predicts that exceptionally low fed funds rates are likely to be warranted for an “extended period” of time. In this way, the statement influences current expectations of future short-term rates and thereby shapes current medium- and long-term interest rates. The FOMC could provide stimulus by saying that it predicts that low rates are likely to be warranted for an even longer period of time than an “extended period.” This kind of stronger language should lead to a decline in medium-term and long-term interest rates.\nI view lowering the IOER as another form of forward guidance. I think that it is unlikely that lowering the IOER by 15 or 25 basis points will have much direct effect on loan markets. However, it is likely that investors would view this move as a signal that the FOMC is planning to keep its target rate even lower for an even longer period of time. In that way, lowering the IOER would serve to lower medium-term and long-term interest rates.\nSo, the FOMC can influence the economy through various forms of forward guidance about how long it plans for the fed funds rate to be so low. However, the FOMC has another tool at its disposal: what is often termed quantitative easing—QE for short. Under quantitative easing, the FOMC buys long-term securities in the open market. In exchange for those securities, it credits the sellers’ accounts at the Fed with more reserves. The upshot is that there are fewer long-term securities being held by private investors, and banks hold more reserves.\nJust to be clear on one point: The FOMC is only authorized by Congress to buy a limited set of securities. Ideas like “the FOMC should buy corporate bonds” would require a change to the Federal Reserve Act—a change that I for one would view as undesirable. In meetings earlier this year, FOMC participants indicated their strong preference to return to an all-Treasury portfolio. So, I’ll proceed in this speech under the presumption is that any new purchases would take the form of long-term Treasuries. But, as I’ll discuss, the idea behind QE is that the yields on those long-term Treasuries will affect yields on all long-term securities.\nI see QE as affecting the economy in four main ways. I’ll first discuss them from a theoretical perspective and then discuss what’s known about these effects empirically.\nThe first effect of QE is that it represents another form of forward guidance about the path of the fed funds rate. It is a way for the FOMC to signal—in a perhaps more striking way—that it plans to keep the fed funds rate low for an even longer time to come.\nSecond, QE creates more reserves in banks’ accounts with the Fed. The standard intuition is that this kind of reserve creation is inflationary. Banks can only offer checkable deposits in proportion to their reserves. Economists view checkable deposits as a form of money because, like cash, checkable deposits make many transactions easier. In this sense, bank reserves held with the Fed are licenses for banks to create a certain amount of money. By giving out more licenses, the FOMC is allowing banks to create more money. More money chasing the same amount of goods—voila, inflation.\nThis basic logic isn’t valid in current circumstances, because reserves are paying interest equal to comparable market interest rates. Banks have nearly $1 trillion of excess reserves. This means that they are not using a lot of their existing licenses to create money. QE gives them new licenses to create money, but I do not see why they would suddenly start to use the new ones if they weren’t using the old ones. With that said, I have indicated in earlier speeches that $1 trillion of excess reserves does create a potential for high inflation at some point in the future if the FOMC does not react sufficiently fast when it starts to see inflationary pressures. But I do not see this risk as being heightened in any meaningful way by banks holding even more excess reserves than what they are holding today.\nThe third effect of QE is the one that is usually stressed: It reduces the exposure of the private sector to interest rate risk. The holder of a long-term Treasury is exposed to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the price of the bond falls, and the bondholder is less wealthy. Now think about an example of QE in which the Fed buys $1 billion of 10-year Treasuries. On the margin, the bond portfolio of the private sector is now less exposed to interest rate risk. As a consequence, private investors will demand a lower premium for holding other bonds that are exposed to interest rate risk. All long-term yields fall, and so firms should be more willing to undertake long-term capital expansions or hire permanent employees.\nThe fourth effect of QE is less widely discussed. The Fed cannot literally eliminate the exposure of the economy to the risk of fluctuations in the real interest rate. It can only shift that risk among people in the economy. So, where did that risk go when the Fed bought the long-term bond? The answer is to taxpayers.\nTo see this more clearly, suppose hypothetically that the Treasury wants to borrow $1 billion today and is choosing between two ways of doing so. One way is to issue a 20-year, zero-coupon, inflation-indexed bond. The bond requires the Treasury to repay $1.5 billion in real terms in 20 years (roughly a 2 percent real yield). Under this plan, taxpayers face no tax risk, but the buyers of the bond can lose a lot if real interest rates rise greatly. The other way is to issue $1 billion of one-year indexed bonds and then keep rolling over that debt for 20 years. Now, taxpayers have to repay a lot more than $1.5 billion in 20 years if short-term real interest rates end up being high.\nBasically, if the government uses short-term debt, it exposes taxpayers to interest rate risk. If it uses long-term government debt, it exposes the bondholders to interest rate risk. QE is a special case of this general principle: When the Fed buys long-term government debt from the private market, it shifts interest rate risk from bondholders to taxpayers.\nWhat is the ultimate impact on the overall economy of this shift in risk? In the baseline models used by central banks, all bondholders are taxpayers. In these models, QE is essentially shifting risk from one pocket to another. As a result, the increase in tax risk (what I’m calling the fourth effect of QE) completely undoes the decrease in interest rate risk (the third effect of QE). QE ends up having no effects, except for those associated with any new forward guidance that it signals.1\nQE will have nontrivial effects over forward guidance in the context of a more realistic model in which people differ from one another in some relevant way. Along those lines, we might think that some people are active participants in the Treasury markets. Others are not. Then, if the Fed buys long-term Treasuries, it takes risk from the former group and imposes it on the second group. The ultimate macroeconomic impact of QE depends on the extent to which the extra tax risk deters economic activity on the part of this second group. We know little about this effect, either theoretically or empirically.\nTo this stage, my discussion of QE has been purely theoretical in nature. The Fed engaged in QE from January 2009 through March 2010 by buying over $1.5 trillion worth of agency debt, agency mortgage-backed securities, and Treasuries. How did this operation—termed the Large-Scale Asset Purchase, or LSAP program—affect the economy? We don’t know as much as we would like as yet. However, I think that the best empirical work on the question of how the LSAP affected long-term Treasury yields has been done by Gagnon, Raskin, Remache, and Sack (2010). The paper is a thorough investigation of this key issue. My conclusion from their work is that the LSAP reduced the term premium on 10-year Treasury bonds relative to 2-year Treasury bonds by about 40-80 basis points (on an annualized basis). (The term premium is a measure of the difference in yields that is not explained by the expected path of short-term interest rates.) This fall in term premia led to a slightly smaller fall in the term premia of corporate bonds.\nThese estimates are extremely useful benchmarks. My own guess is that further uses of QE would have a more muted effect on Treasury term premia. Financial markets are functioning much better in late 2010 than they were in early 2009. As a result, the relevant spreads are lower, and I suspect that it will be somewhat more challenging for the Fed to impact them.\nI’ve talked about three possible tools—lowering the IOER, strengthening the forward guidance in the FOMC statement, and quantitative easing. As I mentioned earlier, Chairman Bernanke observed in his August 27 speech that each of these tools has benefits and drawbacks that must be balanced against each other. With QE, I would say that the multiple novel effects make the calculus even more difficult than usual.\nSo, I’ve taken you through a typical FOMC meeting and the monetary policy situation in the United States. My discussion may have struck you as somewhat technical, and this is no accident. The FOMC meeting participants are a group of unabashed technocrats, seeking to solve an unabashedly technical problem: How do we manage monetary policy so as to ensure lower unemployment and maintain inflation at an appropriate rate? We certainly disagree with one another on occasion. But our disagreements ultimately stem from different assessments of the complicated economic situation and not from political differences.\nI believe that the apolitical nature of the FOMC’s work hinges critically on another aspect of central bank structure, and that has to do with the Federal Reserve’s relationship with the U.S. Congress. On the one hand, the Federal Reserve is a creation of Congress. It has the power to amend the Fed’s responsibilities, as the recent financial reform legislation certainly attests. The Senate approves the presidential appointments to the Board of Governors. Both chambers receive regular reports from the Board of Governors on the conduct of monetary policy, financial supervision, and the payments system. In addition, the Federal Reserve undergoes regular audits of its finances and various operations.\nOn the other hand, Congress has intentionally removed itself from the direct conduct of monetary policy by granting the Federal Reserve the independence to perform this function on its own. In effect, Congress has said that it does not want monetary policy unduly affected by political considerations. This independence is not only a hallmark of this country’s central bank, but is also a characteristic of developed economies worldwide.\nSo I’ve talked about a lot of issues today, and I could certainly talk about a lot more. But I have a feeling that you’ve got plenty of questions, and we are likely to hit on many key topics. So I will stop here and happily take your questions.\nThank you once again for this opportunity.\n1 For example, Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) prove that QE has no real or inflationary impact over forward guidance in their representative agent New Keynesian model. In their proof, they assume that taxes are not distorting.\nReferences\nEggertsson, Gauti B., and Michael Woodford. 2003. “The Zero Bound on Interest rates and Optimal Monetary Policy.” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity 1, 139–211.\nGagnon, Joseph, Matthew Raskin, Julie Remache, and Brian Sack. 2010. “Large-Scale Asset Purchases by the Federal Reserve: Did They Work?” Staff Report 441.

Thus, the real yields on medium-term and long-term government bonds matter for firm investment decisions. Those yields are, in part, shaped by current expectations of future short-term interest rates. The current FOMC statement shapes those expectations by providing forward guidance about its future plans for the behavior of the fed funds target.\n\nRight now, the FOMC states that it will keep the fed funds target range exceptionally low for as long as economic conditions warrant. The statement also predicts that exceptionally low fed funds rates are likely to be warranted for an “extended period” of time. In this way, the statement influences current expectations of future short-term rates and thereby shapes current medium- and long-term interest rates. The FOMC could provide stimulus by saying that it predicts that low rates are likely to be warranted for an even longer period of time than an “extended period.” This kind of stronger language should lead to a decline in medium-term and long-term interest rates.\n\nI view lowering the IOER as another form of forward guidance. I think that it is unlikely that lowering the IOER by 15 or 25 basis points will have much direct effect on loan markets. However, it is likely that investors would view this move as a signal that the FOMC is planning to keep its target rate even lower for an even longer period of time. In that way, lowering the IOER would serve to lower medium-term and long-term interest rates.\n\nSo, the FOMC can influence the economy through various forms of forward guidance about how long it plans for the fed funds rate to be so low. However, the FOMC has another tool at its disposal: what is often termed quantitative easing—QE for short. Under quantitative easing, the FOMC buys long-term securities in the open market. In exchange for those securities, it credits the sellers’ accounts at the Fed with more reserves. The upshot is that there are fewer long-term securities being held by private investors, and banks hold more reserves.\n\nJust to be clear on one point: The FOMC is only authorized by Congress to buy a limited set of securities. Ideas like “the FOMC should buy corporate bonds” would require a change to the Federal Reserve Act—a change that I for one would view as undesirable. In meetings earlier this year, FOMC participants indicated their strong preference to return to an all-Treasury portfolio. So, I’ll proceed in this speech under the presumption is that any new purchases would take the form of long-term Treasuries. But, as I’ll discuss, the idea behind QE is that the yields on those long-term Treasuries will affect yields on all long-term securities.\n\nI see QE as affecting the economy in four main ways. I’ll first discuss them from a theoretical perspective and then discuss what’s known about these effects empirically.\n\nThe first effect of QE is that it represents another form of forward guidance about the path of the fed funds rate. It is a way for the FOMC to signal—in a perhaps more striking way—that it plans to keep the fed funds rate low for an even longer time to come.\n\nSecond, QE creates more reserves in banks’ accounts with the Fed. The standard intuition is that this kind of reserve creation is inflationary. Banks can only offer checkable deposits in proportion to their reserves. Economists view checkable deposits as a form of money because, like cash, checkable deposits make many transactions easier. In this sense, bank reserves held with the Fed are licenses for banks to create a certain amount of money. By giving out more licenses, the FOMC is allowing banks to create more money. More money chasing the same amount of goods—voila, inflation.\n\nThis basic logic isn’t valid in current circumstances, because reserves are paying interest equal to comparable market interest rates. Banks have nearly $1 trillion of excess reserves. This means that they are not using a lot of their existing licenses to create money. QE gives them new licenses to create money, but I do not see why they would suddenly start to use the new ones if they weren’t using the old ones. With that said, I have indicated in earlier speeches that $1 trillion of excess reserves does create a potential for high inflation at some point in the future if the FOMC does not react sufficiently fast when it starts to see inflationary pressures. But I do not see this risk as being heightened in any meaningful way by banks holding even more excess reserves than what they are holding today.\n\nThe third effect of QE is the one that is usually stressed: It reduces the exposure of the private sector to interest rate risk. The holder of a long-term Treasury is exposed to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the price of the bond falls, and the bondholder is less wealthy. Now think about an example of QE in which the Fed buys $1 billion of 10-year Treasuries. On the margin, the bond portfolio of the private sector is now less exposed to interest rate risk. As a consequence, private investors will demand a lower premium for holding other bonds that are exposed to interest rate risk. All long-term yields fall, and so firms should be more willing to undertake long-term capital expansions or hire permanent employees.\n\nThe fourth effect of QE is less widely discussed. The Fed cannot literally eliminate the exposure of the economy to the risk of fluctuations in the real interest rate. It can only shift that risk among people in the economy. So, where did that risk go when the Fed bought the long-term bond? The answer is to taxpayers.\n\nTo see this more clearly, suppose hypothetically that the Treasury wants to borrow $1 billion today and is choosing between two ways of doing so. One way is to issue a 20-year, zero-coupon, inflation-indexed bond. The bond requires the Treasury to repay $1.5 billion in real terms in 20 years (roughly a 2 percent real yield). Under this plan, taxpayers face no tax risk, but the buyers of the bond can lose a lot if real interest rates rise greatly. The other way is to issue $1 billion of one-year indexed bonds and then keep rolling over that debt for 20 years. Now, taxpayers have to repay a lot more than $1.5 billion in 20 years if short-term real interest rates end up being high.\n\nBasically, if the government uses short-term debt, it exposes taxpayers to interest rate risk. If it uses long-term government debt, it exposes the bondholders to interest rate risk. QE is a special case of this general principle: When the Fed buys long-term government debt from the private market, it shifts interest rate risk from bondholders to taxpayers.\n\nWhat is the ultimate impact on the overall economy of this shift in risk? In the baseline models used by central banks, all bondholders are taxpayers. In these models, QE is essentially shifting risk from one pocket to another. As a result, the increase in tax risk (what I’m calling the fourth effect of QE) completely undoes the decrease in interest rate risk (the third effect of QE). QE ends up having no effects, except for those associated with any new forward guidance that it signals.1\n\nQE will have nontrivial effects over forward guidance in the context of a more realistic model in which people differ from one another in some relevant way. Along those lines, we might think that some people are active participants in the Treasury markets. Others are not. Then, if the Fed buys long-term Treasuries, it takes risk from the former group and imposes it on the second group. The ultimate macroeconomic impact of QE depends on the extent to which the extra tax risk deters economic activity on the part of this second group. We know little about this effect, either theoretically or empirically.\n\nTo this stage, my discussion of QE has been purely theoretical in nature. The Fed engaged in QE from January 2009 through March 2010 by buying over $1.5 trillion worth of agency debt, agency mortgage-backed securities, and Treasuries. How did this operation—termed the Large-Scale Asset Purchase, or LSAP program—affect the economy? We don’t know as much as we would like as yet. However, I think that the best empirical work on the question of how the LSAP affected long-term Treasury yields has been done by Gagnon, Raskin, Remache, and Sack (2010). The paper is a thorough investigation of this key issue. My conclusion from their work is that the LSAP reduced the term premium on 10-year Treasury bonds relative to 2-year Treasury bonds by about 40-80 basis points (on an annualized basis). (The term premium is a measure of the difference in yields that is not explained by the expected path of short-term interest rates.) This fall in term premia led to a slightly smaller fall in the term premia of corporate bonds.\n\nThese estimates are extremely useful benchmarks. My own guess is that further uses of QE would have a more muted effect on Treasury term premia. Financial markets are functioning much better in late 2010 than they were in early 2009. As a result, the relevant spreads are lower, and I suspect that it will be somewhat more challenging for the Fed to impact them.\n\nI’ve talked about three possible tools—lowering the IOER, strengthening the forward guidance in the FOMC statement, and quantitative easing. As I mentioned earlier, Chairman Bernanke observed in his August 27 speech that each of these tools has benefits and drawbacks that must be balanced against each other. With QE, I would say that the multiple novel effects make the calculus even more difficult than usual.\n\nSo, I’ve taken you through a typical FOMC meeting and the monetary policy situation in the United States. My discussion may have struck you as somewhat technical, and this is no accident. The FOMC meeting participants are a group of unabashed technocrats, seeking to solve an unabashedly technical problem: How do we manage monetary policy so as to ensure lower unemployment and maintain inflation at an appropriate rate? We certainly disagree with one another on occasion. But our disagreements ultimately stem from different assessments of the complicated economic situation and not from political differences.\n\nI believe that the apolitical nature of the FOMC’s work hinges critically on another aspect of central bank structure, and that has to do with the Federal Reserve’s relationship with the U.S. Congress. On the one hand, the Federal Reserve is a creation of Congress. It has the power to amend the Fed’s responsibilities, as the recent financial reform legislation certainly attests. The Senate approves the presidential appointments to the Board of Governors. Both chambers receive regular reports from the Board of Governors on the conduct of monetary policy, financial supervision, and the payments system. In addition, the Federal Reserve undergoes regular audits of its finances and various operations.\n\nOn the other hand, Congress has intentionally removed itself from the direct conduct of monetary policy by granting the Federal Reserve the independence to perform this function on its own. In effect, Congress has said that it does not want monetary policy unduly affected by political considerations. This independence is not only a hallmark of this country’s central bank, but is also a characteristic of developed economies worldwide.\n\nSo I’ve talked about a lot of issues today, and I could certainly talk about a lot more. But I have a feeling that you’ve got plenty of questions, and we are likely to hit on many key topics. So I will stop here and happily take your questions.\n\nThank you once again for this opportunity.\n\nEggertsson, Gauti B., and Michael Woodford. 2003. “The Zero Bound on Interest rates and Optimal Monetary Policy.” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity 1, 139–211.\n\nGagnon, Joseph, Matthew Raskin, Julie Remache, and Brian Sack. 2010. “Large-Scale Asset Purchases by the Federal Reserve: Did They Work?” Staff Report 441.

        "content": "Thank you for the generous introduction. I’m delighted to have this opportunity to speak with you today, especially on this special occasion—the 25th anniversary of the UMACHA conference. So let me begin by congratulating all of you on the longevity of this important event, and also on its success. It goes without saying that there have been many changes in the payments industry over the last quarter century, and likewise many challenges. I am certain that having a venue like this to come together and learn has greatly benefited the industry, and I am proud of the role that we have played at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis to make this event happen.\nMost people probably don’t realize the extent to which the Federal Reserve is active in the payments system. For example, as you just heard, I became president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis last October. Here’s the start of a rather typical conversation that I would have had with my friends and relatives last fall. “Congratulations! That’s fantastic. Now, what is it that you will do exactly?” They were delighted when I began telling them about FedACH.\nBut I don’t think I’ve been invited here today because of my expertise in matters relating to RDFI ACH audit requirements. Rather, I think I’m here because I help formulate monetary policy for the United States. So what I plan to do is give you some feel for how this part of my job works. In doing so, I’ll highlight the Federal Reserve’s quintessentially American structure. Unlike the central banks of other countries, you’ll see that ours is specifically designed to draw upon the insights of small-town businesses, farmers and ranchers, and large manufacturers, among others, to formulate monetary policy. Before I proceed, I must remind you that any views I express here today are my own, and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\nWhat do I mean by an American structure? Well, relative to its counterparts around the world, the U.S. central bank is highly decentralized. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is one of 12 regional Reserve banks that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System. Our bank represents the ninth of the 12 Federal Reserve districts and includes Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, northwestern Wisconsin, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.\nEight times per year, the Federal Open Market Committee—the FOMC—meets to set the path of short-term interest rates over the next six to seven weeks. All 12 presidents of the various regional Federal Reserve banks—including me—and the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board contribute to these deliberations. (Actually, in the September meeting, there were only four governors. The good news is that we are back up to six governors, and the White House has nominated Peter Diamond—who just won the Nobel Prize in economics—for the remaining vacancy.) However, the committee itself consists only of the governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and a rotating group of four other presidents (currently Cleveland, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Boston). I’ll be on the committee in 2011.\nIn this way, the structure of the FOMC mirrors the federalist structure of our government. Representatives from different regions of the country—the various presidents—have input into FOMC deliberations. The input from the presidents relies critically on information they receive from their districts about local economic performance. We obtain this information through the work of our research staffs—but we also obtain it from business leaders in industries and towns, in my case, across the Upper Midwest. The Federal Reserve System is deliberately designed so that the residents of Main Street are able to have a voice in monetary policy.\nSo how, exactly, do the FOMC meetings work? In the remainder of my remarks, I’ll take you inside an FOMC meeting. Its structure provides a perfect vehicle to communicate the key considerations confronting monetary policymakers in the United States.\nThe typical FOMC meeting features two so-called go-rounds, in which every president and every governor has a chance to speak without interruption. The first go-round is referred to as the economics go-round. The meeting participants describe their views on current economic conditions and their outlook for future economic conditions. The presidents’ remarks will typically include references to their own local economies, as well as the national and global situation.\nAs part of my contributions to the economics go-round in the last couple of meetings, I discussed my outlook for GDP, inflation, and unemployment. In terms of GDP, I believe that a modest recovery is under way and is likely to continue. In terms of inflation, I expect a slight but welcome uptick over the next 18 months. Finally, in terms of unemployment, I see ongoing problems in labor markets.\nI’ll talk first about GDP. Real GDP growth has been positive in each of the past four quarters, and the government’s final estimate is 1.7 percent for the second quarter of this year. Based on forecasts from our Minneapolis model, I expect that GDP growth will be around 2.4 percent in the second half of 2010 and around 2.5 percent in 2011. Together over 2010 and 2011, I expect that GDP will grow around 2.5 percent per year. In contrast, in my first speech about seven months ago, I predicted that GDP would grow around 3.0 percent per year over 2010 and 2011. There is a recovery under way in the United States. But it is a distinctly modest one—and even more modest than I expected at the beginning of this year.\nLet me turn now to inflation. From the fourth quarter of 2009 through the second quarter of 2010, the change in the PCE price level was just over 0.5 percent, which works out to an annual rate of just over 1 percent. The Fed’s price stability mandate is generally interpreted as maintaining an inflation rate of 2 percent, and 1 percent inflation is often considered to be too low relative to this stricture. I expect inflation to remain at about this level during the rest of this year. However, our Minneapolis forecasting model predicts that it will rise back into the more desirable 1.5-2 percent range in the second half of 2011.\nSo the news about inflation and GDP is in the “OK, but certainly could be better” category. However, the lack of vitality in the U.S. labor market can only be termed disturbing. The national unemployment rate remained at 9.6 percent in September. Private sector job creation remains weak—only 64,000 net private sector jobs were created in September. I do not expect the unemployment rate to decline rapidly, and so I expect it to be above 8.0 percent well into 2012.\nIf one digs deeper into the data, the situation seems even more troubling. The National Bureau of Economic Research dates the end of the recession as having occurred in June 2009. Correspondingly, from June 2009 through August 2010, the demand for labor among employers seemed to rise modestly. Since December 2000, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has been keeping data on the job openings rate, which is defined as the number of job openings divided by the sum of job openings and employment. It has also been keeping track of the layoffs/discharges rate, which is the fraction of employed people who have been laid off or discharged in a given month. From June 2009 to August 2010, the job openings rate rose by 26 percent. Over the same period, the layoffs/discharges rate fell by nearly 18 percent.\nNonetheless, despite this apparent increase in the demand for labor from employers, the unemployment rate actually went up slightly from June 2009 to August 2010, from 9.5 percent to 9.6 percent. And other measures of labor market performance actually tell an even bleaker story. From June 2009 to August 2010, the employment/population ratio fell from 59.4 percent to 58.5 percent. At the same time, the seasonally adjusted labor force participation rate fell from 65.7 percent to 64.7 percent.\nThat was essentially my input into the economics go-round of the FOMC at the last two meetings. GDP is growing, but more slowly than we would like. Inflation is a little low, but only temporarily. The failure of unemployment—and the labor market more generally—to respond to the modest increase in labor demand is deeply troubling.\nAfter the economics go-round, the FOMC meeting then transitions to its second phase, the policy go-round. Again, the meeting participants have a chance to speak in turn about what they perceive to be the appropriate policy choices for the committee. We all are committed to achieving the Fed’s dual mandate to attain both price stability and maximum employment. The former objective is generally understood as keeping inflation in a tight range around 2 percent. The second part of the mandate is much more of a moving target. Employment is shaped by many determinants beyond the Fed’s control: demographics, social custom, taxes, and so on. The Fed’s job is to keep employment as high as possible, given these other factors.\nCurrently, the FOMC has two quite distinct tools: short-term interest rates and balance sheet management. In terms of the former, the FOMC has set its target range for the fed funds rate at between 0 and 25 basis points. It has committed to keeping the rate in that range for “an extended period,” contingent on economic conditions being appropriate. The FOMC is also maintaining a portfolio of roughly $2.3 trillion. Over 2 trillion of those dollars are invested in Treasury securities or government-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and other government-sponsored enterprises.\nIn his address at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s annual policy forum in August, Chairman Bernanke described three ways to use these tools if the FOMC chooses to provide further stimulus. The first is to buy more long-term securities. The second is to offer more forward guidance in the FOMC statement. The third is to reduce the interest on excess reserves (IOER) by 15 or even 25 basis points. As Chairman Bernanke indicated, using these tools does not come without costs, and due consideration must be made of both costs and benefits. Along those lines, I will discuss my thoughts on how these tools impact the economy. Again, I must underscore that my thoughts are my own and do not represent the views of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nLet me talk first about forward guidance. In part, firms make their decisions about capital expenditures and hiring by comparing the returns to those internal projects to the inflation-adjusted yields available in financial markets for investments of similar horizon. Thus, the real yields on medium-term and long-term government bonds matter for firm investment decisions. Those yields are, in part, shaped by current expectations of future short-term interest rates. The current FOMC statement shapes those expectations by providing forward guidance about its future plans for the behavior of the fed funds target.\nRight now, the FOMC states that it will keep the fed funds target range exceptionally low for as long as economic conditions warrant. The statement also predicts that exceptionally low fed funds rates are likely to be warranted for an “extended period” of time. In this way, the statement influences current expectations of future short-term rates and thereby shapes current medium- and long-term interest rates. The FOMC could provide stimulus by saying that it predicts that low rates are likely to be warranted for an even longer period of time than an “extended period.” This kind of stronger language should lead to a decline in medium-term and long-term interest rates.\nI view lowering the IOER as another form of forward guidance. I think that it is unlikely that lowering the IOER by 15 or 25 basis points will have much direct effect on loan markets. However, it is likely that investors would view this move as a signal that the FOMC is planning to keep its target rate even lower for an even longer period of time. In that way, lowering the IOER would serve to lower medium-term and long-term interest rates.\nSo, the FOMC can influence the economy through various forms of forward guidance about how long it plans for the fed funds rate to be so low.

So I will stop here and happily take your questions.\nThank you once again for this opportunity.\n1 For example, Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) prove that QE has no real or inflationary impact over forward guidance in their representative agent New Keynesian model.

Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nThank you for the generous introduction. I’m delighted to have this opportunity to speak with you today, especially on this special occasion—the 25th anniversary of the UMACHA conference. So let me begin by congratulating all of you on the longevity of this important event, and also on its success.

I am certain that having a venue like this to come together and learn has greatly benefited the industry, and I am proud of the role that we have played at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis to make this event happen.\n\nMost people probably don’t realize the extent to which the Federal Reserve is active in the payments system. For example, as you just heard, I became president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis last October. Here’s the start of a rather typical conversation that I would have had with my friends and relatives last fall. “Congratulations! That’s fantastic. Now, what is it that you will do exactly?” They were delighted when I began telling them about FedACH.\n\nBut I don’t think I’ve been invited here today because of my expertise in matters relating to RDFI ACH audit requirements. Rather, I think I’m here because I help formulate monetary policy for the United States. So what I plan to do is give you some feel for how this part of my job works. In doing so, I’ll highlight the Federal Reserve’s quintessentially American structure. Unlike the central banks of other countries, you’ll see that ours is specifically designed to draw upon the insights of small-town businesses, farmers and ranchers, and large manufacturers, among others, to formulate monetary policy. Before I proceed, I must remind you that any views I express here today are my own, and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWhat do I mean by an American structure? Well, relative to its counterparts around the world, the U.S. central bank is highly decentralized. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is one of 12 regional Reserve banks that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System. Our bank represents the ninth of the 12 Federal Reserve districts and includes Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, northwestern Wisconsin, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.\n\nEight times per year, the Federal Open Market Committee—the FOMC—meets to set the path of short-term interest rates over the next six to seven weeks. All 12 presidents of the various regional Federal Reserve banks—including me—and the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board contribute to these deliberations. (Actually, in the September meeting, there were only four governors. The good news is that we are back up to six governors, and the White House has nominated Peter Diamond—who just won the Nobel Prize in economics—for the remaining vacancy.) However, the committee itself consists only of the governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and a rotating group of four other presidents (currently Cleveland, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Boston). I’ll be on the committee in 2011.\n\nIn this way, the structure of the FOMC mirrors the federalist structure of our government. Representatives from different regions of the country—the various presidents—have input into FOMC deliberations. The input from the presidents relies critically on information they receive from their districts about local economic performance. We obtain this information through the work of our research staffs—but we also obtain it from business leaders in industries and towns, in my case, across the Upper Midwest. The Federal Reserve System is deliberately designed so that the residents of Main Street are able to have a voice in monetary policy.\n\nSo how, exactly, do the FOMC meetings work? In the remainder of my remarks, I’ll take you inside an FOMC meeting. Its structure provides a perfect vehicle to communicate the key considerations confronting monetary policymakers in the United States.\n\nThe typical FOMC meeting features two so-called go-rounds, in which every president and every governor has a chance to speak without interruption. The first go-round is referred to as the economics go-round. The meeting participants describe their views on current economic conditions and their outlook for future economic conditions. The presidents’ remarks will typically include references to their own local economies, as well as the national and global situation.\n\nAs part of my contributions to the economics go-round in the last couple of meetings, I discussed my outlook for GDP, inflation, and unemployment. In terms of GDP, I believe that a modest recovery is under way and is likely to continue. In terms of inflation, I expect a slight but welcome uptick over the next 18 months. Finally, in terms of unemployment, I see ongoing problems in labor markets.\n\nI’ll talk first about GDP. Real GDP growth has been positive in each of the past four quarters, and the government’s final estimate is 1.7 percent for the second quarter of this year. Based on forecasts from our Minneapolis model, I expect that GDP growth will be around 2.4 percent in the second half of 2010 and around 2.5 percent in 2011. Together over 2010 and 2011, I expect that GDP will grow around 2.5 percent per year. In contrast, in my first speech about seven months ago, I predicted that GDP would grow around 3.0 percent per year over 2010 and 2011. There is a recovery under way in the United States. But it is a distinctly modest one—and even more modest than I expected at the beginning of this year.\n\nLet me turn now to inflation. From the fourth quarter of 2009 through the second quarter of 2010, the change in the PCE price level was just over 0.5 percent, which works out to an annual rate of just over 1 percent. The Fed’s price stability mandate is generally interpreted as maintaining an inflation rate of 2 percent, and 1 percent inflation is often considered to be too low relative to this stricture. I expect inflation to remain at about this level during the rest of this year. However, our Minneapolis forecasting model predicts that it will rise back into the more desirable 1.5-2 percent range in the second half of 2011.\n\nSo the news about inflation and GDP is in the “OK, but certainly could be better” category. However, the lack of vitality in the U.S. labor market can only be termed disturbing. The national unemployment rate remained at 9.6 percent in September. Private sector job creation remains weak—only 64,000 net private sector jobs were created in September. I do not expect the unemployment rate to decline rapidly, and so I expect it to be above 8.0 percent well into 2012.\n\nIf one digs deeper into the data, the situation seems even more troubling. The National Bureau of Economic Research dates the end of the recession as having occurred in June 2009. Correspondingly, from June 2009 through August 2010, the demand for labor among employers seemed to rise modestly. Since December 2000, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has been keeping data on the job openings rate, which is defined as the number of job openings divided by the sum of job openings and employment. It has also been keeping track of the layoffs/discharges rate, which is the fraction of employed people who have been laid off or discharged in a given month. From June 2009 to August 2010, the job openings rate rose by 26 percent. Over the same period, the layoffs/discharges rate fell by nearly 18 percent.\n\nNonetheless, despite this apparent increase in the demand for labor from employers, the unemployment rate actually went up slightly from June 2009 to August 2010, from 9.5 percent to 9.6 percent. And other measures of labor market performance actually tell an even bleaker story. From June 2009 to August 2010, the employment/population ratio fell from 59.4 percent to 58.5 percent. At the same time, the seasonally adjusted labor force participation rate fell from 65.7 percent to 64.7 percent.\n\nThat was essentially my input into the economics go-round of the FOMC at the last two meetings. GDP is growing, but more slowly than we would like. Inflation is a little low, but only temporarily. The failure of unemployment—and the labor market more generally—to respond to the modest increase in labor demand is deeply troubling.\n\nAfter the economics go-round, the FOMC meeting then transitions to its second phase, the policy go-round. Again, the meeting participants have a chance to speak in turn about what they perceive to be the appropriate policy choices for the committee. We all are committed to achieving the Fed’s dual mandate to attain both price stability and maximum employment. The former objective is generally understood as keeping inflation in a tight range around 2 percent. The second part of the mandate is much more of a moving target. Employment is shaped by many determinants beyond the Fed’s control: demographics, social custom, taxes, and so on. The Fed’s job is to keep employment as high as possible, given these other factors.\n\nCurrently, the FOMC has two quite distinct tools: short-term interest rates and balance sheet management. In terms of the former, the FOMC has set its target range for the fed funds rate at between 0 and 25 basis points. It has committed to keeping the rate in that range for “an extended period,” contingent on economic conditions being appropriate. The FOMC is also maintaining a portfolio of roughly $2.3 trillion. Over 2 trillion of those dollars are invested in Treasury securities or government-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and other government-sponsored enterprises.\n\nIn his address at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s annual policy forum in August, Chairman Bernanke described three ways to use these tools if the FOMC chooses to provide further stimulus. The first is to buy more long-term securities. The second is to offer more forward guidance in the FOMC statement. The third is to reduce the interest on excess reserves (IOER) by 15 or even 25 basis points. As Chairman Bernanke indicated, using these tools does not come without costs, and due consideration must be made of both costs and benefits. Along those lines, I will discuss my thoughts on how these tools impact the economy. Again, I must underscore that my thoughts are my own and do not represent the views of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nLet me talk first about forward guidance. In part, firms make their decisions about capital expenditures and hiring by comparing the returns to those internal projects to the inflation-adjusted yields available in financial markets for investments of similar horizon. Thus, the real yields on medium-term and long-term government bonds matter for firm investment decisions. Those yields are, in part, shaped by current expectations of future short-term interest rates. The current FOMC statement shapes those expectations by providing forward guidance about its future plans for the behavior of the fed funds target.\n\nRight now, the FOMC states that it will keep the fed funds target range exceptionally low for as long as economic conditions warrant. The statement also predicts that exceptionally low fed funds rates are likely to be warranted for an “extended period” of time. In this way, the statement influences current expectations of future short-term rates and thereby shapes current medium- and long-term interest rates. The FOMC could provide stimulus by saying that it predicts that low rates are likely to be warranted for an even longer period of time than an “extended period.” This kind of stronger language should lead to a decline in medium-term and long-term interest rates.\n\nI view lowering the IOER as another form of forward guidance. I think that it is unlikely that lowering the IOER by 15 or 25 basis points will have much direct effect on loan markets. However, it is likely that investors would view this move as a signal that the FOMC is planning to keep its target rate even lower for an even longer period of time. In that way, lowering the IOER would serve to lower medium-term and long-term interest rates.\n\nSo, the FOMC can influence the economy through various forms of forward guidance about how long it plans for the fed funds rate to be so low. However, the FOMC has another tool at its disposal: what is often termed quantitative easing—QE for short. Under quantitative easing, the FOMC buys long-term securities in the open market. In exchange for those securities, it credits the sellers’ accounts at the Fed with more reserves. The upshot is that there are fewer long-term securities being held by private investors, and banks hold more reserves.\n\nJust to be clear on one point: The FOMC is only authorized by Congress to buy a limited set of securities. Ideas like “the FOMC should buy corporate bonds” would require a change to the Federal Reserve Act—a change that I for one would view as undesirable. In meetings earlier this year, FOMC participants indicated their strong preference to return to an all-Treasury portfolio. So, I’ll proceed in this speech under the presumption that any new purchases would take the form of long-term Treasuries. But, as I’ll discuss, the idea behind QE is that the yields on those long-term Treasuries will affect yields on all long-term securities.\n\nI see QE as affecting the economy in four main ways. I’ll first discuss them from a theoretical perspective and then discuss what’s known about these effects empirically.\n\nThe first effect of QE is that it represents another form of forward guidance about the path of the fed funds rate. It is a way for the FOMC to signal—in a perhaps more striking way—that it plans to keep the fed funds rate low for an even longer time to come.\n\nSecond, QE creates more reserves in banks’ accounts with the Fed. The standard intuition is that this kind of reserve creation is inflationary. Banks can only offer checkable deposits in proportion to their reserves. Economists view checkable deposits as a form of money because, like cash, checkable deposits make many transactions easier. In this sense, bank reserves held with the Fed are licenses for banks to create a certain amount of money. By giving out more licenses, the FOMC is allowing banks to create more money. More money chasing the same amount of goods—voila, inflation.\n\nThis basic logic isn’t valid in current circumstances, because reserves are paying interest equal to comparable market interest rates. Banks have nearly $1 trillion of excess reserves. This means that they are not using a lot of their existing licenses to create money. QE gives them new licenses to create money, but I do not see why they would suddenly start to use the new ones if they weren’t using the old ones. With that said, I have indicated in earlier speeches that $1 trillion of excess reserves does create a potential for high inflation at some point in the future if the FOMC does not react sufficiently fast when it starts to see inflationary pressures. But I do not see this risk as being heightened in any meaningful way by banks holding even more excess reserves than what they are holding today.\n\nThe third effect of QE is the one that is usually stressed: It reduces the exposure of the private sector to interest rate risk. The holder of a long-term Treasury is exposed to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the price of the bond falls, and the bondholder is less wealthy. Now think about an example of QE in which the Fed buys $1 billion of 10-year Treasuries. On the margin, the bond portfolio of the private sector is now less exposed to interest rate risk. As a consequence, private investors will demand a lower premium for holding other bonds that are exposed to interest rate risk. All long-term yields fall, and so firms should be more willing to undertake long-term capital expansions or hire permanent employees.\n\nThe fourth effect of QE is less widely discussed. The Fed cannot literally eliminate the exposure of the economy to the risk of fluctuations in the real interest rate. It can only shift that risk among people in the economy. So, where did that risk go when the Fed bought the long-term bond? The answer is to taxpayers.\n\nTo see this more clearly, suppose hypothetically that the Treasury wants to borrow $1 billion today and is choosing between two ways of doing so. One way is to issue a 20-year, zero-coupon, inflation-indexed bond. The bond requires the Treasury to repay $1.5 billion in real terms in 20 years (roughly a 2 percent real yield). Under this plan, taxpayers face no tax risk, but the buyers of the bond can lose a lot if real interest rates rise greatly. The other way is to issue $1 billion of one-year indexed bonds and then keep rolling over that debt for 20 years. Now, taxpayers have to repay a lot more than $1.5 billion in 20 years if short-term real interest rates end up being high.\n\nBasically, if the government uses short-term debt, it exposes taxpayers to interest rate risk. If it uses long-term government debt, it exposes the bondholders to interest rate risk. QE is a special case of this general principle: When the Fed buys long-term government debt from the private market, it shifts interest rate risk from bondholders to taxpayers.\n\nWhat is the ultimate impact on the overall economy of this shift in risk? In the baseline models used by central banks, all bondholders are taxpayers. In these models, QE is essentially shifting risk from one pocket to another. As a result, the increase in tax risk (what I’m calling the fourth effect of QE) completely undoes the decrease in interest rate risk (the third effect of QE). QE ends up having no effects, except for those associated with any new forward guidance that it signals.1\n\nQE will have nontrivial effects over forward guidance in the context of a more realistic model in which people differ from one another in some relevant way. Along those lines, we might think that some people are active participants in the Treasury markets. Others are not. Then, if the Fed buys long-term Treasuries, it takes risk from the former group and imposes it on the second group. The ultimate macroeconomic impact of QE depends on the extent to which the extra tax risk deters economic activity on the part of this second group. We know little about this effect, either theoretically or empirically.\n\nTo this stage, my discussion of QE has been purely theoretical in nature. The Fed engaged in QE from January 2009 through March 2010 by buying over $1.5 trillion worth of agency debt, agency mortgage-backed securities, and Treasuries. How did this operation—termed the Large-Scale Asset Purchase, or LSAP program—affect the economy? We don’t know as much as we would like as yet. However, I think that the best empirical work on the question of how the LSAP affected long-term Treasury yields has been done by Gagnon, Raskin, Remache, and Sack (2010). The paper is a thorough investigation of this key issue. My conclusion from their work is that the LSAP reduced the term premium on 10-year Treasury bonds relative to 2-year Treasury bonds by about 40-80 basis points (on an annualized basis). (The term premium is a measure of the difference in yields that is not explained by the expected path of short-term interest rates.) This fall in term premia led to a slightly smaller fall in the term premia of corporate bonds.\n\nThese estimates are extremely useful benchmarks. My own guess is that further uses of QE would have a more muted effect on Treasury term premia. Financial markets are functioning much better in late 2010 than they were in early 2009. As a result, the relevant spreads are lower, and I suspect that it will be somewhat more challenging for the Fed to impact them.\n\nI’ve talked about three possible tools—lowering the IOER, strengthening the forward guidance in the FOMC statement, and quantitative easing. As I mentioned earlier, Chairman Bernanke observed in his August 27 speech that each of these tools has benefits and drawbacks that must be balanced against each other. With QE, I would say that the multiple novel effects make the calculus even more difficult than usual.\n\nSo, I’ve taken you through a typical FOMC meeting and the monetary policy situation in the United States. My discussion may have struck you as somewhat technical, and this is no accident. The FOMC meeting participants are a group of unabashed technocrats, seeking to solve an unabashedly technical problem: How do we manage monetary policy so as to ensure lower unemployment and maintain inflation at an appropriate rate? We certainly disagree with one another on occasion. But our disagreements ultimately stem from different assessments of the complicated economic situation and not from political differences.\n\nI believe that the apolitical nature of the FOMC’s work hinges critically on another aspect of central bank structure, and that has to do with the Federal Reserve’s relationship with the U.S. Congress. On the one hand, the Federal Reserve is a creation of Congress. It has the power to amend the Fed’s responsibilities, as the recent financial reform legislation certainly attests. The Senate approves the presidential appointments to the Board of Governors. Both chambers receive regular reports from the Board of Governors on the conduct of monetary policy, financial supervision, and the payments system. In addition, the Federal Reserve undergoes regular audits of its finances and various operations.\n\nOn the other hand, Congress has intentionally removed itself from the direct conduct of monetary policy by granting the Federal Reserve the independence to perform this function on its own. In effect, Congress has said that it does not want monetary policy unduly affected by political considerations. This independence is not only a hallmark of this country’s central bank, but is also a characteristic of developed economies worldwide.\n\nSo I’ve talked about a lot of issues today, and I could certainly talk about a lot more. But I have a feeling that you’ve got plenty of questions, and we are likely to hit on many key topics. So I will stop here and happily take your questions.\n\nThank you once again for this opportunity.\n\n\n\nEggertsson, Gauti B., and Michael Woodford. 2003. “The Zero Bound on Interest rates and Optimal Monetary Policy.” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity 1, 139–211.\n\nGagnon, Joseph, Matthew Raskin, Julie Remache, and Brian Sack. 2010. “Large-Scale Asset Purchases by the Federal Reserve: Did They Work?” Staff Report 441.

        "content": "Thanks for the generous introduction. I’m delighted to have this opportunity to speak with you today.\nAs you just heard, I became president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis last October. Here’s the start of a rather typical conversation that I would have had with my friends and relatives last fall. “Congratulations! That’s fantastic. Now, what is it that you will do exactly?”\nAs it turns out, the job has a lot of interesting aspects. But I think I’ve been invited to speak here today because I help formulate monetary policy for the United States. So what I plan to do is give you some feel for how this part of my job works. In doing so, I’ll highlight the Federal Reserve’s quintessentially American structure. Unlike the central banks of other countries, you’ll see that ours is specifically designed to draw upon the insights of small-town businesses, farmers and ranchers, and large manufacturers, among others, to formulate monetary policy. Before I proceed, I must remind you that any views I express here today are my own, and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\nWhat do I mean by an American structure? Well, relative to its counterparts around the world, the U.S. central bank is highly decentralized. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is one of 12 regional Reserve banks that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System. Our bank’s district extends from the Rocky Mountains on the west to the Great Lakes in the east and borders Canada, an area roughly four times the size of the U.K. However, the U.K. has about seven times the population.  \nEight times per year, the Federal Open Market Committee—the FOMC—meets to set the path of short-term interest rates over the next six to seven weeks. All 12 presidents of the various regional Federal Reserve banks—including me—and the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board contribute to these deliberations. (Actually, in the meeting last week, there were only four governors. The good news is that the White House has nominated three excellent candidates for the three vacancies.) However, the committee itself consists only of the governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and a rotating group of four other presidents (currently Cleveland, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Boston). I’ll be on the committee in 2011.\nIn this way, the structure of the FOMC mirrors the federalist structure of our government. Representatives from different regions of the country—the various presidents—have input into FOMC deliberations. The input from the presidents relies critically on information they receive from their districts about local economic performance. We obtain this information through the work of our research staffs—but we also obtain it from people in industries and towns, in my case, across the Upper Midwest. The Federal Reserve System is deliberately designed so that the residents of Main Street—and not just Wall Street—are able to have a voice in monetary policy.\nAs part of my contributions to recent FOMC meetings, I discussed my outlook for GDP, inflation, and unemployment. In terms of GDP, I believe that a modest recovery is under way and is likely to continue. In terms of inflation, I expect a slight but welcome uptick over the next 18 months. Finally, in terms of unemployment, I see ongoing deep problems in labor markets.\nI’ll talk first about GDP. Real GDP growth has been positive in each of the past four quarters, and the government’s second estimate is 1.6 percent for the second quarter of this year. We have recently updated our estimates for future growth from our Minneapolis forecasting model. Our September estimates are distinctly lower than our August estimates. I now expect GDP growth to be around 2.4 percent in the second half of 2010 and around 2.5 percent in 2011. Together over 2010 and 2011, I’m now predicting that GDP will grow around 2.5 percent per year. In contrast, in my first speech about seven months ago, I predicted that GDP would grow around 3.0 percent per year over 2010 and 2011. There is a recovery under way in the United States. But it is a distinctly modest one—and even more modest than I expected at the beginning of this year.\nLet me turn now to inflation. From the fourth quarter of 2009 through the second quarter of 2010, the change in the PCE price level was just over 0.5 percent, which works out to an annual rate of just over 1 percent. The Fed’s price stability mandate is generally interpreted as maintaining an inflation rate of 2 percent, and 1 percent inflation is often considered to be too low relative to this stricture. I expect inflation to remain at about this level during the rest of this year. However, our Minneapolis forecasting model predicts that it will rise back into the more desirable 1.5-2 percent range in 2011.\nSo the news about inflation and GDP is in the “OK, but certainly could be better” category. However, the lack of vitality in the U.S. labor market can only be termed disturbing. The national unemployment rate remained at 9.6 percent in August. Private sector job creation remains weak—only 67,000 net private sector jobs were created in August. I do not expect the unemployment rate to decline rapidly, and so I expect it to be above 8.0 percent well into 2012.\nIf one digs deeper into the data, the situation seems even more troubling. Since December 2000, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has been keeping data on the job openings rate, which is defined as the number of job openings divided by the sum of job openings and employment. It has also been keeping track of the layoffs/discharges rate, which is the fraction of employed people who have been laid off or discharged in a given month. The job openings rate rose by around 30 percent between July 2009 and July 2010. The layoffs/discharges rate has fallen by over 10 percent over the same period.\nNonetheless, despite this apparent increase in the demand for labor from employers, the unemployment rate actually went up slightly from July 2009 to July 2010, from 9.4 percent to 9.5 percent. And other measures of labor market performance actually tell an even bleaker story. From July 2009 to July 2010, the employment/population ratio fell from 59.3 percent to 58.4 percent. At the same time, the seasonally adjusted labor force participation rate fell from 65.4 percent to 64.6 percent. This was the biggest July-over-July fall in the 60-plus year history of that statistic.\nTo summarize: GDP is growing, but more slowly than I expected or than we would like. Inflation is a little low, but only temporarily. The behavior of unemployment is deeply troubling.\nWith that economic outlook in mind, we can now turn to the choices facing the FOMC if it were to choose to provide more stimulus. Currently, the FOMC has set its target range for the fed funds rate at between 0 and 25 basis points. It has committed to keeping the rate in that range for “an extended period,” contingent on economic conditions being appropriate. The FOMC is also maintaining a portfolio of roughly $2.3 trillion. Over 2 trillion of those dollars are invested in Treasury securities or government-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and other government-sponsored enterprises.\nIn his address at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s annual policy forum in August, Chairman Bernanke described three possible tools that are available to the FOMC if it chooses to provide further stimulus. The first is to buy more long-term securities. The second is to offer more forward guidance in the FOMC statement. The third is to reduce the interest on excess reserves (IOER) by 15 or even 25 basis points. As Chairman Bernanke indicated, using these tools does not come without costs, and due consideration must be made of both costs and benefits. Along those lines, I will discuss my thoughts on how these tools impact the economy. Again, I must underscore that my thoughts are my own and do not represent the views of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nLet me talk first about forward guidance. In part, firms make their decisions about capital expenditures and hiring by comparing the returns to those internal projects to the inflation-adjusted yields available in financial markets for investments of similar horizon. Thus, the real yields on medium-term and long-term government bonds matter for firm investment decisions. Those yields are, in part, shaped by current expectations of future short-term interest rates. The current FOMC statement shapes those expectations by providing forward guidance about its future plans for the behavior of the fed funds target.\nRight now, the FOMC states that it will keep the fed funds target range exceptionally low for as long as economic conditions warrant. The statement also predicts that exceptionally low fed funds rates are likely to be warranted for an “extended period” of time. In this way, the statement influences current expectations of future short-term rates and thereby shapes current medium- and long-term interest rates. The FOMC could provide stimulus by saying that it predicts that low rates are likely to be warranted for an even longer period of time than an “extended period.” This kind of stronger language should lead to a decline in medium-term and long-term interest rates.\nI view lowering the IOER as another form of forward guidance. I think that it is unlikely that lowering the IOER by 15 or 25 basis points will have much direct effect on loan markets. However, it is likely that investors would view this move as a signal that the FOMC is planning to keep its target rate even lower for an even longer period of time. In that way, lowering the IOER would serve to lower medium-term and long-term interest rates.\nSo, the FOMC can influence the economy through various forms of forward guidance about how long it plans for the fed funds rate to be so low. However, the FOMC has another tool at its disposal: what is often termed quantitative easing—QE for short. Under quantitative easing, the FOMC buys long-term securities in the open market.

Ideas like “the FOMC should buy corporate bonds” would require a change to the Federal Reserve Act—a change that I for one would view as undesirable. In meetings earlier this year, FOMC participants indicated their strong preference to return to an all-Treasury portfolio. So, I’ll proceed in this speech under the presumption that any new purchases would take the form of long-term Treasuries. But, as I’ll discuss, the idea behind QE is that the yields on those long-term Treasuries will affect yields on all long-term securities.\nI see QE as affecting the economy in four main ways.

QE gives them new licenses to create money, but I do not see why they would suddenly start to use the new ones if they weren’t using the old ones. With that said, I have indicated in earlier speeches that $1 trillion of excess reserves does create a potential for high inflation at some point in the future if the FOMC does not react sufficiently fast when it starts to see inflationary pressures. But I do not see this risk as being heightened in any meaningful way by banks holding even more excess reserves than what they are holding today.\nThe third effect of QE is the one that is usually stressed: It reduces the exposure of the private sector to interest rate risk. The holder of a long-term Treasury is exposed to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the price of the bond falls, and the bondholder is less wealthy. Now think about an example of QE in which the Fed buys $1 billion of 10-year Treasuries. On the margin, the bond portfolio of the private sector is now less exposed to interest rate risk. As a consequence, private investors will demand a lower premium for holding other bonds that are exposed to interest rate risk. All long-term yields fall, and so firms should be more willing to undertake long-term capital expansions or hire permanent employees.\nThe fourth effect of QE is less widely discussed. The Fed cannot literally eliminate the exposure of the economy to the risk of fluctuations in the real interest rate. It can only shift that risk among people in the economy. So, where did that risk go when the Fed bought the long-term bond? The answer is to taxpayers.\nTo see this more clearly, suppose hypothetically that the Treasury wants to borrow $1 billion today and is choosing between two ways of doing so. One way is to issue a 20-year, zero coupon, inflation-indexed bond. The bond requires the Treasury to repay $1.5 billion in real terms in 20 years (roughly a 2 percent real yield). Under this plan, taxpayers face no tax risk, but the buyers of the bond can lose a lot if real interest rates rise greatly. The other way is to issue $1 billion of one-year indexed bonds and then keep rolling over that debt for 20 years. Now, taxpayers have to repay a lot more than $1.5 billion in 20 years if short-term real interest rates end up being high.\nBasically, if the government uses short-term debt, it exposes taxpayers to interest rate risk. If it uses long-term government debt, it exposes the bondholders to interest rate risk. QE is a special case of this general principle: When the Fed buys long-term government debt from the private market, it shifts interest rate risk from bondholders to taxpayers.\nWhat is the ultimate impact on the overall economy of this shift in risk? In the baseline models used by central banks, all bondholders are taxpayers. In these models, QE is essentially shifting risk from one pocket to another. As a result, the increase in tax risk (what I’m calling the fourth effect of QE) completely undoes the decrease in interest rate risk (the third effect of QE). QE ends up having no effects, except for those associated with any new forward guidance that it signals.1\nQE will have nontrivial effects over forward guidance in the context of a more realistic model in which people differ from one another in some relevant way. Along those lines, we might think that some people are active participants in the Treasury markets. Others are not. Then, if the Fed buys long-term Treasuries, it takes risk from the former group and imposes it on the second group. The ultimate macroeconomic impact of QE depends on the extent to which the extra tax risk deters economic activity on the part of this second group. We know little about this effect, either theoretically or empirically.\nTo this stage, my discussion of QE has been purely theoretical in nature. The Fed engaged in QE from January 2009 through March 2010 by buying over $1.5 trillion worth of agency debt, agency mortgage-backed securities, and Treasuries. How did this operation—termed the Large-Scale Asset Purchase, or LSAP program—affect the economy? We don’t know as much as we would like as yet. However, I think that the best empirical work on the question of how the LSAP affected long-term Treasury yields has been done by Gagnon, Raskin, Remache, and Sack (2010). Their paper is a thorough investigation of this key issue. My conclusion from their work is that the LSAP reduced the term premium on 10-year Treasury bonds relative to 2-year Treasury bonds by about 40-80 basis points (on an annualized basis). (The term premium is a measure of the difference in yields that is not explained by the expected path of short-term interest rates.) This fall in term premia led to a slightly smaller fall in the term premia of corporate bonds.\nThese estimates are extremely useful benchmarks. My own guess is that further uses of QE would have a more muted effect on Treasury term premia. Financial markets are functioning much better in late 2010 than they were in early 2009. As a result, the relevant spreads are lower, and I suspect that it will be somewhat more challenging for the Fed to impact them.\nI’ve talked about three possible tools—lowering the IOER, strengthening the forward guidance in the FOMC statement, and quantitative easing. As I mentioned earlier, Chairman Bernanke observed in his August 27 speech that each of these tools has benefits and drawbacks that must be balanced against each other. With QE, I would say that the multiple effects make the calculus even more difficult than usual.\nSo I’ve talked about a lot of issues today, and I could certainly talk about a lot more. But I have a feeling that you’ve got plenty of questions, and we are likely to hit on many key topics. So I will stop here and happily take your questions.\n1 For example, Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) prove that QE has no real or inflationary impact over forward guidance in their representative agent New Keynesian model. In their proof, they assume that taxes are not distorting.\nReferences\nEggertsson, Gauti B., and Michael Woodford. 2003. “The Zero Bound on Interest rates and Optimal Monetary Policy.” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity 1, 139–211.\nGagnon, Joseph, Matthew Raskin, Julie Remache, and Brian Sack. 2010. “Large-Scale Asset Purchases by the Federal Reserve: Did They Work?” Staff Report 441. Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nThanks for the generous introduction. I’m delighted to have this opportunity to speak with you today.\n\nAs you just heard, I became president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis last October. Here’s the start of a rather typical conversation that I would have had with my friends and relatives last fall. “Congratulations! That’s fantastic. Now, what is it that you will do exactly?”\n\nAs it turns out, the job has a lot of interesting aspects. But I think I’ve been invited to speak here today because I help formulate monetary policy for the United States. So what I plan to do is give you some feel for how this part of my job works. In doing so, I’ll highlight the Federal Reserve’s quintessentially American structure. Unlike the central banks of other countries, you’ll see that ours is specifically designed to draw upon the insights of small-town businesses, farmers and ranchers, and large manufacturers, among others, to formulate monetary policy. Before I proceed, I must remind you that any views I express here today are my own, and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWhat do I mean by an American structure? Well, relative to its counterparts around the world, the U.S. central bank is highly decentralized. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is one of 12 regional Reserve banks that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System. Our bank’s district extends from the Rocky Mountains on the west to the Great Lakes in the east and borders Canada, an area roughly four times the size of the U.K. However, the U.K. has about seven times the population.\n\nEight times per year, the Federal Open Market Committee—the FOMC—meets to set the path of short-term interest rates over the next six to seven weeks. All 12 presidents of the various regional Federal Reserve banks—including me—and the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board contribute to these deliberations. (Actually, in the meeting last week, there were only four governors. The good news is that the White House has nominated three excellent candidates for the three vacancies.) However, the committee itself consists only of the governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and a rotating group of four other presidents (currently Cleveland, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Boston). I’ll be on the committee in 2011.\n\nIn this way, the structure of the FOMC mirrors the federalist structure of our government. Representatives from different regions of the country—the various presidents—have input into FOMC deliberations. The input from the presidents relies critically on information they receive from their districts about local economic performance. We obtain this information through the work of our research staffs—but we also obtain it from people in industries and towns, in my case, across the Upper Midwest. The Federal Reserve System is deliberately designed so that the residents of Main Street—and not just Wall Street—are able to have a voice in monetary policy.\n\nAs part of my contributions to recent FOMC meetings, I discussed my outlook for GDP, inflation, and unemployment. In terms of GDP, I believe that a modest recovery is under way and is likely to continue. In terms of inflation, I expect a slight but welcome uptick over the next 18 months. Finally, in terms of unemployment, I see ongoing deep problems in labor markets.\n\nI’ll talk first about GDP. Real GDP growth has been positive in each of the past four quarters, and the government’s second estimate is 1.6 percent for the second quarter of this year. We have recently updated our estimates for future growth from our Minneapolis forecasting model. Our September estimates are distinctly lower than our August estimates. I now expect GDP growth to be around 2.4 percent in the second half of 2010 and around 2.5 percent in 2011. Together over 2010 and 2011, I’m now predicting that GDP will grow around 2.5 percent per year. In contrast, in my first speech about seven months ago, I predicted that GDP would grow around 3.0 percent per year over 2010 and 2011. There is a recovery under way in the United States. But it is a distinctly modest one—and even more modest than I expected at the beginning of this year.\n\nLet me turn now to inflation. From the fourth quarter of 2009 through the second quarter of 2010, the change in the PCE price level was just over 0.5 percent, which works out to an annual rate of just over 1 percent. The Fed’s price stability mandate is generally interpreted as maintaining an inflation rate of 2 percent, and 1 percent inflation is often considered to be too low relative to this stricture. I expect inflation to remain at about this level during the rest of this year. However, our Minneapolis forecasting model predicts that it will rise back into the more desirable 1.5-2 percent range in 2011.\n\nSo the news about inflation and GDP is in the “OK, but certainly could be better” category. However, the lack of vitality in the U.S. labor market can only be termed disturbing. The national unemployment rate remained at 9.6 percent in August. Private sector job creation remains weak—only 67,000 net private sector jobs were created in August. I do not expect the unemployment rate to decline rapidly, and so I expect it to be above 8.0 percent well into 2012.\n\nIf one digs deeper into the data, the situation seems even more troubling. Since December 2000, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has been keeping data on the job openings rate, which is defined as the number of job openings divided by the sum of job openings and employment. It has also been keeping track of the layoffs/discharges rate, which is the fraction of employed people who have been laid off or discharged in a given month. The job openings rate rose by around 30 percent between July 2009 and July 2010. The layoffs/discharges rate has fallen by over 10 percent over the same period.\n\nNonetheless, despite this apparent increase in the demand for labor from employers, the unemployment rate actually went up slightly from July 2009 to July 2010, from 9.4 percent to 9.5 percent. And other measures of labor market performance actually tell an even bleaker story. From July 2009 to July 2010, the employment/population ratio fell from 59.3 percent to 58.4 percent. At the same time, the seasonally adjusted labor force participation rate fell from 65.4 percent to 64.6 percent. This was the biggest July-over-July fall in the 60-plus year history of that statistic.\n\nTo summarize: GDP is growing, but more slowly than I expected or than we would like. Inflation is a little low, but only temporarily. The behavior of unemployment is deeply troubling.\n\nWith that economic outlook in mind, we can now turn to the choices facing the FOMC if it were to choose to provide more stimulus. Currently, the FOMC has set its target range for the fed funds rate at between 0 and 25 basis points. It has committed to keeping the rate in that range for “an extended period,” contingent on economic conditions being appropriate. The FOMC is also maintaining a portfolio of roughly $2.3 trillion. Over 2 trillion of those dollars are invested in Treasury securities or government-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and other government-sponsored enterprises.\n\nIn his address at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s annual policy forum in August, Chairman Bernanke described three possible tools that are available to the FOMC if it chooses to provide further stimulus. The first is to buy more long-term securities. The second is to offer more forward guidance in the FOMC statement. The third is to reduce the interest on excess reserves (IOER) by 15 or even 25 basis points. As Chairman Bernanke indicated, using these tools does not come without costs, and due consideration must be made of both costs and benefits. Along those lines, I will discuss my thoughts on how these tools impact the economy. Again, I must underscore that my thoughts are my own and do not represent the views of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nLet me talk first about forward guidance. In part, firms make their decisions about capital expenditures and hiring by comparing the returns to those internal projects to the inflation-adjusted yields available in financial markets for investments of similar horizon. Thus, the real yields on medium-term and long-term government bonds matter for firm investment decisions. Those yields are, in part, shaped by current expectations of future short-term interest rates. The current FOMC statement shapes those expectations by providing forward guidance about its future plans for the behavior of the fed funds target.\n\nRight now, the FOMC states that it will keep the fed funds target range exceptionally low for as long as economic conditions warrant. The statement also predicts that exceptionally low fed funds rates are likely to be warranted for an “extended period” of time. In this way, the statement influences current expectations of future short-term rates and thereby shapes current medium- and long-term interest rates. The FOMC could provide stimulus by saying that it predicts that low rates are likely to be warranted for an even longer period of time than an “extended period.” This kind of stronger language should lead to a decline in medium-term and long-term interest rates.\n\nI view lowering the IOER as another form of forward guidance. I think that it is unlikely that lowering the IOER by 15 or 25 basis points will have much direct effect on loan markets. However, it is likely that investors would view this move as a signal that the FOMC is planning to keep its target rate even lower for an even longer period of time. In that way, lowering the IOER would serve to lower medium-term and long-term interest rates.\n\nSo, the FOMC can influence the economy through various forms of forward guidance about how long it plans for the fed funds rate to be so low. However, the FOMC has another tool at its disposal: what is often termed quantitative easing—QE for short. Under quantitative easing, the FOMC buys long-term securities in the open market. In exchange for those securities, it credits the sellers’ accounts at the Fed with more reserves. The upshot is that there are fewer long-term securities being held by private investors, and banks hold more reserves.\n\nJust to be clear on one point: The FOMC is only authorized by Congress to buy a limited set of securities. Ideas like “the FOMC should buy corporate bonds” would require a change to the Federal Reserve Act—a change that I for one would view as undesirable. In meetings earlier this year, FOMC participants indicated their strong preference to return to an all-Treasury portfolio. So, I’ll proceed in this speech under the presumption that any new purchases would take the form of long-term Treasuries. But, as I’ll discuss, the idea behind QE is that the yields on those long-term Treasuries will affect yields on all long-term securities.\n\nI see QE as affecting the economy in four main ways. I’ll first discuss them from a theoretical perspective and then discuss what’s known about these effects empirically.\n\nThe first effect of QE is that it represents another form of forward guidance about the path of the fed funds rate. It is a way for the FOMC to signal—in a perhaps more striking way—that it plans to keep the fed funds rate low for an even longer time to come.\n\nSecond, QE creates more reserves in banks’ accounts with the Fed. The standard intuition is that this kind of reserve creation is inflationary. Banks can only offer checkable deposits in proportion to their reserves. Economists view checkable deposits as a form of money because, like cash, checkable deposits make many transactions easier. In this sense, bank reserves held with the Fed are licenses for banks to create a certain amount of money. By giving out more licenses, the FOMC is allowing banks to create more money. More money chasing the same amount of goods—voila, inflation.\n\nThis basic logic isn’t valid in current circumstances, because reserves are paying interest equal to comparable market interest rates. Banks have nearly $1 trillion of excess reserves. This means that they are not using a lot of their existing licenses to create money. QE gives them new licenses to create money, but I do not see why they would suddenly start to use the new ones if they weren’t using the old ones. With that said, I have indicated in earlier speeches that $1 trillion of excess reserves does create a potential for high inflation at some point in the future if the FOMC does not react sufficiently fast when it starts to see inflationary pressures. But I do not see this risk as being heightened in any meaningful way by banks holding even more excess reserves than what they are holding today.\n\nThe third effect of QE is the one that is usually stressed: It reduces the exposure of the private sector to interest rate risk. The holder of a long-term Treasury is exposed to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the price of the bond falls, and the bondholder is less wealthy. Now think about an example of QE in which the Fed buys $1 billion of 10-year Treasuries. On the margin, the bond portfolio of the private sector is now less exposed to interest rate risk. As a consequence, private investors will demand a lower premium for holding other bonds that are exposed to interest rate risk. All long-term yields fall, and so firms should be more willing to undertake long-term capital expansions or hire permanent employees.\n\nThe fourth effect of QE is less widely discussed. The Fed cannot literally eliminate the exposure of the economy to the risk of fluctuations in the real interest rate. It can only shift that risk among people in the economy. So, where did that risk go when the Fed bought the long-term bond? The answer is to taxpayers.\n\nTo see this more clearly, suppose hypothetically that the Treasury wants to borrow $1 billion today and is choosing between two ways of doing so. One way is to issue a 20-year, zero coupon, inflation-indexed bond. The bond requires the Treasury to repay $1.5 billion in real terms in 20 years (roughly a 2 percent real yield). Under this plan, taxpayers face no tax risk, but the buyers of the bond can lose a lot if real interest rates rise greatly. The other way is to issue $1 billion of one-year indexed bonds and then keep rolling over that debt for 20 years. Now, taxpayers have to repay a lot more than $1.5 billion in 20 years if short-term real interest rates end up being high.\n\nBasically, if the government uses short-term debt, it exposes taxpayers to interest rate risk. If it uses long-term government debt, it exposes the bondholders to interest rate risk. QE is a special case of this general principle: When the Fed buys long-term government debt from the private market, it shifts interest rate risk from bondholders to taxpayers.\n\nWhat is the ultimate impact on the overall economy of this shift in risk? In the baseline models used by central banks, all bondholders are taxpayers. In these models, QE is essentially shifting risk from one pocket to another. As a result, the increase in tax risk (what I’m calling the fourth effect of QE) completely undoes the decrease in interest rate risk (the third effect of QE). QE ends up having no effects, except for those associated with any new forward guidance that it signals.1\n\nQE will have nontrivial effects over forward guidance in the context of a more realistic model in which people differ from one another in some relevant way. Along those lines, we might think that some people are active participants in the Treasury markets. Others are not. Then, if the Fed buys long-term Treasuries, it takes risk from the former group and imposes it on the second group.

The Fed engaged in QE from January 2009 through March 2010 by buying over $1.5 trillion worth of agency debt, agency mortgage-backed securities, and Treasuries.

        "content": "Thanks for the generous introduction. I’m delighted to have this opportunity to speak with you today, and of course I’m very pleased to make my first official visit to Missoula, here on the western edge of the Federal Reserve’s Ninth District. My most recent speech was near the eastern tip of the district, in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and these trips reinforce not only the diverse nature of the district’s economy for me, but also its natural beauty. And Missoula is certainly second to none in the district when it comes to natural beauty. Of course, that takes nothing away from the Upper Peninsula, or Minnesota, or the Dakotas, or Wisconsin, too, for that matter. You get the picture: We have the most beautiful district in the Federal Reserve System, and you can quote me on that.\nBefore I proceed, I want to acknowledge the presence of the board of directors for our Helena Branch, with whom I had the pleasure to meet this morning: John Franklin, a banker from Sidney; Tim Bartz, an accountant from Helena; Dave Solberg, a rancher from Billings; and Joe McDonald, the recently retired president of Salish Kootenai College in Pablo. In addition to these folks, there are former directors in attendance, as well as members of our advisory councils on small business, labor and agriculture. I won’t name them all, or I would likely have to go through a list of many in this room. However, I think it’s important for people to realize that the Federal Reserve is represented by dedicated citizens like these on all of our bank and branch boards of directors, and I will have more to say on this feature of our Federal Reserve System in a moment. Thanks to all of you for your service.\nOne of the benefits of these trips is that I get to hear how the economy is doing on the ground level, if you will. As you might imagine, we have a lot of data at our fingertips at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, but sometimes statistics don’t tell the whole story. On that note, I’m especially looking forward to the question-and-answer session following my talk. I’ve learned much from the questions at my various speaking engagements and expect that I’ll do the same today.\nAs you just heard, I became president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis last October. Here’s the start of a rather typical conversation that I would have had with my friends and relatives last fall. “Congratulations! That’s fantastic. Now, what is it that you will do exactly?”\nAs it turns out, the job has a lot of interesting aspects. But I think I’ve been invited to speak here today because I help formulate monetary policy for the United States. So what I plan to do is give you some feel for how this part of my job works. In doing so, I’ll highlight the Federal Reserve’s quintessentially American structure. Unlike the central banks of other countries, you’ll see that ours is specifically designed to draw upon the insights of small-town businesses, farmers and ranchers, and large manufacturers, among others, to formulate monetary policy. Before I proceed, I must remind you that any views I express here today are my own, and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\nWhat do I mean by an American structure? Well, relative to its counterparts around the world, the U.S. central bank is highly decentralized. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is one of 12 regional Reserve banks that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System. Our bank represents the ninth of the 12 Federal Reserve districts and includes Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, northwestern Wisconsin, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.\nEight times per year, the Federal Open Market Committee—the FOMC—meets to set the path of short-term interest rates over the next six to seven weeks. All 12 presidents of the various regional Federal Reserve banks—including me—and the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board contribute to these deliberations. (Actually, in the August meeting, there were only five governors, and there are now only four after the retirement of Don Kohn. The good news is that the White House has nominated three excellent candidates for the three vacancies.) However, the committee itself consists only of the governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and a rotating group of four other presidents (currently Cleveland, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Boston). I’ll be on the committee in 2011.\nIn this way, the structure of the FOMC mirrors the federalist structure of our government. Representatives from different regions of the country—the various presidents—have input into FOMC deliberations. The input from the presidents relies critically on information they receive from their districts about local economic performance. We obtain this information through the work of our research staffs—but we also obtain it from business leaders in industries and towns, in my case, across the Upper Midwest. The Federal Reserve System is deliberately designed so that the residents of Main Street are able to have a voice in monetary policy.\nSo how, exactly, do the FOMC meetings work? In the remainder of my remarks, I’ll take you inside an FOMC meeting. Its structure provides a perfect vehicle to communicate the key considerations confronting monetary policymakers in the United States.\nThe typical FOMC meeting features two so-called go-rounds, in which every president and every governor has a chance to speak without interruption. The first go-round is referred to as the economics go-round. The meeting participants describe their views on current economic conditions and their outlook for future economic conditions. The presidents’ remarks will typically include references to their own local economies, as well as the national and global situation.\nAs part of my contributions to the economics go-round in August, I discussed my outlook for GDP, inflation, and unemployment. In terms of GDP, I believe that a modest recovery is under way and is likely to continue. In terms of inflation, I expect a slight but welcome uptick over the next 18 months. Finally, in terms of unemployment, I see current and future problems in labor markets that may be difficult to combat using the tools of monetary policy.\nI’ll talk first about GDP. Real GDP growth has been positive in each of the past four quarters, and the government’s second estimate is 1.6 percent for the second quarter of this year. Based on estimates from our Minneapolis forecasting model, I expect GDP growth to be around 2.5 percent in the second half of 2010 and close to 3.0 percent in 2011. Together over 2010 and 2011, I’m now predicting that GDP will grow around 2.8 percent per year. In contrast, in my first speech about seven months ago, I predicted that GDP would grow around 3.0 percent per year over 2010 and 2011. There is a recovery under way in the United States. But, as expected, it is a modest one.\nLet me turn now to inflation. From the fourth quarter of 2009 through the second quarter of 2010, the change in the PCE price level was just over 0.5 percent, which works out to an annual rate of just over 1 percent. The Fed’s price stability mandate is generally interpreted as maintaining an inflation rate of 2 percent, and 1 percent inflation is often considered to be too low relative to this stricture. I expect inflation to remain at about this level during the rest of this year. However, our Minneapolis forecasting model predicts that it will rise back into the more desirable 1.5-2 percent range in 2011.\nSo the news about inflation and GDP is in the “good, but certainly could be better” category. However, the lack of vitality in the U.S. labor market can only be termed disturbing. The national unemployment rate remains at 9.6 percent in August. Private sector job creation remains weak—only 67,000 net private sector jobs were created in August. I do not expect the unemployment rate to decline rapidly, and so I expect it to be above 8.0 percent into 2012.\nIf one digs deeper into the data, the situation seems even more troubling. Since December 2000, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has been keeping data on the job openings rate, which is defined as the number of job openings divided by the sum of job openings and employment. Not surprisingly, when job openings rise, the unemployed can find jobs more readily, and the unemployment rate typically falls. The inverse relationship between the unemployment rate and the job openings rate was extremely stable throughout the 2000-01 recession, the subsequent recovery, and on through the early part of this recession.\nBeginning in June 2008, this stable relationship began to break down, as the unemployment rate rose much faster than could be rationalized by the fall in job openings. Over the past year, the relationship has completely shattered. The job openings rate has risen by about 20 percent between July 2009 and June 2010. Under this scenario, we would expect unemployment to fall because people find it easier to get jobs. However, the unemployment rate actually went up slightly over this period.\nWhat does this change in the relationship between job openings and unemployment connote? The disincentive effects of extended unemployment insurance benefits are one possible cause for this change. However, I suspect that these effects are not all that large. I am comfortable with the San Francisco Fed’s 2009 estimate, which finds that the extensions of benefits have boosted the unemployment rate by 0.4 percent.\nThe bigger issue is mismatch. Firms have jobs, but can’t find appropriate workers. The workers want to work, but can’t find appropriate jobs. There are many possible sources of mismatch—geography, skills, demography—and they probably interact in nontrivial ways. For example, there may be jobs available in eastern Montana and western North Dakota because of the oil boom. But a household in Nevada that is underwater on its mortgage may find it difficult to move to those locations.\nOf course, the key question is: How much of the current unemployment rate is really due to mismatch? The answer seems to be a lot. I mentioned that the relationship between unemployment and job openings was stable from December 2000 through June 2008. Were that stable relationship still in place today, and given the current job opening rate of 2.2 percent, we would have an unemployment rate closer to 6.5 percent, not 9.6 percent.1 Together with the San Francisco Fed’s estimate of the impact of benefits, this analysis implies that over 2.5 percentage points of the current unemployment rate is attributable to mismatch.\nThis estimate is based on a rather aggregative view of the labor market. It is important to dig deeper to get a better understanding of the problem, and there is a considerable amount of research under way exploring the quantitative importance of the various forms of mismatch. For example, the International Monetary Fund has recently released a special study based on a new state-by-state measure of the gap between demand and supply for workers with different levels of educational attainment. The study examines the impact of this variable and the foreclosure rate on state-level unemployment. It estimates that 1.5 percentage points of the national unemployment rate is due to these two sources and their interaction. Thus, according to this study, these two types of mismatch alone can account for a significant fraction of my estimate of 2.5 percentage points.\nGood economic policy is about using the right tool for the problem at hand. The mismatch problems in the labor market do not strike me as readily amenable to the kinds of monetary policy tools currently available to the Fed. But they may well be amenable to other types of policy tools, like job retraining programs or foreclosure mitigation strategies. As Chairman Bernanke said in his Jackson Hole speech in August, central bankers alone cannot solve the world’s economic problems.\nThat was essentially my input into the economics go-round of the FOMC in August. GDP is growing, but more slowly than we would like. Inflation is a little low, but only temporarily. The behavior of unemployment is deeply troubling.\nAfter the economics go-round, the FOMC meeting then transitions to its second phase, the policy go-round. Again, the meeting participants have a chance to speak in turn about what they perceive to be the appropriate policy choices for the committee. We all are committed to achieving the Fed’s dual mandate to attain both price stability and maximum employment. The former objective is generally understood as keeping inflation in a tight range around 2 percent. The second part of the mandate is much more of a moving target. Employment is shaped by many determinants beyond the Fed’s control: demographics, social custom, taxes, and so on. The Fed’s job is to keep employment as high as possible, given these other factors.\nRight now, the committee has to think about two quite distinct policy tools: short-term interest rates and balance sheet management. I’ll talk about both in turn.\nThe federal funds rate—the key short-term interest rate set by the FOMC—has been set at 0-25 basis points for over a year and a half. The FOMC’s August statement contains the following key sentence:\n“The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.” (See the FOMC statement.)\nWhat do we learn from this rather long sentence? As you would hope, there is an intimate connection between my economics summary and what’s in this statement. The unemployment rate is 9.6 percent, and measured inflation is low (below 2 percent). Market and survey measures of expected inflation are also low (also below 2 percent). In its statement, the FOMC is saying: We’re keeping interest rates low to keep unemployment from going any higher, and we feel safe in doing so because there seems to be little threat of inflation.\nLet me turn next to the issue of the Fed’s balance sheet. The Federal Reserve has 2.3 trillion dollars of assets—over 2.5 times what it owned in September 2008. Over 2 trillion dollars of those assets are in Treasuries, debt issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, or mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These MBSs are backed by the U.S. government—the Federal Reserve faces no credit risk in holding them. But they do have another kind of risk called prepayment risk. If long-term interest rates are low, then many people prepay the mortgages in the MBS. The owners of the MBS—in this case, the Fed—get a large coupon payment and the MBS’s principal falls. However, if long-term interest rates are high, then few people make these prepayments.\nThis kind of fluctuation in prepayments is at the heart of the FOMC’s new policy action in August. Long-term interest rates have declined surprisingly fast since April. But the fall in long-term rates led more people to prepay their mortgages. As a result, MBS principal balances were falling. In this sense, the Fed’s holdings of long-term assets were shrinking, leaving a larger share of the long-term risk in the economy in the hands of the private sector. According to estimates in a recent paper,2 this extra risk in private hands could force up the risk premia on long-term bonds by around 20 basis points and be a drag on the recovery. The FOMC decided to arrest the decline in its holdings of long-term assets by reinvesting the principal payments from the MBSs into long-term Treasuries.\nAs I mentioned, I’m not a member of the FOMC during this calendar year and so I did not vote in the August meeting. However, I would have voted for the FOMC statement in August had I actually been a member of the committee.\nSo, I’ve taken you through a typical FOMC meeting and the monetary policy situation in the United States. My discussion may have struck you as rather techy and wonkish—maybe even verging on the nerdy. I’m sure that my colleagues will forgive me for saying that this nerdy quality mirrors the tone of the discussion within the committee itself. There is no inflated political rhetoric. We are unabashed technocrats, seeking to solve an unabashedly technical problem: How do we manage monetary policy so as to ensure lower unemployment and maintain inflation at an appropriate rate? We certainly disagree with one another on occasion. But our disagreements ultimately stem from different assessments of the complicated economic situation and not from political differences.\nI believe that the apolitical nature of the FOMC’s work hinges critically on another aspect of central bank structure, and that has to do with the Federal Reserve’s relationship with the U.S. Congress. On the one hand, the Federal Reserve is a creation of Congress. It has the power to amend the Fed’s responsibilities, as the recent financial reform legislation certainly attests. The Senate approves the presidential appointments to the Board of Governors. Both chambers receive regular reports from the Board of Governors on the conduct of monetary policy, financial supervision, and the payments system. In addition, the Federal Reserve undergoes regular audits of its finances and various operations.\nOn the other hand, Congress has intentionally removed itself from the direct conduct of monetary policy by granting the Federal Reserve the independence to perform this function on its own. In effect, Congress has said that it does not want monetary policy unduly affected by political considerations. This independence is not only a hallmark of this country’s central bank, but is also a characteristic of developed economies worldwide.\nSo I’ve talked about a lot of issues today, and I could certainly talk about a lot more. But I have a feeling that you’ve got plenty of questions, and we are likely to hit on many key topics. So I will stop here and happily take your questions.\nThank you once again for this opportunity.\n1 I use the following procedure to reach these conclusions. I calibrated parameters in Shimer’s (2007) mismatch model to fit the average level of vacancies from December 2000 to December 2007 and the average level of unemployment over the same period. I obtained m = 210.5 and n = 205.5 to fit an average unemployment rate of 5.2 percent and an average vacancy rate of 2.9 percent. (The calibrated parameters differ from Shimer’s own because of data revisions by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.) In June 2008, the unemployment rate was 5.5 percent and the vacancy rate was 2.7 percent; the model implied an unemployment rate of 5.5 percent and a vacancy rate of 2.6 percent if I set n = 204.2. In June 2010, the vacancy rate was 2.2 percent. I set n = 201.8 to match that in the model. At that value of n, the model implied an unemployment rate of 6.3 percent. The value of m in Shimer’s model has changed greatly.\n2 See Gagnon et al. (2010).\nReferences\nGagnon, Joseph, Matthew Raskin, Julie Remache, and Brian Sack. 2010. “Large-Scale Asset Purchases by the Federal Reserve: Did They Work?” Staff Report 441.

I’m delighted to have this opportunity to speak with you today, and of course I’m very pleased to make my first official visit to Missoula, here on the western edge of the Federal Reserve’s Ninth District. My most recent speech was near the eastern tip of the district, in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and these trips reinforce not only the diverse nature of the district’s economy for me, but also its natural beauty. And Missoula is certainly second to none in the district when it comes to natural beauty. Of course, that takes nothing away from the Upper Peninsula, or Minnesota, or the Dakotas, or Wisconsin, too, for that matter. You get the picture: We have the most beautiful district in the Federal Reserve System, and you can quote me on that.\n\nBefore I proceed, I want to acknowledge the presence of the board of directors for our Helena Branch, with whom I had the pleasure to meet this morning: John Franklin, a banker from Sidney; Tim Bartz, an accountant from Helena; Dave Solberg, a rancher from Billings; and Joe McDonald, the recently retired president of Salish Kootenai College in Pablo. In addition to these folks, there are former directors in attendance, as well as members of our advisory councils on small business, labor and agriculture. I won’t name them all, or I would likely have to go through a list of many in this room. However, I think it’s important for people to realize that the Federal Reserve is represented by dedicated citizens like these on all of our bank and branch boards of directors, and I will have more to say on this feature of our Federal Reserve System in a moment. Thanks to all of you for your service.\n\nOne of the benefits of these trips is that I get to hear how the economy is doing on the ground level, if you will. As you might imagine, we have a lot of data at our fingertips at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, but sometimes statistics don’t tell the whole story. On that note, I’m especially looking forward to the question-and-answer session following my talk. I’ve learned much from the questions at my various speaking engagements and expect that I’ll do the same today.\n\nAs you just heard, I became president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis last October. Here’s the start of a rather typical conversation that I would have had with my friends and relatives last fall. “Congratulations! That’s fantastic. Now, what is it that you will do exactly?”\n\nAs it turns out, the job has a lot of interesting aspects. But I think I’ve been invited to speak here today because I help formulate monetary policy for the United States. So what I plan to do is give you some feel for how this part of my job works. In doing so, I’ll highlight the Federal Reserve’s quintessentially American structure. Unlike the central banks of other countries, you’ll see that ours is specifically designed to draw upon the insights of small-town businesses, farmers and ranchers, and large manufacturers, among others, to formulate monetary policy. Before I proceed, I must remind you that any views I express here today are my own, and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWhat do I mean by an American structure? Well, relative to its counterparts around the world, the U.S. central bank is highly decentralized. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is one of 12 regional Reserve banks that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System. Our bank represents the ninth of the 12 Federal Reserve districts and includes Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, northwestern Wisconsin, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.\n\nEight times per year, the Federal Open Market Committee—the FOMC—meets to set the path of short-term interest rates over the next six to seven weeks. All 12 presidents of the various regional Federal Reserve banks—including me—and the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board contribute to these deliberations. (Actually, in the August meeting, there were only five governors, and there are now only four after the retirement of Don Kohn. The good news is that the White House has nominated three excellent candidates for the three vacancies.) However, the committee itself consists only of the governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and a rotating group of four other presidents (currently Cleveland, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Boston). I’ll be on the committee in 2011.\n\nIn this way, the structure of the FOMC mirrors the federalist structure of our government. Representatives from different regions of the country—the various presidents—have input into FOMC deliberations. The input from the presidents relies critically on information they receive from their districts about local economic performance. We obtain this information through the work of our research staffs—but we also obtain it from business leaders in industries and towns, in my case, across the Upper Midwest. The Federal Reserve System is deliberately designed so that the residents of Main Street are able to have a voice in monetary policy.\n\nSo how, exactly, do the FOMC meetings work? In the remainder of my remarks, I’ll take you inside an FOMC meeting. Its structure provides a perfect vehicle to communicate the key considerations confronting monetary policymakers in the United States.\n\nThe typical FOMC meeting features two so-called go-rounds, in which every president and every governor has a chance to speak without interruption. The first go-round is referred to as the economics go-round. The meeting participants describe their views on current economic conditions and their outlook for future economic conditions. The presidents’ remarks will typically include references to their own local economies, as well as the national and global situation.\n\nAs part of my contributions to the economics go-round in August, I discussed my outlook for GDP, inflation, and unemployment. In terms of GDP, I believe that a modest recovery is under way and is likely to continue. In terms of inflation, I expect a slight but welcome uptick over the next 18 months. Finally, in terms of unemployment, I see current and future problems in labor markets that may be difficult to combat using the tools of monetary policy.\n\nI’ll talk first about GDP. Real GDP growth has been positive in each of the past four quarters, and the government’s second estimate is 1.6 percent for the second quarter of this year. Based on estimates from our Minneapolis forecasting model, I expect GDP growth to be around 2.5 percent in the second half of 2010 and close to 3.0 percent in 2011. Together over 2010 and 2011, I’m now predicting that GDP will grow around 2.8 percent per year. In contrast, in my first speech about seven months ago, I predicted that GDP would grow around 3.0 percent per year over 2010 and 2011. There is a recovery under way in the United States. But, as expected, it is a modest one.\n\nLet me turn now to inflation. From the fourth quarter of 2009 through the second quarter of 2010, the change in the PCE price level was just over 0.5 percent, which works out to an annual rate of just over 1 percent. The Fed’s price stability mandate is generally interpreted as maintaining an inflation rate of 2 percent, and 1 percent inflation is often considered to be too low relative to this stricture. I expect inflation to remain at about this level during the rest of this year. However, our Minneapolis forecasting model predicts that it will rise back into the more desirable 1.5-2 percent range in 2011.\n\nSo the news about inflation and GDP is in the “good, but certainly could be better” category. However, the lack of vitality in the U.S. labor market can only be termed disturbing. The national unemployment rate remains at 9.6 percent in August. Private sector job creation remains weak—only 67,000 net private sector jobs were created in August. I do not expect the unemployment rate to decline rapidly, and so I expect it to be above 8.0 percent into 2012.\n\nIf one digs deeper into the data, the situation seems even more troubling. Since December 2000, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has been keeping data on the job openings rate, which is defined as the number of job openings divided by the sum of job openings and employment. Not surprisingly, when job openings rise, the unemployed can find jobs more readily, and the unemployment rate typically falls. The inverse relationship between the unemployment rate and the job openings rate was extremely stable throughout the 2000-01 recession, the subsequent recovery, and on through the early part of this recession.\n\nBeginning in June 2008, this stable relationship began to break down, as the unemployment rate rose much faster than could be rationalized by the fall in job openings. Over the past year, the relationship has completely shattered. The job openings rate has risen by about 20 percent between July 2009 and June 2010. Under this scenario, we would expect unemployment to fall because people find it easier to get jobs. However, the unemployment rate actually went up slightly over this period.\n\nWhat does this change in the relationship between job openings and unemployment connote? The disincentive effects of extended unemployment insurance benefits are one possible cause for this change. However, I suspect that these effects are not all that large. I am comfortable with the San Francisco Fed’s 2009 estimate, which finds that the extensions of benefits have boosted the unemployment rate by 0.4 percent.\n\nThe bigger issue is mismatch. Firms have jobs, but can’t find appropriate workers. The workers want to work, but can’t find appropriate jobs. There are many possible sources of mismatch—geography, skills, demography—and they probably interact in nontrivial ways. For example, there may be jobs available in eastern Montana and western North Dakota because of the oil boom. But a household in Nevada that is underwater on its mortgage may find it difficult to move to those locations.\n\nOf course, the key question is: How much of the current unemployment rate is really due to mismatch? The answer seems to be a lot. I mentioned that the relationship between unemployment and job openings was stable from December 2000 through June 2008. Were that stable relationship still in place today, and given the current job opening rate of 2.2 percent, we would have an unemployment rate closer to 6.5 percent, not 9.6 percent.1 Together with the San Francisco Fed’s estimate of the impact of benefits, this analysis implies that over 2.5 percentage points of the current unemployment rate is attributable to mismatch.\n\nThis estimate is based on a rather aggregative view of the labor market. It is important to dig deeper to get a better understanding of the problem, and there is a considerable amount of research under way exploring the quantitative importance of the various forms of mismatch. For example, the International Monetary Fund has recently released a special study based on a new state-by-state measure of the gap between demand and supply for workers with different levels of educational attainment. The study examines the impact of this variable and the foreclosure rate on state-level unemployment. It estimates that 1.5 percentage points of the national unemployment rate is due to these two sources and their interaction. Thus, according to this study, these two types of mismatch alone can account for a significant fraction of my estimate of 2.5 percentage points.\n\nGood economic policy is about using the right tool for the problem at hand. The mismatch problems in the labor market do not strike me as readily amenable to the kinds of monetary policy tools currently available to the Fed. But they may well be amenable to other types of policy tools, like job retraining programs or foreclosure mitigation strategies.

GDP is growing, but more slowly than we would like. Inflation is a little low, but only temporarily. The behavior of unemployment is deeply troubling.\n\nAfter the economics go-round, the FOMC meeting then transitions to its second phase, the policy go-round. Again, the meeting participants have a chance to speak in turn about what they perceive to be the appropriate policy choices for the committee. We all are committed to achieving the Fed’s dual mandate to attain both price stability and maximum employment. The former objective is generally understood as keeping inflation in a tight range around 2 percent. The second part of the mandate is much more of a moving target. Employment is shaped by many determinants beyond the Fed’s control: demographics, social custom, taxes, and so on. The Fed’s job is to keep employment as high as possible, given these other factors.\n\nRight now, the committee has to think about two quite distinct policy tools: short-term interest rates and balance sheet management. I’ll talk about both in turn.\n\nThe federal funds rate—the key short-term interest rate set by the FOMC—has been set at 0-25 basis points for over a year and a half. The FOMC’s August statement contains the following key sentence:\n\n“The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.” (See the FOMC statement.)\n\nWhat do we learn from this rather long sentence? As you would hope, there is an intimate connection between my economics summary and what’s in this statement. The unemployment rate is 9.6 percent, and measured inflation is low (below 2 percent). Market and survey measures of expected inflation are also low (also below 2 percent).

This is my first trip to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and I look forward to many more. I want to take this opportunity to thank Bob Jacquart, who was instrumental in helping us set up this meeting. Bob served on one of our economic advisory councils a few years ago, and I know that others in this room have served on such councils or on our bank’s board of directors. Thanks to all of you for that service. Thanks also to Dr. Les Wong and the UP CEOs for their role in making this event happen, and especially to Theresa Nease and others here at Northern Michigan University for their hospitality.\nOne of the benefits of these trips is that I get to hear how the economy is doing on the ground level, if you will.

All 12 presidents of the various regional Federal Reserve banks—including me—and the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board contribute to these deliberations.

The good news is that the White House has nominated three excellent candidates for the three vacancies.) However, the committee itself consists only of the governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and a rotating group of four other presidents (currently Cleveland, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Boston).

Its structure provides a perfect vehicle to communicate the key considerations confronting monetary policymakers in the United States today.\nThe typical FOMC meeting features two so-called go-rounds, in which every president and every governor has a chance to speak without interruption. The first go-round is referred to as the economics go-round. The meeting participants describe their views on current economic conditions and their outlook for future economic conditions. The presidents’ remarks will typically include references to their own local economies, as well as the national and global situation.\nAs part of my contributions to the economics go-round in August, I discussed my outlook for gross domestic product (GDP), inflation, and unemployment. In terms of GDP, I believe that a modest recovery is under way and is likely to continue. In terms of inflation, I expect a slight but welcome uptick over the next 18 months. Finally, in terms of unemployment, I see current and future problems in labor markets that are likely to continue to prove resistant to the tools of monetary policy.\nI’ll talk first about GDP. Real GDP growth has been positive in each of the past four quarters, and the government’s initial estimate is that GDP grew at an annualized rate of 2.4 percent in the second quarter of this year. Based on estimates from our Minneapolis forecasting model, I expect GDP growth to be around 2.5 percent in the second half of 2010 and close to 3.0 percent in 2011. There is a recovery under way in the United States, and I expect it to continue.\nAs last week’s FOMC statement says, though, the pace of the recovery is more modest than I would have anticipated. We are four quarters into the recovery, and real GDP per person is still about 3.2 percent below its level in the fourth quarter of 2007 when the recession began. In some sense, this number actually understates the economic problem. Typically, real GDP per person grows between 1.5 and 2 percent per year. If the economy had actually grown at that rate over the past two and a half years, we would have between 7 and 8.2 percent more output per person than we do right now. My forecast is such that we will not make up that 7-8.2 percent lost output anytime soon.\nLet me turn now to inflation. From the fourth quarter of 2009 through the second quarter of 2010, the change in the PCE (personal consumption expenditures) price level was just over 0.5 percent, which works out to an annual rate of just over 1 percent. The Fed’s price stability mandate is generally interpreted as maintaining an inflation rate of 2 percent, and 1 percent inflation is often considered to be too low relative to this stricture. I expect it to remain at about this level during the rest of this year. However, our Minneapolis forecasting model predicts that it will rise back into the more desirable 1.5-2 percent range in 2011.\nSo the news about inflation and GDP is in the “good, but certainly could be better” category. However, the lack of vitality in the U.S. labor market can only be termed disturbing. The national unemployment rate remains at 9.5 percent in July. Private sector job creation remains weak—only 71,000 net private sector jobs were created in July.\nIf one digs deeper into the data, the situation seems even more troubling. Since December 2000, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has been keeping data on the job openings rate, which is defined as the number of job openings divided by the sum of job openings and employment. Not surprisingly, when job openings rise, the unemployed can find jobs more readily, and the unemployment rate typically falls. The inverse relationship between unemployment and job openings was extremely stable throughout the 2000-01 recession, the subsequent recovery, and on through the early part of this recession.\nBeginning in June 2008, this stable relationship began to break down, as the unemployment rate rose much faster than could be rationalized by the fall in the job openings rate. Over the past year, the relationship has completely shattered. The job openings rate has risen by about 20 percent between July 2009 and June 2010. Under this scenario, we would expect unemployment to fall because people find it easier to get jobs. However, the unemployment rate actually went up slightly over this period.\nWhat does this change in the relationship between job openings and unemployment connote? In a word, mismatch. Firms have jobs, but can’t find appropriate workers. The workers want to work, but can’t find appropriate jobs. There are many possible sources of mismatch—geography, skills, demography—and they are probably all at work. Whatever the source, though, it is hard to see how the Fed can do much to cure this problem. Monetary stimulus has provided conditions so that manufacturing plants want to hire new workers. But the Fed does not have a means to transform construction workers into manufacturing workers.\nOf course, the key question is: How much of the current unemployment rate is really due to mismatch, as opposed to conditions that the Fed can readily ameliorate? The answer seems to be a lot. I mentioned that the relationship between unemployment and job openings was stable from December 2000 through June 2008. Were that stable relationship still in place today, and given the current job opening rate of 2.2 percent, we would have an unemployment rate of closer to 6.5 percent, not 9.5 percent. Most of the existing unemployment represents mismatch that is not readily amenable to monetary policy.1\nGiven the structural problems in the labor market, I do not expect unemployment to decline rapidly. My own prediction is that unemployment will remain above 8 percent into 2012. Persistently high unemployment of this kind will impose considerable losses on many of our citizens. Good public policy requires that we help mitigate their losses via a well-designed unemployment insurance program. Recent economic research, including some done at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, shows that such a program will not feature the termination of benefits after 26, 52, or 99 weeks. Instead, a good insurance program should offer constant benefits over the entire duration of an unemployment spell, however long. It should provide incentives only through the level of those benefits, not through their timing.2\nThat was essentially my input about the national economy in the economics go-round of the FOMC last week. GDP is growing, but more slowly than we would like. Inflation is a little low, but only temporarily. The behavior of unemployment is deeply troubling.\nAfter the economics go-round, the FOMC meeting then transitions to its second phase, the policy go-round. Again, the 17 meeting participants have a chance to speak in turn about what they perceive to be the appropriate policy choices for the committee. We are all committed to achieving the Fed’s dual mandate to attain both price stability and maximum employment. As I mentioned, the former objective is generally understood as keeping inflation in a tight range around 2 percent. The second part of the mandate is much more of a moving target. Everyone knows that employment is shaped by many determinants beyond the Fed’s control: demographics, social custom, taxes, and so on. The Fed’s job is to keep employment as high as possible, given these other factors.\nRight now, the committee has to think about two quite distinct policy tools: short-term interest rates and balance sheet management. I’ll talk about both in turn.\nThe federal funds rate—the key short-term interest rate set by the FOMC—has been set at 0-25 basis points for over 18 months. In terms of its future level, the FOMC’s statement last week contains the following key sentence:\n“The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.”\nWhat do we learn from this rather long sentence? As you would hope, there is an intimate connection between my economic summary and what’s in this statement. The unemployment rate is 9.5 percent, and measured inflation is low (below 2 percent). Market and survey measures of expected inflation are also low (also below 2 percent). In its statement, the FOMC is saying: We’re keeping interest rates low to keep unemployment from going any higher, and we feel safe in doing so because there seems to be little threat of inflation.\nLet me turn next to the issue of the Fed’s balance sheet. The Federal Reserve has 2.3 trillion dollars of assets—over 2.5 times what it owned in September 2008. Over 2 trillion dollars of those assets are in Treasuries, debt issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, or mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These MBSs are not toxic assets in any sense of the word—they are fully backed by the U.S. government, and so the Federal Reserve faces no credit risk in holding them.  But the MBSs do have another kind of risk called prepayment risk. If long-term interest rates are low, then many people prepay the mortgages in the MBS. The owners of the MBS—in this case, the Fed—get a large coupon payment and the MBS’s principal falls. However, if long-term interest rates are high, then few people make these prepayments.\nThis kind of fluctuation in prepayments is at the heart of the FOMC’s new policy action in August. Long-term interest rates declined surprisingly fast in the past three months. But the fall in long-term rates meant that more people were prepaying their mortgages, and the Fed’s MBS principal balances were falling. In this sense, the Fed’s holdings of long-term assets were shrinking, leaving a larger share of the long-term risk in the economy in the hands of the private sector. This extra risk in private hands could force up the risk premia on long-term bonds and be a drag on the real economy. The FOMC decided to arrest the decline in its holdings of long-term assets by re-investing the principal payments from the MBSs into long-term Treasuries.\nThe FOMC’s decision has had a larger impact on financial markets than I would have anticipated. My own interpretation is that the FOMC action led investors to believe that the economic situation in the United States was worse than they, the investors, had imagined. In my view, this reaction is unwarranted. The FOMC’s decisions were largely predicated on publicly available data about real GDP, its various components, unemployment, and inflation. I would say that there is no new information about the current state of the economy to be learned from the FOMC’s actions or its statement.\nSo, I’ve taken you through a typical FOMC meeting and the monetary policy situation in the United States. My discussion may have struck you as rather techy and wonkish—maybe even verging on the nerdy. I’m sure that my colleagues will forgive me for saying that this nerdy quality mirrors the tone of the discussion within the meeting itself. There is no inflated political rhetoric. We are unabashed technocrats, seeking to solve an unabashedly technical problem: How do we manage monetary policy so as to ensure lower unemployment and maintain inflation at an appropriate rate? We certainly disagree with one another on occasion. But our disagreements ultimately stem from different assessments of the complicated economic situation and not from political differences.\nI believe that the apolitical nature of the FOMC’s work hinges critically on another aspect of central bank structure, and that has to do with the Federal Reserve’s relationship with the U.S. Congress. On the one hand, the Federal Reserve is a creation of Congress. It has the power to amend the Fed’s responsibilities, as the recent financial reform legislation certainly attests. The Senate approves the presidential appointments to the Board of Governors. Both chambers receive regular reports from the Board of Governors on the conduct of monetary policy, financial supervision, and the payments system. In addition, the Federal Reserve undergoes regular audits of its finances and various operations.\nOn the other hand, Congress has intentionally removed itself from the direct conduct of monetary policy by granting the Federal Reserve the independence to perform this function on its own. In effect, Congress has said that it does not want monetary policy unduly affected by political considerations. This independence not only is a hallmark of this country’s central bank, but is also a characteristic of developed economies worldwide.\nAs I said, the FOMC meets eight times a year. Its decisions are always influenced by fairly recent economic data. But, at the same time, its decision-making has to be shaped by long-run considerations. In that vein, let me close by offering some thoughts about long-run inflation—or really, long-run deflation. I mentioned earlier that inflation has been near 1 percent recently. These data have led some observers to worry about the possibility of a multiyear period of falling prices—that is, persistent deflation. I don’t see this possibility as likely. It would require the FOMC to make the surprising mistake of ignoring the long run in its desire to fix the short run.\nHere’s what I mean. It is conventional for central banks to attribute deflationary outcomes to temporary shortfalls in aggregate demand. Given that interpretation, central banks then respond to deflation by easing monetary policy in order to generate extra demand. Unfortunately, this conventional response leads to problems if followed for too long. The fed funds rate is roughly the sum of two components: the real, net-of-inflation, return on safe short-term investments and anticipated inflation. Monetary policy does affect the real return on safe investments over short periods of time. But over the long run, money is, as we economists like to say, neutral. This means that no matter what the inflation rate is and no matter what the FOMC does, the real return on safe short-term investments averages about 1-2 percent over the long run.\nLong-run monetary neutrality is an uncontroversial, simple, but nonetheless profound proposition. In particular, it implies that if the FOMC maintains the fed funds rate at its current level of 0-25 basis points for too long, both anticipated and actual inflation have to become negative. Why? It’s simple arithmetic. Let’s say that the real rate of return on safe investments is 1 percent and we need to add an amount of anticipated inflation that will result in a fed funds rate of 0.25 percent. The only way to get that is to add a negative number—in this case, –0.75 percent.\nTo sum up, over the long run, a low fed funds rate must lead to consistent—but low—levels of deflation. The good news is that it is certainly possible to eliminate this eventuality through smart policy choices. Right now, the real safe return on short-term investments is negative because of various headwinds in the real economy. Again, using our simple arithmetic, this negative real return combined with the near-zero fed funds rate means that inflation must be positive. Eventually, the real economy will improve sufficiently that the real return to safe short-term investments will normalize at its more typical positive level. The FOMC has to be ready to increase its target rate soon thereafter.\nThat sounds easy—but it’s not. When real returns are normalized, inflationary expectations could well be negative, and there may still be a considerable amount of structural unemployment. If the FOMC hews too closely to conventional thinking, it might be inclined to keep its target rate low. That kind of reaction would simply re-enforce the deflationary expectations and lead to many years of deflation.\nWhile this scenario is conceivable, I consider it to be a highly unlikely one. The FOMC and the Board of Governors have displayed exactly the required unconventionality in solving many seemingly intractable problems over the past three years. I am confident that the Federal Reserve will display that same attribute if this deflationary challenge should ever arise. I am sure too that households and financial markets will share my confidence—which would actually eliminate the need for the Fed to ever confront hardened deflationary expectations.\nSo I’ve talked about a lot of issues today, and I could certainly talk about a lot more. But I have a feeling that you’ve got plenty of questions, and we are likely to hit on many key topics. So I will stop here and happily take your questions.\nThank you once again for this opportunity.\n1 I use the following procedure to reach these conclusions. I calibrated parameters in Shimer’s (2007) mismatch model to fit the average job openings rate from December 2000 to December 2007 and the average unemployment rate over the same period. I obtained m = 210.5 and n = 205.5 to fit an average unemployment rate of 5.2 percent and an average vacancy rate of 2.9 percent. (The calibrated parameters differ from Shimer’s own because of data revisions by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.) In June 2008, the unemployment rate was 5.5 percent and the vacancy rate was 2.7 percent; the model implied an unemployment rate of 5.5 percent and a vacancy rate of 2.6 percent if I set n = 204.2. In June 2010, the vacancy rate was 2.2 percent. I set n = 201.8 to match that in the model. At that value of n, the model implied an unemployment rate of 6.3 percent. The value of m in Shimer’s model has changed greatly.\n2 See Shimer and Werning (2008) and Clement (2006).\nReferences\nClement, Douglas. 2006. “If You Lost Your Job.” Region 20 (June), 34-37, 50-53.\nShimer, Robert. 2007. “Mismatch.” American Economic Review 97 (September), 1074-1101.\nShimer, Robert, and Iván Werning. 2008. “Liquidity and Insurance for the Unemployed.” American Economic Review 98 (December), 1922-42.\n\nThanks for the generous introduction. I’m delighted to have this opportunity to speak with you today. This is my first trip to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and I look forward to many more. I want to take this opportunity to thank Bob Jacquart, who was instrumental in helping us set up this meeting. Bob served on one of our economic advisory councils a few years ago, and I know that others in this room have served on such councils or on our bank’s board of directors. Thanks to all of you for that service. Thanks also to Dr. Les Wong and the UP CEOs for their role in making this event happen, and especially to Theresa Nease and others here at Northern Michigan University for their hospitality.\n\nOne of the benefits of these trips is that I get to hear how the economy is doing on the ground level, if you will. As you might imagine, we have a lot of data at our fingertips at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, but sometimes statistics don’t tell the whole story. On that note, I’m especially looking forward to the question-and-answer session following my talk. I’ve learned much from the questions at my various speaking engagements and expect that I’ll do the same today.\n\nAs you just heard, I became president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis last October. Here’s the start of a rather typical conversation that I would have had with my friends and relatives last fall. “Congratulations! That’s fantastic. Now, what is it that you will do exactly?”\n\nAs it turns out, the job has a lot of interesting aspects. But I think I’ve been invited to speak here today because I help formulate monetary policy for the United States. So what I plan to do is give you some feel for how this part of my job works. In doing so, I’ll highlight the Federal Reserve’s quintessentially American structure. Unlike the central banks of other countries, you’ll see that ours is specifically designed to draw upon the insights of small town businesses, farmers and ranchers, and large manufacturers, among others, to formulate monetary policy. Before I proceed, I must remind you that any views I express here today are my own, and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWhat do I mean by an American structure? Well, relative to its counterparts around the world, the U.S. central bank is highly decentralized. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is one of 12 regional Reserve banks that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System. Our bank represents the ninth of the 12 Federal Reserve districts. The Ninth District is, by area, the second largest. It includes Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, northwestern Wisconsin, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.\n\nEight times per year, the Federal Open Market Committee—the FOMC—meets to set the path of short-term interest rates over the next six to seven weeks. All 12 presidents of the various regional Federal Reserve banks—including me—and the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board contribute to these deliberations. (Actually, right now, there are only five governors—two positions are unfilled, and we’re scheduled to go down to four by the end of the month. The good news is that the White House has nominated three excellent candidates for the three vacancies.) However, the committee itself consists only of the governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and a rotating group of four other presidents (currently Cleveland, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Boston). I’ll be on the committee in 2011.\n\nIn this way, the structure of the FOMC mirrors the federalist structure of our government. Representatives from different regions of the country—the various presidents—have input into FOMC deliberations. The input from the presidents relies critically on information they receive from their districts about local economic performance. We obtain this information through the work of our research staffs—but we also obtain it from business leaders in industries and towns, in my case, across the Upper Midwest. The Federal Reserve System is deliberately designed so that the residents of Main Street are able to have a voice in monetary policy.\n\nSo how, exactly, do the FOMC meetings work? In the remainder of my remarks, I’ll take you inside an FOMC meeting. Its structure provides a perfect vehicle to communicate the key considerations confronting monetary policymakers in the United States today.\n\nThe typical FOMC meeting features two so-called go-rounds, in which every president and every governor has a chance to speak without interruption. The first go-round is referred to as the economics go-round. The meeting participants describe their views on current economic conditions and their outlook for future economic conditions. The presidents’ remarks will typically include references to their own local economies, as well as the national and global situation.\n\nAs part of my contributions to the economics go-round in August, I discussed my outlook for gross domestic product (GDP), inflation, and unemployment. In terms of GDP, I believe that a modest recovery is under way and is likely to continue. In terms of inflation, I expect a slight but welcome uptick over the next 18 months. Finally, in terms of unemployment, I see current and future problems in labor markets that are likely to continue to prove resistant to the tools of monetary policy.\n\nI’ll talk first about GDP. Real GDP growth has been positive in each of the past four quarters, and the government’s initial estimate is that GDP grew at an annualized rate of 2.4 percent in the second quarter of this year. Based on estimates from our Minneapolis forecasting model, I expect GDP growth to be around 2.5 percent in the second half of 2010 and close to 3.0 percent in 2011. There is a recovery under way in the United States, and I expect it to continue.\n\nAs last week’s FOMC statement says, though, the pace of the recovery is more modest than I would have anticipated. We are four quarters into the recovery, and real GDP per person is still about 3.2 percent below its level in the fourth quarter of 2007 when the recession began. In some sense, this number actually understates the economic problem. Typically, real GDP per person grows between 1.5 and 2 percent per year. If the economy had actually grown at that rate over the past two and a half years, we would have between 7 and 8.2 percent more output per person than we do right now. My forecast is such that we will not make up that 7-8.2 percent lost output anytime soon.\n\nLet me turn now to inflation. From the fourth quarter of 2009 through the second quarter of 2010, the change in the PCE (personal consumption expenditures) price level was just over 0.5 percent, which works out to an annual rate of just over 1 percent. The Fed’s price stability mandate is generally interpreted as maintaining an inflation rate of 2 percent, and 1 percent inflation is often considered to be too low relative to this stricture. I expect it to remain at about this level during the rest of this year. However, our Minneapolis forecasting model predicts that it will rise back into the more desirable 1.5-2 percent range in 2011.\n\nSo the news about inflation and GDP is in the “good, but certainly could be better” category. However, the lack of vitality in the U.S. labor market can only be termed disturbing. The national unemployment rate remains at 9.5 percent in July. Private sector job creation remains weak—only 71,000 net private sector jobs were created in July.\n\nIf one digs deeper into the data, the situation seems even more troubling. Since December 2000, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has been keeping data on the job openings rate, which is defined as the number of job openings divided by the sum of job openings and employment. Not surprisingly, when job openings rise, the unemployed can find jobs more readily, and the unemployment rate typically falls. The inverse relationship between unemployment and job openings was extremely stable throughout the 2000-01 recession, the subsequent recovery, and on through the early part of this recession.\n\nBeginning in June 2008, this stable relationship began to break down, as the unemployment rate rose much faster than could be rationalized by the fall in the job openings rate. Over the past year, the relationship has completely shattered. The job openings rate has risen by about 20 percent between July 2009 and June 2010. Under this scenario, we would expect unemployment to fall because people find it easier to get jobs. However, the unemployment rate actually went up slightly over this period.\n\nWhat does this change in the relationship between job openings and unemployment connote? In a word, mismatch. Firms have jobs, but can’t find appropriate workers. The workers want to work, but can’t find appropriate jobs. There are many possible sources of mismatch—geography, skills, demography—and they are probably all at work. Whatever the source, though, it is hard to see how the Fed can do much to cure this problem. Monetary stimulus has provided conditions so that manufacturing plants want to hire new workers. But the Fed does not have a means to transform construction workers into manufacturing workers.\n\nOf course, the key question is: How much of the current unemployment rate is really due to mismatch, as opposed to conditions that the Fed can readily ameliorate? The answer seems to be a lot. I mentioned that the relationship between unemployment and job openings was stable from December 2000 through June 2008. Were that stable relationship still in place today, and given the current job opening rate of 2.2 percent, we would have an unemployment rate of closer to 6.5 percent, not 9.5 percent. Most of the existing unemployment represents mismatch that is not readily amenable to monetary policy.1\n\nGiven the structural problems in the labor market, I do not expect unemployment to decline rapidly. My own prediction is that unemployment will remain above 8 percent into 2012. Persistently high unemployment of this kind will impose considerable losses on many of our citizens. Good public policy requires that we help mitigate their losses via a well-designed unemployment insurance program. Recent economic research, including some done at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, shows that such a program will not feature the termination of benefits after 26, 52, or 99 weeks. Instead, a good insurance program should offer constant benefits over the entire duration of an unemployment spell, however long. It should provide incentives only through the level of those benefits, not through their timing.2\n\nThat was essentially my input about the national economy in the economics go-round of the FOMC last week. GDP is growing, but more slowly than we would like. Inflation is a little low, but only temporarily. The behavior of unemployment is deeply troubling.\n\nAfter the economics go-round, the FOMC meeting then transitions to its second phase, the policy go-round.

I am confident that the Federal Reserve will display that same attribute if this deflationary challenge should ever arise. I am sure too that households and financial markets will share my confidence—which would actually eliminate the need for the Fed to ever confront hardened deflationary expectations.\n\nSo I’ve talked about a lot of issues today, and I could certainly talk about a lot more. But I have a feeling that you’ve got plenty of questions, and we are likely to hit on many key topics. So I will stop here and happily take your questions.\n\nThank you once again for this opportunity.\n\nClement, Douglas. 2006. “If You Lost Your Job.” Region 20 (June), 34-37, 50-53.\n\nShimer, Robert. 2007. “Mismatch.” American Economic Review 97 (September), 1074-1101.\n\nShimer, Robert, and Iván Werning. 2008. “Liquidity and Insurance for the Unemployed.” American Economic Review 98 (December), 1922-42."

Nonetheless, my remarks will focus on the lessons of the crisis for financial regulation. In doing so, I’m continuing an institutional tradition. My predecessor, Gary Stern, and my current head of supervision, Ron Feldman, literally wrote the book on how to deal with “Too Big to Fail” in 2004. Long before that, while working at the Minneapolis Fed, John Kareken and Neil Wallace sounded the alarm about the moral hazard generated by deposit insurance. This institutional history makes it especially important that I emphasize that any views I share today are my own, and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\nMy own thinking about financial regulation begins with what I see as the inevitability of collective mistakes. In the mid-2000s, we—as American investors, home owners, and bank lenders—collectively bet that house prices would not fall by 30 percent in most major metropolitan areas in three years. We were wrong. This mismatch between our expectations and our realizations was the ultimate source of the financial crisis of 2007-09.\nMy view is that no law can completely eliminate the kinds of collective investor and regulator mistakes that lead to financial crises. These mistakes have taken place periodically for centuries. They will certainly do so again. And once these crises happen, there are strong economic forces that lead policymakers—for the best of reasons—to bail out financial firms. In other words, no legislation can completely eliminate bailouts.\nMy theme today is that, even though they are inevitable, the likelihood and the magnitude of financial crises and bailouts can be limited by taxes on financial institutions. I arrive at this conclusion about the usefulness of taxes by thinking through an analogy that I’ll develop at some length. I will argue that, knowing bailouts are inevitable, financial institutions fail to internalize all the risks that their investment decisions impose on society. Economists would say that bailouts thereby create a risk “externality.” There is nearly a century of economic thought about how to deal with externalities of various sorts—and the usual answer is through taxation.  Taxes are a good response because they create incentives for firms to internalize the costs that would otherwise be external. \nI will emphasize the desirable incentive effects of taxes.  Much of the dialog about taxes on financial institutions emphasizes revenue collection goals. I will argue that correcting incentives and generating revenue are largely separate objectives. The United States could design a tax system with the right incentives and collect $5 billion per year from financial institutions. On the other hand, Canada could design a tax system with the right incentives and collect no revenue from financial institutions. Countries could well differ on their revenue collection objectives. But all should be interested in getting incentives in place to deter excessive risk-taking by financial institutions.\nMany policymakers are advocating taxation as a key instrument of financial regulation. Sweden has implemented a bank tax. The United Kingdom, France, and Germany seem likely to follow.  In the United States, the Obama administration has recommended the adoption of a levy on large financial institutions. The International Monetary Fund recently released a staff report that recommends a global tax on the financial sector.\nIn its June 27, 2010 communiqué, the G-20 agreed that countries should finance the response to financial crises through policies that accomplish five goals:\nProtect taxpayers\nReduce the risks from the financial sector\nProtect the flow of credit in good times and bad\nTake into account individual countries’ circumstances and options\nHelp promote a level playing field.\nThe G-20 made no specific recommendation about how to achieve these goals. But I hope to convince you that taxation is the best way to meet all five objectives.\nMy remarks today will overlap with those that I gave in Minneapolis on May 10.1 I build on the previous speech in two ways. First, I spend more time explaining the advantages of taxes over other regulatory responses. Second, while I discuss my preferred ideal tax system, I also describe some essential features for any desirable tax system.\nInevitability of Bailouts\nI began by saying that bailouts of financial institutions are certain to occur in financial crises. Why do I say this? There are many forces at play, but I believe that the strongest has to do with the very nature of financial intermediation. Investors in financial institutions always want the ability to pull their funds out quickly. For this reason, financial institutions’ liabilities often take the form of short-term debt and deposits. But short-term financing instruments are intrinsically prone to self-fulfilling crises of confidence commonly referred to as “runs.”\nImagine that Bank X needs $100 billion of one-day loans to survive. This means that for a given lender to be willing to make a $1 billion, one-day loan to Bank X, that lender has to believe that Bank X will get another $99 billion in one-day loans. Then, Bank X may fail simply because every possible lender believes correctly that no lender is willing to lend to Bank X. Such a crisis of confidence can occur regardless of the true condition of Bank X.\nThis story is hardly a new one. It’s exactly why we have deposit insurance: to prevent runs by reassuring short-term bank depositors that their money is safe. But the story has huge consequences for how governments operate. In a financial crisis, there is a tremendous sense of uncertainty. There are some truly insolvent financial firms out there—but no one knows for sure which ones are insolvent and which are sound. And during a crisis, the panic in the air means that any institution—even one with solid fundamentals—may be subjected to a run if its investors lose confidence in its solvency.\nIn such an atmosphere, contagion effects become extremely powerful. Even a slight loss by one short-term creditor can lead all short-term lenders to rush to the safety of Treasury bills. Such flight would endanger the survival of key financial institutions, even if they are fundamentally sound. Governments cannot risk systemic collapse, and so during times of crisis, they end up providing debt guarantees for financial institutions. Thus, policymakers inevitably resort to bailouts even when they have explicitly resolved, in the strongest possible terms, to let firms fail.\nMany observers have emphasized the need for better resolution mechanisms as part of financial regulatory reform. Different people mean different things by this, but most want to impose losses on debt holders. I’m not opposed to faster and better resolution of bankruptcies. But I do not believe that better resolution mechanisms will end bailouts. Indeed, I’m led to make a prediction. No matter what mechanisms we legislate now to impose losses on creditors, Congress, or some agency acting on Congress’ behalf, will block those mechanisms when we next face a financial crisis. And Congress will do so for a very good reason: to forestall a run on the key players in the financial system and thereby prevent system-wide collapse.\nInvestment Inefficiencies\nSo, that’s my first point: Bailouts are inevitable during financial crises. Let me move to the second: Anticipation of bailouts creates inefficiency in the allocation of real investment. Here’s what I mean. Financial institutions make investments that are, by their very nature, risky—that is, their returns are not certain. They finance these investments, at least in part, using debt and deposits.\nNow, imagine for a moment that we live in a world without bailouts, so that the government does not provide debt guarantees or deposit insurance. In such a world, if a financial institution decided to increase the risk level of its investment portfolio, its debt holders and depositors would face a greater risk of loss. By way of compensation for that greater risk, they’d demand a higher yield. As a result, in the absence of government guarantees, financial institutions would find it more costly to obtain debt financing for highly risky investments than for less risky ones. This effect, on the margin, would curb a firm’s appetite for risk. It would have an especially powerful effect on highly leveraged financial institutions, because high debt-to-asset levels mean higher risk of being unable to fulfill debt obligations.\nBut now return to the real world, with deposit insurance and debt guarantees, and the inevitability of government bailouts. Even if they only kick in during financial crises, these guarantees change the natural market relationship between risk and cost. Depositors and debt holders are now partially insulated from increases in investment risk, and so they do not demand a sufficiently high yield from riskier firms. Financial institutions take on too much risk, because they are no longer deterred from doing so by the high cost of debt finance. And this missing deterrence is especially relevant for firms that are highly leveraged, because they should be paying out especially high yields on their debts.\nIn this way, the expectation of bailouts leads to too much capital being allocated toward overly risky ventures. These misallocations of capital don’t create the collective mistakes in predictions that generate financial crises. But the misallocations do mean that society loses a lot from those mistakes—a lot more than is efficient.\nRegulatory Responses\nThere are a number of regulatory responses that would help mitigate the misallocation problem just described. In its June 27 communiqué, the G-20 put special emphasis on enhancing capital and liquidity requirements. Both would deter risk-taking by financial institutions. However, it is important to understand and consider the costs that they impose on an economy.\nLet me talk first about capital. High capital requirements are designed to reduce the amount of debt issued by a financial institution. With less debt, there are fewer failing firms that policymakers must bail out during financial crises. With lowered needs for government debt guarantees, there is less inefficiency. Consider the extreme situation of a financial institution that is financed only by equity, and not by debt or deposits. Such an institution would never get any bailouts from the government, and so would not engage in excessive risk-taking.\nHowever, financial economists have long recognized that debt has important benefits. Outside investors are typically not as well-informed about firm attributes as decision makers inside a firm. In this context, debt—and the associated threat of bankruptcy—helps discipline firm insiders. For example, one essential feature of equity is that a firm can vary its dividend payments to investors. But this very flexibility allows managers and other firm insiders more freedom to divert firm income to themselves and away from outside investors. Having to repay debt imposes much sharper constraints on managers—a discipline that both equity holders and debt holders value. As a result, firms that use a mix of debt and equity should be able to raise more outside funds for a given investment opportunity than firms that use equity alone.\nThe above argument applies to all kinds of debt. (In passing, the argument depends on the firm’s debt only being guaranteed during financial crises. Perfectly guaranteed debt holders, such as depositors, will impose no discipline on managers.) However, short-term debt is especially relevant. Suppose outside investors learn that a firm’s managerial team has been making poor choices. In this context, equity holders and long-term debt holders cannot retrieve their investments without finding some other firm outsider to buy them. In contrast, short-term debt holders and depositors have the ability to withdraw their entire investment from the firm without using sales.\nTo sum up: It is true that debt—especially short-term debt—increases the size of government transfers that a given firm will potentially receive during a financial panic. From that point of view, restrictions on debt issuance are attractive. At the same time, debt—especially short-term debt—helps align the incentives of managerial insiders and investing outsiders. Tougher capital standards will undercut this alignment, and inhibit economic growth.\nAnother potentially useful regulatory response emphasized in the G-20 communiqué is to require financial institutions to hold more liquid assets. Again, such a requirement would help reduce the need for government bailouts. Consider an extreme example. Suppose all financial institutions were required to hold cash equal in value to their deposits. There would be no need for deposit insurance, as depositors would always be sure that they could obtain their funds.\nSuch a regulation would obviously be inefficient, though. While it is certainly true that bank depositors have the right to retrieve their deposits within seconds, they rarely exercise that right. The typical dollar stays in a bank for many months before being withdrawn. This timing means that banks can safely invest deposits in longer-term, higher-yield investments. Indeed, many economists have identified this so-called “maturity transformation” of demandable deposits into long-term investments as being the defining feature of banks.\nSo there are benefits and costs associated with liquidity requirements, just as there are with capital requirements. Banks with more liquid asset holdings are certainly better protected against the possibility of runs, but they’re also performing less of the maturity transformation that improves capital allocation and economic efficiency. The right liquidity requirement for a given bank will depend critically on the nature of its investment opportunities, the fluctuations in the inflows and outflows of its deposits, and its ability to access short-term debt funding.\nAlong with capital and liquidity requirements, financial regulators have a host of other approaches at their disposal to curb excessive risk-taking. With this portfolio of possible instruments, it is important to find the right combination of regulations for financial firms. However, as we have discussed for capital and liquidity requirements, all regulations have private costs as well as social benefits. Because of these private costs, regulators cannot find the optimal mix of regulatory requirements for a firm without solving that firm’s cost minimization problem with respect to capital, liquidity and many other variables.\nTaxes\nIs there a different government response to excessive risk-taking that would allow regulators to avoid solving the cost minimization problems of financial firms? In what follows, I offer an analogy from a completely different arena of public policy that can help us think through this key question.\nConsider a factory that creates air pollution as a byproduct of operation. When the firm that owns the factory chooses to produce more output, it incurs various private costs: more raw materials, more labor, and so on. But the production increase also generates more pollution that will be absorbed by the surrounding community. The pollution is a social cost of production not paid for, or “internalized,” by the firm that generates it. Economists refer to such costs as “externalities.”\nThis same distinction between private and social costs applies to financial institutions that enjoy debt guarantees. Such guarantees imply that some portion of the risk produced by a firm’s investment decisions is absorbed by taxpayers. In making decisions about what to invest in, the firm ignores that portion of risk. It is a social cost of the project that the private firm does not internalize. Just like the pollution, the risk borne by taxpayers is an externality—what I will call a “risk externality.”\nThis analogy is useful because economists know a lot about how to deal with externalities. We can exploit their years of research to address the problem of financial regulation when government bailouts are inevitable. In particular, that long history of thought says that the best way to correct externalities is by providing the right kinds of incentives through appropriate taxes.\nLet me be more specific. Again, let’s think about the firm with a polluting factory. Many of its choices affect the amount of pollution generated, including the amount of time that the firm runs the factory during the workweek, the sorts of antipollution technology employed, and the kind of energy used to run the factory. Now, the government could regulate the firm’s pollution levels by controlling each and every one of these choices. However, to do so, the government has to choose how to trade off these three (and other) factors against one another.\nIts trade-off decisions will be influenced by both pollution considerations and cost factors. If antipollution technology is cheap, the government may simply require the firm to invest in that. But if antipollution technology is expensive, the government may require the firm to buy clean energy instead. Making these trade-offs requires a tremendous amount of firm-specific information and firm-specific cost minimization analysis. To put it mildly, historical evidence suggests that governments are not very good at such micromanagement of factory-level operation; that’s why we have private markets.\nThe solution to this difficulty is to regulate the amount of pollution generated by the firm, rather than how the firm creates it. The central problem here is that pollution has a social cost that the firm does not internalize when choosing its level of production. From society’s point of view, the firm will generate excessive pollution. However, the firm will create the socially efficient level of pollution if it is required to pay for—or internalize—its full social cost.\nMore concretely, suppose that the firm is told, before choosing its level of production, that the government will measure the amount of pollution that the firm generates and charge the firm a tax that is exactly equal to the social cost of that quantity of pollution. This policy generates a tax schedule that translates the amount of pollution generated into an amount paid by the firm. If the firm knows that it faces this tax schedule, its costs of production will include the social cost of pollution, along with the costs of labor, materials, energy, and the like. In this way, what was external to the firm becomes internal. As a result, the firm will choose the socially efficient level of pollution. Just as importantly, it will automatically choose to create that pollution—and the factory’s more beneficial outputs—in a cost-minimizing fashion. Governments do not need to solve the firm’s cost-minimization problem.\nLessons for Financial Regulation\nThese lessons about pollution regulation translate directly into lessons for financial regulation. As in the pollution case, a financial institution should be taxed for the amount of risk it creates that is borne by taxpayers. Once the firm faces the correct tax, it will choose to produce that risk with a cost-minimizing mix of capital, liquidity, incentive compensation and other factors. As in the pollution case, using taxes to discourage excessive risk saves the government from actually trying to solve the cost-minimization problem of financial firms.\nThis reasoning suggests the following idealized policy. The firm is told that the government will estimate the expected, discounted value of bailouts that the financial institution (or any of its stakeholders) will receive in the future. I say “expected” because the amount of the bailout is uncertain (and indeed is likely to be zero much of the time). I say “discounted” because the bailout may be received next year or in 30 years, and we need to discount accordingly. Getting the right discount rate is important. The bailouts will be large when the stock market and the economy are doing poorly. In the language of finance, the bailouts have a negative beta. It follows that the appropriate discount rate should be less—and possibly substantially less—than the rate of return on Treasuries.\nClearly, this estimate will depend on many firm choices and attributes, including its leverage ratio, the maturity structure of its liabilities, the risk characteristics of its investment portfolio, its incentive compensation schemes, and its involvement in the payment system. For example, the expected bailout will be higher for firms with highly risky investments than for firms with less risky portfolios.\nHaving done this calculation, the government then charges the firm a tax that is exactly equal to the expected discounted value of the firm’s bailouts. Just as in the pollution example, this measurement-plus-taxation policy confronts the firm with a tax schedule that translates its choices into a cost paid by the firm. The tax amount exactly equals the extra cost borne by the taxpayers because of bailouts, appropriately adjusted for risk and the time value of money. Knowing that it faces this tax schedule, the firm no longer has an incentive to undertake inefficiently risky investments. Its investment choices will be socially efficient. It is useful to tax a financial institution producing a risk externality, just as it is useful to tax a firm generating a pollution externality. The purpose of the tax in both instances is to ensure that the targeted firm pays the full costs—private and social—of its production decisions.\nMy proposed tax creates the right kinds of incentives for risk-taking. As I mentioned in the introduction, these incentives are distinct from revenue objectives. The risk tax will raise some amount of revenue. Governments wishing to collect more revenue from the financial sector can impose an additional one-time levy on financial institutions that is not risk-based. Other governments may want to collect less revenue from the financial sector. In that case, they can transfer back some of the risk tax collections. These transfers need to be structured so that they do not undo the incentives in the risk tax itself. For example, they could simply be spread evenly across all financial institutions.\nA risk tax does require bank supervisors to calculate the expected present value of future bailout payments. These calculations are likely to be complex in a number of ways. Moreover, the calculations could well be controversial. Financial institutions that follow highly risky strategies get especially high profits when those strategies are working. Thus, supervisors would be required to levy high risk taxes on exactly those institutions that appear to be extremely successful. To address these issues of complexity and controversy, it would be of great value to develop an objective way—with the use of market information— to compute the required tax.\nHere’s what I have in mind. Suppose that, for every relevant financial institution, the government issues a “rescue bond.”  The rescue bond pays a variable coupon equal to 1/1,000 of the transfers made from the taxpayer to the institution or its stakeholders. (I pick 1/1,000 out of the air; any fixed fraction will do.) Much of the time, this coupon will be zero, because bailouts aren’t necessary and so the firm will not receive transfers. However, just like the institution’s stakeholders, the owners of the rescue bond will occasionally receive a large payment. In a well-functioning market, the price of this bond is exactly equal to the 1/1,000 of the expected discounted value of the transfers to the firm and its stakeholders. Thus, the government should charge the financial firm a tax equal to 1,000 times the price of the bond. Note that the “rescue” bond is only a measurement device. In particular, it is not part of the financial firm’s rescue. \nNotice that this approach could be used for a wide variety of financial institutions, including nonbanks. In principle, the government need not figure out in advance exactly which are systemically important and which are not. Instead, it could simply issue a rescue bond for every institution. Then the market itself could reveal how systemically important each institution is through the price of its rescue bonds. Of course, markets are not always perfect. It may not always be appropriate to rely only on market measures to compute the appropriate taxes. However, even in these cases, the prices of rescue bonds would contain valuable information that should be an important input into the supervisory process.\nGeneral Rules for Implementation\nIn describing the above tax system, I’ve glossed over a variety of political and administrative realities. In this sense, I would have to say that my tax system should be viewed as an ideal. Nonetheless, like all economic ideals, I believe that it suggests general rules that can be used to discipline the construction of any tax on financial institution risk.\nThe first rule is that a useful tax on risk must take into account the existence of deposit insurance. Deposit insurance means that deposit rates of return are independent of the underlying risk in bank assets. Like any debt guarantee, it incentivizes excessive risk-taking by financial institutions. A good tax must undo these incentives.\nIn many countries, banks pay risk-based deposit insurance premia. If levied on top of an explicit risk tax, these premia create the possibility of inefficient double taxation. However, it is straightforward to design a tax system that avoids this possibility. First, calculate the overall tax on risk for the financial institution (based on its assets, liabilities and other attributes). Then, deduct whatever premium the bank is paying to the deposit insurer.\nAlternatively, it may be desirable to simply re-label what I’m terming a “bank tax” or “risk tax” as a “systemic insurance premium.” It could then be collected by a regulatory agency, as opposed to the Treasury.\nThe second rule is that risk taxes must always be collected. Many of the proposals for taxes on financial institutions (and the actual law in Sweden) put a cap on tax collections. Once that cap is reached, banks will no longer face taxes for taking on extra risk and will again have an incentive to engage in excessively risky investments.\nAs I indicated earlier, it’s important to keep revenue objectives separate from incentive correction. Some governments may find it desirable to stop collecting revenues from the financial sector after some point in time. They can readily do so while preserving the incentives of the risk tax system. My point is that those incentives must always be kept in place.\nThe third rule is that any tax on risk must incorporate market information. The goal of a tax on risk is to force financial institutions to internalize the costs that their investing decisions impose on taxpayers by virtue of government debt guarantees. These costs are forward-looking valuations of future risky cash flows. It is impossible to have accurate measures of the costs without market information about both the quantity and the price of risk embedded in these cash flows.\nRescue bonds provide one highly precise but perhaps impractical way to use market information. A cruder, possibly more practical approach would be to use measures from the ratings agencies. Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s each provide two distinct ratings for the debt of various financial institutions. One rating considers the financial institutions as they are, and the other considers the institutions in an imaginary world without government support. The difference between the two is termed “ratings uplift” and it can be substantial. In principle, a regulator can translate these uplifts into differences in debt yields, and thereby into measures of implicit government subsidies.\nConclusions\nLet me close with some final thoughts about capital. As I stated earlier, the June 27 G-20 communiqué emphasizes the role of capital requirements in forging a new regulatory structure. The communiqué suggests that banks be required to hold enough capital “to withstand … stresses of a magnitude that they experienced during the recent financial crisis” without government support. This response strikes me as being problematic in a couple of ways. \nFirst, good financial regulations should take into account the probability and timing of various possible outcomes. The recent crisis is generally agreed to be the biggest of its kind since 1929. Should financial institutions be required to protect themselves fully against shocks that take place just once in eighty years? This kind of extreme risk aversion in regulatory design seems likely to create an undue drag on economic growth.\nParadoxically, the G-20’s capital requirement proposal also strikes me as too weak. The magnitude of our recent financial crisis was created in part by the investment decisions of leading global financial institutions. These institutions have the ability to generate even bigger shocks and their creditors would be likely to receive even more substantial government transfers in that event. Good regulation should deter them from creating the potential for adverse shocks bigger than those we have observed historically. The proposed capital standard does not.\nThus, capital is at once too strong a tool and too weak a tool. More generally, it seems to me that capital and liquidity requirements are intrinsically backwards-looking. We need forward-looking instruments for what is intrinsically a forward-looking problem. And that’s a key reason why taxes, based on market information, will work better.\nTo wrap up: Bailouts will inevitably happen during financial crises to prevent runs and systemic collapse. We need to structure financial regulation so as to limit the size and frequency of these bailouts. How should we best design such regulations? The social distortion we face is that debt guarantees create a risk externality, because financial institutions do not bear the full costs of their investment choices. Financial regulation should be designed to best control that externality. Capital and liquidity requirements may be helpful, but they are likely to create inefficient drags on growth.\nInstead, as is true with any externality, the risk externality can be eliminated with a well-designed tax system. I’ve suggested some properties for a good tax system. In particular, I believe that any such tax should embed appropriate information from financial markets.\n1 Kocherlakota, Narayana R. 2010. “Taxing Risk.” Comments at the Economic Club of Minnesota (May 10): Minneapolis, Minn.

Thus, policymakers inevitably resort to bailouts even when they have explicitly resolved, in the strongest possible terms, to let firms fail.\n\nMany observers have emphasized the need for better resolution mechanisms as part of financial regulatory reform. Different people mean different things by this, but most want to impose losses on debt holders. I’m not opposed to faster and better resolution of bankruptcies. But I do not believe that better resolution mechanisms will end bailouts. Indeed, I’m led to make a prediction. No matter what mechanisms we legislate now to impose losses on creditors, Congress, or some agency acting on Congress’ behalf, will block those mechanisms when we next face a financial crisis. And Congress will do so for a very good reason: to forestall a run on the key players in the financial system and thereby prevent system-wide collapse.\n\nSo, that’s my first point: Bailouts are inevitable during financial crises. Let me move to the second: Anticipation of bailouts creates inefficiency in the allocation of real investment. Here’s what I mean. Financial institutions make investments that are, by their very nature, risky—that is, their returns are not certain. They finance these investments, at least in part, using debt and deposits.\n\nNow, imagine for a moment that we live in a world without bailouts, so that the government does not provide debt guarantees or deposit insurance. In such a world, if a financial institution decided to increase the risk level of its investment portfolio, its debt holders and depositors would face a greater risk of loss. By way of compensation for that greater risk, they’d demand a higher yield. As a result, in the absence of government guarantees, financial institutions would find it more costly to obtain debt financing for highly risky investments than for less risky ones. This effect, on the margin, would curb a firm’s appetite for risk. It would have an especially powerful effect on highly leveraged financial institutions, because high debt-to-asset levels mean higher risk of being unable to fulfill debt obligations.\n\nBut now return to the real world, with deposit insurance and debt guarantees, and the inevitability of government bailouts. Even if they only kick in during financial crises, these guarantees change the natural market relationship between risk and cost. Depositors and debt holders are now partially insulated from increases in investment risk, and so they do not demand a sufficiently high yield from riskier firms. Financial institutions take on too much risk, because they are no longer deterred from doing so by the high cost of debt finance. And this missing deterrence is especially relevant for firms that are highly leveraged, because they should be paying out especially high yields on their debts.\n\nIn this way, the expectation of bailouts leads to too much capital being allocated toward overly risky ventures. These misallocations of capital don’t create the collective mistakes in predictions that generate financial crises. But the misallocations do mean that society loses a lot from those mistakes—a lot more than is efficient.\n\nThere are a number of regulatory responses that would help mitigate the misallocation problem just described. In its June 27 communiqué, the G-20 put special emphasis on enhancing capital and liquidity requirements. Both would deter risk-taking by financial institutions. However, it is important to understand and consider the costs that they impose on an economy.\n\nLet me talk first about capital. High capital requirements are designed to reduce the amount of debt issued by a financial institution. With less debt, there are fewer failing firms that policymakers must bail out during financial crises. With lowered needs for government debt guarantees, there is less inefficiency. Consider the extreme situation of a financial institution that is financed only by equity, and not by debt or deposits. Such an institution would never get any bailouts from the government, and so would not engage in excessive risk-taking.\n\nHowever, financial economists have long recognized that debt has important benefits. Outside investors are typically not as well-informed about firm attributes as decision makers inside a firm. In this context, debt—and the associated threat of bankruptcy—helps discipline firm insiders. For example, one essential feature of equity is that a firm can vary its dividend payments to investors. But this very flexibility allows managers and other firm insiders more freedom to divert firm income to themselves and away from outside investors. Having to repay debt imposes much sharper constraints on managers—a discipline that both equity holders and debt holders value. As a result, firms that use a mix of debt and equity should be able to raise more outside funds for a given investment opportunity than firms that use equity alone.\n\nThe above argument applies to all kinds of debt. (In passing, the argument depends on the firm’s debt only being guaranteed during financial crises. Perfectly guaranteed debt holders, such as depositors, will impose no discipline on managers.) However, short-term debt is especially relevant. Suppose outside investors learn that a firm’s managerial team has been making poor choices. In this context, equity holders and long-term debt holders cannot retrieve their investments without finding some other firm outsider to buy them. In contrast, short-term debt holders and depositors have the ability to withdraw their entire investment from the firm without using sales.\n\nTo sum up: It is true that debt—especially short-term debt—increases the size of government transfers that a given firm will potentially receive during a financial panic. From that point of view, restrictions on debt issuance are attractive. At the same time, debt—especially short-term debt—helps align the incentives of managerial insiders and investing outsiders. Tougher capital standards will undercut this alignment, and inhibit economic growth.\n\nAnother potentially useful regulatory response emphasized in the G-20 communiqué is to require financial institutions to hold more liquid assets. Again, such a requirement would help reduce the need for government bailouts. Consider an extreme example. Suppose all financial institutions were required to hold cash equal in value to their deposits. There would be no need for deposit insurance, as depositors would always be sure that they could obtain their funds.\n\nSuch a regulation would obviously be inefficient, though. While it is certainly true that bank depositors have the right to retrieve their deposits within seconds, they rarely exercise that right. The typical dollar stays in a bank for many months before being withdrawn. This timing means that banks can safely invest deposits in longer-term, higher-yield investments. Indeed, many economists have identified this so-called “maturity transformation” of demandable deposits into long-term investments as being the defining feature of banks.\n\nSo there are benefits and costs associated with liquidity requirements, just as there are with capital requirements. Banks with more liquid asset holdings are certainly better protected against the possibility of runs, but they’re also performing less of the maturity transformation that improves capital allocation and economic efficiency. The right liquidity requirement for a given bank will depend critically on the nature of its investment opportunities, the fluctuations in the inflows and outflows of its deposits, and its ability to access short-term debt funding.\n\nAlong with capital and liquidity requirements, financial regulators have a host of other approaches at their disposal to curb excessive risk-taking. With this portfolio of possible instruments, it is important to find the right combination of regulations for financial firms. However, as we have discussed for capital and liquidity requirements, all regulations have private costs as well as social benefits. Because of these private costs, regulators cannot find the optimal mix of regulatory requirements for a firm without solving that firm’s cost minimization problem with respect to capital, liquidity and many other variables.\n\nIs there a different government response to excessive risk-taking that would allow regulators to avoid solving the cost minimization problems of financial firms? In what follows, I offer an analogy from a completely different arena of public policy that can help us think through this key question.\n\nConsider a factory that creates air pollution as a byproduct of operation. When the firm that owns the factory chooses to produce more output, it incurs various private costs: more raw materials, more labor, and so on. But the production increase also generates more pollution that will be absorbed by the surrounding community. The pollution is a social cost of production not paid for, or “internalized,” by the firm that generates it. Economists refer to such costs as “externalities.”\n\nThis same distinction between private and social costs applies to financial institutions that enjoy debt guarantees. Such guarantees imply that some portion of the risk produced by a firm’s investment decisions is absorbed by taxpayers. In making decisions about what to invest in, the firm ignores that portion of risk. It is a social cost of the project that the private firm does not internalize. Just like the pollution, the risk borne by taxpayers is an externality—what I will call a “risk externality.”\n\nThis analogy is useful because economists know a lot about how to deal with externalities. We can exploit their years of research to address the problem of financial regulation when government bailouts are inevitable. In particular, that long history of thought says that the best way to correct externalities is by providing the right kinds of incentives through appropriate taxes.\n\nLet me be more specific. Again, let’s think about the firm with a polluting factory. Many of its choices affect the amount of pollution generated, including the amount of time that the firm runs the factory during the workweek, the sorts of antipollution technology employed, and the kind of energy used to run the factory. Now, the government could regulate the firm’s pollution levels by controlling each and every one of these choices. However, to do so, the government has to choose how to trade off these three (and other) factors against one another.\n\nIts trade-off decisions will be influenced by both pollution considerations and cost factors. If antipollution technology is cheap, the government may simply require the firm to invest in that. But if antipollution technology is expensive, the government may require the firm to buy clean energy instead. Making these trade-offs requires a tremendous amount of firm-specific information and firm-specific cost minimization analysis. To put it mildly, historical evidence suggests that governments are not very good at such micromanagement of factory-level operation; that’s why we have private markets.\n\nThe solution to this difficulty is to regulate the amount of pollution generated by the firm, rather than how the firm creates it. The central problem here is that pollution has a social cost that the firm does not internalize when choosing its level of production. From society’s point of view, the firm will generate excessive pollution. However, the firm will create the socially efficient level of pollution if it is required to pay for—or internalize—its full social cost.\n\nMore concretely, suppose that the firm is told, before choosing its level of production, that the government will measure the amount of pollution that the firm generates and charge the firm a tax that is exactly equal to the social cost of that quantity of pollution. This policy generates a tax schedule that translates the amount of pollution generated into an amount paid by the firm. If the firm knows that it faces this tax schedule, its costs of production will include the social cost of pollution, along with the costs of labor, materials, energy, and the like. In this way, what was external to the firm becomes internal. As a result, the firm will choose the socially efficient level of pollution. Just as importantly, it will automatically choose to create that pollution—and the factory’s more beneficial outputs—in a cost-minimizing fashion. Governments do not need to solve the firm’s cost-minimization problem.\n\nThese lessons about pollution regulation translate directly into lessons for financial regulation. As in the pollution case, a financial institution should be taxed for the amount of risk it creates that is borne by taxpayers. Once the firm faces the correct tax, it will choose to produce that risk with a cost-minimizing mix of capital, liquidity, incentive compensation and other factors. As in the pollution case, using taxes to discourage excessive risk saves the government from actually trying to solve the cost-minimization problem of financial firms.\n\nThis reasoning suggests the following idealized policy. The firm is told that the government will estimate the expected, discounted value of bailouts that the financial institution (or any of its stakeholders) will receive in the future. I say “expected” because the amount of the bailout is uncertain (and indeed is likely to be zero much of the time). I say “discounted” because the bailout may be received next year or in 30 years, and we need to discount accordingly. Getting the right discount rate is important. The bailouts will be large when the stock market and the economy are doing poorly. In the language of finance, the bailouts have a negative beta. It follows that the appropriate discount rate should be less—and possibly substantially less—than the rate of return on Treasuries.\n\nClearly, this estimate will depend on many firm choices and attributes, including its leverage ratio, the maturity structure of its liabilities, the risk characteristics of its investment portfolio, its incentive compensation schemes, and its involvement in the payment system. For example, the expected bailout will be higher for firms with highly risky investments than for firms with less risky portfolios.\n\nHaving done this calculation, the government then charges the firm a tax that is exactly equal to the expected discounted value of the firm’s bailouts. Just as in the pollution example, this measurement-plus-taxation policy confronts the firm with a tax schedule that translates its choices into a cost paid by the firm. The tax amount exactly equals the extra cost borne by the taxpayers because of bailouts, appropriately adjusted for risk and the time value of money. Knowing that it faces this tax schedule, the firm no longer has an incentive to undertake inefficiently risky investments. Its investment choices will be socially efficient. It is useful to tax a financial institution producing a risk externality, just as it is useful to tax a firm generating a pollution externality. The purpose of the tax in both instances is to ensure that the targeted firm pays the full costs—private and social—of its production decisions.\n\nMy proposed tax creates the right kinds of incentives for risk-taking. As I mentioned in the introduction, these incentives are distinct from revenue objectives. The risk tax will raise some amount of revenue. Governments wishing to collect more revenue from the financial sector can impose an additional one-time levy on financial institutions that is not risk-based. Other governments may want to collect less revenue from the financial sector. In that case, they can transfer back some of the risk tax collections. These transfers need to be structured so that they do not undo the incentives in the risk tax itself. For example, they could simply be spread evenly across all financial institutions.\n\nA risk tax does require bank supervisors to calculate the expected present value of future bailout payments. These calculations are likely to be complex in a number of ways. Moreover, the calculations could well be controversial. Financial institutions that follow highly risky strategies get especially high profits when those strategies are working. Thus, supervisors would be required to levy high risk taxes on exactly those institutions that appear to be extremely successful. To address these issues of complexity and controversy, it would be of great value to develop an objective way—with the use of market information— to compute the required tax.\n\nHere’s what I have in mind. Suppose that, for every relevant financial institution, the government issues a “rescue bond.”  The rescue bond pays a variable coupon equal to 1/1,000 of the transfers made from the taxpayer to the institution or its stakeholders. (I pick 1/1,000 out of the air; any fixed fraction will do.) Much of the time, this coupon will be zero, because bailouts aren’t necessary and so the firm will not receive transfers. However, just like the institution’s stakeholders, the owners of the rescue bond will occasionally receive a large payment. In a well-functioning market, the price of this bond is exactly equal to the 1/1,000 of the expected discounted value of the transfers to the firm and its stakeholders. Thus, the government should charge the financial firm a tax equal to 1,000 times the price of the bond. Note that the “rescue” bond is only a measurement device. In particular, it is not part of the financial firm’s rescue.\n\nNotice that this approach could be used for a wide variety of financial institutions, including nonbanks. In principle, the government need not figure out in advance exactly which are systemically important and which are not. Instead, it could simply issue a rescue bond for every institution. Then the market itself could reveal how systemically important each institution is through the price of its rescue bonds. Of course, markets are not always perfect. It may not always be appropriate to rely only on market measures to compute the appropriate taxes. However, even in these cases, the prices of rescue bonds would contain valuable information that should be an important input into the supervisory process.\n\nIn describing the above tax system, I’ve glossed over a variety of political and administrative realities. In this sense, I would have to say that my tax system should be viewed as an ideal. Nonetheless, like all economic ideals, I believe that it suggests general rules that can be used to discipline the construction of any tax on financial institution risk.\n\nThe first rule is that a useful tax on risk must take into account the existence of deposit insurance. Deposit insurance means that deposit rates of return are independent of the underlying risk in bank assets. Like any debt guarantee, it incentivizes excessive risk-taking by financial institutions. A good tax must undo these incentives.\n\nIn many countries, banks pay risk-based deposit insurance premia. If levied on top of an explicit risk tax, these premia create the possibility of inefficient double taxation. However, it is straightforward to design a tax system that avoids this possibility. First, calculate the overall tax on risk for the financial institution (based on its assets, liabilities and other attributes). Then, deduct whatever premium the bank is paying to the deposit insurer.\n\nAlternatively, it may be desirable to simply re-label what I’m terming a “bank tax” or “risk tax” as a “systemic insurance premium.” It could then be collected by a regulatory agency, as opposed to the Treasury.\n\nThe second rule is that risk taxes must always be collected. Many of the proposals for taxes on financial institutions (and the actual law in Sweden) put a cap on tax collections. Once that cap is reached, banks will no longer face taxes for taking on extra risk and will again have an incentive to engage in excessively risky investments.\n\nAs I indicated earlier, it’s important to keep revenue objectives separate from incentive correction. Some governments may find it desirable to stop collecting revenues from the financial sector after some point in time. They can readily do so while preserving the incentives of the risk tax system. My point is that those incentives must always be kept in place.\n\nThe third rule is that any tax on risk must incorporate market information. The goal of a tax on risk is to force financial institutions to internalize the costs that their investing decisions impose on taxpayers by virtue of government debt guarantees. These costs are forward-looking valuations of future risky cash flows. It is impossible to have accurate measures of the costs without market information about both the quantity and the price of risk embedded in these cash flows.\n\nRescue bonds provide one highly precise but perhaps impractical way to use market information. A cruder, possibly more practical approach would be to use measures from the ratings agencies. Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s each provide two distinct ratings for the debt of various financial institutions. One rating considers the financial institutions as they are, and the other considers the institutions in an imaginary world without government support. The difference between the two is termed “ratings uplift” and it can be substantial. In principle, a regulator can translate these uplifts into differences in debt yields, and thereby into measures of implicit government subsidies.\n\nLet me close with some final thoughts about capital. As I stated earlier, the June 27 G-20 communiqué emphasizes the role of capital requirements in forging a new regulatory structure. The communiqué suggests that banks be required to hold enough capital “to withstand … stresses of a magnitude that they experienced during the recent financial crisis” without government support. This response strikes me as being problematic in a couple of ways.\n\nFirst, good financial regulations should take into account the probability and timing of various possible outcomes. The recent crisis is generally agreed to be the biggest of its kind since 1929. Should financial institutions be required to protect themselves fully against shocks that take place just once in eighty years? This kind of extreme risk aversion in regulatory design seems likely to create an undue drag on economic growth.\n\nParadoxically, the G-20’s capital requirement proposal also strikes me as too weak. The magnitude of our recent financial crisis was created in part by the investment decisions of leading global financial institutions. These institutions have the ability to generate even bigger shocks and their creditors would be likely to receive even more substantial government transfers in that event. Good regulation should deter them from creating the potential for adverse shocks bigger than those we have observed historically. The proposed capital standard does not.\n\nThus, capital is at once too strong a tool and too weak a tool. More generally, it seems to me that capital and liquidity requirements are intrinsically backwards-looking. We need forward-looking instruments for what is intrinsically a forward-looking problem. And that’s a key reason why taxes, based on market information, will work better.\n\nTo wrap up: Bailouts will inevitably happen during financial crises to prevent runs and systemic collapse. We need to structure financial regulation so as to limit the size and frequency of these bailouts. How should we best design such regulations? The social distortion we face is that debt guarantees create a risk externality, because financial institutions do not bear the full costs of their investment choices. Financial regulation should be designed to best control that externality. Capital and liquidity requirements may be helpful, but they are likely to create inefficient drags on growth.\n\nInstead, as is true with any externality, the risk externality can be eliminated with a well-designed tax system. I’ve suggested some properties for a good tax system. In particular, I believe that any such tax should embed appropriate information from financial markets."

        "content": "Congratulations! You have earned your college degree. Now, I’m sure that I’m not the first to congratulate you. Your parents have congratulated you. Your aunt and uncle have congratulated you. In fact, if you’re lucky, even your teen-age brother or sister has found the time in their busy lives to congratulate you.\nWhy does everyone congratulate you? I’m going to give you two answers to that question. The first is pretty uncontroversial, while the second is more so.\nI first want to talk about your college degree as a successful financial investment. My guess is that most of you have not done a lot of financial investing yet. When I was in college, I liked to put my spare money into pizza and not into stocks or bonds. (Pizza pays off—but in pounds not dollars. That’s a pun, and a great example of what economists call humor.) But, whether you realize it or not, going to college was an investment. Anytime you give up some money today in exchange for money in the future—well, that’s an investment. And making good investments is critical to being financially successful.\nEconomists rank investments by what we call investment returns—that is, what you get back per dollar invested. If you give up $100,000 and get back $8,000 per year forever—well, that’s a return of 8 percent per year. If you give up $200,000, and get back $8,000 per year forever—well, that’s a return of 4 percent per year. The second investment is not as good as the first (assuming that they have the same levels of risk). We can compare any two investments, no matter how different they seem, by comparing their returns.\nYour college education was a big investment. You—and your investment partners—gave up about $40,000 in tuition. But that’s just the beginning—you couldn’t work full time while in college, and so you lost out on four years of part-time wages. All told, my guess is that you gave up something on the order of $100,000.\nSo, the college education investment was a big one, in terms of what you put in. But you also will get something big out of that investment—higher wages upon graduation, and then higher wages for the rest of your working life. What is the expected return on investing in a college education—that is, what will you get back in terms of increased wages per dollar that you invested? Recent studies estimate that finishing college over high school delivers a return of somewhere between 8 percent and 10 percent per year.1 Is this a big number? Well, historically, the rate of return on the stock market is around 6-7 percent per year. So, by investing in a college education, you can beat the stock market! That’s especially true because the return to a college education is much less risky.\nThese numbers are pretty well-known. The real kicker is the value of a four-year degree over a two-year degree. You’ve received your degree at the University of Minnesota. You could’ve earned a two-year degree instead. But four years of post-high school education delivers a return of about 15-20 percent per year over two years of post-high school education. That’s over twice the return to the stock market.\nNow, there is a complicating factor to this somewhat rosy scenario that’s probably occurred to all of you: We are coming out of one of the worst economic downturns since the Great Depression. Jobs are not in abundance.\nFortunately, this doesn’t change the story—and that’s something that I can tell you from personal experience. I graduated from college in June 1983, when the unemployment rate was actually even higher than it is today. Now it is true that when I graduated, the slack job market put downward pressure on all wages, including those of college grads. However, over time, the wages of these June 1983 grads did rise, and the negative effects of the recession were largely lost. Even in a tough job market, my cohort found that college remained a good investment.\nAnd that’s my first reason for congratulating you! You’ve made a great financial investment. In fact, my bet is that few of you will ever make a better one. I never have.\nBut I have a second reason for why you should be so happy today. It’s related to a question that may have occurred to you already: If going to a four-year college is such a great deal, why don’t more people get four-year college degrees?\nThere are a lot of possible answers to this question, including some significant issues related to credit access. However, the most important answer is also the simplest answer: Some people like college better than others. Now, I’m not saying that there are some people who like college parties and other people who don’t. That’s probably true, but it’s not the main reason why some students invest $100K in themselves and others don’t. What I’m saying is that some people enjoy learning and others don’t. Those who like to learn—well, they go to college and spend four challenging years learning. Those who don’t like to learn—well, they don’t finish, and in many cases they don’t even start.2\nI think that this simple story—that people go to college because they like to learn—says something deep about college, and especially about a college of liberal arts. As a student, I took a lot of courses in the liberal arts. Economics, of course, but I also took courses in sociology, English legal history, American constitutional interpretation, Chaucer, art history, Asian music, and on and on.\nI have to admit that I have not retained as many details as I would like from these courses—so please don’t ask me about the constitutions of Clarendon or how a mob is different from a crowd. But even though I don’t retain all of the details, the courses were all important to me. I learned to approach new ideas with respect. I learned to make an argument. I learned to read and think critically. Basically, I learned to learn in college—and I loved learning to learn, because I loved learning.\nThat’s what any good college—and especially any good college of liberal arts—does. It takes people who like to learn and teaches them how to learn—not just at school but in all aspects of their lives. It is often rightly emphasized that this process is spiritually enriching. But to an economist like me, it’s important to emphasize its financial benefits.\nCollege grads get higher wages in part because they have already acquired valuable skills. But college grads also get higher wages because they like learning and know how to learn. Their ability and willingness to keep learning, and thereby acquire more skills, is also what allows their wages to grow so fast over time. And this is the second reason why I say congratulations to you—you’re a person who likes learning, and that’s allowed you to learn how to learn.\nI’m sure that you’ve realized over the past couple of weeks that nobody over the age of 40 ever talks for 10 minutes to a recent college grad without offering advice of some kind. Now you get to hear mine.\nI’ve told you that college was a good investment for you because you’re a learner. But to get most of the economic benefits from college, like the faster wage growth, you have to stay a learner for years and years and years. How do you stay a learner? To me, the answer to this question lies in confidence. You cannot learn without asking stupid questions. You cannot learn without revealing your ignorance. In other words, you cannot learn without having the confidence to make mistakes.\nYou’ve got that confidence now. It is a large part of what has led you here today. I urge you to strive to retain that confidence in the years to come. As an economist, I can tell you that it can make your income grow rapidly over time. As a person, I can tell you that it can keep you young even when all the physical signs say that you are not.\nOnce again, congratulations to you all!\nReferences\nHeckman, J., Lochner, L., and Todd, P., Earnings functions, rates of return, and treatment effects: The Mincer equation and beyond, National Bureau of Economic Research working paper 11544.\nFootnotes\n1 See Table 4, Heckman, et al.

Even in a tough job market, my cohort found that college remained a good investment.\n\nAnd that’s my first reason for congratulating you! You’ve made a great financial investment. In fact, my bet is that few of you will ever make a better one. I never have.\n\nBut I have a second reason for why you should be so happy today. It’s related to a question that may have occurred to you already: If going to a four-year college is such a great deal, why don’t more people get four-year college degrees?\n\nThere are a lot of possible answers to this question, including some significant issues related to credit access. However, the most important answer is also the simplest answer: Some people like college better than others. Now, I’m not saying that there are some people who like college parties and other people who don’t. That’s probably true, but it’s not the main reason why some students invest $100K in themselves and others don’t. What I’m saying is that some people enjoy learning and others don’t. Those who like to learn—well, they go to college and spend four challenging years learning. Those who don’t like to learn—well, they don’t finish, and in many cases they don’t even start.2\n\nI think that this simple story—that people go to college because they like to learn—says something deep about college, and especially about a college of liberal arts. As a student, I took a lot of courses in the liberal arts. Economics, of course, but I also took courses in sociology, English legal history, American constitutional interpretation, Chaucer, art history, Asian music, and on and on.\n\nI have to admit that I have not retained as many details as I would like from these courses—so please don’t ask me about the constitutions of Clarendon or how a mob is different from a crowd. But even though I don’t retain all of the details, the courses were all important to me. I learned to approach new ideas with respect. I learned to make an argument. I learned to read and think critically. Basically, I learned to learn in college—and I loved learning to learn, because I loved learning.\n\nThat’s what any good college—and especially any good college of liberal arts—does. It takes people who like to learn and teaches them how to learn—not just at school but in all aspects of their lives. It is often rightly emphasized that this process is spiritually enriching. But to an economist like me, it’s important to emphasize its financial benefits.\n\nCollege grads get higher wages in part because they have already acquired valuable skills. But college grads also get higher wages because they like learning and know how to learn. Their ability and willingness to keep learning, and thereby acquire more skills, is also what allows their wages to grow so fast over time. And this is the second reason why I say congratulations to you—you’re a person who likes learning, and that’s allowed you to learn how to learn.\n\nI’m sure that you’ve realized over the past couple of weeks that nobody over the age of 40 ever talks for 10 minutes to a recent college grad without offering advice of some kind. Now you get to hear mine.\n\nI’ve told you that college was a good investment for you because you’re a learner. But to get most of the economic benefits from college, like the faster wage growth, you have to stay a learner for years and years and years. How do you stay a learner? To me, the answer to this question lies in confidence. You cannot learn without asking stupid questions. You cannot learn without revealing your ignorance. In other words, you cannot learn without having the confidence to make mistakes.\n\nYou’ve got that confidence now. It is a large part of what has led you here today. I urge you to strive to retain that confidence in the years to come. As an economist, I can tell you that it can make your income grow rapidly over time. As a person, I can tell you that it can keep you young even when all the physical signs say that you are not.\n\nOnce again, congratulations to you all!\n\nHeckman, J., Lochner, L., and Todd, P., Earnings functions, rates of return, and treatment effects: The Mincer equation and beyond, National Bureau of Economic Research working paper 11544."

        "content": "This topic is discussed in greater depth in “Taxing Risk and the Optimal Regulation of Financial Institutions,” Economic Policy Paper 10-3 (May 2010), Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.\n\nSee video of this speech by Narayana Kocherlakota from C-Span (off-site on c-spanvideo.org)\nIn the mid-2000s, we—as investors, home buyers, and bank lenders—collectively bet that house prices would not fall by 30 percent in most major metropolitan areas in three years. We were wrong. This mismatch between our expectations and our realizations was the ultimate source of the financial crisis of 2007-09.\nThe Congress of the United States is currently considering legislation to restructure financial regulation. However, no matter how well-written or how well-intentioned the legislation may be, no law can completely eliminate the kinds of collective investor and regulator mistakes that lead to financial crises. These mistakes have taken place periodically for centuries. They will certainly do so again. And once these crises happen, there are strong economic forces that lead policymakers—for the best of reasons—to bail out financial firms. In other words, no legislation can completely eliminate bailouts. Any new financial regulatory structure must keep this reality in mind.\nMy theme today is that, although bailouts are inevitable, their magnitude can be limited by taxes on financial institutions. I arrive at this conclusion about the usefulness of taxes by thinking through an analogy that I’ll develop at some length. I will argue that, knowing bailouts are inevitable, financial institutions fail to internalize all the risks that their investment decisions impose on society. Economists would say that bailouts thereby create a risk “externality.” There is nearly a century of economic thought about how to deal with externalities of various sorts—and the usual answer is through taxation. I will suggest that the logic that argues for taxation to deal with other externalities is exactly applicable in this case as well. As always, any views I share today are my own, and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\nMy case for taxing banks is distinct from one often heard in popular discourse. This latter logic usually runs: Taxpayers put X dollars into the banking sector, and the banking sector should repay all of that money. This argument is, I think, fundamentally grounded in a desire for revenge: Some big banks—perhaps now gone forever—took our money, and so all big banks must pay. Taxes are seen as punishment—a means of exacting retribution from the guilty (them) to compensate the innocent (us).\nMy story is different. At least some big banks did make socially undesirable choices. But — in large part—they were led to make those choices by incentives within the tax and regulatory system. Parts of these incentives were shaped by the ultimately correct expectation that some bailouts would take place in the event of a financial crisis. These government guarantees—no matter how implicit they might have been—created an incentive for financial institutions to make socially undesirable choices. Taxation is a useful way to correct this incentive.\nEarlier, I claimed that bailouts of financial institutions are certain to occur in financial crises. Why do I say this? There are many forces at play, but I believe that the strongest has to do with the very nature of financial intermediation. Investors in financial institutions always want the ability to pull out their funds quickly. For this reason, financial institutions’ liabilities often take the form of short-term debt and deposits. But such short-term financing instruments are intrinsically prone to self-fulfilling crises of confidence that economists term “runs.”\nImagine that Bank X needs $100 billion of one-day loans to survive. This means that for a given lender to be willing to make a $1-billion, one-day loan to Bank X, that lender has to believe that Bank X will get another $99 billion in one-day loans. Then, Bank X may fail simply because every possible lender believes correctly that no lender is willing to lend to Bank X. Such a crisis of confidence can occur regardless of the true condition of Bank X.\nThis story is hardly a new one. It’s exactly why we have deposit insurance: to prevent runs by reassuring bank depositors that their money is safe. But the story has huge consequences for how governments operate. In a financial crisis, there is a tremendous sense of uncertainty. There are some truly insolvent financial firms out there—but no one knows for sure which ones they are. And during a crisis, the panic in the air means that any institution—even one with solid fundamentals—may be subjected to a run if its investors lose confidence in its solvency.\nIn such an atmosphere, contagion effects become extremely powerful. Even a slight loss by one short-term creditor can lead all short-term lenders to rush to the safety of Treasury bills. Such flight would endanger the survival of key financial institutions, even if they are fundamentally sound. Governments cannot risk such systemic collapse, and so during times of crisis, they end up providing debt guarantees for all financial institutions. Thus, policymakers inevitably resort to bailouts even when they have explicitly resolved, in the strongest possible terms, to let firms fail.\nMany observers of the events of September 2008 have emphasized the need for better resolution mechanisms. Different people mean different things by this, but most want to impose losses on debt holders. I’m not opposed to faster resolutions of bankruptcies. But I do not believe that better resolution mechanisms will end bailouts. Indeed, I’m led to make a prediction. No matter what mechanisms we legislate now to impose losses on creditors, Congress, or some agency acting on Congress’ behalf, will block them when we next face a financial crisis. And Congress will do so for a very good reason: to forestall a run on the key players in the financial system.\nSo, that’s my first point: Bailouts are inevitable. Let me move to my next point: Bailouts create inefficiencies in the allocation of real investment. Here’s what I mean. Financial institutions make investments that are, by their very nature, risky—that is, their returns are not certain. They finance these investments, at least in part, using debt and deposits.\nNow, imagine for a moment that we live in a world without bailouts, so that the government does not provide debt guarantees or deposit insurance. If a financial institution decided to increase the risk level of its investment portfolio, its debt holders and depositors would face a greater risk of loss. By way of compensation for that greater risk, they’d demand a higher yield. As a result, in the absence of government guarantees, financial institutions would find it more costly to obtain debt financing for highly risky investments than for less risky ones. This effect, on the margin, would curb a firm’s appetite for risk. It would have an especially powerful effect on highly leveraged financial institutions, because high debt-to-asset levels mean higher risk of being unable to fulfill debt obligations.\nBut now return to the real world, with deposit insurance and debt guarantees, and the inevitability of government bailouts. Even if they only kick in during financial crises, these guarantees change this natural market relationship between risk and cost. The depositors and debt holders are now partially insulated from increases in investment risk, and so do not demand a sufficiently high yield from riskier firms. Financial institutions take on too much risk, because they are no longer deterred from doing so by the high costs of debt finance. And this missing deterrence is especially relevant for firms that are highly leveraged, because they should be paying out especially high yields on their debts.\nIn this way, the expectation of bailouts leads to too much capital being allocated toward overly risky ventures. These misallocations of capital don’t create the collective mistakes in predictions that generate financial crises. But the misallocations do mean that society loses a lot from those mistakes—a lot more than is efficient.\nWhat kind of policy would be useful in correcting this inefficiency? In what follows, I will offer an analogy from a completely different arena of public policy that can help us think through this key question.\nConsider a factory that creates air pollution as a byproduct of operation. When the firm that owns the factory chooses to produce more output, it incurs various private costs: more raw materials, more labor, and so on. But the production increase also generates more pollution that will be absorbed by the surrounding community. The pollution is a social cost of production not paid for, or “internalized,” by the firm that generates it. Economists refer to such costs as “externalities.”\nThis same distinction between private and social costs applies to financial institutions that are facing debt guarantees. Such guarantees imply that some portion of the risk produced by a firm’s investment decisions is absorbed by taxpayers. In making decisions about what to invest in, the firm ignores that portion of risk. It is a social cost of the project that the private firm does not internalize. Just like the pollution, the risk borne by taxpayers is an externality—what I will call a “risk externality.”\nThis analogy is useful because economists know a lot about how to deal with externalities. We can exploit their years of research to address the problem of financial regulation when government bailouts are inevitable. In particular, that long history of thought says that the best way to correct externalities is by providing the right kinds of incentives through appropriate taxes.\nLet me be more specific. Again, let’s think about the firm with a polluting factory. Many of its choices affect the amount of pollution produced, including the amount of time that the firm runs the factory during the workweek, the sorts of antipollution technology employed, and the kind of energy used to run the factory. Now, the government could regulate the firm’s pollution levels by controlling each and every one of these choices. However, to do so, the government has to choose how to trade off these three (and other) factors against one another.\nIts trade-off decisions will be influenced by both pollution considerations and cost factors. If antipollution technology is cheap, the government may simply require the firm to invest in that. But if antipollution technology is expensive, the government may require the firm to switch to using natural gas instead of coal. Making these trade-offs requires a tremendous amount of firm-specific information and firm-specific cost minimization. To put it mildly, historical evidence suggests that governments are not very good at such micromanagement of factory-level operation; that’s why we have private markets.\nThe solution to this difficulty is to regulate the amount of pollution produced by the firm, rather than how the firm produces that pollution. The central problem here is that pollution has a social cost that the firm does not internalize when choosing its level of production. From society’s point of view, the firm will overproduce pollution. However, the firm will choose the socially efficient level of pollution if it is required to pay for—or internalize—the social cost of the pollution.\nMore concretely, suppose that the firm is told, before choosing its level of production, that the government will measure the amount of pollution that the firm generates and charge the firm a tax that is exactly equal to the social cost of that quantity of pollution. This policy generates a tax schedule that translates the amount of pollution generated into an amount paid by the firm. If the firm knows that it faces this tax schedule, its costs of production will include the social cost of pollution, along with labor, materials, energy, and the like. In this way, what was external to the firm becomes internal. As a result, the firm will choose the socially efficient level of production. Just as importantly, it will automatically choose to produce that pollution—and its other more beneficial outputs—in a cost-minimizing fashion. The government does not need to solve the firm’s cost-minimization problem.\nThese lessons about pollution regulation translate directly into lessons about financial regulation. As in the pollution case, a financial institution should be taxed for the amount of risk it produces that is borne by taxpayers. The firm will then choose the socially optimal level of risk.\nHere’s my preferred policy. The firm is told that the government will estimate the expected, discounted value of bailouts that the financial institution (or any of its stakeholders) will receive in the future. I say “expected” because the amount of the bailout is uncertain (and indeed is likely to be zero much of the time). I say “discounted” because the bailout may be received next year or in 30 years, and we need to discount accordingly. Clearly, this estimate will depend on many firm choices and attributes, including its leverage ratio, the maturity structure of its liabilities, the risk characteristics of its investment portfolio, and its incentive compensation schemes. For example, the expected bailout will be higher for firms with highly risky investments than for firms with less risky portfolios.\nHaving done this calculation, the government then charges the firm a tax that is exactly equal to the expected discounted value of the firm’s bailouts. Just as in the pollution example, this measurement-plus-taxation policy confronts the firm with a tax schedule that translates its choices into a cost paid by the firm. The tax amount exactly equals the extra cost borne by the taxpayers because of bailouts, appropriately adjusted for risk and the time value of money. Knowing that it faces this tax schedule, the firm no longer has an incentive to undertake inefficiently risky investments. Its investment choices will be socially efficient. It is useful to tax a financial institution producing a risk externality, just as it is useful to tax a firm producing a pollution externality. The purpose of the tax in both instances is to ensure that the firm pays the full costs—private and social—of its production decisions.\nI emphasized that the pollution tax corrects the pollution externality without creating any new inefficiencies for the firm. The risk tax has the same property. Policymakers are considering a host of regulatory responses to the events of the past two and a half years, including higher capital requirements, leverage caps, and restrictions on incentive compensation. All of these potential changes are good in that they serve to lower the amount of risk-taking by financial institutions. However, they may also create new kinds of inefficiency for the targeted firms. For example, imposing new restrictions on incentive compensation may hamper a firm’s ability to motivate its employees. In contrast, my proposed risk tax, like the pollution tax, corrects the risk externality without creating any new inefficiencies.\nThe proposed tax does require bank supervisors to calculate the expected present value of future bailout payments. These calculations are likely to be complex in a number of ways. Moreover, the calculations could well be controversial. Financial institutions that follow highly risky strategies get especially high profits when those strategies are working. Thus, supervisors would be required to levy high risk taxes on exactly those institutions that appear extremely successful. For these reasons, it would be useful to develop an objective way to compute the required tax using market information.\nHere’s what I have in mind. Suppose that, for every relevant financial institution, the government issues a “rescue bond.” The rescue bond pays a variable coupon equal to 1/1000 of the transfers made from the taxpayer to the institution or its stakeholders. (I pick 1/1000 out of the air; any fixed fraction will do.) Much of the time, this coupon will be zero, because bailouts aren’t necessary and so the firm will not receive transfers. However, just like the institution’s stakeholders, the owners of the rescue bond will occasionally receive a large payment. In a well-functioning market, the price of this bond is exactly equal to the 1/1000 of the expected discounted value of the transfers to the firm and its stakeholders. Thus, the government should charge the financial firm a tax equal to 1000 times the price of the bond.\nNotice that this approach could be used for a wide variety of financial institutions, including nonbanks. In principle, the government need not figure out in advance exactly which are systemically important and which are not. Instead, it could simply issue a rescue bond for every institution. Then, the market itself could reveal how systemically important each institution is through the price of its rescue bonds. Of course, markets are not always perfect, and it would be inappropriate to rely only on market measures to compute the appropriate taxes. However, the prices of rescue bonds would contain valuable information that should be an important input into the supervisory process.\nAs I mentioned at the beginning, Congress is in the process of considering changes to the financial regulatory system. In December, the House passed the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The Senate is currently deliberating the Restoring American Financial Stability Act. There is much to like in both pieces of legislation. However, neither piece of legislation incorporates the kind of risk tax that I have described to you. The Senate bill proposes no new taxes on financial institutions, unless some fail. In that event, taxes could be levied on surviving large financial institutions, regardless of whether or not they had actually engaged in excessive risk-taking. The House bill has a new risk-based assessment on large banks and hedge funds. Such a risk-adjusted tax should have desirable incentive effects on the targeted firms. However, the tax will end once it has raised $150 billion. This cap is problematic, because once the tax is ended, so too will its desirable incentive effects.\nWhy do the bills fail to include new levies of the kind that I propose? In my view, both bills significantly understate the extreme economic forces that lead to bailouts during financial crises. Indeed, the opening language of the Senate bill actually declares that it will end taxpayer bailouts. This objective is laudable. But it is not achievable—and thinking that it is can lead to poor choices about the structure of financial regulation.\nTo wrap up: Bailouts will inevitably happen during financial crises to prevent runs and systemic collapse. We need to structure financial regulation so as to limit the size and occurrence of these bailouts. How should we best design such regulations? The social distortion we face is that debt guarantees create a risk externality, because financial institutions do not bear the full costs of their investment choices. Financial regulation should be designed so as to best control that externality. As is true with any externality, the risk externality can be eliminated with a well-designed tax system. Figuring out the right tax may be complicated, but the task can be eased using appropriate information from financial markets.\n\nIn the mid-2000s, we—as investors, home buyers, and bank lenders—collectively bet that house prices would not fall by 30 percent in most major metropolitan areas in three years. We were wrong. This mismatch between our expectations and our realizations was the ultimate source of the financial crisis of 2007-09.\n\nThe Congress of the United States is currently considering legislation to restructure financial regulation.

For example, the expected bailout will be higher for firms with highly risky investments than for firms with less risky portfolios.\n\nHaving done this calculation, the government then charges the firm a tax that is exactly equal to the expected discounted value of the firm’s bailouts. Just as in the pollution example, this measurement-plus-taxation policy confronts the firm with a tax schedule that translates its choices into a cost paid by the firm. The tax amount exactly equals the extra cost borne by the taxpayers because of bailouts, appropriately adjusted for risk and the time value of money. Knowing that it faces this tax schedule, the firm no longer has an incentive to undertake inefficiently risky investments. Its investment choices will be socially efficient. It is useful to tax a financial institution producing a risk externality, just as it is useful to tax a firm producing a pollution externality. The purpose of the tax in both instances is to ensure that the firm pays the full costs—private and social—of its production decisions.\n\nI emphasized that the pollution tax corrects the pollution externality without creating any new inefficiencies for the firm. The risk tax has the same property. Policymakers are considering a host of regulatory responses to the events of the past two and a half years, including higher capital requirements, leverage caps, and restrictions on incentive compensation. All of these potential changes are good in that they serve to lower the amount of risk-taking by financial institutions. However, they may also create new kinds of inefficiency for the targeted firms. For example, imposing new restrictions on incentive compensation may hamper a firm’s ability to motivate its employees. In contrast, my proposed risk tax, like the pollution tax, corrects the risk externality without creating any new inefficiencies.\n\nThe proposed tax does require bank supervisors to calculate the expected present value of future bailout payments. These calculations are likely to be complex in a number of ways. Moreover, the calculations could well be controversial. Financial institutions that follow highly risky strategies get especially high profits when those strategies are working. Thus, supervisors would be required to levy high risk taxes on exactly those institutions that appear extremely successful. For these reasons, it would be useful to develop an objective way to compute the required tax using market information.\n\nHere’s what I have in mind. Suppose that, for every relevant financial institution, the government issues a “rescue bond.” The rescue bond pays a variable coupon equal to 1/1000 of the transfers made from the taxpayer to the institution or its stakeholders. (I pick 1/1000 out of the air; any fixed fraction will do.) Much of the time, this coupon will be zero, because bailouts aren’t necessary and so the firm will not receive transfers. However, just like the institution’s stakeholders, the owners of the rescue bond will occasionally receive a large payment. In a well-functioning market, the price of this bond is exactly equal to the 1/1000 of the expected discounted value of the transfers to the firm and its stakeholders. Thus, the government should charge the financial firm a tax equal to 1000 times the price of the bond.\n\nNotice that this approach could be used for a wide variety of financial institutions, including nonbanks. In principle, the government need not figure out in advance exactly which are systemically important and which are not. Instead, it could simply issue a rescue bond for every institution. Then, the market itself could reveal how systemically important each institution is through the price of its rescue bonds. Of course, markets are not always perfect, and it would be inappropriate to rely only on market measures to compute the appropriate taxes. However, the prices of rescue bonds would contain valuable information that should be an important input into the supervisory process.\n\nAs I mentioned at the beginning, Congress is in the process of considering changes to the financial regulatory system. In December, the House passed the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The Senate is currently deliberating the Restoring American Financial Stability Act. There is much to like in both pieces of legislation. However, neither piece of legislation incorporates the kind of risk tax that I have described to you. The Senate bill proposes no new taxes on financial institutions, unless some fail. In that event, taxes could be levied on surviving large financial institutions, regardless of whether or not they had actually engaged in excessive risk-taking. The House bill has a new risk-based assessment on large banks and hedge funds. Such a risk-adjusted tax should have desirable incentive effects on the targeted firms. However, the tax will end once it has raised $150 billion. This cap is problematic, because once the tax is ended, so too will its desirable incentive effects.\n\nWhy do the bills fail to include new levies of the kind that I propose? In my view, both bills significantly understate the extreme economic forces that lead to bailouts during financial crises. Indeed, the opening language of the Senate bill actually declares that it will end taxpayer bailouts. This objective is laudable. But it is not achievable—and thinking that it is can lead to poor choices about the structure of financial regulation.\n\nTo wrap up: Bailouts will inevitably happen during financial crises to prevent runs and systemic collapse. We need to structure financial regulation so as to limit the size and occurrence of these bailouts. How should we best design such regulations? The social distortion we face is that debt guarantees create a risk externality, because financial institutions do not bear the full costs of their investment choices. Financial regulation should be designed so as to best control that externality. As is true with any externality, the risk externality can be eliminated with a well-designed tax system. Figuring out the right tax may be complicated, but the task can be eased using appropriate information from financial markets."

I’m beginning to realize that one of the benefits of being president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is that I will get to periodically visit your great state and this lovely community. I look forward to my return trips and hope I have a chance to meet with many of you again.\nToday I want to talk about the prospects for the U.S. economy and the Federal Reserve’s recent role in the economy, with particular emphasis on the part that housing plays in both of those issues. As you know, the Federal Reserve has been very active in the U.S. economy over the past two-and-a-half-years. Now the economy is on the mend. It is time for the Federal Reserve to think about how to go about resuming its more traditional role. In the latter part of my speech, I will discuss one aspect of this process: Federal Reserve balance sheet normalization.\nFirst, though, I want to talk about the state of the economy and offer you my forecast. Now, I have to say that the continued demand for economists’ forecasts is a little puzzling to me, given our track record. On that note, it’s been said that economists make predictions about gross domestic product to the hundredth decimal point for one reason: to prove that they have a sense of humor. Well, just to assure you that I am taking this all very seriously, I will keep my forecasts to the tenth decimal point. And before I begin, let me remind you that the following views are my own, and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve.\nLet me start my outlook with the most troubling information first. Housing starts and sales remain at near historically low levels. These data are disturbing to many observers. And that’s understandable. After many past recessions, residential investment has played a significant role in the subsequent recovery. Arguing by analogy, some are concerned that we cannot have a sustainable economic recovery unless housing starts pick up dramatically from their current low levels.\nI have to say that I’m somewhat skeptical of this thinking. Yes, the housing sector is important, but residential investment makes up just 2.8 percent of the country’s gross domestic product. The U.S. economy is a wonderfully diverse one, and has many possible sources of growth. We can—and I believe that we will—have significant growth in output without seeing a major turnaround in the housing market.\nBut suppose for a moment that we do accept the claim that housing is somehow critical for an economic turnaround. I’m not sure how, if at all, it would affect my thinking as a monetary policymaker. The Federal Reserve can only influence the housing market by manipulating interest rates. But there is little evidence that interest rates have a big influence on housing starts. For example, in a 2007 National Bureau of Economic Research paper on housing and the business cycle, UCLA professor Edward Leamer estimated a relationship between current housing starts, past housing starts, and interest rates. The Minneapolis Fed banking studies group has used Leamer’s estimates to calculate the impact of a 100-basis-point permanent decrease in 10-year Treasury yields on housing starts one year from now. The group has found that housing starts would be 11 percent higher with the rate cut than without it. This effect would be barely noticeable, given that housing starts need to nearly triple to get back to their normal level.\nHousing starts are more strongly affected by the general health of the economy (job growth or loss) and the stock of housing relative to demand. As I see it, the problems in the housing sector right now are largely driven by this second factor. For a number of reasons, the nation has built a lot more houses than it now needs or wants. As a result, my own prediction is that housing starts are going to remain low—possibly for several years.\nWhat does the large supply of housing mean for the general economy? It means that resources formerly dedicated to building and outfitting homes are gradually shifting to other uses. This points out another remarkable feature of the U.S. economy: its flexibility. Resources in the U.S. economy—from financial capital to human capital—can move freely from one sector to another. Clearly, this reallocation process is difficult in many ways. In particular, it takes place only because companies cut production or close their doors, and accordingly cut their workforces. These workers have to find jobs elsewhere, and they endure the trauma of being unemployed. Nonetheless, the reallocation process is a necessary one if an economy is to regain its health and start growing again.\nThe reallocation process is at work today in the United States—more slowly than we would like, but at work. Housing starts have remained at a very low level in recent months, but the economy has nonetheless begun to recover. GDP began to grow in the third quarter of 2009. In fact, that growth rate accelerated to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 5.6 percent in the fourth quarter.\nWill this turnaround in GDP continue in the coming months and years? I believe it will, but I am not as optimistic as other economists. And since I have recently spoken at greater length about my forecast, I will give you the condensed version. My own forecast calls for about 3 percent growth per year over the next two years, as opposed to the consensus view among economists, which is 3.5 percent. This pessimism derives from two sources. First, our statistical forecasting model at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is predicting that GDP growth over this period will be around 2.5 percent per year. The model is a simple one in many ways, but its forecasting track record is surprisingly good.\nSecond, financial markets have largely healed from the traumas of 2007-09. But the banking sector faces ongoing problems. Banks with large amounts of commercial real estate risk-exposure face a correspondingly elevated risk of failure. This threat could well lead to continued declines in bank lending, which would curtail the recovery.\nTo this point in my forecast, I have been discussing broad factors that can affect GDP growth. However, as I mentioned earlier, GDP does not tell the full story of the impact of recessions. We need to also be thinking about unemployment.\nUnemployment is currently 9.7 percent. It has been higher in the post-World War II period—it reached 10.8 percent in the bleak fall of 1982. However, in the 25-year span between January 1984 and January 2009, unemployment never topped 8 percent. It is safe to say that those born after 1968 have never experienced an economic episode of this kind in their working lives. It is also safe to say that the Federal Reserve is certainly not meeting its full employment mandate when unemployment is at 9.7 percent.\nCertainly, there has been some good news in labor markets. Unemployment has declined from its high of 10.1 percent in October 2009. In March, nonfarm payroll employment increased by 162,000 jobs—the biggest increase in three years. Nonetheless, I still think the outlook for unemployment is not promising. Unemployment is notoriously slow to recover, and the rate has been especially slow to decline after the last two milder recessions of 1990-91 and 2000-01. I would be surprised if unemployment were below 9 percent by the end of 2010 or below 8 percent by the end of 2011.\nLet me end this discussion of my outlook on a more positive note, with a caveat to follow. The positive news in this economy is that inflation has been relatively tame. From the fourth quarter of 2007 to the fourth quarter of 2009, PCE inflation has averaged slightly less than 1.5 percent per year. Over that same period, core PCE inflation (subtracting food and energy) averaged around 1.7 percent per year. The Federal Reserve is keeping inflation at levels consistent with good long-run economic performance.\nHere’s the caveat: Deposit institutions are holding over a trillion dollars in excess reserves (that is, over 15 times what they are required to hold given their deposits). These excess reserves create the potential for high inflation. Suppose that households believe that prices will rise. They would then demand more deposits to use for transactions. Banks can readily accommodate this extra demand, because they are holding so many excess reserves. These extra deposits become extra money chasing the same amount of goods and so generate upward pressure on prices. The households’ inflationary expectations would, in fact, become self-fulfilling.\nWhy might households expect an increase in inflation? The amount of federal government debt held by the private sector has gone up by over 30 percent since the beginning of 2008. This debt can only be paid by tax collections or by the Federal Reserve’s debt monetization (that is, by printing dollars to pay off the obligations incurred by Congress). If households begin to expect that the latter will be true—even if it is not—their inflationary expectations will rise as well.\nI hasten to say—and I want to stress—that I view this scenario as unlikely. For it to transpire, the country would need a combination of bad monetary policy and poor fiscal management. I do not foresee this combination as likely to occur. Nonetheless, good policy requires good choices, and policymakers at the Federal Reserve and in Congress need to keep this scenario in mind when making their decisions. I can assure you that we in the Federal Reserve have every intention of keeping our end of the bargain.\nSo, to summarize my economic forecast, I do think that the economy is on the mend and should continue to recover over the next two years—in terms of both GDP and unemployment—but at slower rates than we would like. The outlook for inflation is basically promising, as long as the Federal Reserve and Congress work together appropriately. And as for housing: Housing will recover eventually. In the meantime, the general economy has already begun the recovery process.\nAnd so, the economy has begun to normalize from the events of the past 30 months. It seems like a good time for the Federal Reserve to think about how to normalize policy. I want to spend the rest of my time talking about one aspect of this normalization process. The Federal Reserve has more than doubled its assets since September 2008. This expansion has taken two distinct forms: making new kinds of loans and buying new kinds of securities. At this point, the new loans are mostly gone from our balance sheet. The new securities are very much still with us. As a result, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet looks both larger in scale and different in composition from 2007. In the remainder of my talk, I will discuss what the FOMC is targeting as “balance sheet normalization.” I will also offer some thoughts about the process needed to accomplish this goal.\nI said that the Federal Reserve made new kinds of loans and bought new kinds of securities. In terms of making new kinds of loans, the Board of Governors and the New York Fed worked together to open a number of short-term lending facilities during 2008 and into 2009. Their objective was to set borrowing rates and collateral requirements on these facilities to meet two conflicting targets: Borrowers would want to use them when financial markets were strained, and borrowers would not use them when financial markets were not strained. Despite some skepticism among outside observers, the facilities worked exactly as intended.\nAt their onset, in late 2008 and early 2009, the new lending facilities were critical in improving the functioning of financial markets. Let me pick a date—January 28, 2009. On that date, the Federal Reserve had a balance sheet of roughly 2 trillion dollars. The Federal Reserve held 500 billion dollars worth of Treasuries and under 10 billion dollars worth of mortgage-backed securities. It held 500 billion dollars worth of central bank liquidity swaps—essentially short-term dollar loans to other central banks. And it held about 700 billion dollars worth of loans to banks and issuers of commercial paper through the discount window, the term auction facility, and the commercial paper funding facility.\nNow fast-forward to January 2010. The use of the various special lending facilities had declined sharply. As a result, the Federal Reserve closed virtually all of them as of February 1, 2010, and held its last term auction on March 8. The facilities worked exactly as intended: They provided necessary support when financial markets were strained and vanished when they were not. It is worth noting too that the Federal Reserve lost not a single penny on any of these loans.\nThus, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet has normalized in the sense that this new kind of lending has largely disappeared. But as of March 24, the Federal Reserve still has a balance sheet of over 2 trillion dollars, swollen by its holdings of unusual securities. In particular, the Federal Reserve owns about 1.1 trillion dollars in agency mortgage-backed securities and about 170 billion dollars in agency debt. The term “agency” refers to the fact that these securities are issued by government-sponsored enterprises that are involved in housing finance (primarily Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac). Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac create the MBSs by buying mortgages from around the country and bundling them together. The underlying mortgages are all fixed-rate ones, and all of the mortgages in a particular MBS have the same interest rate.\nThese assets may sound “toxic,” to use the language of 2008. But all of these instruments are guaranteed by the U.S. taxpayer, and so the Federal Reserve itself faces no default or credit risk. Of course, if many borrowers do default on their mortgages, taxpayers suffer losses because taxpayers are backing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. But those losses are an issue for Congress and the Treasury—they do not find their way through to the Federal Reserve.\nHowever, the Federal Reserve faces two other forms of risk in these securities. First, these securities are long term, and so their value responds to changes in long-term interest rates. Second, if interest rates fall, then more people will prepay their mortgages as they refinance. This means that the coupon payments that the Federal Reserve receives from a given agency MBS have an additional source of sensitivity to changes in long-term interest rates.\nThe minutes from the January 2010 FOMC meeting say that the participants were unanimous that, in the long run, they would like the Federal Reserve to have a much smaller balance sheet. There are a number of reasons for this preference, but certainly one is the concern about inflationary risks that I discussed earlier.\nFOMC participants were also unanimous that, in the long run, the Federal Reserve should be holding only Treasuries. Why does the FOMC feel this way? There are several reasons, and different participants probably put differing weight on them. The first reason is simple. We want to return to our pre-2007 ways of conducting monetary policy. We feel that we understand that framework well—although not perfectly—and want to use it again in the future.\nThe second reason has to do with appearances. We originally bought Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac instruments to accomplish two goals. The first objective was financial: We were trying to help improve liquidity conditions in the markets for those particular important instruments. The second objective was a macroeconomic one: The Federal Reserve wanted to lower all long-term interest rates. In my view, buying the agency securities was good policy, given market and macroeconomic circumstances in 2008 and 2009. But, in the long run, owning the obligations of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mae gives the impression that the Federal Reserve is in the business of allocating credit to a particular small sector of the economy—namely, the housing sector. We don’t want to be seen as being in the game of choosing which sector to back among the many in the economy.\nFinally, at least some of us have a prejudice against holding long-term securities, no matter who issues them. Holding long-term securities means that we have maturity mismatches between our assets and our liabilities. These mismatches expose us to interest rate risk that we’d rather avoid.\nSo, the bottom line is that we want to have a smaller balance sheet and to get out of agency securities. To accomplish these goals, we could use a passive approach, an active approach, or both. The passive approach is to maintain our existing holdings of securities and engage in no further purchases or sales. Over time, some of the securities will mature. As well, people will prepay the mortgages underlying the MBSs as they sell their houses and refinance. Together, maturation and prepayment will lead to a reduction in the part of our balance sheet in MBSs.\nThe problem with the passive approach is that it is slow. Many of the MBSs bought by the Federal Reserve were new issues that will mature as late as 2040. As a result, if the Federal Reserve relies only on the passive approach, it will still be holding some amount of mortgage-backed securities as late as 2040. How much the Federal Reserve will be holding at that late date depends on how fast people prepay their mortgages. Prepayment speeds are hard to estimate with any degree of confidence, because they depend on rates of refinancing, and those depend on whether interest rates turn out to be high or low.\nWith this caveat in mind, the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis banking studies group has done the following illustrative exercise. The New York Fed has every MBS owned by the Federal Reserve System listed on its Web site. The Minneapolis Fed’s banking studies group obtained data from Bloomberg on the largest quintile of these MBSs by value and used those data to estimate the rate of prepayment on these MBSs over the past year. The group found that this rate of prepayment was sufficiently slow that only half of the mortgages will vanish from the balance sheet every 10 years. This estimate implies that as late as 2030, the Federal Reserve will still be holding something like 250 billion dollars in mortgage-backed securities.\nSo, the passive approach is a slow approach that will leave the Federal Reserve holding significant amounts of MBSs for many years to come. If the Federal Reserve wants to normalize its balance sheet in the next five, 10, or even 20 years, it needs to supplement the passive approach with an active one. In plain English, it will have to sell mortgage-backed securities.\nSales present an unusual challenge for the Federal Reserve, because they require us to be able to make a particular kind of credible commitment. To understand this commitment, I think that it’s useful for me to talk through a situation that I see as roughly analogous.\nSuppose Sarah owns two houses on the same block. Sarah decides that she wants to sell both houses. How should Sarah accomplish this change?\nClearly, if Sarah tries to sell both of her houses at once, she’s going to suffer some serious losses. The houses are on the same block, and so they end up competing with each other. Sarah needs to sell the houses slowly over time, so that they don’t compete with each other. Obviously, how slowly would depend on the particulars of market conditions. In my neighborhood right now, selling one house per year would be about the right speed.\nSo suppose Sarah puts one house on the market and tells everyone that she’s not going to sell the other one until a year later. Then, she sells the first house after a month. It sells at a high price, because the buyers don’t want to wait a whole year to get a house on this particular block.\nAt this stage, Sarah is supposed to wait a year to sell her second house. But Sarah was only planning to wait so long to sell the second house to protect the first house from competition. Once the first house is sold at a high price, she has no reason to wait. She will not fulfill her promise to wait a year.\nNow think about what Sarah’s inability to wait means for her first sale. The potential buyers of the first house will all realize that they won’t have to wait a year to get a house on the same block. They will not be willing to pay a high price for the first house. And so Sarah’s lack of credibility means that the first house will necessarily sell at the same price as if she’s actually selling both houses at the same time.\nThe Federal Reserve faces exactly these same problems when undertaking to sell MBSs. Like Sarah, if the Federal Reserve were to sell its holdings of MBSs all at once, the sales price of the MBSs would be low. Long-term interest rates would spike up, which the Federal Reserve doesn’t want. Like Sarah, the Federal Reserve can avoid this problem by spacing its sales out over time. But just like Sarah, the Federal Reserve faces a commitment problem. The Federal Reserve wants to sell gradually in large part to ensure that its early sales of MBSs are at a high price. But once those early sales are made, the Federal Reserve has an increased incentive to sell its remaining MBSs rapidly. And as in Sarah’s case, if the market believes that the Federal Reserve will act on this increased incentive, the Federal Reserve will only be able to sell its early MBSs at a low price. Under this story, any MBS sales—no matter how small—may have big effects on long-term interest rates.\nSo far, sales sound pretty challenging! Fortunately, the analogy between the Federal Reserve and Sarah is incomplete. The difference gets at the very heart of what the Federal Reserve is about. Our structure—and in particular our independence from Congress and the president—means that we are set up to act in the public’s long-run interest, not to maximize short-run political or monetary gain. This structure means that, with the right set of policymakers on the FOMC, the Federal Reserve can credibly make and keep long-run commitments. Indeed, our credibility has been critical in the past crisis. Since July 2007, the monetary base has more than doubled, and the public debt has gone up by over 30 percent. At the same time, though, long-run inflationary expectations—as embedded in the prices of 5-year and 10-year inflation-indexed TIPS bonds—have moved slightly, if at all. The public and markets trust the Federal Reserve to keep inflation under control—and we will fulfill their trust.\nOur structure means too that the Federal Reserve can credibly commit to selling its MBSs slowly over time. Along these lines, in testimony before Congress in late March, Chairman Bernanke described how he expected MBS sales to work. He emphasized that the timing of initiating sales, like any other move by the FOMC, would depend on its assessment of economic conditions. But once conditions are right, he suggested that the Federal Reserve could reduce its balance sheet by pre-announcing and then implementing a slow, gradual path of sales.\nI’ve always been a numbers guy, and so I find it helpful in my own thinking to put some actual numbers on the table. To pick one of many possible plans, suppose we were to commit to the public to sell 15 billion to 25 billion dollars worth per month of MBSs. This path of sales, combined with prepayments, would get the Federal Reserve out of MBSs within five years after the start of selling. The plan would also return the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet to a normal size, so that excess reserves would be normalized at their 2007 levels well before the end of the five-year period. Just as important, I feel confident that this pace of sales would be sufficiently slow that it would have little or no impact on MBS prices and long-term interest rates.\nTo sum up: It is likely that the Federal Reserve will have to sell a nontrivial amount of its MBS holdings if it is to be able to normalize its balance sheet in the next two decades. Such sales might cause untoward jumps in interest rates unless the Federal Reserve is able to credibly commit to a sufficiently slow pace. Fortunately, as is true in all realms of monetary policy, the Federal Reserve is well situated to make, communicate, and carry out such a commitment. I am optimistic that we will be able to normalize our balance sheet by the end of the teens.\nI’ve covered a lot of ground in this talk—from the housing sector to the general economy to the Fed balance sheet. My overarching theme has been the issue of normalization after the recession. That normalization will, in my view, be slow in the housing sector. But despite the ongoing difficulties in this sector, the recovery process seems underway in the general economy. It is time for us in the Federal Reserve to begin to think about the process of normalization of our balance sheet, and how that process is likely to work.\nThis concludes my remarks, but let me close by thanking all of you for this invitation. Some of you in this room have worked formally with the Federal Reserve Bank in the past, either as a member of our Board of Directors or as a member of one of our business advisory councils. Others of you—or representatives of your companies—have shared business insights that help us better understand what’s going on in the economy. That local representation is part of what makes the Federal Reserve System unique. So thanks to all of you who have worked with us in the past, and as for the rest of you—we’ll be in touch. And now I would be happy to take your questions.\n\nThank you for that introduction, and thank you very much for the opportunity to meet with you today. I’m beginning to realize that one of the benefits of being president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is that I will get to periodically visit your great state and this lovely community. I look forward to my return trips and hope I have a chance to meet with many of you again.\n\nToday I want to talk about the prospects for the U.S. economy and the Federal Reserve’s recent role in the economy, with particular emphasis on the part that housing plays in both of those issues. As you know, the Federal Reserve has been very active in the U.S. economy over the past two-and-a-half-years. Now the economy is on the mend.

In particular, it takes place only because companies cut production or close their doors, and accordingly cut their workforces. These workers have to find jobs elsewhere, and they endure the trauma of being unemployed. Nonetheless, the reallocation process is a necessary one if an economy is to regain its health and start growing again.\n\nThe reallocation process is at work today in the United States—more slowly than we would like, but at work. Housing starts have remained at a very low level in recent months, but the economy has nonetheless begun to recover. GDP began to grow in the third quarter of 2009. In fact, that growth rate accelerated to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 5.6 percent in the fourth quarter.\n\nWill this turnaround in GDP continue in the coming months and years? I believe it will, but I am not as optimistic as other economists. And since I have recently spoken at greater length about my forecast, I will give you the condensed version. My own forecast calls for about 3 percent growth per year over the next two years, as opposed to the consensus view among economists, which is 3.5 percent. This pessimism derives from two sources. First, our statistical forecasting model at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is predicting that GDP growth over this period will be around 2.5 percent per year. The model is a simple one in many ways, but its forecasting track record is surprisingly good.\n\nSecond, financial markets have largely healed from the traumas of 2007-09. But the banking sector faces ongoing problems. Banks with large amounts of commercial real estate risk-exposure face a correspondingly elevated risk of failure. This threat could well lead to continued declines in bank lending, which would curtail the recovery.\n\nTo this point in my forecast, I have been discussing broad factors that can affect GDP growth. However, as I mentioned earlier, GDP does not tell the full story of the impact of recessions. We need to also be thinking about unemployment.\n\nUnemployment is currently 9.7 percent. It has been higher in the post-World War II period—it reached 10.8 percent in the bleak fall of 1982. However, in the 25-year span between January 1984 and January 2009, unemployment never topped 8 percent. It is safe to say that those born after 1968 have never experienced an economic episode of this kind in their working lives. It is also safe to say that the Federal Reserve is certainly not meeting its full employment mandate when unemployment is at 9.7 percent.\n\nCertainly, there has been some good news in labor markets. Unemployment has declined from its high of 10.1 percent in October 2009. In March, nonfarm payroll employment increased by 162,000 jobs—the biggest increase in three years. Nonetheless, I still think the outlook for unemployment is not promising. Unemployment is notoriously slow to recover, and the rate has been especially slow to decline after the last two milder recessions of 1990-91 and 2000-01. I would be surprised if unemployment were below 9 percent by the end of 2010 or below 8 percent by the end of 2011.\n\nLet me end this discussion of my outlook on a more positive note, with a caveat to follow. The positive news in this economy is that inflation has been relatively tame. From the fourth quarter of 2007 to the fourth quarter of 2009, PCE inflation has averaged slightly less than 1.5 percent per year. Over that same period, core PCE inflation (subtracting food and energy) averaged around 1.7 percent per year. The Federal Reserve is keeping inflation at levels consistent with good long-run economic performance.\n\nHere’s the caveat: Deposit institutions are holding over a trillion dollars in excess reserves (that is, over 15 times what they are required to hold given their deposits). These excess reserves create the potential for high inflation. Suppose that households believe that prices will rise. They would then demand more deposits to use for transactions. Banks can readily accommodate this extra demand, because they are holding so many excess reserves. These extra deposits become extra money chasing the same amount of goods and so generate upward pressure on prices. The households’ inflationary expectations would, in fact, become self-fulfilling.\n\nWhy might households expect an increase in inflation? The amount of federal government debt held by the private sector has gone up by over 30 percent since the beginning of 2008. This debt can only be paid by tax collections or by the Federal Reserve’s debt monetization (that is, by printing dollars to pay off the obligations incurred by Congress). If households begin to expect that the latter will be true—even if it is not—their inflationary expectations will rise as well.\n\nI hasten to say—and I want to stress—that I view this scenario as unlikely. For it to transpire, the country would need a combination of bad monetary policy and poor fiscal management. I do not foresee this combination as likely to occur. Nonetheless, good policy requires good choices, and policymakers at the Federal Reserve and in Congress need to keep this scenario in mind when making their decisions. I can assure you that we in the Federal Reserve have every intention of keeping our end of the bargain.\n\nSo, to summarize my economic forecast, I do think that the economy is on the mend and should continue to recover over the next two years—in terms of both GDP and unemployment—but at slower rates than we would like. The outlook for inflation is basically promising, as long as the Federal Reserve and Congress work together appropriately. And as for housing: Housing will recover eventually. In the meantime, the general economy has already begun the recovery process.\n\nAnd so, the economy has begun to normalize from the events of the past 30 months. It seems like a good time for the Federal Reserve to think about how to normalize policy. I want to spend the rest of my time talking about one aspect of this normalization process. The Federal Reserve has more than doubled its assets since September 2008. This expansion has taken two distinct forms: making new kinds of loans and buying new kinds of securities. At this point, the new loans are mostly gone from our balance sheet. The new securities are very much still with us. As a result, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet looks both larger in scale and different in composition from 2007. In the remainder of my talk, I will discuss what the FOMC is targeting as “balance sheet normalization.” I will also offer some thoughts about the process needed to accomplish this goal.\n\nI said that the Federal Reserve made new kinds of loans and bought new kinds of securities. In terms of making new kinds of loans, the Board of Governors and the New York Fed worked together to open a number of short-term lending facilities during 2008 and into 2009. Their objective was to set borrowing rates and collateral requirements on these facilities to meet two conflicting targets: Borrowers would want to use them when financial markets were strained, and borrowers would not use them when financial markets were not strained. Despite some skepticism among outside observers, the facilities worked exactly as intended.\n\nAt their onset, in late 2008 and early 2009, the new lending facilities were critical in improving the functioning of financial markets. Let me pick a date—January 28, 2009. On that date, the Federal Reserve had a balance sheet of roughly 2 trillion dollars. The Federal Reserve held 500 billion dollars worth of Treasuries and under 10 billion dollars worth of mortgage-backed securities. It held 500 billion dollars worth of central bank liquidity swaps—essentially short-term dollar loans to other central banks. And it held about 700 billion dollars worth of loans to banks and issuers of commercial paper through the discount window, the term auction facility, and the commercial paper funding facility.\n\nNow fast-forward to January 2010. The use of the various special lending facilities had declined sharply. As a result, the Federal Reserve closed virtually all of them as of February 1, 2010, and held its last term auction on March 8. The facilities worked exactly as intended: They provided necessary support when financial markets were strained and vanished when they were not. It is worth noting too that the Federal Reserve lost not a single penny on any of these loans.\n\nThus, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet has normalized in the sense that this new kind of lending has largely disappeared. But as of March 24, the Federal Reserve still has a balance sheet of over 2 trillion dollars, swollen by its holdings of unusual securities. In particular, the Federal Reserve owns about 1.1 trillion dollars in agency mortgage-backed securities and about 170 billion dollars in agency debt. The term “agency” refers to the fact that these securities are issued by government-sponsored enterprises that are involved in housing finance (primarily Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac). Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac create the MBSs by buying mortgages from around the country and bundling them together. The underlying mortgages are all fixed-rate ones, and all of the mortgages in a particular MBS have the same interest rate.\n\nThese assets may sound “toxic,” to use the language of 2008. But all of these instruments are guaranteed by the U.S. taxpayer, and so the Federal Reserve itself faces no default or credit risk. Of course, if many borrowers do default on their mortgages, taxpayers suffer losses because taxpayers are backing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. But those losses are an issue for Congress and the Treasury—they do not find their way through to the Federal Reserve.\n\nHowever, the Federal Reserve faces two other forms of risk in these securities. First, these securities are long term, and so their value responds to changes in long-term interest rates. Second, if interest rates fall, then more people will prepay their mortgages as they refinance. This means that the coupon payments that the Federal Reserve receives from a given agency MBS have an additional source of sensitivity to changes in long-term interest rates.\n\nThe minutes from the January 2010 FOMC meeting say that the participants were unanimous that, in the long run, they would like the Federal Reserve to have a much smaller balance sheet. There are a number of reasons for this preference, but certainly one is the concern about inflationary risks that I discussed earlier.\n\nFOMC participants were also unanimous that, in the long run, the Federal Reserve should be holding only Treasuries. Why does the FOMC feel this way? There are several reasons, and different participants probably put differing weight on them. The first reason is simple. We want to return to our pre-2007 ways of conducting monetary policy. We feel that we understand that framework well—although not perfectly—and want to use it again in the future.\n\nThe second reason has to do with appearances. We originally bought Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac instruments to accomplish two goals. The first objective was financial: We were trying to help improve liquidity conditions in the markets for those particular important instruments. The second objective was a macroeconomic one: The Federal Reserve wanted to lower all long-term interest rates. In my view, buying the agency securities was good policy, given market and macroeconomic circumstances in 2008 and 2009. But, in the long run, owning the obligations of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mae gives the impression that the Federal Reserve is in the business of allocating credit to a particular small sector of the economy—namely, the housing sector. We don’t want to be seen as being in the game of choosing which sector to back among the many in the economy.\n\nFinally, at least some of us have a prejudice against holding long-term securities, no matter who issues them. Holding long-term securities means that we have maturity mismatches between our assets and our liabilities. These mismatches expose us to interest rate risk that we’d rather avoid.\n\nSo, the bottom line is that we want to have a smaller balance sheet and to get out of agency securities. To accomplish these goals, we could use a passive approach, an active approach, or both. The passive approach is to maintain our existing holdings of securities and engage in no further purchases or sales. Over time, some of the securities will mature. As well, people will prepay the mortgages underlying the MBSs as they sell their houses and refinance. Together, maturation and prepayment will lead to a reduction in the part of our balance sheet in MBSs.\n\nThe problem with the passive approach is that it is slow. Many of the MBSs bought by the Federal Reserve were new issues that will mature as late as 2040. As a result, if the Federal Reserve relies only on the passive approach, it will still be holding some amount of mortgage-backed securities as late as 2040. How much the Federal Reserve will be holding at that late date depends on how fast people prepay their mortgages. Prepayment speeds are hard to estimate with any degree of confidence, because they depend on rates of refinancing, and those depend on whether interest rates turn out to be high or low.\n\nWith this caveat in mind, the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis banking studies group has done the following illustrative exercise. The New York Fed has every MBS owned by the Federal Reserve System listed on its Web site. The Minneapolis Fed’s banking studies group obtained data from Bloomberg on the largest quintile of these MBSs by value and used those data to estimate the rate of prepayment on these MBSs over the past year. The group found that this rate of prepayment was sufficiently slow that only half of the mortgages will vanish from the balance sheet every 10 years. This estimate implies that as late as 2030, the Federal Reserve will still be holding something like 250 billion dollars in mortgage-backed securities.\n\nSo, the passive approach is a slow approach that will leave the Federal Reserve holding significant amounts of MBSs for many years to come. If the Federal Reserve wants to normalize its balance sheet in the next five, 10, or even 20 years, it needs to supplement the passive approach with an active one. In plain English, it will have to sell mortgage-backed securities.\n\nSales present an unusual challenge for the Federal Reserve, because they require us to be able to make a particular kind of credible commitment. To understand this commitment, I think that it’s useful for me to talk through a situation that I see as roughly analogous.\n\nSuppose Sarah owns two houses on the same block. Sarah decides that she wants to sell both houses. How should Sarah accomplish this change?\n\nClearly, if Sarah tries to sell both of her houses at once, she’s going to suffer some serious losses. The houses are on the same block, and so they end up competing with each other. Sarah needs to sell the houses slowly over time, so that they don’t compete with each other. Obviously, how slowly would depend on the particulars of market conditions. In my neighborhood right now, selling one house per year would be about the right speed.\n\nSo suppose Sarah puts one house on the market and tells everyone that she’s not going to sell the other one until a year later. Then, she sells the first house after a month. It sells at a high price, because the buyers don’t want to wait a whole year to get a house on this particular block.\n\nAt this stage, Sarah is supposed to wait a year to sell her second house. But Sarah was only planning to wait so long to sell the second house to protect the first house from competition. Once the first house is sold at a high price, she has no reason to wait. She will not fulfill her promise to wait a year.\n\nNow think about what Sarah’s inability to wait means for her first sale. The potential buyers of the first house will all realize that they won’t have to wait a year to get a house on the same block. They will not be willing to pay a high price for the first house. And so Sarah’s lack of credibility means that the first house will necessarily sell at the same price as if she’s actually selling both houses at the same time.\n\nThe Federal Reserve faces exactly these same problems when undertaking to sell MBSs. Like Sarah, if the Federal Reserve were to sell its holdings of MBSs all at once, the sales price of the MBSs would be low. Long-term interest rates would spike up, which the Federal Reserve doesn’t want. Like Sarah, the Federal Reserve can avoid this problem by spacing its sales out over time. But just like Sarah, the Federal Reserve faces a commitment problem. The Federal Reserve wants to sell gradually in large part to ensure that its early sales of MBSs are at a high price. But once those early sales are made, the Federal Reserve has an increased incentive to sell its remaining MBSs rapidly. And as in Sarah’s case, if the market believes that the Federal Reserve will act on this increased incentive, the Federal Reserve will only be able to sell its early MBSs at a low price. Under this story, any MBS sales—no matter how small—may have big effects on long-term interest rates.\n\nSo far, sales sound pretty challenging! Fortunately, the analogy between the Federal Reserve and Sarah is incomplete. The difference gets at the very heart of what the Federal Reserve is about. Our structure—and in particular our independence from Congress and the president—means that we are set up to act in the public’s long-run interest, not to maximize short-run political or monetary gain. This structure means that, with the right set of policymakers on the FOMC, the Federal Reserve can credibly make and keep long-run commitments. Indeed, our credibility has been critical in the past crisis. Since July 2007, the monetary base has more than doubled, and the public debt has gone up by over 30 percent. At the same time, though, long-run inflationary expectations—as embedded in the prices of 5-year and 10-year inflation-indexed TIPS bonds—have moved slightly, if at all. The public and markets trust the Federal Reserve to keep inflation under control—and we will fulfill their trust.\nOur structure means too that the Federal Reserve can credibly commit to selling its MBSs slowly over time. Along these lines, in testimony before Congress in late March, Chairman Bernanke described how he expected MBS sales to work. He emphasized that the timing of initiating sales, like any other move by the FOMC, would depend on its assessment of economic conditions. But once conditions are right, he suggested that the Federal Reserve could reduce its balance sheet by pre-announcing and then implementing a slow, gradual path of sales.\n\nI’ve always been a numbers guy, and so I find it helpful in my own thinking to put some actual numbers on the table. To pick one of many possible plans, suppose we were to commit to the public to sell 15 billion to 25 billion dollars worth per month of MBSs. This path of sales, combined with prepayments, would get the Federal Reserve out of MBSs within five years after the start of selling. The plan would also return the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet to a normal size, so that excess reserves would be normalized at their 2007 levels well before the end of the five-year period. Just as important, I feel confident that this pace of sales would be sufficiently slow that it would have little or no impact on MBS prices and long-term interest rates.\n\nTo sum up: It is likely that the Federal Reserve will have to sell a nontrivial amount of its MBS holdings if it is to be able to normalize its balance sheet in the next two decades. Such sales might cause untoward jumps in interest rates unless the Federal Reserve is able to credibly commit to a sufficiently slow pace. Fortunately, as is true in all realms of monetary policy, the Federal Reserve is well situated to make, communicate, and carry out such a commitment. I am optimistic that we will be able to normalize our balance sheet by the end of the teens.\n\nI’ve covered a lot of ground in this talk—from the housing sector to the general economy to the Fed balance sheet. My overarching theme has been the issue of normalization after the recession. That normalization will, in my view, be slow in the housing sector. But despite the ongoing difficulties in this sector, the recovery process seems underway in the general economy. It is time for us in the Federal Reserve to begin to think about the process of normalization of our balance sheet, and how that process is likely to work.\n\nThis concludes my remarks, but let me close by thanking all of you for this invitation. Some of you in this room have worked formally with the Federal Reserve Bank in the past, either as a member of our Board of Directors or as a member of one of our business advisory councils. Others of you—or representatives of your companies—have shared business insights that help us better understand what’s going on in the economy. That local representation is part of what makes the Federal Reserve System unique. So thanks to all of you who have worked with us in the past, and as for the rest of you—we’ll be in touch. And now I would be happy to take your questions."

        "content": "Paper: Financial Conditions Indexes: A Fresh Look after the Financial Crisis [PDF] (from the 2010 U.S. Monetary Policy Forum)\nIntroduction\nIn this paper, the authors construct a new financial conditions index (FCI). As its name suggests, an FCI is a summary statistic that gauges how well financial markets are working. Before I continue, let me make the usual disclaimer and stress that the following views are mine, and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve. The FCI in this paper has three novel features relative to earlier indices. First, it is constructed from a large number (44!) of distinct data series. These different series cover different sample periods (different beginning and end dates). The authors are able to use all of these distinct sources of information because they exploit relatively novel unbalanced panel estimation techniques to construct their index.\nSecond, the authors purge their FCI of information related to current and lagged GDP growth and inflation. They do so to better isolate information in financial markets themselves, as opposed to other parts of the economy.\nFinally, prior FCIs are constructed to be the principal component of a number of underlying data series. Implicitly, these constructions are assuming that the underlying data series are largely driven by a single factor. The authors allow for the possibility that their 44 data series are generated by multiple factors (specifically three).\nThe authors use pseudo-out-of-sample forecasting exercises to evaluate their new FCI in terms of its ability to predict future GDP growth. Generally speaking, they find that the new FCI does somewhat better than a basic autoregressive (AR) model (in which lags of past GDP growth are used to forecast future GDP growth) and prior FCIs. The superior performance is especially pronounced in the past five years. However, the new FCI does considerably worse than these alternative models in the latter part of the 1990s.\nI enjoyed reading this paper. I was especially impressed by how the authors exploited high-powered econometrics to combine information from so many distinct sources.\nThe authors focus on the use of the FCI as a forecasting tool. This is indeed an important question, and we learn much from their analysis. In my remarks, I will focus on a related but distinct question: How should we measure financial market conditions so as to best guide monetary policymakers’ decisions?\nMy discussion will begin with a brief—and certainly overly simplistic—description of three kinds of financial market frictions: collateral scarcity, asymmetric information, and illiquidity. (Admittedly, these terms are used in a variety of ways in the economics literature, and you will have to wait to hear how I’m using them.) Especially in light of the past two and a half years, it seems reasonable to think that the severity of these frictions may vary over time. I will argue, though, that the different frictions translate into different policy responses. As a result, economic theory strongly suggests that one needs more than a single variable to get a measure of financial market conditions that is useful for policymakers. I will try to provide some (crude!) guidance about how to parse the data to arrive at the relevant information.\nThree Frictions\nI discuss three frictions in asset markets and appropriate policy responses to their becoming more severe. Throughout, it is worth keeping in mind that government interventions typically have some administrative costs. These costs mean that interventions are certainly inappropriate when the frictions are relatively small in size.\nCollateral\nIn frictionless credit markets, firms are fully able to capitalize their flow of future profits. In practice, lenders realize that borrowers may be able to hide or divert profits. As a result, a firm’s borrowing capacity is generally affected by the market value of its holdings of collateral. Appropriate notions of collateral vary from context to context. However, whatever their form, collateral requirements impose a connection between a firm’s ability to borrow and the market value of its collateral.\nThus, suppose that firms are using land as a form of collateral, and land falls in value by 20%. Then, some firms will be forced to forgo projects that they would have otherwise undertaken. The quantity of investment will fall. Perhaps more surprisingly, the equilibrium interest rate will fall. Intuitively, borrowers’ demand for loans is capped by the market value of collateral. A fall in the market value of collateral leads to a fall in loan demand. To equilibrate markets, the supply of loans must also fall—and that can only happen if interest rates decline.\nThere are a number of useful policy responses to collateral shocks of this kind. The problem is that firms don’t have enough collateral. Suppose that the government gives Treasury debt to all firms. Those with good projects now have a source of funding: They can sell their Treasury debt (or borrow against it). Of course, creating this new Treasury debt means that the government must tax in the future. However, as long as the credit constraint is sufficiently tight, the social losses created by this taxation are less than the gains generated by loosening the firms’ borrowing constraints.1\nOn the other hand, some seemingly useful policy responses are ineffective. Lowering the fed funds rate (and thereby the real interest rate) cannot generate more investment. Loan demand is constrained by the availability of collateral, not by the cost of funds to borrowers. Indeed, the above policy response (handing out more government debt to firms) necessarily raises interest rates.\nBanks are firms, and so a good response may well require handing out Treasury debt to banks. Nonetheless, it may not be effective to give Treasury debt only to banks (as opposed to all firms). Banks will not be able to use this source of funds to make loans if firms are collateral-constrained.\nAsymmetric Information\nFirms may have private information about their projects or their collateral. This private information confronts lenders with an extra form of risk and constrains their willingness to lend. Correspondingly, increases in private information lead to falls in the amount of lending and to spikes in the spreads between corporate lending rates and default-free Treasuries. Indeed, in extremis, private information problems can actually shut down lending entirely.\nThe government’s ability to respond to this friction depends critically on its level of information. If a government has no more information than lenders, then the government must lose money on any program that seeks to expand the scope of lending. (If this were not true, then lenders would have adopted that same program.) At least in this sense, taxpayers are made worse off by government interventions.\nHowever, in some markets, governments may well have superior information to lenders. For example, through the bank supervision process, the Federal Reserve acquires a great deal of information that is not shared with markets. With this extra information, the Federal Reserve can safely lend through the discount window to potential borrowers at a lower rate than the borrowers would receive in private markets. There is a valuable synergy between the Fed’s role in bank supervision and its ability to intervene usefully in interbank lending markets.\nIlliquidity\nFinancial markets vary in their liquidity. In liquid markets, a seller gets the same price per unit regardless of the quantity sold or the speed of sale. In illiquid markets, selling rapidly or selling a lot leads to large price per unit declines relative to selling slowly or selling little.\nLiquidity shows up in asset prices and can influence allocations of real resources. For example, agency mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are guaranteed against default risk. But they still contain prepayment risk. The buyers of agency MBSs can usually diversify much of this risk by selling the asset. Now imagine, though, that the secondary markets for agency MBSs become much less liquid. Buyers of agency MBSs cannot diversify away the associated prepayment risk, and so demand a higher yield per unit of risk held. (Technically, we say that the market price of agency MBS prepayment risk rises.) Agency MBS risk premia rise, and home buyers end up facing higher mortgage rates.\nThe government can respond usefully to such an event. Suppose that the government buys a large amount of MBSs. Their generated flow of income will not greatly affect the government’s revenue stream, and so the government faces relatively little additional risk by buying the MBSs. However, buyers now have to hold a lot less risk in the form of agency MBSs. The market price of agency MBS prepayment risk declines. This form of government intervention is desirable because the government can cheaply diversify its position, while a private agent cannot.\nIf the market remains illiquid, then government sales of agency MBSs would lead to increases in their risk premium (because MBS buyers are forced to hold more risk). But eventually, the agency MBS market will become liquid once more. At this point, the government can reverse its operation and sell its MBSs in secondary markets without affecting their risk premium.\nHow Do We See the Frictions in the Data?\nI have talked about three frictions and the associated policy responses. Admittedly, the frictions almost certainly overlap to a greater extent than my discussion implies. For example, markets may well become more illiquid when collateral constraints tighten and/or private information problems worsen.\nBut, in general, these are three distinct frictions with three distinct policy responses. A single FCI cannot capture their separate fluctuations. To understand appropriate policy responses, one needs to identify (at least) three distinct financial condition factors (FCFs).\nI think that the authors do a useful first step in this direction. In Table 5.2, they distinguish several FCFs based on subsets of their 44 data series. They document that these FCFs do not have superior predictive performance relative to their preferred FCI. However, this exercise could be made even more useful by using theoretical considerations to map various kinds of credit market frictions into distinct choices of subsets of variables.\nMy discussion of the various frictions provides some initial insights into how we can determine their relative severity using financial markets data. For all of them, of course, we should see loan quantities decline. How else would they show up in financial markets data?\nFriction 1 (collateral): Collateral prices fall, and interest rates decline. Credit market risk spreads do not change.\nFriction 2 (private information): Credit market spreads increase, and loan standards tighten.\nFriction 3 (illiquidity): The market price of a given asset’s risk rises.\nI have to say that separate frictions are probably not essential in thinking about the period from late 2007 through mid-2009. It seems clear—both from the authors’ work and from more casual empiricism—that all three of these frictions increased greatly in severity during this period.\nBut the current picture is murkier. I would certainly say that at this point, credit market spreads are sufficiently low that friction 2 seems hardly relevant. It is harder to tell about friction 3. The market price of agency MBS prepayment risk has fallen, but this decline may well be due to the large Fed holdings of agency MBSs.\nBut net borrowing remains low. This indicates to me that friction 1—low borrowing capacity because of collateral constraints—may still be significant. Both short-term and medium-term real interest rates (as measured by TIPS bonds) are low relative to their historical averages. Land is an important source of collateral, and its price remains low. (More generally, as of 2009:3, nonfinancial noncorporate net worth is down about 17% from 2007.) It is true that credit market spreads have vanished, but this is not a relevant consideration when thinking about friction 1.\nIt is exactly this kind of analysis that makes me think that using multiple FCFs to gauge financial market conditions might be so important. This point is reinforced by the recent behavior of the eight FCIs in the authors’ paper. The first seven all rose in the second half of 2009, but the authors’ own FCI fell. Clearly, there are at least two distinct factors responsible for these movements. My message is that knowing these distinct factors matters for understanding how policymakers should respond to worsening financial market conditions.\nConclusions\nIn many ways, my remarks parallel the sophisticated discussion of financial market imperfections in the introduction to this paper. To use their language, the authors point out that our modeling of such imperfections is still rudimentary. They argue that this state of play means that one has to use reduced-form statistical techniques to create FCIs.\nI agree with them that the extant modeling is rudimentary, and it is likely to remain so for some time. Nonetheless, even these simple models have important insights. I hope that these model-based insights become more central in future attempts to construct measures of strains in financial markets.\n1 These social gains exist because the government has a power that private lenders do not. The collateral constraint exists because borrowers can divert profits before repaying lenders. Governments can impose sales and other taxes that seize firm revenues before they can be diverted.\n\nPaper: Financial Conditions Indexes: A Fresh Look after the Financial Crisis [PDF] (from the 2010 U.S. Monetary Policy Forum)\n\nIn this paper, the authors construct a new financial conditions index (FCI). As its name suggests, an FCI is a summary statistic that gauges how well financial markets are working. Before I continue, let me make the usual disclaimer and stress that the following views are mine, and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve. The FCI in this paper has three novel features relative to earlier indices. First, it is constructed from a large number (44!) of distinct data series. These different series cover different sample periods (different beginning and end dates). The authors are able to use all of these distinct sources of information because they exploit relatively novel unbalanced panel estimation techniques to construct their index.\n\nSecond, the authors purge their FCI of information related to current and lagged GDP growth and inflation. They do so to better isolate information in financial markets themselves, as opposed to other parts of the economy.\n\nFinally, prior FCIs are constructed to be the principal component of a number of underlying data series. Implicitly, these constructions are assuming that the underlying data series are largely driven by a single factor. The authors allow for the possibility that their 44 data series are generated by multiple factors (specifically three).\n\nThe authors use pseudo-out-of-sample forecasting exercises to evaluate their new FCI in terms of its ability to predict future GDP growth. Generally speaking, they find that the new FCI does somewhat better than a basic autoregressive (AR) model (in which lags of past GDP growth are used to forecast future GDP growth) and prior FCIs. The superior performance is especially pronounced in the past five years. However, the new FCI does considerably worse than these alternative models in the latter part of the 1990s.\n\nI enjoyed reading this paper. I was especially impressed by how the authors exploited high-powered econometrics to combine information from so many distinct sources.\n\nThe authors focus on the use of the FCI as a forecasting tool. This is indeed an important question, and we learn much from their analysis. In my remarks, I will focus on a related but distinct question: How should we measure financial market conditions so as to best guide monetary policymakers’ decisions?\n\nMy discussion will begin with a brief—and certainly overly simplistic—description of three kinds of financial market frictions: collateral scarcity, asymmetric information, and illiquidity. (Admittedly, these terms are used in a variety of ways in the economics literature, and you will have to wait to hear how I’m using them.) Especially in light of the past two and a half years, it seems reasonable to think that the severity of these frictions may vary over time. I will argue, though, that the different frictions translate into different policy responses. As a result, economic theory strongly suggests that one needs more than a single variable to get a measure of financial market conditions that is useful for policymakers. I will try to provide some (crude!) guidance about how to parse the data to arrive at the relevant information.\n\nI discuss three frictions in asset markets and appropriate policy responses to their becoming more severe. Throughout, it is worth keeping in mind that government interventions typically have some administrative costs. These costs mean that interventions are certainly inappropriate when the frictions are relatively small in size.\n\nCollateral\nIn frictionless credit markets, firms are fully able to capitalize their flow of future profits. In practice, lenders realize that borrowers may be able to hide or divert profits. As a result, a firm’s borrowing capacity is generally affected by the market value of its holdings of collateral. Appropriate notions of collateral vary from context to context. However, whatever their form, collateral requirements impose a connection between a firm’s ability to borrow and the market value of its collateral.\n\nThus, suppose that firms are using land as a form of collateral, and land falls in value by 20%. Then, some firms will be forced to forgo projects that they would have otherwise undertaken. The quantity of investment will fall. Perhaps more surprisingly, the equilibrium interest rate will fall. Intuitively, borrowers’ demand for loans is capped by the market value of collateral. A fall in the market value of collateral leads to a fall in loan demand. To equilibrate markets, the supply of loans must also fall—and that can only happen if interest rates decline.\n\nThere are a number of useful policy responses to collateral shocks of this kind. The problem is that firms don’t have enough collateral. Suppose that the government gives Treasury debt to all firms. Those with good projects now have a source of funding: They can sell their Treasury debt (or borrow against it). Of course, creating this new Treasury debt means that the government must tax in the future. However, as long as the credit constraint is sufficiently tight, the social losses created by this taxation are less than the gains generated by loosening the firms’ borrowing constraints.1\n\nOn the other hand, some seemingly useful policy responses are ineffective. Lowering the fed funds rate (and thereby the real interest rate) cannot generate more investment. Loan demand is constrained by the availability of collateral, not by the cost of funds to borrowers. Indeed, the above policy response (handing out more government debt to firms) necessarily raises interest rates.\n\nBanks are firms, and so a good response may well require handing out Treasury debt to banks. Nonetheless, it may not be effective to give Treasury debt only to banks (as opposed to all firms). Banks will not be able to use this source of funds to make loans if firms are collateral-constrained.\n\nAsymmetric Information\nFirms may have private information about their projects or their collateral. This private information confronts lenders with an extra form of risk and constrains their willingness to lend. Correspondingly, increases in private information lead to falls in the amount of lending and to spikes in the spreads between corporate lending rates and default-free Treasuries. Indeed, in extremis, private information problems can actually shut down lending entirely.\n\nThe government’s ability to respond to this friction depends critically on its level of information. If a government has no more information than lenders, then the government must lose money on any program that seeks to expand the scope of lending. (If this were not true, then lenders would have adopted that same program.) At least in this sense, taxpayers are made worse off by government interventions.\n\nHowever, in some markets, governments may well have superior information to lenders. For example, through the bank supervision process, the Federal Reserve acquires a great deal of information that is not shared with markets. With this extra information, the Federal Reserve can safely lend through the discount window to potential borrowers at a lower rate than the borrowers would receive in private markets. There is a valuable synergy between the Fed’s role in bank supervision and its ability to intervene usefully in interbank lending markets.\n\nIlliquidity\nFinancial markets vary in their liquidity. In liquid markets, a seller gets the same price per unit regardless of the quantity sold or the speed of sale. In illiquid markets, selling rapidly or selling a lot leads to large price per unit declines relative to selling slowly or selling little.\n\nLiquidity shows up in asset prices and can influence allocations of real resources. For example, agency mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are guaranteed against default risk. But they still contain prepayment risk. The buyers of agency MBSs can usually diversify much of this risk by selling the asset. Now imagine, though, that the secondary markets for agency MBSs become much less liquid. Buyers of agency MBSs cannot diversify away the associated prepayment risk, and so demand a higher yield per unit of risk held. (Technically, we say that the market price of agency MBS prepayment risk rises.) Agency MBS risk premia rise, and home buyers end up facing higher mortgage rates.\n\nThe government can respond usefully to such an event. Suppose that the government buys a large amount of MBSs. Their generated flow of income will not greatly affect the government’s revenue stream, and so the government faces relatively little additional risk by buying the MBSs. However, buyers now have to hold a lot less risk in the form of agency MBSs. The market price of agency MBS prepayment risk declines. This form of government intervention is desirable because the government can cheaply diversify its position, while a private agent cannot.\n\nIf the market remains illiquid, then government sales of agency MBSs would lead to increases in their risk premium (because MBS buyers are forced to hold more risk). But eventually, the agency MBS market will become liquid once more. At this point, the government can reverse its operation and sell its MBSs in secondary markets without affecting their risk premium.\n\nI have talked about three frictions and the associated policy responses. Admittedly, the frictions almost certainly overlap to a greater extent than my discussion implies. For example, markets may well become more illiquid when collateral constraints tighten and/or private information problems worsen.\n\nBut, in general, these are three distinct frictions with three distinct policy responses. A single FCI cannot capture their separate fluctuations. To understand appropriate policy responses, one needs to identify (at least) three distinct financial condition factors (FCFs).\n\nI think that the authors do a useful first step in this direction. In Table 5.2, they distinguish several FCFs based on subsets of their 44 data series. They document that these FCFs do not have superior predictive performance relative to their preferred FCI. However, this exercise could be made even more useful by using theoretical considerations to map various kinds of credit market frictions into distinct choices of subsets of variables.\n\nMy discussion of the various frictions provides some initial insights into how we can determine their relative severity using financial markets data. For all of them, of course, we should see loan quantities decline. How else would they show up in financial markets data?\n\nFriction 1 (collateral): Collateral prices fall, and interest rates decline. Credit market risk spreads do not change.\n\nFriction 2 (private information): Credit market spreads increase, and loan standards tighten.\n\nFriction 3 (illiquidity): The market price of a given asset’s risk rises.\n\nI have to say that separate frictions are probably not essential in thinking about the period from late 2007 through mid-2009. It seems clear—both from the authors’ work and from more casual empiricism—that all three of these frictions increased greatly in severity during this period.\n\nBut the current picture is murkier. I would certainly say that at this point, credit market spreads are sufficiently low that friction 2 seems hardly relevant. It is harder to tell about friction 3. The market price of agency MBS prepayment risk has fallen, but this decline may well be due to the large Fed holdings of agency MBSs.\n\nBut net borrowing remains low. This indicates to me that friction 1—low borrowing capacity because of collateral constraints—may still be significant. Both short-term and medium-term real interest rates (as measured by TIPS bonds) are low relative to their historical averages. Land is an important source of collateral, and its price remains low. (More generally, as of 2009:3, nonfinancial noncorporate net worth is down about 17% from 2007.) It is true that credit market spreads have vanished, but this is not a relevant consideration when thinking about friction 1.\n\nIt is exactly this kind of analysis that makes me think that using multiple FCFs to gauge financial market conditions might be so important. This point is reinforced by the recent behavior of the eight FCIs in the authors’ paper. The first seven all rose in the second half of 2009, but the authors’ own FCI fell. Clearly, there are at least two distinct factors responsible for these movements. My message is that knowing these distinct factors matters for understanding how policymakers should respond to worsening financial market conditions.\n\nIn many ways, my remarks parallel the sophisticated discussion of financial market imperfections in the introduction to this paper. To use their language, the authors point out that our modeling of such imperfections is still rudimentary. They argue that this state of play means that one has to use reduced-form statistical techniques to create FCIs.\n\nI agree with them that the extant modeling is rudimentary, and it is likely to remain so for some time. Nonetheless, even these simple models have important insights. I hope that these model-based insights become more central in future attempts to construct measures of strains in financial markets.\n\n1 These social gains exist because the government has a power that private lenders do not. The collateral constraint exists because borrowers can divert profits before repaying lenders. Governments can impose sales and other taxes that seize firm revenues before they can be diverted."
