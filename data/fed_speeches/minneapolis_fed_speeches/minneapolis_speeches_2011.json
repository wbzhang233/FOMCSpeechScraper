The theme of the speech is that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) should do more than simply decide at each meeting whether or not to buy more assets or to keep interest rates low for longer. The Committee should provide a public contingency plan—that is, provide guidance to the public on how it will respond to a variety of relevant scenarios. But how should the FOMC formulate a public contingency plan? The FOMC has two statutory mandates: to promote price stability and to promote maximum employment. Given these mandates, it makes sense for the FOMC to vary its chosen level of monetary accommodation in response to changes in current and expected inflation and current and expected unemployment.\nI find it helpful to summarize the relevant information in what I term a mandate dashboard. Here’s what the dashboard looked like in the FOMC meeting earlier this month.\nLarge Image\nI’ll explain the dashboard starting with the inflation side. The first cell from the left is current inflation. The second cell is what inflation is projected to be in one year’s time. Finally, the third cell contains a forecast for inflation in two years’ time. The unemployment side is similar. The first cell from the left is current unemployment. The second cell contains a forecast for unemployment in one year’s time, and the third cell is a forecast for unemployment in two years’ time. The various forecasts are based on the Summary of Economic Projections released by the FOMC earlier this month.\nIt is important to note that the dashboard includes information from other current variables besides inflation and unemployment. The forecasts for inflation and unemployment could potentially be based on a wide range of information—anticipated changes in fiscal policy, changes in European financial markets and so on. So, basing policy on the mandate dashboard does allow policy to react to changes in these other economic variables. However, using this kind of dashboard does require monetary policy to respond to any economic variable only insofar as that variable affects current and future inflation or unemployment. This restriction seems appropriate given the limited nature of the FOMC’s statutory assignment from Congress.\nGiven this mandate dashboard, how should the level of monetary accommodation evolve over time in response to changes in the dashboard’s readings? In general, the answer to this question is subtle, because it depends on how the FOMC weights its two mandates. However, there are two common cases in which the mandate dashboard becomes straightforward to use. Suppose current and expected inflation rise and current and expected unemployment fall, as is often true in a recovery. Then, regardless of how it weights its two mandates, the FOMC should reduce the level of accommodation. Alternatively, suppose inflation and expected inflation go down and unemployment and expected unemployment go up, as is often true when the economy slows. Then, regardless of how it weights its two mandates, the FOMC should increase the level of accommodation.\nA public contingency plan for 2012 would specify how the FOMC would act in a number of scenarios for the mandate dashboard in a year’s time. It’s useful to start with the FOMC’s projected scenario for 2012.\nLarge Image\nNotice that the second cell for the November 2012 row is the forecast for inflation over the course of 2013, and the second cell for the November 2011 row is the forecast for inflation over the course of 2012. We generally think that monetary policy operates with a one- or two-year lag. Accordingly, the dashboard keeps track of what we expect the economy to be like in a year or two.\nIf we compare the second row with the first, we see that in this scenario, core inflation is about the same in a year’s time as it is now. Unemployment is lower. These changes imply that the Committee should reduce the level of monetary accommodation over the coming year. But, like those of many private sector forecasters, the FOMC’s projections have proven imperfect over the past few years. With that in mind, the Committee should provide guidance to the public about how it will respond to unexpected changes in the mandate dashboard. Suppose, for example, that the following alternative scenario occurs in 2012, in which economic conditions are worse than expected:\nLarge Image\nIn this alternative scenario, inflation has fallen since November 2011 and unemployment has risen since November 2011.

In a speech given in May 2010, Chairman Bernanke stated, “Transparency regarding monetary policy … not only helps make central banks more accountable, it also increases the effectiveness of policy.”1 I agree completely with this sentiment. And I see a public contingency plan, based on the explicit use of metrics like the mandate dashboard, as promoting exactly the kind of transparency that Chairman Bernanke was describing.

        "content": "Thank you for that generous introduction. It’s a huge pleasure to be back in Winnipeg. I’ve been gone a long time. How long? After living here for 13 years, I moved back to the States right after the Winnipeg Jets won their last AVCO Cup as champions of the World Hockey Association—that is, 1979. Consequently, my words today will be those of an American policymaker speaking on American policy issues. More specifically, I’ll provide a look back at Federal Reserve decision-making over the past few years. However, I’ll close with my views on how I think that the Federal Open Market Committee—the FOMC—can work to reduce the level of uncertainty surrounding future monetary policymaking. As always, any views I express here today are my own, and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System, including my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\nSome FOMC Basics\nLet me begin with some basics about the Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is one of 12 regional Reserve banks that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System. Our bank represents the ninth of the 12 Federal Reserve districts, and by area, we’re the second largest. Our district includes Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, northwestern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.\nEight times per year, the FOMC meets to set the path of monetary policy over the next six to seven weeks. All 12 presidents of the various regional Federal Reserve banks—including me—and the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board, including Chairman Bernanke, contribute to these deliberations. (Currently, there are only five governors—two positions are unfilled.) However, the Committee itself consists only of the governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and a group of four other presidents that rotates annually. Right now, that last group consists of the presidents from the Minneapolis, Philadelphia, Dallas and Chicago Federal Reserve Banks.\nI’ve said that the FOMC meets (at least) eight times per year. But how do these meetings work? At a typical meeting, there are two so-called go-rounds, in which every president and every governor has the opportunity to speak without interruption. The first of these is referred to as the economics go-round. It is kicked off by a presentation on current economic conditions by Federal Reserve staff economists. Then, the presidents and governors describe their individual views on current economic conditions and their respective outlooks for future economic conditions. The presidents typically start by providing information about their district’s local economic performance. We get that information from our research staffs, but also from our interactions with business and community leaders in industries and towns from across our districts.\nThe Committee next turns to the second go-round, which focuses on policy. Again, the staff begins, with a presentation of policy options. After that, each of the 17 meeting participants has a chance to speak on what each views as the appropriate policy choice. This set of remarks is followed with a summary by the chairman, in which he lays out what he sees as the Committee’s consensus view for future policy. The voting members of the FOMC then cast their votes on this policy statement and thereby set monetary policy for the next six to seven weeks.\nThis description of an FOMC meeting highlights how the structure of the FOMC mirrors the federalist structure of our government. Representatives from different regions of the country—the various presidents—have input into FOMC deliberations. And, as I’ve described, their input relies critically on information received from district residents. In this way, the Federal Reserve System is deliberately designed to give the residents of Main Street a voice in national monetary policy.\nFOMC Objectives\nI’ve said that FOMC participants seek to adopt what they view as the appropriate policy choice. That provides a natural segue into my next topic: the policy objectives of the FOMC. The FOMC has a dual mandate, established by Congress: to set monetary policy so as to promote price stability and maximum employment. The heart of the price stability mandate is the Federal Reserve’s inflation objective. The FOMC communicates its inflation objective to the public in a number of ways. Most prominently, at quarterly intervals, FOMC meeting participants publicly reveal their forecasts for inflation in the longer run (maybe five or six years), assuming that monetary policy is optimal. Those forecasts usually range between 1.5 percent and 2 percent per year. They are often collectively referred to by saying that the Federal Reserve views inflation as being “mandate-consistent” if it is running at “2 percent or a bit under.”\nCongress has also mandated that the FOMC set monetary policy so as to promote maximum employment. An important and ongoing communications challenge for the FOMC is that it is much harder to quantify the maximum employment mandate than the price stability mandate. Changes in minimum wage policy, demography, taxes and regulations, technological productivity, job market efficiency, unemployment insurance benefits, entrepreneurial credit access and social norms all influence what we might consider “maximum employment.” Trying to offset these changes in the economy with monetary policy can lead to a dangerous drift in inflationary expectations and ultimately in inflation itself.\nLooking Back over the Past Four Years: Actions\nThe National Bureau of Economic Research’s Business Cycle Dating Committee serves as the official arbiter of precisely when recessions begin and end in the United States.1The committee has determined that what is commonly referred to as the Great Recession began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009. During that time period, real gross domestic product (that is, GDP adjusted for inflation) fell by 5 percent and unemployment nearly doubled.\nThe Federal Reserve responded to the Great Recession and the associated financial crisis in a number of ways that fall roughly into two classes. First, the Fed engaged in a vast amount of lending to firms believed to be in sound condition. It lent through conventional vehicles like the discount window and currency swaps with foreign central banks. But it also lent through relatively unconventional vehicles like the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility.2 Second, the Fed lowered the real interest rate facing borrowers and lenders.\nHere, I should clarify some terminology. By the term “real interest rate,” I’m referring to the interest rate received by lenders net of inflation. Thus, if the interest rate on the loan is 5 percent per year and lenders expect inflation to be around 2 percent, the real interest rate is roughly 3 percent. Economists generally think that it’s the real interest rate that matters for economic decision-making.\nI’ll first discuss the Fed’s lending responses and then talk about the interest rate cuts.\nLending\nTo understand the Fed’s lending response to the events of 2007-09, we need to step back to the second half of 2006. At that time, firms and people around the world held a wide array of financial assets that were ultimately backed by U.S. residential land. They viewed those assets as being largely risk-free. Investors may have understood that a fall in the value of U.S. land would impose large losses on them. However, they put low odds on such a decline taking place. Rather, they seemed to believe that U.S. land prices would continue to rise at a steady clip, as they had over the preceding 10 years.\nBy the second half of 2007, that belief began to unravel in the face of incoming data. People were learning the hard way that U.S. land was a risky investment. Now the only question was how risky. That uncertainty planted the seeds for global financial panic.\nWhat do I mean by the term “financial panic”? Financial panics are events that blur the line between liquidity and solvency. A firm is solvent if its revenues (in a discounted present-value sense) exceed its expenditures. A firm is liquid if it is able to raise enough funds—either by borrowing or by selling assets—to pay its current costs. In a financial market that is functioning well, solvent firms are typically liquid because they can borrow against their future profits. During a financial panic, however, lenders feel unable to assess the future profits and/or collateral of borrowers. Borrowing becomes highly constrained, credit markets cease to function as well, and even highly solvent firms may become illiquid.\nAs I’ve said, many forms of collateral around the world were either implicitly or explicitly backed by U.S. residential land in the mid-2000s. But by mid-2007, as those land prices fell, financial markets became increasingly uncertain about how to evaluate mortgage-backed securities and other assets backed by U.S. land. That translated into uncertainty about the ultimate solvency of institutions holding those assets—and then about the ultimate solvency of any of their creditors. Spreads in credit markets between Treasury returns and other bond returns began to widen—at first slightly and then alarmingly as the panic conditions took firmer hold.\nMost economists agree that central banks should respond to financial panics by communicating that they are willing to lend freely to solvent firms, against a wide range of good collateral, at some kind of penalty rate. This policy is useful for two reasons. First, it provides a source of funds to potential borrowers who are illiquid but nonetheless solvent. Second, it provides a floor to collateral valuation. Private lenders know that they can always use collateral seized from a defaulting borrower as a vehicle to borrow money from the central bank. That baseline use serves to spur private lending.\nBeginning in mid-2007, the Fed took a number of actions consistent with this operating principle. It lent money to financial institutions through the discount window and its close cousin, the Term Auction Facility. It injected liquidity into a broad range of essential credit markets through a veritable alphabet soup of special lending vehicles. In some sense, these interventions were typical for a central bank operating in the context of a financial panic. But the size of the problem meant that the operations were unprecedented in their scale. The interventions ultimately made up more than $1 trillion of Federal Reserve assets.\nThere is no doubt that these interventions saved many solvent firms from collapse during the financial crisis. Over time, panic eased and spreads in financial markets normalized. Once that happened, the private sector stopped borrowing from the Fed because it found the Fed’s penalty rates too onerous. As a result, the Fed shut down its special lending facilities in 2010.\nIt is plausible that the Fed’s loans through the various special facilities exposed it—and by extension, the American public—to some risk of loss. However, it is difficult to know how much risk was involved. We generally try to measure a financial asset’s risk by the spread between its yield and that of a safe benchmark like U.S. Treasuries. But as I’ve mentioned, in a financial panic a relatively large fraction of such a spread is attributable to illiquidity as opposed to intrinsic risk. The goal of the central bank’s intervention is exactly to eliminate this panic-driven illiquidity. Accordingly, we cannot gauge the Fed’s risk exposures without somehow correcting spreads for this illiquidity factor. Calculating this, however, is extremely difficult. What we can say with certainty is that the Fed has not lost a penny on any of these transactions: All such loans have been repaid in full.\nI should be careful to distinguish the lending that I’ve described from the institution-specific assistance the Federal Reserve provided to firms like AIG. These institution-specific interventions were deemed necessary by the Fed and the Bush administration because they believed that there were no adequate procedures in place for liquidating the assets of systemically important financial institutions in an orderly fashion. In 2010, the U.S. Congress passed an act that provides these procedures. Simultaneously—and correctly—the Congress removes the Fed’s ability to engage in institution-specific assistance. The act does leave in place the Fed’s ability to engage in broad-based market interventions of the kind that I’ve described, albeit with more congressional and White House oversight. This ability of the Fed could be useful in the event that financial market turmoil in other parts of the world ever threatens to spread to U.S. credit and capital markets.\nCutting Interest Rates\nI’ve talked about how the fall in land prices generated a sharp increase in risk perceptions in financial markets and how that in turn led to a financial crisis. I now want to turn to what I see as the second key effect of the fall in land prices. This fall reduced the net worth of many households and firms. According to Fed calculations, household net worth fell by over 25 percent from the second quarter of 2007 to the first quarter of 2009. Households responded to this change in their balance sheets by forgoing consumption, which led in turn to a fall in output and employment,3 and put downward pressure on the price level.\nThe FOMC reacted by lowering its target interest rate from 5.25 percent in August 2007 to a range of 0 to 0.25 percent in December 2008; it now remains at this lower bound. Since inflation expectations remained stable, the FOMC’s action has had the effect of lowering the real interest rate facing households. Households, of course, typically respond to lower rates by saving less and demanding more consumption. Similarly, firms undertake more investment projects. In this way, the FOMC can and has partially offset the impact on the economy of the loss of net worth.\nIndeed, the FOMC would probably have liked to respond by cutting its target interest rate still further. The problem is that this target interest rate cannot go below zero. Instead, the FOMC has engaged in large-scale purchases of long-term assets issued or backed by the government. The goal of these transactions is to lower long-term real interest rates and again offset the impact on the economy of the net worth shock.\nSo, to sum up, the fall in land prices triggered an increase in risk perceptions and a decrease in household net worth. The increase in risk led to a major financial crisis, which the Federal Reserve addressed through a large amount of broad-based lending. The decrease in net worth led to a major recession and ongoing slow recovery. The Federal Reserve’s reduction in interest rates has lessened the impact of this change in net worth.\nLooking Back over the Past Four Years: Outcomes\nHow has the Federal Reserve performed relative to its dual mandate over the past four years, since the onset of the Great Recession at the end of 2007? In terms of price stability, the answer is remarkably well. The personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation rate has averaged 1.8 percent per year from the fourth quarter of 2007 through the third quarter of 2011. In my view, this outcome is essentially consistent with price stability.\nNow, I want to be clear here about what I mean when I say “inflation.” That number I just gave you, 1.8 percent per year for nearly four years, refers to what’s termed headline inflation. It includes all goods and services, including food and energy. When the Fed says that it is committed to keeping inflation at 2 percent or a little less, it means prices for all goods and services, including the gas we put in our cars and the food we put on our tables. When we make reference to year-over-year core inflation—that is, inflation without food and energy—it’s only because we believe that core inflation is a helpful predictor of headline inflation over the next three or four years.\nIt is important, I think, to understand why there is no longer an intrinsic connection between the size of the Fed’s balance sheet and inflation. In the past three years, the Fed has bought over $2 trillion of securities issued or backed by the government. The Fed has funded that purchase by tripling the amount of deposits held by banks with the Fed—what are called bank reserves.\nThe standard reasoning is that this kind of reserve creation is inflationary. Banks are only allowed to offer checkable deposits in proportion to their reserves. Economists view checkable deposits as a form of money because, like cash, checkable deposits make many transactions easier. In this sense, bank reserves held with the Fed are essentially licenses for banks to create a certain amount of money. By giving out more licenses, the FOMC is allowing banks to create more money. And if you took any economics in school you learned: More money chasing the same number of goods—voilà, inflation.\nBut this connection between bank reserves and inflation is simply not operative right now. Banks have few good lending opportunities, and so they’re not trying to attract deposits. As a result, they are keeping nearly $1.6 trillion of reserves at the Fed in excess of what they need to back their deposits. In other words, banks have the licenses to create money, but are choosing not to do so.\nI’m confident, though, that at some point in the future, the economy will improve and banks will once again have good lending opportunities. Some observers are concerned that once this happens, the banks’ excess reserves will serve as kindling for an inflationary fire. This concern would have been entirely appropriate three years ago. But in October 2008, Congress granted the Federal Reserve the power to pay interest on bank reserves. Right now, that interest rate is 25 basis points, or 0.25 percent. By raising that rate judiciously, the Fed has the ability to deter banks from using their reserves to create money, and through this mechanism, the Fed can prevent inflation. The Fed’s ability to pay interest on reserves means that the old and familiar link between increased bank reserves and higher inflation has been broken.\nOf course, this requires the Fed to raise the interest rate on reserves in response to changes in economic conditions. You might well ask: Will the Fed raise interest rates in a sufficiently timely and effective manner to keep inflation at 2 percent or a little less? But that’s always been the key question to ask about Fed policy, even when the Fed had a much smaller balance sheet. And that’s my point: Because the Fed can pay interest on reserves, the size of its balance sheet does not, in and of itself, undercut the credibility of its commitment to keep inflation at 2 percent or a bit under. I believe that’s why both survey and market-based measures of expected inflation over the next five to 10 years have remained remarkably stable as the Fed has expanded its liabilities.\nIn terms of the Fed’s employment mandate: Unemployment remains disturbingly high at 9 percent. But—and this is important to keep in mind—it would likely be much higher without Federal Reserve interventions. Suppose the Fed had not followed its aggressive lending policies or its imaginative forms of monetary accommodation. What would have happened to the economy? While a definitive answer is impossible, the evidence from the Great Depression is suggestive. In the early years of the Great Depression, the United States was on the gold standard and the Fed could not easily adjust the quantity of bank reserves. As a result, the Fed did not engage in broad-based lending during the 1929-33 period. Nor did it cut interest rates aggressively. By 1933, hosts of financial institutions had failed, real GDP had fallen by over 25 percent, unemployment was 25 percent and the nation had experienced annual double-digit rates of deflation. The Fed’s passiveness in 1929-33 was associated with an economic catastrophe.\nLet me summarize my review of Federal Reserve performance since the beginning of the Great Recession in December 2007. My assessment is that, despite profound economic shocks, the Federal Reserve—led by Chairman Bernanke—has successfully met its price stability mandate through its lending programs and through innovative forms of monetary accommodation. These actions also helped keep the unemployment rate from rising even higher. As part of its accommodative policy, the FOMC has greatly expanded its balance sheet. But it is important to understand that this expansion need not trigger inflation now or in the future, because the Federal Reserve can now pay interest on bank reserves.\nGoing Forward\nI’ve spent most of this speech looking back. Let me close by offering some thoughts about future policy.\nI’ve underscored the Federal Reserve’s success in meeting its price stability mandate over the past four years. And the Fed’s actions have helped keep unemployment from rising higher. But the unemployment rate, currently 9 percent, remains disturbingly high—and FOMC meeting participants are projecting that it will fall to only about 8 percent over the next two years.\nThe FOMC does have tools remaining. It could put downward pressure on long-term market interest rates in at least two ways. First, it could buy more long-term Treasury securities or securities issued by government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Second, the Committee could extend its prediction for how long it will keep its target short-term interest rate exceptionally low. So, tools—and choices—remain.\nHowever, the FOMC should do more than simply decide at each meeting whether or not to buy more assets or to keep interest rates low for longer. Any current decision is based on the FOMC’s forecast of the future, and no forecast can be perfect. The Committee should provide a public contingency plan—that is, provide clear guidance on how it will respond to a variety of relevant scenarios. For example, the Committee recently projected that in 2011, core inflation will be 1.9 percent and that it will fall back in 2012 and 2013 to around 1.7 percent. Suppose hypothetically that core inflation, and the outlook for core inflation, has risen to 3 percent by the end of 2013, while unemployment has fallen to between 8 percent and 8.5 percent. A public contingency plan would allow the public to know what the Committee intends to do in that eventuality.\nI believe that public contingency planning will have many benefits. Let me mention two. First, in recent statements and speeches, I have described why the FOMC actions in August and September seemed inconsistent with the evolution of the macroeconomic data in 2011. This kind of inconsistency is much less likely to occur once the FOMC has formulated an explicit public contingency plan. Second, I’ve heard from businesses that policy uncertainty is curbing their incentive to hire or invest. Similarly, I’ve heard from consumers that policy uncertainty is curbing their incentive to spend. A public FOMC contingency plan can help reduce the level of policy uncertainty being created by the Fed.\nNo contingency plan can ever be definitive. Inevitably, the FOMC will learn things that it did not expect to learn. And so there may be conditions that force the FOMC to deviate from a chosen plan. However, having a public plan, and couching its decisions against the backdrop of that plan, will enhance Federal Reserve transparency, credibility, accountability and consistency.\nThank you for listening. I’d be happy to take your questions.\nEndnotes\n1 See National Bureau of Economic Research’s Business Cycle Dating Committee.\n2 See Willardson (2008) and Willardson and Pederson (2010).\n3 See Kocherlakota (2010) for a more extensive discussion of the relevant transmission mechanisms.\nReferences\nKocherlakota, Narayana R. 2010. “Two Models of Land Overvaluation and Their Implications.” Presented at “A Return to Jekyll Island: The Origins, History, and Future of the Federal Reserve,” Jekyll Island, Ga.\nWillardson, Niel. 2008. “Actions to Restore Financial Stability.” The Region (December), Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.\nWillardson, Niel, and LuAnne Pederson. 2010. “Federal Reserve Liquidity Programs: An Update.” The Region (June), Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.\n\nThank you for that generous introduction.

More specifically, I’ll provide a look back at Federal Reserve decision-making over the past few years. However, I’ll close with my views on how I think that the Federal Open Market Committee—the FOMC—can work to reduce the level of uncertainty surrounding future monetary policymaking. As always, any views I express here today are my own, and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System, including my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nLet me begin with some basics about the Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is one of 12 regional Reserve banks that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System. Our bank represents the ninth of the 12 Federal Reserve districts, and by area, we’re the second largest. Our district includes Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, northwestern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.\n\nEight times per year, the FOMC meets to set the path of monetary policy over the next six to seven weeks. All 12 presidents of the various regional Federal Reserve banks—including me—and the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board, including Chairman Bernanke, contribute to these deliberations. (Currently, there are only five governors—two positions are unfilled.) However, the Committee itself consists only of the governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and a group of four other presidents that rotates annually. Right now, that last group consists of the presidents from the Minneapolis, Philadelphia, Dallas and Chicago Federal Reserve Banks.\n\nI’ve said that the FOMC meets (at least) eight times per year. But how do these meetings work? At a typical meeting, there are two so-called go-rounds, in which every president and every governor has the opportunity to speak without interruption. The first of these is referred to as the economics go-round. It is kicked off by a presentation on current economic conditions by Federal Reserve staff economists. Then, the presidents and governors describe their individual views on current economic conditions and their respective outlooks for future economic conditions. The presidents typically start by providing information about their district’s local economic performance. We get that information from our research staffs, but also from our interactions with business and community leaders in industries and towns from across our districts.\n\nThe Committee next turns to the second go-round, which focuses on policy. Again, the staff begins, with a presentation of policy options. After that, each of the 17 meeting participants has a chance to speak on what each views as the appropriate policy choice. This set of remarks is followed with a summary by the chairman, in which he lays out what he sees as the Committee’s consensus view for future policy. The voting members of the FOMC then cast their votes on this policy statement and thereby set monetary policy for the next six to seven weeks.\n\nThis description of an FOMC meeting highlights how the structure of the FOMC mirrors the federalist structure of our government. Representatives from different regions of the country—the various presidents—have input into FOMC deliberations. And, as I’ve described, their input relies critically on information received from district residents. In this way, the Federal Reserve System is deliberately designed to give the residents of Main Street a voice in national monetary policy.\n\nI’ve said that FOMC participants seek to adopt what they view as the appropriate policy choice. That provides a natural segue into my next topic: the policy objectives of the FOMC. The FOMC has a dual mandate, established by Congress: to set monetary policy so as to promote price stability and maximum employment. The heart of the price stability mandate is the Federal Reserve’s inflation objective. The FOMC communicates its inflation objective to the public in a number of ways. Most prominently, at quarterly intervals, FOMC meeting participants publicly reveal their forecasts for inflation in the longer run (maybe five or six years), assuming that monetary policy is optimal. Those forecasts usually range between 1.5 percent and 2 percent per year. They are often collectively referred to by saying that the Federal Reserve views inflation as being “mandate-consistent” if it is running at “2 percent or a bit under.”\n\nCongress has also mandated that the FOMC set monetary policy so as to promote maximum employment. An important and ongoing communications challenge for the FOMC is that it is much harder to quantify the maximum employment mandate than the price stability mandate. Changes in minimum wage policy, demography, taxes and regulations, technological productivity, job market efficiency, unemployment insurance benefits, entrepreneurial credit access and social norms all influence what we might consider “maximum employment.” Trying to offset these changes in the economy with monetary policy can lead to a dangerous drift in inflationary expectations and ultimately in inflation itself.\n\nThe National Bureau of Economic Research’s Business Cycle Dating Committee serves as the official arbiter of precisely when recessions begin and end in the United States.1The committee has determined that what is commonly referred to as the Great Recession began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009. During that time period, real gross domestic product (that is, GDP adjusted for inflation) fell by 5 percent and unemployment nearly doubled.\n\nThe Federal Reserve responded to the Great Recession and the associated financial crisis in a number of ways that fall roughly into two classes. First, the Fed engaged in a vast amount of lending to firms believed to be in sound condition. It lent through conventional vehicles like the discount window and currency swaps with foreign central banks. But it also lent through relatively unconventional vehicles like the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility.2 Second, the Fed lowered the real interest rate facing borrowers and lenders.\n\nHere, I should clarify some terminology. By the term “real interest rate,” I’m referring to the interest rate received by lenders net of inflation. Thus, if the interest rate on the loan is 5 percent per year and lenders expect inflation to be around 2 percent, the real interest rate is roughly 3 percent. Economists generally think that it’s the real interest rate that matters for economic decision-making.\n\nI’ll first discuss the Fed’s lending responses and then talk about the interest rate cuts.\n\nTo understand the Fed’s lending response to the events of 2007-09, we need to step back to the second half of 2006. At that time, firms and people around the world held a wide array of financial assets that were ultimately backed by U.S. residential land. They viewed those assets as being largely risk-free. Investors may have understood that a fall in the value of U.S. land would impose large losses on them. However, they put low odds on such a decline taking place. Rather, they seemed to believe that U.S. land prices would continue to rise at a steady clip, as they had over the preceding 10 years.\n\nBy the second half of 2007, that belief began to unravel in the face of incoming data. People were learning the hard way that U.S. land was a risky investment. Now the only question was how risky. That uncertainty planted the seeds for global financial panic.\n\nWhat do I mean by the term “financial panic”? Financial panics are events that blur the line between liquidity and solvency. A firm is solvent if its revenues (in a discounted present-value sense) exceed its expenditures. A firm is liquid if it is able to raise enough funds—either by borrowing or by selling assets—to pay its current costs. In a financial market that is functioning well, solvent firms are typically liquid because they can borrow against their future profits. During a financial panic, however, lenders feel unable to assess the future profits and/or collateral of borrowers. Borrowing becomes highly constrained, credit markets cease to function as well, and even highly solvent firms may become illiquid.\n\nAs I’ve said, many forms of collateral around the world were either implicitly or explicitly backed by U.S. residential land in the mid-2000s. But by mid-2007, as those land prices fell, financial markets became increasingly uncertain about how to evaluate mortgage-backed securities and other assets backed by U.S. land. That translated into uncertainty about the ultimate solvency of institutions holding those assets—and then about the ultimate solvency of any of their creditors. Spreads in credit markets between Treasury returns and other bond returns began to widen—at first slightly and then alarmingly as the panic conditions took firmer hold.\n\nMost economists agree that central banks should respond to financial panics by communicating that they are willing to lend freely to solvent firms, against a wide range of good collateral, at some kind of penalty rate. This policy is useful for two reasons. First, it provides a source of funds to potential borrowers who are illiquid but nonetheless solvent. Second, it provides a floor to collateral valuation. Private lenders know that they can always use collateral seized from a defaulting borrower as a vehicle to borrow money from the central bank. That baseline use serves to spur private lending.\n\nBeginning in mid-2007, the Fed took a number of actions consistent with this operating principle. It lent money to financial institutions through the discount window and its close cousin, the Term Auction Facility. It injected liquidity into a broad range of essential credit markets through a veritable alphabet soup of special lending vehicles. In some sense, these interventions were typical for a central bank operating in the context of a financial panic. But the size of the problem meant that the operations were unprecedented in their scale. The interventions ultimately made up more than $1 trillion of Federal Reserve assets.\n\nThere is no doubt that these interventions saved many solvent firms from collapse during the financial crisis. Over time, panic eased and spreads in financial markets normalized. Once that happened, the private sector stopped borrowing from the Fed because it found the Fed’s penalty rates too onerous. As a result, the Fed shut down its special lending facilities in 2010.\n\nIt is plausible that the Fed’s loans through the various special facilities exposed it—and by extension, the American public—to some risk of loss. However, it is difficult to know how much risk was involved. We generally try to measure a financial asset’s risk by the spread between its yield and that of a safe benchmark like U.S. Treasuries. But as I’ve mentioned, in a financial panic a relatively large fraction of such a spread is attributable to illiquidity as opposed to intrinsic risk. The goal of the central bank’s intervention is exactly to eliminate this panic-driven illiquidity. Accordingly, we cannot gauge the Fed’s risk exposures without somehow correcting spreads for this illiquidity factor. Calculating this, however, is extremely difficult. What we can say with certainty is that the Fed has not lost a penny on any of these transactions: All such loans have been repaid in full.\n\nI should be careful to distinguish the lending that I’ve described from the institution-specific assistance the Federal Reserve provided to firms like AIG. These institution-specific interventions were deemed necessary by the Fed and the Bush administration because they believed that there were no adequate procedures in place for liquidating the assets of systemically important financial institutions in an orderly fashion. In 2010, the U.S. Congress passed an act that provides these procedures. Simultaneously—and correctly—the Congress removes the Fed’s ability to engage in institution-specific assistance. The act does leave in place the Fed’s ability to engage in broad-based market interventions of the kind that I’ve described, albeit with more congressional and White House oversight. This ability of the Fed could be useful in the event that financial market turmoil in other parts of the world ever threatens to spread to U.S. credit and capital markets.\n\nI’ve talked about how the fall in land prices generated a sharp increase in risk perceptions in financial markets and how that in turn led to a financial crisis. I now want to turn to what I see as the second key effect of the fall in land prices. This fall reduced the net worth of many households and firms. According to Fed calculations, household net worth fell by over 25 percent from the second quarter of 2007 to the first quarter of 2009. Households responded to this change in their balance sheets by forgoing consumption, which led in turn to a fall in output and employment,3 and put downward pressure on the price level.\n\nThe FOMC reacted by lowering its target interest rate from 5.25 percent in August 2007 to a range of 0 to 0.25 percent in December 2008; it now remains at this lower bound. Since inflation expectations remained stable, the FOMC’s action has had the effect of lowering the real interest rate facing households. Households, of course, typically respond to lower rates by saving less and demanding more consumption. Similarly, firms undertake more investment projects. In this way, the FOMC can and has partially offset the impact on the economy of the loss of net worth.\n\nIndeed, the FOMC would probably have liked to respond by cutting its target interest rate still further. The problem is that this target interest rate cannot go below zero. Instead, the FOMC has engaged in large-scale purchases of long-term assets issued or backed by the government. The goal of these transactions is to lower long-term real interest rates and again offset the impact on the economy of the net worth shock.\n\nSo, to sum up, the fall in land prices triggered an increase in risk perceptions and a decrease in household net worth. The increase in risk led to a major financial crisis, which the Federal Reserve addressed through a large amount of broad-based lending. The decrease in net worth led to a major recession and ongoing slow recovery. The Federal Reserve’s reduction in interest rates has lessened the impact of this change in net worth.\n\nHow has the Federal Reserve performed relative to its dual mandate over the past four years, since the onset of the Great Recession at the end of 2007? In terms of price stability, the answer is remarkably well. The personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation rate has averaged 1.8 percent per year from the fourth quarter of 2007 through the third quarter of 2011. In my view, this outcome is essentially consistent with price stability.\n\nNow, I want to be clear here about what I mean when I say “inflation.” That number I just gave you, 1.8 percent per year for nearly four years, refers to what’s termed headline inflation. It includes all goods and services, including food and energy. When the Fed says that it is committed to keeping inflation at 2 percent or a little less, it means prices for all goods and services, including the gas we put in our cars and the food we put on our tables. When we make reference to year-over-year core inflation—that is, inflation without food and energy—it’s only because we believe that core inflation is a helpful predictor of headline inflation over the next three or four years.\n\nIt is important, I think, to understand why there is no longer an intrinsic connection between the size of the Fed’s balance sheet and inflation. In the past three years, the Fed has bought over $2 trillion of securities issued or backed by the government. The Fed has funded that purchase by tripling the amount of deposits held by banks with the Fed—what are called bank reserves.\n\nThe standard reasoning is that this kind of reserve creation is inflationary. Banks are only allowed to offer checkable deposits in proportion to their reserves. Economists view checkable deposits as a form of money because, like cash, checkable deposits make many transactions easier. In this sense, bank reserves held with the Fed are essentially licenses for banks to create a certain amount of money. By giving out more licenses, the FOMC is allowing banks to create more money. And if you took any economics in school you learned: More money chasing the same number of goods—voilà, inflation.\n\nBut this connection between bank reserves and inflation is simply not operative right now. Banks have few good lending opportunities, and so they’re not trying to attract deposits. As a result, they are keeping nearly $1.6 trillion of reserves at the Fed in excess of what they need to back their deposits. In other words, banks have the licenses to create money, but are choosing not to do so.\n\nI’m confident, though, that at some point in the future, the economy will improve and banks will once again have good lending opportunities. Some observers are concerned that once this happens, the banks’ excess reserves will serve as kindling for an inflationary fire. This concern would have been entirely appropriate three years ago. But in October 2008, Congress granted the Federal Reserve the power to pay interest on bank reserves. Right now, that interest rate is 25 basis points, or 0.25 percent. By raising that rate judiciously, the Fed has the ability to deter banks from using their reserves to create money, and through this mechanism, the Fed can prevent inflation. The Fed’s ability to pay interest on reserves means that the old and familiar link between increased bank reserves and higher inflation has been broken.\n\nOf course, this requires the Fed to raise the interest rate on reserves in response to changes in economic conditions. You might well ask: Will the Fed raise interest rates in a sufficiently timely and effective manner to keep inflation at 2 percent or a little less? But that’s always been the key question to ask about Fed policy, even when the Fed had a much smaller balance sheet. And that’s my point: Because the Fed can pay interest on reserves, the size of its balance sheet does not, in and of itself, undercut the credibility of its commitment to keep inflation at 2 percent or a bit under. I believe that’s why both survey and market-based measures of expected inflation over the next five to 10 years have remained remarkably stable as the Fed has expanded its liabilities.\n\nIn terms of the Fed’s employment mandate: Unemployment remains disturbingly high at 9 percent. But—and this is important to keep in mind—it would likely be much higher without Federal Reserve interventions. Suppose the Fed had not followed its aggressive lending policies or its imaginative forms of monetary accommodation. What would have happened to the economy? While a definitive answer is impossible, the evidence from the Great Depression is suggestive. In the early years of the Great Depression, the United States was on the gold standard and the Fed could not easily adjust the quantity of bank reserves. As a result, the Fed did not engage in broad-based lending during the 1929-33 period. Nor did it cut interest rates aggressively. By 1933, hosts of financial institutions had failed, real GDP had fallen by over 25 percent, unemployment was 25 percent and the nation had experienced annual double-digit rates of deflation. The Fed’s passiveness in 1929-33 was associated with an economic catastrophe.\n\nLet me summarize my review of Federal Reserve performance since the beginning of the Great Recession in December 2007. My assessment is that, despite profound economic shocks, the Federal Reserve—led by Chairman Bernanke—has successfully met its price stability mandate through its lending programs and through innovative forms of monetary accommodation. These actions also helped keep the unemployment rate from rising even higher. As part of its accommodative policy, the FOMC has greatly expanded its balance sheet. But it is important to understand that this expansion need not trigger inflation now or in the future, because the Federal Reserve can now pay interest on bank reserves.\n\nI’ve spent most of this speech looking back. Let me close by offering some thoughts about future policy.\n\nI’ve underscored the Federal Reserve’s success in meeting its price stability mandate over the past four years. And the Fed’s actions have helped keep unemployment from rising higher. But the unemployment rate, currently 9 percent, remains disturbingly high—and FOMC meeting participants are projecting that it will fall to only about 8 percent over the next two years.\n\nThe FOMC does have tools remaining. It could put downward pressure on long-term market interest rates in at least two ways. First, it could buy more long-term Treasury securities or securities issued by government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Second, the Committee could extend its prediction for how long it will keep its target short-term interest rate exceptionally low. So, tools—and choices—remain.\n\nHowever, the FOMC should do more than simply decide at each meeting whether or not to buy more assets or to keep interest rates low for longer. Any current decision is based on the FOMC’s forecast of the future, and no forecast can be perfect. The Committee should provide a public contingency plan—that is, provide clear guidance on how it will respond to a variety of relevant scenarios. For example, the Committee recently projected that in 2011, core inflation will be 1.9 percent and that it will fall back in 2012 and 2013 to around 1.7 percent. Suppose hypothetically that core inflation, and the outlook for core inflation, has risen to 3 percent by the end of 2013, while unemployment has fallen to between 8 percent and 8.5 percent. A public contingency plan would allow the public to know what the Committee intends to do in that eventuality.\n\nI believe that public contingency planning will have many benefits. Let me mention two. First, in recent statements and speeches, I have described why the FOMC actions in August and September seemed inconsistent with the evolution of the macroeconomic data in 2011. This kind of inconsistency is much less likely to occur once the FOMC has formulated an explicit public contingency plan. Second, I’ve heard from businesses that policy uncertainty is curbing their incentive to hire or invest. Similarly, I’ve heard from consumers that policy uncertainty is curbing their incentive to spend. A public FOMC contingency plan can help reduce the level of policy uncertainty being created by the Fed.\n\nNo contingency plan can ever be definitive. Inevitably, the FOMC will learn things that it did not expect to learn. And so there may be conditions that force the FOMC to deviate from a chosen plan. However, having a public plan, and couching its decisions against the backdrop of that plan, will enhance Federal Reserve transparency, credibility, accountability and consistency.\n\nThank you for listening. I’d be happy to take your questions.",

        "content": "Note1\nThank you for that generous introduction, John. As Paul Drake described earlier, the board of directors of the Helena Branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is meeting here in Sidney to commemorate John Franklin’s last meeting as a member of that board. I would like to take this opportunity to publicly thank John for his generous service to the Federal Reserve, as well as other members of the board, past and present. It is important for people to realize that the Federal Reserve is represented by dedicated citizens like John and his colleagues on all of the System’s bank and branch boards. In addition, each Federal Reserve bank has a number of advisory councils representing Main Street businesses, agricultural producers, labor groups and community banks and thrifts, among other constituencies. As I will describe later, the input from these citizens plays an important role in the development of monetary policy. So thank you, once again, to John and the rest of the Helena board of directors, as well as others in the audience who have served us so well.\nI’d also like to offer congratulations, on behalf of myself and the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, to Thomas Sargent and Christopher Sims, winners of the 2011 Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. In the 1970s, in separate research, Sargent and Sims developed systematic approaches to distinguishing between cause and effect in macroeconomic data. Now, almost 40 years later, their thinking informs the making of macroeconomic policy around the world. I’m especially proud that much of the work recognized by the prize committee was done at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis and the University of Minnesota. My predecessors at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis deliberately fostered a research environment that could give rise to such important work, and this tradition continues today.\nIn the rest of my remarks today, I’d like to touch on several topics. I’ll begin with a quick description of the structure of the Federal Reserve System and the deliberative process of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed’s policymaking group. Then I’ll describe the FOMC’s objectives and discuss its recent performance with regard to those objectives. I’ll close with a discussion of my dissents on recent FOMC decisions. After that, I’ll be pleased to answer any questions you may have. And before I begin, I should remind you that my comments here today reflect my views alone and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System, including my FOMC colleagues.\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is one of 12 regional Reserve banks that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System. Our bank represents the ninth of the 12 Federal Reserve districts, and by area, we’re the second largest—thanks in no small part to the great state of Montana. Our district also includes the Dakotas, Minnesota, northwestern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.\nEight times per year, the FOMC meets to set the path of monetary policy over the next six to seven weeks. All 12 presidents of the various regional Federal Reserve banks—including me—and the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board, including Chairman Bernanke, contribute to these deliberations. (Currently, there are only five governors—two positions are unfilled.) However, the Committee itself consists only of the governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and a group of four other presidents that rotates annually. Right now, that last group consists of the presidents from the Minneapolis, Philadelphia, Dallas and Chicago Federal Reserve Banks.\nI’ve said that the FOMC meets (at least) eight times per year. But how do these meetings work? At a typical meeting, there are two so-called go-rounds, in which every president and every governor has the opportunity to speak without interruption. The first of these is referred to as the economics go-round. It is kicked off by a presentation on current economic conditions by Federal Reserve staff economists. Then, the presidents and governors describe their individual views on current economic conditions and their respective outlooks for future economic conditions. The presidents typically start by providing information about their district’s local economic performance. We get that information from our research staffs, but also from our interactions with business and community leaders in industries and towns from across our districts.\nThe chairman speaks at the end of the first go-round. He briefly but thoroughly summarizes the preceding 16 perspectives. I can assure you that this is no easy task—and the chairman’s balanced and thoughtful treatment of our remarks is one of the many reasons that he commands such respect among his colleagues. He then provides his own views on the economy.\nThe Committee next turns to the second go-round, which focuses on policy. Again, the staff begins, with a presentation of policy options. After that, each of the 17 meeting participants has a chance to speak on what each views as the appropriate policy choice. This set of remarks is followed with a summary by the chairman, in which he lays out what he sees as the Committee’s consensus view for future policy. The voting members of the FOMC then cast their votes on this policy statement and thereby set monetary policy for the next six to seven weeks.\nI think that this description of an FOMC meeting highlights how the structure of the FOMC mirrors the federalist structure of our government. Representatives from different regions of the country—the various presidents—have input into FOMC deliberations. And, as I’ve described, their input relies critically on information received from district residents. In this way, the Federal Reserve System is deliberately designed to give the residents of Main Street a voice in national monetary policy.\nI’ve said that FOMC participants seek to adopt what they view as the appropriate policy choice. That provides a natural segue into my next topic: the policy objectives of the FOMC. The FOMC has a dual mandate, established by Congress: to set monetary policy so as to promote price stability and maximum employment. In my view, the heart of implementing the price stability mandate is to formulate and communicate an objective for inflation. The central bank then fulfills its price stability mandate by making choices over time so as to keep inflation close to that objective.\nOf course, the central bank’s job is complicated by economic shocks that may lower or raise inflationary pressures. The central bank provides additional monetary accommodation—like lower interest rates—in response to the shocks that push down on medium-term inflation. It reduces accommodation in response to the shocks that push up on inflation. By doing so, it works to ensure that inflation stays close to its objective.\nIt is not enough to have an objective—the Federal Reserve must also communicate that objective clearly and credibly. That communication serves to anchor the public’s medium- and long-term inflationary expectations. Put another way, without clear communication of objectives, the public can only guess at the intentions of the FOMC, and inflationary expectations and inflation itself will inevitably end up fluctuating—and perhaps by a lot. It is possible to undo these shifts in expectations, but doing so entails significant economic cost. The nation saw this all too clearly in the early 1980s, when tighter monetary policy necessary to rein in high inflation resulted in painful employment losses.\nThe Federal Reserve communicates its objective for inflation in a number of ways. For example, at quarterly intervals, FOMC meeting participants publicly reveal their forecasts for inflation five years hence, assuming that monetary policy is optimal. Those forecasts usually range between 1.5 percent and 2 percent per year. They are often collectively referred to by saying that the Federal Reserve views inflation as being “mandate-consistent” if it is running at “2 percent or a bit under.”\nCongress has also mandated that the FOMC set monetary policy so as to promote maximum employment. Some see an intrinsic conflict between the FOMC’s price stability mandate and maximum employment mandate. But there is actually a deep sense in which the price stability and maximum employment mandates are intertwined. Imagine that inflation runs at 3 or 4 percent per year for three or four years. The public will then start to doubt the credibility of the Fed’s stated commitment to a 2-percent-or-a-bit-under objective. The public’s medium-term inflationary expectations will consequently begin to rise. As we saw in the latter part of the 1970s, these changes in expectations can serve to reinforce and augment the upward drift in inflation. At that point, the Federal Reserve will have to tighten policy considerably if it wishes to regain control of inflation. But we learned in the early 1980s that the resultant tightening—while necessary—generates large losses in employment. In other words, failing to meet its price stability mandate can also lead the FOMC, over the medium and long term, to substantial failure on its employment mandate.2\nOver the past year, the FOMC has communicated through its statements that it perceives the current unemployment rate to be elevated relative to levels that it views as consistent with its dual mandate. However, an important and ongoing communications challenge for the FOMC is that it is much harder to quantify the maximum employment mandate than the price stability mandate. Changes in minimum wage policy, demography, taxes and regulations, technological productivity, job market efficiency, unemployment insurance benefits, entrepreneurial credit access and social norms all influence what we might consider “maximum employment.” Trying to offset these changes in the economy with monetary policy can lead to a dangerous drift in inflationary expectations and ultimately in inflation itself.\nHow has the FOMC performed relative to its dual mandate over the past three and a half years, since the onset of the Great Recession at the end of 2007? In terms of price stability, the answer is: remarkably well. The personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation rate has averaged 1.8 percent per year from the fourth quarter of 2007 through the second quarter of 2011. In my view, this outcome is essentially consistent with price stability.\nNow, I want to be clear here about what I mean when I say “inflation.” That number I just gave you, 1.8 percent per year for more than three years, refers to what’s termed headline inflation. It includes all goods and services, including food and energy. When the Fed says that it is committed to keeping inflation at 2 percent or a little less, it means prices for all goods and services, including the gas we put in our cars and the food we put on our tables. When we make reference to year-over-year core inflation—that is, inflation without food and energy—it’s only because we believe that core inflation is a helpful predictor of headline inflation over the next three or four years.\nThe FOMC’s admirable performance on the price stability mandate is not due to luck. Since mid-2006, residential land prices in the United States have fallen by over 50 percent.3 Falling land prices were at the heart of the financial crisis from 2007 to 2009 and have generated a persistent fall in wealth and borrowing capacity for households. The associated declines in demand for consumption goods and investment goods pushed downward on prices and inflation.\nConfronted with this enormous shock to the economy, the Federal Reserve followed an unprecedentedly and imaginatively accommodative policy. It kept interest rates near zero. It provided “forward guidance” by explicitly expressing its expectation that interest rates would stay extraordinarily low for an extended period. It bought over $2 trillion of longer-term government securities. Through these actions, the Fed provided an extraordinary amount of monetary stimulus—and so was able to meet its price stability mandate in the face of challenging circumstances.\nUnemployment does remain disturbingly high—over 9 percent. However, I am sure that it would be even higher without the enormous amount of monetary stimulus being provided by the Fed. Moreover, I believe that the FOMC could only have systematically lowered the unemployment rate further by generating inflation rates over a multiyear period that were higher than its communicated objective of 2 percent. Such an outcome could potentially lead the public to lose faith in the credibility of the FOMC’s communicated objective and thereby increase the probability that the FOMC would lose control of inflation. As I discussed earlier, this scenario would require a policy response that would generate substantial losses of employment.\nI want to close my discussion of FOMC performance by explaining why there is no longer an intrinsic connection between the size of the Fed’s balance sheet and inflation. I’ve mentioned how the Federal Reserve has bought over $2 trillion of government securities. It has funded that purchase by tripling the amount of deposits held by banks with the Fed—what are called bank reserves. The standard reasoning is that this kind of reserve creation is inflationary. Banks are only allowed to offer checkable deposits in proportion to their reserves. Economists view checkable deposits as a form of money because, like cash, checkable deposits make many transactions easier. In this sense, bank reserves held with the Fed are essentially licenses for banks to create a certain amount of money. By giving out more licenses, the FOMC is allowing banks to create more money. And if you took any economics in school you learned: more money chasing the same number of goods—voilà, inflation. Indeed, I think I’m pretty safe in saying that after four years in economics grad school, I’ve uttered this phrase—more money chasing the same number of goods creates inflation—more often than anyone else in this room.\nBut this connection between bank reserves and inflation is simply not operative right now. Banks have few good lending opportunities, and so they’re not trying to attract deposits. As a result, they are keeping nearly $1.6 trillion of reserves at the Fed in excess of what they need to back their deposits. In other words, banks have the licenses to create money, but are choosing not to do so.\nI’m confident, though, that at some point in the future, the economy will improve and banks will once again have good lending opportunities. Some observers are concerned that once this happens, the banks’ excess reserves will serve as kindling for an inflationary fire. This concern would have been entirely appropriate three years ago. But in October 2008, Congress granted the Federal Reserve the power to pay interest on bank reserves. Right now, that interest rate is 25 basis points, or 0.25 percent. By raising that rate judiciously, the Fed has the ability to deter banks from using their reserves to create money, and through this mechanism, the Fed can prevent inflation. The Fed’s ability to pay interest on reserves means that the old and familiar link between increased bank reserves and higher inflation has been broken.\nOf course, this requires the Fed to raise the interest rate on reserves in response to changes in economic conditions. You might well ask: Will the Fed raise interest rates in a sufficiently timely and effective manner to keep inflation at 2 percent or a little less? But that’s always been the key question to ask about Fed policy, even when the Fed had a much smaller balance sheet. And that’s my point: Because the Fed can pay interest on reserves, the size of its balance sheet does not, in and of itself, undercut the credibility of its commitment to keep inflation at 2 percent or a bit under. I believe that’s why both survey and market-based measures of expected inflation over the next five to 10 years have remained remarkably stable as the Fed has expanded its liabilities.\nLet me summarize my review of FOMC performance since the beginning of the Great Recession in December 2007. My assessment is that, despite some profound economic shocks, the FOMC—led by Chairman Bernanke—has successfully met its price stability mandate by engaging in imaginative forms of monetary accommodation. These actions have also helped lower the unemployment rate. As part of its accommodative policy, the FOMC has greatly expanded its balance sheet. But it is important to understand that this expansion need not trigger inflation now or in the future, because the Federal Reserve can now pay interest on bank reserves.\nWith all that said, I’ve dissented from the FOMC’s decisions in the past two meetings. As I mentioned earlier, I believe that the FOMC’s ultimate effectiveness relies critically on its communication and the credibility of that communication. I’ve dissented at the last two meetings because I believe that the Committee’s decisions at those meetings diminish that requisite credibility. I’ll close my remarks today by explaining my thinking on this matter.\nThe FOMC’s dual mandate, as I’ve said, is to keep inflation at 2 percent or a bit under and to promote maximum employment—that is, to keep unemployment low. Over the past few years, the Fed has quite appropriately provided a historically unprecedented level of monetary accommodation. However, as inflation rises and unemployment falls, the FOMC should respond by lowering the level of accommodation. This kind of systematic response to changes in economic conditions is an essential part of good monetary policy for at least a couple of reasons. First, there is a great deal of empirical evidence and theoretical support for the idea that following a systematic policy rule, as economists call it, is what enables the Committee to achieve its dual mandate goals. Second, and perhaps more importantly, actions speak louder than words. The Committee can claim that it intends to make monetary policy so as to fulfill its dual mandate. But the public will watch its actions carefully in this regard. If the Committee fails to reduce its immense amount of accommodation in a timely fashion, the public will begin to doubt the Committee’s claims about its goals.\nIn November 2010, the FOMC undertook a second round of purchases of long-term government securities—an action that has become known as QE2. This was a controversial move in some quarters, but I supported it—and I believe that it played a valuable role in reducing what seemed at the time to be a large risk of deflation. Let’s look back at economic conditions at that November 2010 meeting. The unemployment rate was 9.8 percent and was expected to be 9 percent a year later. The year-over-year core PCE inflation rate was less than 1 percent and was expected to rise to 1.3 percent over the course of 2011.\nNow, fast-forward to October 2011. The unemployment rate is 9.1 percent and is expected to be near 8.5 percent by the end of 2012. The year-over-year core PCE inflation rate is 1.6 percent and is expected to stay near that level—or even higher—over the course of the coming year.4 So, since November 2010, the unemployment rate and the outlook for the unemployment rate have improved. Inflation and the outlook for inflation have both risen closer to 2 percent. As I’ve just discussed, in response to these changes in economic conditions, the Committee should have lowered the level of monetary accommodation over the course of the year. Instead, through actions taken at its last two meetings, the Committee has raised the level of monetary accommodation. In this sense, the Committee’s recent actions in 2011 are inconsistent with the evolution of the economic data in 2011.\nI want to be clear about one additional point. Along with many private sector forecasters, the FOMC has overestimated the strength of the recovery over the past two years. Some have suggested that the unexpected slowness of the recovery is a justification for the FOMC’s increasing the level of monetary accommodation over the past couple of months. But I disagree with this argument. I’ve described how, as the economy recovers, the FOMC should respond by reducing the level of monetary accommodation. Logically, it follows that if the economy recovers more slowly than expected, then the FOMC should respond by reducing the level of monetary accommodation more slowly than expected. The FOMC should only increase accommodation if the economy’s performance, relative to the dual mandate, actually worsens over time.\nTo sum up: The Committee’s actions at the last two meetings are inconsistent with a systematic pursuit of its communicated objectives. It follows that these actions diminish the Committee’s credibility and so reduce the effectiveness of future Committee actions and communications. And that’s why I’ve dissented from the Committee’s actions at those meetings.\nThank you very much for your attention, and I look forward to taking your questions.\nEndnotes\n1 I thank Doug Clement, David Fettig, Terry Fitzgerald and Kei-Mu Yi for very helpful comments\n2 The discussion in this paragraph is largely consistent with the following quote from Chairman Bernanke’s response to a reporter’s question in April about the Fed’s ability to lower the rate of unemployment more rapidly: “even purely from an employment perspective—that if inflation were to become unmoored, inflation expectations were to rise significantly, that the cost of that in terms of employment loss in the future, as we had to respond to that, would be quite significant.” (See transcript of Chairman Bernanke’s April 27, 2011, press conference, p. 14).\n3 See Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, LAND-PI (CSW) series.\n4 I’m using current core inflation as a way of measuring medium-term pressures on headline inflation. See May 25, 2011, speech for more details.\n\nNote1\n\nThank you for that generous introduction, John. As Paul Drake described earlier, the board of directors of the Helena Branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is meeting here in Sidney to commemorate John Franklin’s last meeting as a member of that board. I would like to take this opportunity to publicly thank John for his generous service to the Federal Reserve, as well as other members of the board, past and present. It is important for people to realize that the Federal Reserve is represented by dedicated citizens like John and his colleagues on all of the System’s bank and branch boards. In addition, each Federal Reserve bank has a number of advisory councils representing Main Street businesses, agricultural producers, labor groups and community banks and thrifts, among other constituencies. As I will describe later, the input from these citizens plays an important role in the development of monetary policy. So thank you, once again, to John and the rest of the Helena board of directors, as well as others in the audience who have served us so well.\n\nI’d also like to offer congratulations, on behalf of myself and the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, to Thomas Sargent and Christopher Sims, winners of the 2011 Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. In the 1970s, in separate research, Sargent and Sims developed systematic approaches to distinguishing between cause and effect in macroeconomic data. Now, almost 40 years later, their thinking informs the making of macroeconomic policy around the world. I’m especially proud that much of the work recognized by the prize committee was done at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis and the University of Minnesota. My predecessors at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis deliberately fostered a research environment that could give rise to such important work, and this tradition continues today.\n\nIn the rest of my remarks today, I’d like to touch on several topics. I’ll begin with a quick description of the structure of the Federal Reserve System and the deliberative process of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed’s policymaking group. Then I’ll describe the FOMC’s objectives and discuss its recent performance with regard to those objectives. I’ll close with a discussion of my dissents on recent FOMC decisions. After that, I’ll be pleased to answer any questions you may have. And before I begin, I should remind you that my comments here today reflect my views alone and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System, including my FOMC colleagues.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is one of 12 regional Reserve banks that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System. Our bank represents the ninth of the 12 Federal Reserve districts, and by area, we’re the second largest—thanks in no small part to the great state of Montana. Our district also includes the Dakotas, Minnesota, northwestern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.\n\nEight times per year, the FOMC meets to set the path of monetary policy over the next six to seven weeks. All 12 presidents of the various regional Federal Reserve banks—including me—and the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board, including Chairman Bernanke, contribute to these deliberations. (Currently, there are only five governors—two positions are unfilled.) However, the Committee itself consists only of the governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and a group of four other presidents that rotates annually. Right now, that last group consists of the presidents from the Minneapolis, Philadelphia, Dallas and Chicago Federal Reserve Banks.\n\nI’ve said that the FOMC meets (at least) eight times per year. But how do these meetings work? At a typical meeting, there are two so-called go-rounds, in which every president and every governor has the opportunity to speak without interruption. The first of these is referred to as the economics go-round. It is kicked off by a presentation on current economic conditions by Federal Reserve staff economists. Then, the presidents and governors describe their individual views on current economic conditions and their respective outlooks for future economic conditions. The presidents typically start by providing information about their district’s local economic performance. We get that information from our research staffs, but also from our interactions with business and community leaders in industries and towns from across our districts.\n\nThe chairman speaks at the end of the first go-round. He briefly but thoroughly summarizes the preceding 16 perspectives. I can assure you that this is no easy task—and the chairman’s balanced and thoughtful treatment of our remarks is one of the many reasons that he commands such respect among his colleagues. He then provides his own views on the economy.\n\nThe Committee next turns to the second go-round, which focuses on policy. Again, the staff begins, with a presentation of policy options. After that, each of the 17 meeting participants has a chance to speak on what each views as the appropriate policy choice. This set of remarks is followed with a summary by the chairman, in which he lays out what he sees as the Committee’s consensus view for future policy. The voting members of the FOMC then cast their votes on this policy statement and thereby set monetary policy for the next six to seven weeks.\n\nI think that this description of an FOMC meeting highlights how the structure of the FOMC mirrors the federalist structure of our government. Representatives from different regions of the country—the various presidents—have input into FOMC deliberations. And, as I’ve described, their input relies critically on information received from district residents. In this way, the Federal Reserve System is deliberately designed to give the residents of Main Street a voice in national monetary policy.\n\nI’ve said that FOMC participants seek to adopt what they view as the appropriate policy choice. That provides a natural segue into my next topic: the policy objectives of the FOMC. The FOMC has a dual mandate, established by Congress: to set monetary policy so as to promote price stability and maximum employment. In my view, the heart of implementing the price stability mandate is to formulate and communicate an objective for inflation. The central bank then fulfills its price stability mandate by making choices over time so as to keep inflation close to that objective.\n\nOf course, the central bank’s job is complicated by economic shocks that may lower or raise inflationary pressures. The central bank provides additional monetary accommodation—like lower interest rates—in response to the shocks that push down on medium-term inflation. It reduces accommodation in response to the shocks that push up on inflation. By doing so, it works to ensure that inflation stays close to its objective.\n\nIt is not enough to have an objective—the Federal Reserve must also communicate that objective clearly and credibly. That communication serves to anchor the public’s medium- and long-term inflationary expectations. Put another way, without clear communication of objectives, the public can only guess at the intentions of the FOMC, and inflationary expectations and inflation itself will inevitably end up fluctuating—and perhaps by a lot. It is possible to undo these shifts in expectations, but doing so entails significant economic cost. The nation saw this all too clearly in the early 1980s, when tighter monetary policy necessary to rein in high inflation resulted in painful employment losses.\n\nThe Federal Reserve communicates its objective for inflation in a number of ways. For example, at quarterly intervals, FOMC meeting participants publicly reveal their forecasts for inflation five years hence, assuming that monetary policy is optimal. Those forecasts usually range between 1.5 percent and 2 percent per year. They are often collectively referred to by saying that the Federal Reserve views inflation as being “mandate-consistent” if it is running at “2 percent or a bit under.”\n\nCongress has also mandated that the FOMC set monetary policy so as to promote maximum employment. Some see an intrinsic conflict between the FOMC’s price stability mandate and maximum employment mandate. But there is actually a deep sense in which the price stability and maximum employment mandates are intertwined. Imagine that inflation runs at 3 or 4 percent per year for three or four years. The public will then start to doubt the credibility of the Fed’s stated commitment to a 2-percent-or-a-bit-under objective. The public’s medium-term inflationary expectations will consequently begin to rise. As we saw in the latter part of the 1970s, these changes in expectations can serve to reinforce and augment the upward drift in inflation. At that point, the Federal Reserve will have to tighten policy considerably if it wishes to regain control of inflation. But we learned in the early 1980s that the resultant tightening—while necessary—generates large losses in employment. In other words, failing to meet its price stability mandate can also lead the FOMC, over the medium and long term, to substantial failure on its employment mandate.2\n\nOver the past year, the FOMC has communicated through its statements that it perceives the current unemployment rate to be elevated relative to levels that it views as consistent with its dual mandate. However, an important and ongoing communications challenge for the FOMC is that it is much harder to quantify the maximum employment mandate than the price stability mandate. Changes in minimum wage policy, demography, taxes and regulations, technological productivity, job market efficiency, unemployment insurance benefits, entrepreneurial credit access and social norms all influence what we might consider “maximum employment.” Trying to offset these changes in the economy with monetary policy can lead to a dangerous drift in inflationary expectations and ultimately in inflation itself.\n\nHow has the FOMC performed relative to its dual mandate over the past three and a half years, since the onset of the Great Recession at the end of 2007? In terms of price stability, the answer is: remarkably well. The personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation rate has averaged 1.8 percent per year from the fourth quarter of 2007 through the second quarter of 2011. In my view, this outcome is essentially consistent with price stability.\n\nNow, I want to be clear here about what I mean when I say “inflation.” That number I just gave you, 1.8 percent per year for more than three years, refers to what’s termed headline inflation. It includes all goods and services, including food and energy. When the Fed says that it is committed to keeping inflation at 2 percent or a little less, it means prices for all goods and services, including the gas we put in our cars and the food we put on our tables. When we make reference to year-over-year core inflation—that is, inflation without food and energy—it’s only because we believe that core inflation is a helpful predictor of headline inflation over the next three or four years.\n\nThe FOMC’s admirable performance on the price stability mandate is not due to luck. Since mid-2006, residential land prices in the United States have fallen by over 50 percent.3 Falling land prices were at the heart of the financial crisis from 2007 to 2009 and have generated a persistent fall in wealth and borrowing capacity for households. The associated declines in demand for consumption goods and investment goods pushed downward on prices and inflation.\n\nConfronted with this enormous shock to the economy, the Federal Reserve followed an unprecedentedly and imaginatively accommodative policy. It kept interest rates near zero. It provided “forward guidance” by explicitly expressing its expectation that interest rates would stay extraordinarily low for an extended period. It bought over $2 trillion of longer-term government securities. Through these actions, the Fed provided an extraordinary amount of monetary stimulus—and so was able to meet its price stability mandate in the face of challenging circumstances.\n\nUnemployment does remain disturbingly high—over 9 percent. However, I am sure that it would be even higher without the enormous amount of monetary stimulus being provided by the Fed. Moreover, I believe that the FOMC could only have systematically lowered the unemployment rate further by generating inflation rates over a multiyear period that were higher than its communicated objective of 2 percent. Such an outcome could potentially lead the public to lose faith in the credibility of the FOMC’s communicated objective and thereby increase the probability that the FOMC would lose control of inflation. As I discussed earlier, this scenario would require a policy response that would generate substantial losses of employment.\n\nI want to close my discussion of FOMC performance by explaining why there is no longer an intrinsic connection between the size of the Fed’s balance sheet and inflation. I’ve mentioned how the Federal Reserve has bought over $2 trillion of government securities. It has funded that purchase by tripling the amount of deposits held by banks with the Fed—what are called bank reserves. The standard reasoning is that this kind of reserve creation is inflationary. Banks are only allowed to offer checkable deposits in proportion to their reserves.

Banks have few good lending opportunities, and so they’re not trying to attract deposits. As a result, they are keeping nearly $1.6 trillion of reserves at the Fed in excess of what they need to back their deposits. In other words, banks have the licenses to create money, but are choosing not to do so.\n\nI’m confident, though, that at some point in the future, the economy will improve and banks will once again have good lending opportunities. Some observers are concerned that once this happens, the banks’ excess reserves will serve as kindling for an inflationary fire. This concern would have been entirely appropriate three years ago. But in October 2008, Congress granted the Federal Reserve the power to pay interest on bank reserves. Right now, that interest rate is 25 basis points, or 0.25 percent. By raising that rate judiciously, the Fed has the ability to deter banks from using their reserves to create money, and through this mechanism, the Fed can prevent inflation. The Fed’s ability to pay interest on reserves means that the old and familiar link between increased bank reserves and higher inflation has been broken.\n\nOf course, this requires the Fed to raise the interest rate on reserves in response to changes in economic conditions. You might well ask: Will the Fed raise interest rates in a sufficiently timely and effective manner to keep inflation at 2 percent or a little less? But that’s always been the key question to ask about Fed policy, even when the Fed had a much smaller balance sheet. And that’s my point: Because the Fed can pay interest on reserves, the size of its balance sheet does not, in and of itself, undercut the credibility of its commitment to keep inflation at 2 percent or a bit under. I believe that’s why both survey and market-based measures of expected inflation over the next five to 10 years have remained remarkably stable as the Fed has expanded its liabilities.\n\nLet me summarize my review of FOMC performance since the beginning of the Great Recession in December 2007.

Let’s look back at economic conditions at that November 2010 meeting. The unemployment rate was 9.8 percent and was expected to be 9 percent a year later. The year-over-year core PCE inflation rate was less than 1 percent and was expected to rise to 1.3 percent over the course of 2011.\n\nNow, fast-forward to October 2011. The unemployment rate is 9.1 percent and is expected to be near 8.5 percent by the end of 2012. The year-over-year core PCE inflation rate is 1.6 percent and is expected to stay near that level—or even higher—over the course of the coming year.4 So, since November 2010, the unemployment rate and the outlook for the unemployment rate have improved. Inflation and the outlook for inflation have both risen closer to 2 percent. As I’ve just discussed, in response to these changes in economic conditions, the Committee should have lowered the level of monetary accommodation over the course of the year.

Logically, it follows that if the economy recovers more slowly than expected, then the FOMC should respond by reducing the level of monetary accommodation more slowly than expected. The FOMC should only increase accommodation if the economy’s performance, relative to the dual mandate, actually worsens over time.\n\nTo sum up: The Committee’s actions at the last two meetings are inconsistent with a systematic pursuit of its communicated objectives. It follows that these actions diminish the Committee’s credibility and so reduce the effectiveness of future Committee actions and communications. And that’s why I’ve dissented from the Committee’s actions at those meetings.\n\nThank you very much for your attention, and I look forward to taking your questions.",

Since that date, there has been a growing appreciation of the role of fiscal policy in the determination of the price level. The idea is a simple one. Consider a government that borrows only using non-indexed debt denominated in its own currency. There is an intertemporal government budget constraint that implies that the current real value of government liabilities—including the monetary base—must equal the present value of future real surpluses. Because the liabilities are nominal and non-indexed, the government budget constraint provides a linkage between the public’s assessment of future real tax collections and government spending and the current price level.\nI like John Cochrane’s analogy here.2 He thinks of money and government bonds as being like stock in a company. Just like a firm’s stock, money and bonds implicitly represent claims to the ownership of the government’s stream of surpluses. And just like with financial assets, the variations in their prices are fundamentally linked to variations in the present discounted value of government profits—that is, surpluses.3\nThis simple insight has rather profound consequences for how we think about inflation. Inflation is no longer “always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.” Instead, even apparently independent central banks may not have control of the price level. Thus, if the public begins to think that the fiscal authority is behaving irresponsibly, that belief will push upward on the price level.\nHowever, in the existing literature, the analysis of fiscal effects on the price level is typically based on the presumption that a fiscal authority will never default on liabilities denominated in its own currency. In my remarks today, I will relax this assumption. Once I do so, it will become clear that a sufficiently tough central bank does have the ability to control the price level, regardless of the behavior of the fiscal authority.4 I will argue that its ability to do so hinges on the nature of its response to the possibility of default on the part of the fiscal authority. I will talk about some of the short-run versus long-run tensions involved in that response. Throughout, I will refer to the central bank as CB and the fiscal authority as FA. I will refer to the currency as being dollars, but that should not be viewed as suggesting that I am talking about the United States—or Australia.\nLet me start by describing a simple CB policy: a commodity price peg. Suppose the central bank holds X ounces of gold. It commits to being willing to buy and sell p dollars for each ounce of gold and has a monetary base of $pX. This policy successfully ties the price level to variations in the price of gold, regardless of the behavior of the FA.\nWhat impact does this policy have on the FA? Now, when the FA borrows in dollars, it is essentially borrowing in a real commodity: gold. All of the FA’s debt is essentially indexed to the price of gold, and it is certainly conceivable that various shocks could lead the FA to default on those obligations.5\nOf course, as I have argued elsewhere, this simple policy is generally viewed as suboptimal by macroeconomists.6In contrast, suppose that the CB follows an aggressive Taylor rule when determining the path of the short-term interest rate.7 That policy pins down an inflation path in the usual way, regardless of the FA’s fiscal plans.8 However, given that inflation path, the FA’s nominal debt is now actually real. This means that if the FA is faced with an unexpected decline in its current and expected future real surpluses, it will be forced to default.\nThus, once we allow for the possibility of default by the FA, a sufficiently tough CB can have considerable control over the price level. Of course, I’ve been arguing through examples. It would be more interesting to deliver a fuller characterization of the term “sufficiently tough”—but I’m not going to attempt to do so. Instead, in what follows, I’ll discuss some aspects of the CB’s response to a particularly critical situation.\nSuppose the FA owes $10 billion on a given Friday. It plans to repay that loan by auctioning new debt on the preceding Monday. However, when it auctions off the new debt, it finds that it can only raise $5 billion. The FA is now in danger of defaulting on its Friday obligation of $10 billion.\nIt is at this stage that the level of commitment of the CB to its chosen inflation path will be severely tested. The FA will ask the CB to take some action that will allow the FA to raise an additional $5 billion on Wednesday. There are many possible actions. The FA might ask the CB to intervene by setting a floor on the price of debt in the Wednesday auction. But there are less overt approaches. For example, the CB can commit to a price peg for the FA’s debt in the secondary market for that debt.\nIn any event, if the CB does intervene in some way to ensure the FA’s solvency, the CB no longer can be said to have independent control over the price level. If the CB’s intervention was largely unanticipated by markets, expected inflation will rise after the CB’s intervention. Then, incipient fiscal insolvency has triggered inflationary pressures. Of course, markets may well have already assigned a positive probability to the possibility that the CB might intervene in this kind of scenario. If so, then past inflation was already influenced by the markets’ expectations of this fiscal policy scenario.\nShould the CB be required to never intervene in this sort of insolvency scenario? I’ve argued that a ban on these interventions will give the CB more independence in its control over the price level. For those who think of CB independence as being the foundational element of macroeconomic policy, that pretty much settles the question.\nBut I see a couple of reasons for caution here. It is certainly conceivable that FA insolvency can be triggered by shocks that are well outside the control of the FA itself. And, empirically, FA insolvency is associated with large short-term and even medium-term declines in output. Should the CB be prepared to drive the FA into insolvency given the possible adverse economic impact on the country?\nMore subtly, regardless of the FA’s solvency, sovereign debt issues can fail simply through a coordination failure among investors. If I, as an investor, don’t anticipate that others will buy into the debt issue, I won’t either. In this sense, sovereign debt issues may be susceptible to suboptimal “runs.” The CB can eliminate this possibility by ensuring the nominal promises of the FA whenever the FA is threatened with default.\nThus, I see trade-offs. On the one hand, if the CB is known to be willing to intervene to keep the FA solvent, then inflation is necessarily shaped by fiscal considerations and by the short-run incentives of elected officials. We know from many years of theoretical and empirical research that this effect is not a desirable one. On the other hand, if the CB is fully committed to allow the FA to default if necessary, then even optimal debt management by the FA may end up exposing the country to troubling risks, like sovereign debt runs.\nLet me wrap up. I’ve argued that even if the fiscal authority borrows exclusively in its country’s own currency, the central bank can have a large amount of control over the price level. But the central bank can only achieve that control if it is willing to commit to letting the fiscal authority default. Such a commitment may expose the country to risks of short-term and medium-term output losses. How this trade-off should best be resolved awaits future research. But it may turn out to be optimal for central banks to guarantee fiscal authority debts in some situations. If so, we again have to think of price level determination as something that is done jointly by the fiscal authority and the central bank—just as Sargent and Wallace taught us 30 years ago.\nEndnotes\n1 These remarks are highly similar to those I gave on April 1, 2011, in Philadelphia. I thank Marco Bassetto, V. V. Chari, Ron Feldman, Futoshi Narita and Juan-Pablo Nicolini for their comments. The views I express here today are my own, and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 See Cochrane (2005).\n3 The present-discounted-value formula for stock price evaluation is based on the assumption that the stock price does not have a bubble component. In the same way, the intertemporal government budget constraint relies on the assumption that the price of neither money nor bonds has a bubble component. This assumption is violated in a wide class of models of money.\n4 See Bassetto (2008) for a related analysis.\n5 As modeled, for example, by Eaton and Gersovitz (1987).\n6 See Kocherlakota (2011).\n7 Here, I’m assuming that the CB is exchanging reserves and FA securities so as to control the path of a short-term nominally risk-free interest rate. This nominally risk-free interest rate may not be the same as the interest rate on FA debt.\n8 Atkeson, Chari and Kehoe (2010) and Cochrane (2011) argue (convincingly to my mind) that an aggressive Taylor rule is not sufficient to determine inflation. The former authors suggest how price level determination can be achieved using a hybrid rule that augments an activist Taylor rule with a commodity price peg. Note though that their implementations implicitly require the CB to have the ability to buy back money from the public. If the CB can only hold assets issued by the FA, then the FA’s actions will influence the value of the CB’s portfolio and thereby influence the CB’s ability to implement a given price level path. In this sense, the CB does not have independent control of the price level.\nReferences\nAtkeson, Andrew, V. V. Chari and Patrick J.

Since that date, there has been a growing appreciation of the role of fiscal policy in the determination of the price level. The idea is a simple one. Consider a government that borrows only using non-indexed debt denominated in its own currency. There is an intertemporal government budget constraint that implies that the current real value of government liabilities—including the monetary base—must equal the present value of future real surpluses. Because the liabilities are nominal and non-indexed, the government budget constraint provides a linkage between the public’s assessment of future real tax collections and government spending and the current price level.\n\nI like John Cochrane’s analogy here.2 He thinks of money and government bonds as being like stock in a company. Just like a firm’s stock, money and bonds implicitly represent claims to the ownership of the government’s stream of surpluses. And just like with financial assets, the variations in their prices are fundamentally linked to variations in the present discounted value of government profits—that is, surpluses.3\n\nThis simple insight has rather profound consequences for how we think about inflation. Inflation is no longer “always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.” Instead, even apparently independent central banks may not have control of the price level. Thus, if the public begins to think that the fiscal authority is behaving irresponsibly, that belief will push upward on the price level.\n\nHowever, in the existing literature, the analysis of fiscal effects on the price level is typically based on the presumption that a fiscal authority will never default on liabilities denominated in its own currency. In my remarks today, I will relax this assumption. Once I do so, it will become clear that a sufficiently tough central bank does have the ability to control the price level, regardless of the behavior of the fiscal authority.4 I will argue that its ability to do so hinges on the nature of its response to the possibility of default on the part of the fiscal authority. I will talk about some of the short-run versus long-run tensions involved in that response. Throughout, I will refer to the central bank as CB and the fiscal authority as FA. I will refer to the currency as being dollars, but that should not be viewed as suggesting that I am talking about the United States—or Australia.\n\nLet me start by describing a simple CB policy: a commodity price peg. Suppose the central bank holds X ounces of gold. It commits to being willing to buy and sell p dollars for each ounce of gold and has a monetary base of $pX. This policy successfully ties the price level to variations in the price of gold, regardless of the behavior of the FA.\n\nWhat impact does this policy have on the FA? Now, when the FA borrows in dollars, it is essentially borrowing in a real commodity: gold. All of the FA’s debt is essentially indexed to the price of gold, and it is certainly conceivable that various shocks could lead the FA to default on those obligations.5\n\nOf course, as I have argued elsewhere, this simple policy is generally viewed as suboptimal by macroeconomists.6In contrast, suppose that the CB follows an aggressive Taylor rule when determining the path of the short-term interest rate.7 That policy pins down an inflation path in the usual way, regardless of the FA’s fiscal plans.8 However, given that inflation path, the FA’s nominal debt is now actually real. This means that if the FA is faced with an unexpected decline in its current and expected future real surpluses, it will be forced to default.\n\nThus, once we allow for the possibility of default by the FA, a sufficiently tough CB can have considerable control over the price level. Of course, I’ve been arguing through examples. It would be more interesting to deliver a fuller characterization of the term “sufficiently tough”—but I’m not going to attempt to do so. Instead, in what follows, I’ll discuss some aspects of the CB’s response to a particularly critical situation.\n\nSuppose the FA owes $10 billion on a given Friday. It plans to repay that loan by auctioning new debt on the preceding Monday. However, when it auctions off the new debt, it finds that it can only raise $5 billion. The FA is now in danger of defaulting on its Friday obligation of $10 billion.\n\nIt is at this stage that the level of commitment of the CB to its chosen inflation path will be severely tested. The FA will ask the CB to take some action that will allow the FA to raise an additional $5 billion on Wednesday. There are many possible actions. The FA might ask the CB to intervene by setting a floor on the price of debt in the Wednesday auction. But there are less overt approaches. For example, the CB can commit to a price peg for the FA’s debt in the secondary market for that debt.\n\nIn any event, if the CB does intervene in some way to ensure the FA’s solvency, the CB no longer can be said to have independent control over the price level. If the CB’s intervention was largely unanticipated by markets, expected inflation will rise after the CB’s intervention. Then, incipient fiscal insolvency has triggered inflationary pressures. Of course, markets may well have already assigned a positive probability to the possibility that the CB might intervene in this kind of scenario. If so, then past inflation was already influenced by the markets’ expectations of this fiscal policy scenario.\n\nShould the CB be required to never intervene in this sort of insolvency scenario? I’ve argued that a ban on these interventions will give the CB more independence in its control over the price level. For those who think of CB independence as being the foundational element of macroeconomic policy, that pretty much settles the question.\n\nBut I see a couple of reasons for caution here.

And, empirically, FA insolvency is associated with large short-term and even medium-term declines in output. Should the CB be prepared to drive the FA into insolvency given the possible adverse economic impact on the country?\n\nMore subtly, regardless of the FA’s solvency, sovereign debt issues can fail simply through a coordination failure among investors.

        "content": "Good afternoon. Thank you for that kind introduction. It is an honor to be here with you at this important conference.\nPeople often ask me what surprised me during my three years in Washington. One of the pleasant surprises was the quality of the people I worked with at Treasury, the Federal Reserve Board and regional banks, as well as the other financial regulators. It was an extraordinary privilege for me to work with and learn from you, and to call you colleagues. I saw many outstanding people who are dedicated to public service work tirelessly and selflessly to try to stabilize the financial system during a time of national crisis. Those are examples of leadership and service that I will never forget. And now you have honored me again by inviting me to speak at your important conference. I am grateful for and humbled by your generosity. Thank you for this honor.\nFinancial regulators today are extremely busy implementing the many regulatory changes that Congress has specified in Dodd Frank, and trying to close the regulatory gaps exposed by the financial crisis. This conference is important to getting those regulations right—striking the right balance between safety and innovation—but it is also important to continue the analysis and research necessary to fully understand the causes of the most recent crisis so we can reduce the likelihood it is repeated.\nI’d like to share with you my perspectives on the fundamental causes of the crisis, what they mean for regulation going forward and the many questions we still don’t have answers for. I will also discuss some concepts that could be important to protecting against a future extraordinary crisis. Then I look forward to taking your questions.\nOne of the most important lessons I learned in my three years at Treasury is that almost every issue is far more complex than it appears in the public arena. If the answers were easy or obvious, they would already have been implemented. Policymakers are trying to balance a wide range of competing issues and constraints: economic, legal and political. It is almost impossible for thoughtful outside observers to grasp all the nuances and intricacies that policymakers at the Federal Reserve, Treasury or the White House are wrestling with. This now is true for me too, since I am no longer in government. I now tend to give policymakers the benefit of the doubt that you are likely wrestling with important details I am unaware of as you reach your conclusions.\nWhile that is generally true for policymaking, financial regulatory reform issues are especially complex and the risk of unintended consequences is high. It will take time for the markets to fully appreciate the effects of new regulations—likely for months or even years after they are put into effect.\nSetting aside politics, why is regulatory reform so inherently difficult?\nFirst, none of us can predict the future of the financial system any more than people could in the 1930s. As policymakers considered reforms during the Great Depression, no one could have predicted that MBSs, CDOs or SIVs would pose a danger to our financial system—because they didn’t even exist at the time. Consider that Fannie Mae was created during the Depression to help support mortgage finance. Its creators never imagined it would pose a systemic risk 80 years later. In fact, the only thing we know for certain about the next financial crisis is that it won’t look like the most recent crisis.\nWatching airport security procedures change in response to evolving terrorist threats reminds me of the challenges in designing regulations today in response to a recent crisis that we hope will be effective in preventing a future crisis. Has forcing people to take off their shoes as they pass through security caught any more shoe bombers? Has it made air travel safer?\nWe must also confront a second harsh reality that is rooted deep in human psychology: We’ve had periodic financial crises since the beginning of recorded financial history—virtually no country has been spared—and there will be financial crises for the rest of human history.\nPreventing all future crises would only be possible if we were to eliminate innovation in the financial system—which no one wants because it would deprive our citizens of better jobs and a higher standard of living.\nWhen we consider regulation, I believe it is important distinguish between what I will call a “normal” crisis, when an individual institution runs into trouble, which happens about once a decade, and an “extraordinary,” systemwide crisis when the entire system is at risk. I believe the recent crisis was an example of an extraordinary crisis—a one-in-100-year event. Let’s look at its root causes to understand why such exceptional crises are so difficult to prevent: Virtually the entire country believed that homeownership was the American dream and that nationwide, home prices would only go up. The latter assumption permeated the risk models of investors, banks, regulators and the ratings agencies. When that assumption proved false, the results were disastrous.\nBut could we even protect against such mistakes if we could identify them in advance? Imagine if then-Chairman Greenspan had stood up in 2005 and said, “We have a housing bubble. I am going to clamp down on mortgage lending.” How would the country have reacted? Potential first-time homeowners, banks, minority groups, investors and many members of Congress would have been outraged, claiming he was preventing deserving families from achieving the American dream and at the same time restraining our economic growth.\nHow likely is it that any regulator decades from now will be successful in first identifying and then pushing back against a cherished nationwide delusion?\nDespite these shortcomings, we should without question take actions to fix the problems that led to the most recent crisis and try to make sensible reforms that reduce damage from future crises. But we should also recognize that none of us are omniscient and that the changes made today are unlikely to work as expected decades from now.\nThe good news is that the final tool to resolving a future extraordinary crisis is the U.S. Congress. To Congress’ great credit, when policymakers asked for unprecedented TARP authority to prevent a financial collapse, they realized the danger and acted in just two weeks. That action was essential to preventing a collapse that would have brought far more job losses and foreclosures. It is likely the next time we face an extraordinary financial crisis, policymakers at the time will not have the necessary tools and Congress will again have to be part of the solution. Congressional involvement during a time of extreme crisis is appropriate.\nI believe many of the tools created by Dodd Frank can be effective in dealing with an ordinary crisis when an individual institution runs into trouble. Unfortunately, I fear that we still don’t know what to do about a future extraordinary crisis other than putting the balance sheet of the federal government behind the financial system.\nFor example, let’s consider the complexities surrounding resolution authority.\nOur society cherishes certain fundamental beliefs—such as our beliefs in free markets and fairness. If you take a risk, you should get the reward. But if you take a risk and you fail, you should bear the consequences. I certainly share these sentiments.\nIn that sense, resolution authority is very attractive. Regulators can fire the management of a failing firm, restructure its debt, forcing bond holders to take a haircut, and put the firm on sound financial footing—all without exposing taxpayers. Those are all noble objectives.\nI believe such procedures can work—in an ordinary crisis—when a single firm runs into trouble, but the system is otherwise stable. The question is, would it work during an extraordinary crisis when the entire system is at risk of failure?\nI ask myself if we had had resolution authority for investment banks and AIG during the fall of 2008—would we have actually used it?\nI doubt it. Here’s why. In an extraordinary crisis—such as the one we just faced—people don’t know which institutions are healthy and which are weak. If we had resolved, say Citigroup, forcing large losses on its bondholders, how would bondholders of, say, Bank of America reacted? They would likely have been terrified that they were next, and they would likely have sold their debt to protect themselves, and in doing so caused a liquidity run that could have destabilized the institution. Banks have this peculiar weakness that when creditors get nervous and take action to protect themselves, they increase the likelihood that the crisis they fear actually happens.\nThis contagion is the challenge that in my judgment makes extraordinary crises so difficult to deal with. European policymakers are struggling with the risk of contagion today. If Greece is allowed to default, as we at PIMCO believe is necessary, how will creditors of Ireland and Portugal respond? Will those countries be immediately cut off from the financial markets? Where will the contagion dominos stop falling?\nHence, I believe we do not yet know what to do to deal with another truly systemwide crisis, other than to put the balance sheet of the federal government behind the financial system—which is what we did successfully this time. My suggestion is that we continue to work hard closing the regulatory gaps exposed by the crisis, but we should also be humble and honest about what we don’t yet know. Much more research and reflection is needed to learn how to deal with extraordinary crises. Humility can help us to remain focused on these important issues and prevent us from gaining a false sense of security that we have solved all the problems.\nIn my view, our best hope to prevent a future systemic crisis is to institutionalize the lessons from this most recent crisis—lessons that the nation can suffer from a mass delusion and that markets, investors and policymakers can grossly misunderstand risk.\nHowever, developing such a long-term memory, one that spans decades and even generations, is extremely challenging. Much of our society is driven by periodic performance measurements: quarterly reports for public companies, or 2- or 4-year election cycles for politicians. What institutions do we have that can remain vigilant for the next 100 years and raise a warning flag when a future generation is about to repeat our mistake?\nUnfortunately, it is likely society itself will forget the lessons of the most recent crisis, which will then enable the conditions for a future crisis. For example, I find it remarkable that we experienced the unprecedented technology bubble in the late 1990s, and less than 10 years later didn’t identify the housing bubble until it was too late. The bursting of the technology bubble was painful—especially for those speculating on tech stocks. But the recession it triggered was relatively moderate and the lessons clearly short-lived.\nWe often hear that some countries, such as Germany, are vigilant about inflation because their people have suffered from hyperinflation many decades ago, and the pain of those prior generations is still carried by their citizens today. In that sense, the painful lessons of inflation have been institutionalized in German society itself. That institutionalization reduces the likelihood that the policy mistakes that led to hyperinflation will be repeated.\nWhile this most recent crisis inflicted significant pain on millions of Americans and, indeed, continues to, the pain was far less than it would have been had the financial system collapsed, which could have triggered another Great Depression. Stabilizing the financial system was absolutely the right thing to do, but I fear one result is that we’ve now reduced the likelihood that American society will retain these lessons, making it more likely that a future American generation will suffer from a mass delusion that leads to a future crisis.\nIf I am right that society itself won’t retain the lessons, how can we institutionalize them?\nOne would normally look to universities as institutions to retain and pass along knowledge, but I fear that our universities have become too responsive to their customers, their students, to play this role. Business schools today adjust their curriculum to meet student demands. In the late 1990s, they all taught entrepreneurship. After Enron, they all focused on corporate ethics. Now they are all teaching courses on the financial crisis. In 10 years, they will be on to the next hot topic.\nIf neither society itself nor our universities are likely to retain and pass along these lessons, could our political system? Unfortunately, in my judgment, our executive and legislative branches are too consumed by day-to-day political demands to take such a long-term view. It is hard to get politicians to focus past the next election, let alone look ahead decades.\nFor example, President Reagan created the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets (PWG) after the stock market crash of 1987, under the leadership of the Treasury Secretary, and comprising most federal financial regulators. But by the time Secretary Paulson joined Treasury in 2006, just 20 years later, the PWG had already fallen dormant. With Chairman Bernanke’s help, they reenergized the PWG, which became an important coordinating body during the crisis, and it has now been reconstituted as the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which will hopefully remain a vigilant watchdog for the next hundred years. Congress is to be applauded for codifying this coordinating body in legislation and directing it to watch out for emerging threats to financial stability. But politics in Washington can change priorities—especially when markets and the economy appear calm. Note that the biggest regulatory topic in Washington and on Wall Street just before the financial crisis erupted was “capital markets competitiveness”—a fear that our markets were losing out to international competition because they were smothered under too much regulation.\nWhile the FSOC has an important role to play, I believe our best hope for institutionalizing these important lessons lies within the financial regulators themselves, and indeed especially within the Federal Reserve System.\nYou have fought hard over many decades to establish and maintain your independence from day-to-day politics. Indeed, your monetary policy mandate requires you to look across decades and incorporate all that you have learned from past policy successes and failures. Given your large, highly trained staff of research and regulatory personnel, your independence from politics and your significant presence outside of Washington, I believe you have the best shot of maintaining your focus over decades. But it won’t be easy. It would take a focused effort from your senior leadership, who would need to declare this a cross-generational priority for the system.\nWhat are some of the ideas that could help institutionalize these important lessons within the Federal Reserve System? Here are just a few, but I’m sure you can come up with better ones:\nYou have a governing document called “The Purposes and Duties of the Federal Reserve System,” which categorizes your duties into four areas: monetary policy, banking supervision, financial stability and providing financial services such as the payments system. Perhaps these duties could be updated to specifically include retaining and passing forward the lessons of past crises?\nConferences such as this one could be another vehicle. The agenda of this year’s conference is focused on designing and implementing new regulations. Perhaps future conferences could specifically include a session on institutionalizing these lessons?\nDuring the crisis, a friend suggested I read John Kenneth Galbraith’s 1954 book The Great Crash. I didn’t have time to read it until after I left Washington. When I did read it, I couldn’t believe how prescient it seemed—how modern society had repeated many of the same mistakes that led to the Great Depression. I also couldn’t understand why this remarkable book hadn’t been required reading when I attended business school, or even when I joined the Treasury. Perhaps there are a few such timeless pieces that could be required reading for every new financial regulator or policymaker? The challenge is how to prevent that reading list from being updated 20 years from now when someone decides these lessons are just outdated relics of an era long since passed.\nThe goal that I am describing should be to create institutional processes so that 50 or 100 years from now, the next time the entire country deludes itself that we have found a low risk source of easy wealth, someone in authority can stand up and say, “Wait, we have seen this movie before. It doesn’t end well.”\nThis is an aspirational goal and I know it won’t be easy. And, indeed, as I indicated earlier, society may still not listen.\nThank you inviting me to join your important conference and for listening to my ideas. I hope you found them interesting. I am now happy to take your questions and have an active discussion with you.\n\nGood afternoon. Thank you for that kind introduction. It is an honor to be here with you at this important conference.\n\nPeople often ask me what surprised me during my three years in Washington. One of the pleasant surprises was the quality of the people I worked with at Treasury, the Federal Reserve Board and regional banks, as well as the other financial regulators. It was an extraordinary privilege for me to work with and learn from you, and to call you colleagues. I saw many outstanding people who are dedicated to public service work tirelessly and selflessly to try to stabilize the financial system during a time of national crisis. Those are examples of leadership and service that I will never forget. And now you have honored me again by inviting me to speak at your important conference. I am grateful for and humbled by your generosity. Thank you for this honor.\n\nFinancial regulators today are extremely busy implementing the many regulatory changes that Congress has specified in Dodd Frank, and trying to close the regulatory gaps exposed by the financial crisis. This conference is important to getting those regulations right—striking the right balance between safety and innovation—but it is also important to continue the analysis and research necessary to fully understand the causes of the most recent crisis so we can reduce the likelihood it is repeated.\n\nI’d like to share with you my perspectives on the fundamental causes of the crisis, what they mean for regulation going forward and the many questions we still don’t have answers for. I will also discuss some concepts that could be important to protecting against a future extraordinary crisis. Then I look forward to taking your questions.\n\nOne of the most important lessons I learned in my three years at Treasury is that almost every issue is far more complex than it appears in the public arena. If the answers were easy or obvious, they would already have been implemented. Policymakers are trying to balance a wide range of competing issues and constraints: economic, legal and political. It is almost impossible for thoughtful outside observers to grasp all the nuances and intricacies that policymakers at the Federal Reserve, Treasury or the White House are wrestling with. This now is true for me too, since I am no longer in government. I now tend to give policymakers the benefit of the doubt that you are likely wrestling with important details I am unaware of as you reach your conclusions.\n\nWhile that is generally true for policymaking, financial regulatory reform issues are especially complex and the risk of unintended consequences is high. It will take time for the markets to fully appreciate the effects of new regulations—likely for months or even years after they are put into effect.\n\nSetting aside politics, why is regulatory reform so inherently difficult?\n\nFirst, none of us can predict the future of the financial system any more than people could in the 1930s. As policymakers considered reforms during the Great Depression, no one could have predicted that MBSs, CDOs or SIVs would pose a danger to our financial system—because they didn’t even exist at the time. Consider that Fannie Mae was created during the Depression to help support mortgage finance. Its creators never imagined it would pose a systemic risk 80 years later. In fact, the only thing we know for certain about the next financial crisis is that it won’t look like the most recent crisis.\n\nWatching airport security procedures change in response to evolving terrorist threats reminds me of the challenges in designing regulations today in response to a recent crisis that we hope will be effective in preventing a future crisis. Has forcing people to take off their shoes as they pass through security caught any more shoe bombers? Has it made air travel safer?\n\nWe must also confront a second harsh reality that is rooted deep in human psychology: We’ve had periodic financial crises since the beginning of recorded financial history—virtually no country has been spared—and there will be financial crises for the rest of human history.\n\nPreventing all future crises would only be possible if we were to eliminate innovation in the financial system—which no one wants because it would deprive our citizens of better jobs and a higher standard of living.\n\nWhen we consider regulation, I believe it is important distinguish between what I will call a “normal” crisis, when an individual institution runs into trouble, which happens about once a decade, and an “extraordinary,” systemwide crisis when the entire system is at risk.

European policymakers are struggling with the risk of contagion today. If Greece is allowed to default, as we at PIMCO believe is necessary, how will creditors of Ireland and Portugal respond? Will those countries be immediately cut off from the financial markets? Where will the contagion dominos stop falling?\nHence, I believe we do not yet know what to do to deal with another truly systemwide crisis, other than to put the balance sheet of the federal government behind the financial system—which is what we did successfully this time. My suggestion is that we continue to work hard closing the regulatory gaps exposed by the crisis, but we should also be humble and honest about what we don’t yet know. Much more research and reflection is needed to learn how to deal with extraordinary crises. Humility can help us to remain focused on these important issues and prevent us from gaining a false sense of security that we have solved all the problems.\nIn my view, our best hope to prevent a future systemic crisis is to institutionalize the lessons from this most recent crisis—lessons that the nation can suffer from a mass delusion and that markets, investors and policymakers can grossly misunderstand risk.\nHowever, developing such a long-term memory, one that spans decades and even generations, is extremely challenging. Much of our society is driven by periodic performance measurements: quarterly reports for public companies, or 2- or 4-year election cycles for politicians. What institutions do we have that can remain vigilant for the next 100 years and raise a warning flag when a future generation is about to repeat our mistake?\nUnfortunately, it is likely society itself will forget the lessons of the most recent crisis, which will then enable the conditions for a future crisis. For example, I find it remarkable that we experienced the unprecedented technology bubble in the late 1990s, and less than 10 years later didn’t identify the housing bubble until it was too late. The bursting of the technology bubble was painful—especially for those speculating on tech stocks. But the recession it triggered was relatively moderate and the lessons clearly short-lived.\nWe often hear that some countries, such as Germany, are vigilant about inflation because their people have suffered from hyperinflation many decades ago, and the pain of those prior generations is still carried by their citizens today. In that sense, the painful lessons of inflation have been institutionalized in German society itself. That institutionalization reduces the likelihood that the policy mistakes that led to hyperinflation will be repeated.\nWhile this most recent crisis inflicted significant pain on millions of Americans and, indeed, continues to, the pain was far less than it would have been had the financial system collapsed, which could have triggered another Great Depression. Stabilizing the financial system was absolutely the right thing to do, but I fear one result is that we’ve now reduced the likelihood that American society will retain these lessons, making it more likely that a future American generation will suffer from a mass delusion that leads to a future crisis.\nIf I am right that society itself won’t retain the lessons, how can we institutionalize them?\nOne would normally look to universities as institutions to retain and pass along knowledge, but I fear that our universities have become too responsive to their customers, their students, to play this role. Business schools today adjust their curriculum to meet student demands. In the late 1990s, they all taught entrepreneurship. After Enron, they all focused on corporate ethics. Now they are all teaching courses on the financial crisis. In 10 years, they will be on to the next hot topic.\nIf neither society itself nor our universities are likely to retain and pass along these lessons, could our political system? Unfortunately, in my judgment, our executive and legislative branches are too consumed by day-to-day political demands to take such a long-term view. It is hard to get politicians to focus past the next election, let alone look ahead decades.\nFor example, President Reagan created the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets (PWG) after the stock market crash of 1987, under the leadership of the Treasury Secretary, and comprising most federal financial regulators. But by the time Secretary Paulson joined Treasury in 2006, just 20 years later, the PWG had already fallen dormant. With Chairman Bernanke’s help, they reenergized the PWG, which became an important coordinating body during the crisis, and it has now been reconstituted as the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which will hopefully remain a vigilant watchdog for the next hundred years. Congress is to be applauded for codifying this coordinating body in legislation and directing it to watch out for emerging threats to financial stability. But politics in Washington can change priorities—especially when markets and the economy appear calm. Note that the biggest regulatory topic in Washington and on Wall Street just before the financial crisis erupted was “capital markets competitiveness”—a fear that our markets were losing out to international competition because they were smothered under too much regulation.\nWhile the FSOC has an important role to play, I believe our best hope for institutionalizing these important lessons lies within the financial regulators themselves, and indeed especially within the Federal Reserve System.\nYou have fought hard over many decades to establish and maintain your independence from day-to-day politics. Indeed, your monetary policy mandate requires you to look across decades and incorporate all that you have learned from past policy successes and failures. Given your large, highly trained staff of research and regulatory personnel, your independence from politics and your significant presence outside of Washington, I believe you have the best shot of maintaining your focus over decades. But it won’t be easy. It would take a focused effort from your senior leadership, who would need to declare this a cross-generational priority for the system.\nWhat are some of the ideas that could help institutionalize these important lessons within the Federal Reserve System? Here are just a few, but I’m sure you can come up with better ones:\nYou have a governing document called “The Purposes and Duties of the Federal Reserve System,” which categorizes your duties into four areas: monetary policy, banking supervision, financial stability and providing financial services such as the payments system. Perhaps these duties could be updated to specifically include retaining and passing forward the lessons of past crises?\nConferences such as this one could be another vehicle. The agenda of this year’s conference is focused on designing and implementing new regulations. Perhaps future conferences could specifically include a session on institutionalizing these lessons?\nDuring the crisis, a friend suggested I read John Kenneth Galbraith’s 1954 book The Great Crash. I didn’t have time to read it until after I left Washington. When I did read it, I couldn’t believe how prescient it seemed—how modern society had repeated many of the same mistakes that led to the Great Depression. I also couldn’t understand why this remarkable book hadn’t been required reading when I attended business school, or even when I joined the Treasury. Perhaps there are a few such timeless pieces that could be required reading for every new financial regulator or policymaker? The challenge is how to prevent that reading list from being updated 20 years from now when someone decides these lessons are just outdated relics of an era long since passed.\nThe goal that I am describing should be to create institutional processes so that 50 or 100 years from now, the next time the entire country deludes itself that we have found a low risk source of easy wealth, someone in authority can stand up and say, “Wait, we have seen this movie before. It doesn’t end well.”\nThis is an aspirational goal and I know it won’t be easy. And, indeed, as I indicated earlier, society may still not listen.\nThank you inviting me to join your important conference and for listening to my ideas. I hope you found them interesting. I am now happy to take your questions and have an active discussion with you.\n\nGood afternoon. Thank you for that kind introduction. It is an honor to be here with you at this important conference.\n\nPeople often ask me what surprised me during my three years in Washington. One of the pleasant surprises was the quality of the people I worked with at Treasury, the Federal Reserve Board and regional banks, as well as the other financial regulators. It was an extraordinary privilege for me to work with and learn from you, and to call you colleagues. I saw many outstanding people who are dedicated to public service work tirelessly and selflessly to try to stabilize the financial system during a time of national crisis. Those are examples of leadership and service that I will never forget. And now you have honored me again by inviting me to speak at your important conference. I am grateful for and humbled by your generosity. Thank you for this honor.\n\nFinancial regulators today are extremely busy implementing the many regulatory changes that Congress has specified in Dodd Frank, and trying to close the regulatory gaps exposed by the financial crisis. This conference is important to getting those regulations right—striking the right balance between safety and innovation—but it is also important to continue the analysis and research necessary to fully understand the causes of the most recent crisis so we can reduce the likelihood it is repeated.\n\nI’d like to share with you my perspectives on the fundamental causes of the crisis, what they mean for regulation going forward and the many questions we still don’t have answers for. I will also discuss some concepts that could be important to protecting against a future extraordinary crisis. Then I look forward to taking your questions.\n\nOne of the most important lessons I learned in my three years at Treasury is that almost every issue is far more complex than it appears in the public arena. If the answers were easy or obvious, they would already have been implemented. Policymakers are trying to balance a wide range of competing issues and constraints: economic, legal and political. It is almost impossible for thoughtful outside observers to grasp all the nuances and intricacies that policymakers at the Federal Reserve, Treasury or the White House are wrestling with. This now is true for me too, since I am no longer in government. I now tend to give policymakers the benefit of the doubt that you are likely wrestling with important details I am unaware of as you reach your conclusions.\n\nWhile that is generally true for policymaking, financial regulatory reform issues are especially complex and the risk of unintended consequences is high. It will take time for the markets to fully appreciate the effects of new regulations—likely for months or even years after they are put into effect.\n\nSetting aside politics, why is regulatory reform so inherently difficult?\n\nFirst, none of us can predict the future of the financial system any more than people could in the 1930s. As policymakers considered reforms during the Great Depression, no one could have predicted that MBSs, CDOs or SIVs would pose a danger to our financial system—because they didn’t even exist at the time. Consider that Fannie Mae was created during the Depression to help support mortgage finance. Its creators never imagined it would pose a systemic risk 80 years later. In fact, the only thing we know for certain about the next financial crisis is that it won’t look like the most recent crisis.\n\nWatching airport security procedures change in response to evolving terrorist threats reminds me of the challenges in designing regulations today in response to a recent crisis that we hope will be effective in preventing a future crisis. Has forcing people to take off their shoes as they pass through security caught any more shoe bombers? Has it made air travel safer?\n\nWe must also confront a second harsh reality that is rooted deep in human psychology: We’ve had periodic financial crises since the beginning of recorded financial history—virtually no country has been spared—and there will be financial crises for the rest of human history.\n\nPreventing all future crises would only be possible if we were to eliminate innovation in the financial system—which no one wants because it would deprive our citizens of better jobs and a higher standard of living.\n\nWhen we consider regulation, I believe it is important distinguish between what I will call a “normal” crisis, when an individual institution runs into trouble, which happens about once a decade, and an “extraordinary,” systemwide crisis when the entire system is at risk. I believe the recent crisis was an example of an extraordinary crisis—a one-in-100-year event. Let’s look at its root causes to understand why such exceptional crises are so difficult to prevent: Virtually the entire country believed that homeownership was the American dream and that nationwide, home prices would only go up. The latter assumption permeated the risk models of investors, banks, regulators and the ratings agencies. When that assumption proved false, the results were disastrous.\n\nBut could we even protect against such mistakes if we could identify them in advance? Imagine if then-Chairman Greenspan had stood up in 2005 and said, “We have a housing bubble. I am going to clamp down on mortgage lending.” How would the country have reacted? Potential first-time homeowners, banks, minority groups, investors and many members of Congress would have been outraged, claiming he was preventing deserving families from achieving the American dream and at the same time restraining our economic growth.\n\nHow likely is it that any regulator decades from now will be successful in first identifying and then pushing back against a cherished nationwide delusion?\n\nDespite these shortcomings, we should without question take actions to fix the problems that led to the most recent crisis and try to make sensible reforms that reduce damage from future crises. But we should also recognize that none of us are omniscient and that the changes made today are unlikely to work as expected decades from now.\n\nThe good news is that the final tool to resolving a future extraordinary crisis is the U.S. Congress. To Congress’ great credit, when policymakers asked for unprecedented TARP authority to prevent a financial collapse, they realized the danger and acted in just two weeks. That action was essential to preventing a collapse that would have brought far more job losses and foreclosures. It is likely the next time we face an extraordinary financial crisis, policymakers at the time will not have the necessary tools and Congress will again have to be part of the solution. Congressional involvement during a time of extreme crisis is appropriate.\n\nI believe many of the tools created by Dodd Frank can be effective in dealing with an ordinary crisis when an individual institution runs into trouble. Unfortunately, I fear that we still don’t know what to do about a future extraordinary crisis other than putting the balance sheet of the federal government behind the financial system.\n\nFor example, let’s consider the complexities surrounding resolution authority.\n\nOur society cherishes certain fundamental beliefs—such as our beliefs in free markets and fairness. If you take a risk, you should get the reward. But if you take a risk and you fail, you should bear the consequences. I certainly share these sentiments.\n\nIn that sense, resolution authority is very attractive. Regulators can fire the management of a failing firm, restructure its debt, forcing bond holders to take a haircut, and put the firm on sound financial footing—all without exposing taxpayers. Those are all noble objectives.\n\nI believe such procedures can work—in an ordinary crisis—when a single firm runs into trouble, but the system is otherwise stable. The question is, would it work during an extraordinary crisis when the entire system is at risk of failure?\n\nI ask myself if we had had resolution authority for investment banks and AIG during the fall of 2008—would we have actually used it?\n\nI doubt it. Here’s why. In an extraordinary crisis—such as the one we just faced—people don’t know which institutions are healthy and which are weak. If we had resolved, say Citigroup, forcing large losses on its bondholders, how would bondholders of, say, Bank of America reacted? They would likely have been terrified that they were next, and they would likely have sold their debt to protect themselves, and in doing so caused a liquidity run that could have destabilized the institution. Banks have this peculiar weakness that when creditors get nervous and take action to protect themselves, they increase the likelihood that the crisis they fear actually happens.\n\nThis contagion is the challenge that in my judgment makes extraordinary crises so difficult to deal with. European policymakers are struggling with the risk of contagion today. If Greece is allowed to default, as we at PIMCO believe is necessary, how will creditors of Ireland and Portugal respond? Will those countries be immediately cut off from the financial markets? Where will the contagion dominos stop falling?\n\nHence, I believe we do not yet know what to do to deal with another truly systemwide crisis, other than to put the balance sheet of the federal government behind the financial system—which is what we did successfully this time. My suggestion is that we continue to work hard closing the regulatory gaps exposed by the crisis, but we should also be humble and honest about what we don’t yet know. Much more research and reflection is needed to learn how to deal with extraordinary crises. Humility can help us to remain focused on these important issues and prevent us from gaining a false sense of security that we have solved all the problems.\n\nIn my view, our best hope to prevent a future systemic crisis is to institutionalize the lessons from this most recent crisis—lessons that the nation can suffer from a mass delusion and that markets, investors and policymakers can grossly misunderstand risk.\n\nHowever, developing such a long-term memory, one that spans decades and even generations, is extremely challenging.

        "position": "President",
        "content": "Introduction\nGood morning. I am pleased to be here and have a chance to talk with you. My ability to engage in this kind of dialogue reflects the characteristically American design of the Federal Reserve System. Unlike most central banks, the Fed was designed to be a regional organization, so that residents of cities and rural areas from across the country can hear from central bank officials in person and directly add their voices to the monetary policy process. I and my senior management colleagues regularly hear from our boards of directors and advisory councils at both the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank and our Helena branch, and I really appreciate the opportunities I have to get out to Helena and other Ninth District cities and communities.\nOften, at events like this, I provide comments on the economic outlook or monetary policy and then interact with the audience, to get their insights into the issues facing households, businesses, and local governments. I find those opportunities incredibly valuable, both to communicate what the Fed is doing and to hear how our policies, and economic forces generally, are affecting people like you.\nToday, however, I want to forgo my usual monetary policy themes and talk about another way in which the Federal Reserve interacts with citizens at the local level to promote economic prosperity. I have in mind our Community Development program, which collaborates with partners across the Ninth District to enhance the foundations of an open and accessible market economy. More specifically, I want to talk about some important work our Community Development staff are engaged in, much of it here in Montana, to assist tribal leaders who are strengthening the institutions of business law that prevail on Indian reservations. First, however, I must note that the views I present are mine and not those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee.\nCommunity Development\nThe Fed’s Community Development function is not the most prominent of our policy tools, but it provides a useful complement to our better-known tools, such as monetary policy and banking supervision. For example, one of our staff in Helena, Sue Woodrow, helped found the Montana Financial Education Coalition as part of her Community Development work to ensure that low- and moderate-income Montanans would know how to access credit markets prudently and effectively. But that same effort provides a broader benefit to the Fed, because monetary policy is also more effective if consumers and business owners understand concepts like inflation and compound interest. For another example, Sue and her colleagues gathered intelligence last year on the factors that were impeding the flow of credit from banks to small businesses, one of the sectors targeted by our Community Development program. But the results of that exercise were also shared with management in Minneapolis and ultimately with Chairman Bernanke at a national forum in Washington.\nOur Community Development program has roots in the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, which requires federal regulators to assess that financial institutions are meeting, safely and soundly, the credit needs of their entire community or market, including credit needs in low- or moderate-income neighborhoods. Out of that basic regulatory responsibility, the Federal Reserve gave the Community Development program the mission of supporting the Fed’s economic growth objectives by working beyond our walls and independently from our bank examiners to promote fair and impartial access to credit and financial services.\nIn pursuing this mission, the Minneapolis Community Development team often works with external partners to shore up the foundations of a well-functioning market economy, including initiatives on financial education like the one I mentioned. This year, they also will work to strengthen organizations that provide training and credit to small businesses, to assist foreclosure and housing counselors, and to support organizations that foster rural development and post-foreclosure neighborhood recovery. In a very local but important way, these efforts supplement the Fed’s other policy tools for promoting economic growth.\nWork in Indian Country\nAs you might imagine, the range of issues our Community Development staff might try to address is vast. I should note, by the way, that we do not operate as a foundation and thus do not provide cash contributions or donations to any organization. Our community development work is primarily conducted through staff work on outreach, technical assistance, and analysis. To thoroughly cover the entire community development field would take significantly more staff than we have. So we have identified some high-priority areas where we think we can make a difference by focusing our efforts. One of our highest Community Development priorities is the one I want to focus on this morning—supporting tribes as they strengthen the legal foundations of their Indian Country economies. By the way, I am using the term Indian Country as a consistent term to describe the many self-governing Native American communities throughout the United States.\nA New Voyage of Discovery\nI find these efforts to strengthen legal foundations of Indian Country economies to be very interesting and full of potential, but thinking about them here also reminds me of their historical roots. A bit over 200 years ago, Lewis and Clark and their Corps of Discovery passed near here on a federally sponsored voyage that launched a powerful transformation of Montana and the American West. That transformation led to tremendous economic development, but, as we know, also relegated most of the region’s tribal societies to reservations. For decades thereafter, the tribes’ affairs were largely administered by federal officials who permitted them very little local autonomy. Partly as a result, economic development lagged on most reservations, leaving them as pockets of sharp rural poverty.\nFederal policy began to shift in the 1930s, with passage of the Indian Reorganization Act, which led to the drafting of numerous tribal government constitutions. But federal policy wavered for another 40 years, including a significant shift away from tribal recognition and sovereign rights in the 1950s. By the 1970s, however, civil rights activism and a shift toward market-oriented economic policies created a consensus in support of greater tribal self-government. A combination of executive orders and the Indian Self-Determination and Educational Assistance Act of 1975 finally put federal support for tribal sovereignty on firmer footing. Despite some unsettled issues, a new realm of meaningful tribal sovereignty within the United States was opened up.\nThis realm remains fairly new and is still incompletely mapped out. I am tempted to say that tribes are now on a new voyage of discovery in search of the most suitable institutions to govern their own affairs, including in the important area of business law and regulation. From an outsider’s perspective, at least, the impetus for this search is simple. In the United States, the bulk of our practical, everyday business law is state, not federal, law. But tribes are sovereign, to varying but significant degrees, with respect to state law. That is, state laws and state legal procedures and institutions often do not apply, or do not clearly apply, to business disputes on reservations. Unless appropriate tribal laws and institutions are in place, the result can be a vacuum, a real or perceived lack of business law and related institutions on reservations. Not surprisingly, this has a chilling effect on business and economic development.\nFortunately, since the 1930s and especially since the 1970s, a number of tribes have pioneered the development of laws and institutions that support growth while respecting tribal traditions. In the Southwest, for example, the Navajo have developed both an extensive body of written law and a strong system of courts to coherently administer a blend of written and Navajo traditional law. Later, I will also discuss work here in Montana. Nonetheless, the voyage has only begun, and much remains to be learned and done.\nOur Work\nThe Minneapolis Fed’s Community Development program is proud to assist in this journey. For many years, we have helped Ninth District tribes explore how to make good use of their renewed sovereign powers, with a special focus on helping tribes develop the legal and institutional foundations of a strong private business sector. This fits neatly into our general strategy of shoring up the foundations of a sound and inclusive market-oriented economy; in fact, I regard it as perhaps the best example of that strategy.\nSome of our work in this area goes back many years, but the thrust of our current efforts took shape early in the previous decade here in Montana. Through the initiative of Sue Woodrow, who is our Helena Branch Community Development staff person and an attorney with experience on Indian reservations, we began to take an active role in national efforts to draft model tribal business laws.\nWhat is a model law? It’s essentially a recommended starting point that a legislative body can use in drafting and passing real laws. For example, states often base their business laws on the model laws developed by a voluntary organization called the Uniform Law Commission.\nAbout 10 years ago, the commission took a new direction by undertaking to draft a model secured transactions law for tribal governments. Secured transactions laws are basic to modern business finance. These laws allow a business owner to pledge movable property, like a truck or machine the business owns, as collateral for a loan. State governments have provided for this bread-and-butter business activity by adopting versions of the commission’s Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) for states and, in particular, its Article 9 on secured transactions.\nAs I’ve noted, however, state law does not automatically extend to transactions on reservations. So unless tribes take similar steps to adopt secured transactions laws, creditors may hold back from making collateralized loans to reservation-based businesses. There are ways to try to work around this problem, and some tribes had adopted varying types of secured transactions laws to fill the gap. Overall, however, big gaps remained, and the existing tribal laws in this area were often incomplete, confusingly divergent, or out of date.\nThe Uniform Law Commission chose to address this problem head on. Under its leadership, a team of business law experts and tribal leaders gathered to devise a model secured transactions law that would both support collateralized lending on reservations and respect key aspects of tribal sovereignty. The team also understood that an effective model tribal act would need to be free-standing, unlike the UCC’s Article 9, which frequently refers to other UCC articles. We were very pleased to make Sue Woodrow available to serve on this team of experts.\nIn 2005, after four years of work, the group put forward a new model Tribal Secured Transactions Act, or model STA, for tribal governments to consider. Just as states decide whether to adopt the Uniform Law Commission’s model acts, tribes are free to make use of the model STA as they wish. However, to help tribes make an informed decision, our Community Development program prominently includes the provision of information about the model STA, which we pursue through our publications, a new Indian Country page on our website, and presentations and meetings all around Indian Country.\nSince 2005, a growing number of tribes have reached the conclusion that the model STA can help them. Again, the way was paved here in Montana. Crow tribal leaders were involved in advising the Uniform Law Commission on the model act and were also quick to undertake the process of adapting the model act to meet their specific needs. The tribe passed its customized version of the model STA in April 2006. Since then, other tribes in the Ninth District and beyond have adopted versions of the model STA, including the Oglala Sioux in South Dakota, the Mille Lacs and Leech Lake Ojibwe in Minnesota, the Ponca in Nebraska, and the Osage in Oklahoma, while others are actively considering it.\nCommunity Development’s support has not ended with adoption of the tribal STAs, and for good reason. The act is important, but achieving its full potential requires a system for filing liens, judges who are trained to understand and enforce it, and lenders who understand and trust it. To assist tribes in putting these elements in place, our Community Development staff have organized training materials and events on the STAs for tribal judges, lenders, attorneys, and other interested parties. They have also helped tribes negotiate with state governments to use existing state lien filing systems. We were thus very pleased when the compact that was negotiated here, for the Crow tribe to use the state of Montana’s lien filing system, was nationally recognized with a ceremonial signing at the Capitol in Washington, D.C., on February 6, 2008.\nRecently, our work in Indian Country has broadened in three new directions that complement our earlier work. First, to assist Indian business owners to articulate and overcome barriers to tribal economic development, the Minneapolis Community Development staff have helped organize Indian business alliances, or IBAs, in Montana, South Dakota, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. These statewide coalitions of tribes, financial institutions, nonprofit organizations, corporations, colleges and universities, and government agencies work to encourage and support Native small business owners and entrepreneurs. Although each alliance is unique, they all have committed to working on four building blocks of sustainable business development in Indian Country: governance, infrastructure, finance, and business training and support resources. The Montana IBA is quite active, and we expect to work with them to host a conference in Montana on tribal economic development issues and opportunities later this year. Similar events with our other IBAs are also in the works this year.\nSecond, we have again made Sue Woodrow available to the Uniform Law Commission, this time to assist in drafting a model tribal probate code. This project is in its early stages but further exemplifies our support for tribes’ efforts to modernize their legal institutions in support of economic development.\nFinally, I have challenged my Community Development staff to evaluate the impact of their efforts to assist tribes in the development of tribal business laws and institutions. Part of their response will be to compare key aspects of the business environment on a number of reservations, in order to assess which factors seem to be associated with better economic outcomes. This is a new and challenging research effort, but I hope we will be able to report some results by next year.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, I have noted that Indian tribes have embarked on a voyage of discovery of their renewed sovereign powers and capacity for local governance. Our Community Development program has strongly supported this journey for many years and will continue to do so. As you can see by visiting our website, our Indian Country work fits into a broader strategy that touches Montana and the rest of the Ninth District in many ways. Nonetheless, I regard our work with tribes who are modernizing the legal and institutional foundations of their reservation economies, much of it done right here in Montana, as the leading example of how our Community Development program rounds out the Federal Reserve’s approach to economic policy and economic development.\nThank you.\n\nGood morning. I am pleased to be here and have a chance to talk with you. My ability to engage in this kind of dialogue reflects the characteristically American design of the Federal Reserve System. Unlike most central banks, the Fed was designed to be a regional organization, so that residents of cities and rural areas from across the country can hear from central bank officials in person and directly add their voices to the monetary policy process. I and my senior management colleagues regularly hear from our boards of directors and advisory councils at both the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank and our Helena branch, and I really appreciate the opportunities I have to get out to Helena and other Ninth District cities and communities.\n\nOften, at events like this, I provide comments on the economic outlook or monetary policy and then interact with the audience, to get their insights into the issues facing households, businesses, and local governments. I find those opportunities incredibly valuable, both to communicate what the Fed is doing and to hear how our policies, and economic forces generally, are affecting people like you.\n\nToday, however, I want to forgo my usual monetary policy themes and talk about another way in which the Federal Reserve interacts with citizens at the local level to promote economic prosperity. I have in mind our Community Development program, which collaborates with partners across the Ninth District to enhance the foundations of an open and accessible market economy. More specifically, I want to talk about some important work our Community Development staff are engaged in, much of it here in Montana, to assist tribal leaders who are strengthening the institutions of business law that prevail on Indian reservations. First, however, I must note that the views I present are mine and not those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Fed’s Community Development function is not the most prominent of our policy tools, but it provides a useful complement to our better-known tools, such as monetary policy and banking supervision. For example, one of our staff in Helena, Sue Woodrow, helped found the Montana Financial Education Coalition as part of her Community Development work to ensure that low- and moderate-income Montanans would know how to access credit markets prudently and effectively. But that same effort provides a broader benefit to the Fed, because monetary policy is also more effective if consumers and business owners understand concepts like inflation and compound interest. For another example, Sue and her colleagues gathered intelligence last year on the factors that were impeding the flow of credit from banks to small businesses, one of the sectors targeted by our Community Development program. But the results of that exercise were also shared with management in Minneapolis and ultimately with Chairman Bernanke at a national forum in Washington.\n\nOur Community Development program has roots in the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, which requires federal regulators to assess that financial institutions are meeting, safely and soundly, the credit needs of their entire community or market, including credit needs in low- or moderate-income neighborhoods. Out of that basic regulatory responsibility, the Federal Reserve gave the Community Development program the mission of supporting the Fed’s economic growth objectives by working beyond our walls and independently from our bank examiners to promote fair and impartial access to credit and financial services.\n\nIn pursuing this mission, the Minneapolis Community Development team often works with external partners to shore up the foundations of a well-functioning market economy, including initiatives on financial education like the one I mentioned. This year, they also will work to strengthen organizations that provide training and credit to small businesses, to assist foreclosure and housing counselors, and to support organizations that foster rural development and post-foreclosure neighborhood recovery. In a very local but important way, these efforts supplement the Fed’s other policy tools for promoting economic growth.\n\nAs you might imagine, the range of issues our Community Development staff might try to address is vast. I should note, by the way, that we do not operate as a foundation and thus do not provide cash contributions or donations to any organization. Our community development work is primarily conducted through staff work on outreach, technical assistance, and analysis. To thoroughly cover the entire community development field would take significantly more staff than we have. So we have identified some high-priority areas where we think we can make a difference by focusing our efforts. One of our highest Community Development priorities is the one I want to focus on this morning—supporting tribes as they strengthen the legal foundations of their Indian Country economies. By the way, I am using the term Indian Country as a consistent term to describe the many self-governing Native American communities throughout the United States.\n\nI find these efforts to strengthen legal foundations of Indian Country economies to be very interesting and full of potential, but thinking about them here also reminds me of their historical roots. A bit over 200 years ago, Lewis and Clark and their Corps of Discovery passed near here on a federally sponsored voyage that launched a powerful transformation of Montana and the American West. That transformation led to tremendous economic development, but, as we know, also relegated most of the region’s tribal societies to reservations. For decades thereafter, the tribes’ affairs were largely administered by federal officials who permitted them very little local autonomy. Partly as a result, economic development lagged on most reservations, leaving them as pockets of sharp rural poverty.\n\nFederal policy began to shift in the 1930s, with passage of the Indian Reorganization Act, which led to the drafting of numerous tribal government constitutions. But federal policy wavered for another 40 years, including a significant shift away from tribal recognition and sovereign rights in the 1950s. By the 1970s, however, civil rights activism and a shift toward market-oriented economic policies created a consensus in support of greater tribal self-government. A combination of executive orders and the Indian Self-Determination and Educational Assistance Act of 1975 finally put federal support for tribal sovereignty on firmer footing. Despite some unsettled issues, a new realm of meaningful tribal sovereignty within the United States was opened up.\n\nThis realm remains fairly new and is still incompletely mapped out. I am tempted to say that tribes are now on a new voyage of discovery in search of the most suitable institutions to govern their own affairs, including in the important area of business law and regulation. From an outsider’s perspective, at least, the impetus for this search is simple. In the United States, the bulk of our practical, everyday business law is state, not federal, law. But tribes are sovereign, to varying but significant degrees, with respect to state law. That is, state laws and state legal procedures and institutions often do not apply, or do not clearly apply, to business disputes on reservations. Unless appropriate tribal laws and institutions are in place, the result can be a vacuum, a real or perceived lack of business law and related institutions on reservations. Not surprisingly, this has a chilling effect on business and economic development.\n\nFortunately, since the 1930s and especially since the 1970s, a number of tribes have pioneered the development of laws and institutions that support growth while respecting tribal traditions. In the Southwest, for example, the Navajo have developed both an extensive body of written law and a strong system of courts to coherently administer a blend of written and Navajo traditional law. Later, I will also discuss work here in Montana. Nonetheless, the voyage has only begun, and much remains to be learned and done.\n\nThe Minneapolis Fed’s Community Development program is proud to assist in this journey. For many years, we have helped Ninth District tribes explore how to make good use of their renewed sovereign powers, with a special focus on helping tribes develop the legal and institutional foundations of a strong private business sector. This fits neatly into our general strategy of shoring up the foundations of a sound and inclusive market-oriented economy; in fact, I regard it as perhaps the best example of that strategy.\n\nSome of our work in this area goes back many years, but the thrust of our current efforts took shape early in the previous decade here in Montana. Through the initiative of Sue Woodrow, who is our Helena Branch Community Development staff person and an attorney with experience on Indian reservations, we began to take an active role in national efforts to draft model tribal business laws.\n\nWhat is a model law? It’s essentially a recommended starting point that a legislative body can use in drafting and passing real laws. For example, states often base their business laws on the model laws developed by a voluntary organization called the Uniform Law Commission.\n\nAbout 10 years ago, the commission took a new direction by undertaking to draft a model secured transactions law for tribal governments. Secured transactions laws are basic to modern business finance. These laws allow a business owner to pledge movable property, like a truck or machine the business owns, as collateral for a loan. State governments have provided for this bread-and-butter business activity by adopting versions of the commission’s Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) for states and, in particular, its Article 9 on secured transactions.\n\nAs I’ve noted, however, state law does not automatically extend to transactions on reservations. So unless tribes take similar steps to adopt secured transactions laws, creditors may hold back from making collateralized loans to reservation-based businesses. There are ways to try to work around this problem, and some tribes had adopted varying types of secured transactions laws to fill the gap. Overall, however, big gaps remained, and the existing tribal laws in this area were often incomplete, confusingly divergent, or out of date.\n\nThe Uniform Law Commission chose to address this problem head on. Under its leadership, a team of business law experts and tribal leaders gathered to devise a model secured transactions law that would both support collateralized lending on reservations and respect key aspects of tribal sovereignty. The team also understood that an effective model tribal act would need to be free-standing, unlike the UCC’s Article 9, which frequently refers to other UCC articles. We were very pleased to make Sue Woodrow available to serve on this team of experts.\n\nIn 2005, after four years of work, the group put forward a new model Tribal Secured Transactions Act, or model STA, for tribal governments to consider. Just as states decide whether to adopt the Uniform Law Commission’s model acts, tribes are free to make use of the model STA as they wish. However, to help tribes make an informed decision, our Community Development program prominently includes the provision of information about the model STA, which we pursue through our publications, a new Indian Country page on our website, and presentations and meetings all around Indian Country.\n\nSince 2005, a growing number of tribes have reached the conclusion that the model STA can help them. Again, the way was paved here in Montana. Crow tribal leaders were involved in advising the Uniform Law Commission on the model act and were also quick to undertake the process of adapting the model act to meet their specific needs. The tribe passed its customized version of the model STA in April 2006. Since then, other tribes in the Ninth District and beyond have adopted versions of the model STA, including the Oglala Sioux in South Dakota, the Mille Lacs and Leech Lake Ojibwe in Minnesota, the Ponca in Nebraska, and the Osage in Oklahoma, while others are actively considering it.\n\nCommunity Development’s support has not ended with adoption of the tribal STAs, and for good reason. The act is important, but achieving its full potential requires a system for filing liens, judges who are trained to understand and enforce it, and lenders who understand and trust it. To assist tribes in putting these elements in place, our Community Development staff have organized training materials and events on the STAs for tribal judges, lenders, attorneys, and other interested parties. They have also helped tribes negotiate with state governments to use existing state lien filing systems. We were thus very pleased when the compact that was negotiated here, for the Crow tribe to use the state of Montana’s lien filing system, was nationally recognized with a ceremonial signing at the Capitol in Washington, D.C., on February 6, 2008.\n\nRecently, our work in Indian Country has broadened in three new directions that complement our earlier work.

The Montana IBA is quite active, and we expect to work with them to host a conference in Montana on tribal economic development issues and opportunities later this year. Similar events with our other IBAs are also in the works this year.\n\nSecond, we have again made Sue Woodrow available to the Uniform Law Commission, this time to assist in drafting a model tribal probate code.

A combination of executive orders and the Indian Self-Determination and Educational Assistance Act of 1975 finally put federal support for tribal sovereignty on firmer footing. Despite some unsettled issues, a new realm of meaningful tribal sovereignty within the United States was opened up.\n\nThis realm remains fairly new and is still incompletely mapped out. I am tempted to say that tribes are now on a new voyage of discovery in search of the most suitable institutions to govern their own affairs, including in the important area of business law and regulation. From an outsider’s perspective, at least, the impetus for this search is simple. In the United States, the bulk of our practical, everyday business law is state, not federal, law. But tribes are sovereign, to varying but significant degrees, with respect to state law. That is, state laws and state legal procedures and institutions often do not apply, or do not clearly apply, to business disputes on reservations. Unless appropriate tribal laws and institutions are in place, the result can be a vacuum, a real or perceived lack of business law and related institutions on reservations. Not surprisingly, this has a chilling effect on business and economic development.\n\nFortunately, since the 1930s and especially since the 1970s, a number of tribes have pioneered the development of laws and institutions that support growth while respecting tribal traditions. In the Southwest, for example, the Navajo have developed both an extensive body of written law and a strong system of courts to coherently administer a blend of written and Navajo traditional law. Later, I will also discuss work here in Montana. Nonetheless, the voyage has only begun, and much remains to be learned and done.\n\nThe Minneapolis Fed’s Community Development program is proud to assist in this journey. For many years, we have helped Ninth District tribes explore how to make good use of their renewed sovereign powers, with a special focus on helping tribes develop the legal and institutional foundations of a strong private business sector. This fits neatly into our general strategy of shoring up the foundations of a sound and inclusive market-oriented economy; in fact, I regard it as perhaps the best example of that strategy.\n\nSome of our work in this area goes back many years, but the thrust of our current efforts took shape early in the previous decade here in Montana. Through the initiative of Sue Woodrow, who is our Helena Branch Community Development staff person and an attorney with experience on Indian reservations, we began to take an active role in national efforts to draft model tribal business laws.\n\nWhat is a model law? It’s essentially a recommended starting point that a legislative body can use in drafting and passing real laws. For example, states often base their business laws on the model laws developed by a voluntary organization called the Uniform Law Commission.\n\nAbout 10 years ago, the commission took a new direction by undertaking to draft a model secured transactions law for tribal governments. Secured transactions laws are basic to modern business finance. These laws allow a business owner to pledge movable property, like a truck or machine the business owns, as collateral for a loan. State governments have provided for this bread-and-butter business activity by adopting versions of the commission’s Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) for states and, in particular, its Article 9 on secured transactions.\n\nAs I’ve noted, however, state law does not automatically extend to transactions on reservations. So unless tribes take similar steps to adopt secured transactions laws, creditors may hold back from making collateralized loans to reservation-based businesses. There are ways to try to work around this problem, and some tribes had adopted varying types of secured transactions laws to fill the gap. Overall, however, big gaps remained, and the existing tribal laws in this area were often incomplete, confusingly divergent, or out of date.\n\nThe Uniform Law Commission chose to address this problem head on. Under its leadership, a team of business law experts and tribal leaders gathered to devise a model secured transactions law that would both support collateralized lending on reservations and respect key aspects of tribal sovereignty. The team also understood that an effective model tribal act would need to be free-standing, unlike the UCC’s Article 9, which frequently refers to other UCC articles. We were very pleased to make Sue Woodrow available to serve on this team of experts.\n\nIn 2005, after four years of work, the group put forward a new model Tribal Secured Transactions Act, or model STA, for tribal governments to consider. Just as states decide whether to adopt the Uniform Law Commission’s model acts, tribes are free to make use of the model STA as they wish. However, to help tribes make an informed decision, our Community Development program prominently includes the provision of information about the model STA, which we pursue through our publications, a new Indian Country page on our website, and presentations and meetings all around Indian Country.\n\nSince 2005, a growing number of tribes have reached the conclusion that the model STA can help them. Again, the way was paved here in Montana. Crow tribal leaders were involved in advising the Uniform Law Commission on the model act and were also quick to undertake the process of adapting the model act to meet their specific needs. The tribe passed its customized version of the model STA in April 2006. Since then, other tribes in the Ninth District and beyond have adopted versions of the model STA, including the Oglala Sioux in South Dakota, the Mille Lacs and Leech Lake Ojibwe in Minnesota, the Ponca in Nebraska, and the Osage in Oklahoma, while others are actively considering it.\n\nCommunity Development’s support has not ended with adoption of the tribal STAs, and for good reason. The act is important, but achieving its full potential requires a system for filing liens, judges who are trained to understand and enforce it, and lenders who understand and trust it. To assist tribes in putting these elements in place, our Community Development staff have organized training materials and events on the STAs for tribal judges, lenders, attorneys, and other interested parties. They have also helped tribes negotiate with state governments to use existing state lien filing systems. We were thus very pleased when the compact that was negotiated here, for the Crow tribe to use the state of Montana’s lien filing system, was nationally recognized with a ceremonial signing at the Capitol in Washington, D.C., on February 6, 2008.\n\nRecently, our work in Indian Country has broadened in three new directions that complement our earlier work. First, to assist Indian business owners to articulate and overcome barriers to tribal economic development, the Minneapolis Community Development staff have helped organize Indian business alliances, or IBAs, in Montana, South Dakota, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. These statewide coalitions of tribes, financial institutions, nonprofit organizations, corporations, colleges and universities, and government agencies work to encourage and support Native small business owners and entrepreneurs. Although each alliance is unique, they all have committed to working on four building blocks of sustainable business development in Indian Country: governance, infrastructure, finance, and business training and support resources. The Montana IBA is quite active, and we expect to work with them to host a conference in Montana on tribal economic development issues and opportunities later this year. Similar events with our other IBAs are also in the works this year.\n\nSecond, we have again made Sue Woodrow available to the Uniform Law Commission, this time to assist in drafting a model tribal probate code. This project is in its early stages but further exemplifies our support for tribes’ efforts to modernize their legal institutions in support of economic development.\n\nFinally, I have challenged my Community Development staff to evaluate the impact of their efforts to assist tribes in the development of tribal business laws and institutions. Part of their response will be to compare key aspects of the business environment on a number of reservations, in order to assess which factors seem to be associated with better economic outcomes. This is a new and challenging research effort, but I hope we will be able to report some results by next year.\n\nIn conclusion, I have noted that Indian tribes have embarked on a voyage of discovery of their renewed sovereign powers and capacity for local governance. Our Community Development program has strongly supported this journey for many years and will continue to do so. As you can see by visiting our website, our Indian Country work fits into a broader strategy that touches Montana and the rest of the Ninth District in many ways. Nonetheless, I regard our work with tribes who are modernizing the legal and institutional foundations of their reservation economies, much of it done right here in Montana, as the leading example of how our Community Development program rounds out the Federal Reserve’s approach to economic policy and economic development.\n\nThank you.",

I am happy to have the opportunity to welcome you to the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis and speak with you today. I assumed the role of president at this Reserve Bank long after the launch of the Emerging Markets Homeownership Initiative, but I have heard about your goals, objectives, challenges, and successes from my community development staff. I understand the purpose of this “lunch ‘n’ learn” session today is to encourage dialogue and brainstorming on the next steps for this initiative in light of the recent economic and housing crisis. I thought I would provide some context for the changes in mortgage lending practices that have followed the housing crisis. As always, I am speaking for myself today, and not others in the Federal Reserve System, including the Federal Open Market Committee. I trust that my comments will prove beneficial in your endeavors.\nLet’s turn back the clock for a moment to the second half of 2006. At that time, firms and people around the world held a wide array of financial assets that were ultimately backed by U.S. residential land. (Think, for example, of mortgage-backed securities or any asset backed by mortgage-backed securities.) They viewed those assets as being largely free of risk. Investors may have understood that a fall in the value of U.S. land would impose large losses on them. However, they put low odds on such a decline taking place. Rather, they seemed to believe that U.S. land prices would continue to rise at a steady clip.\nBy the second half of 2007, that belief began to unravel in the face of incoming data. People were beginning to learn the hard way that U.S. land was a risky investment. Now the only question was how risky. The uncertainty about the answer to this question planted the seeds for a global financial panic.\nWhat do I mean by the term “financial panic”? Financial panics are events that blur the line between liquidity and solvency. A firm is solvent if its revenues (in a discounted present value sense) exceed its expenditures. A firm is liquid if it is able to raise enough funds—either by borrowing or by selling assets—to pay its current costs. In a well-functioning financial market, solvent firms are typically liquid, because they are able to borrow against their future profits. In contrast, in a financial panic, lenders feel unable to assess the future profits and/or collateral of borrowers. Borrowing becomes highly constrained, and even highly solvent firms may become illiquid.\nDuring the mid-2000s, many forms of collateral around the world were either implicitly or explicitly backed by U.S. residential land. As I’ve described, beginning in mid-2007, it started to become clear that this asset had more risk than financial markets had originally appreciated. It was not clear, though, how much more risk was involved. As a result, financial markets became increasingly uncertain about how to evaluate assets backed by U.S. land. That uncertainty translated into uncertainty about the ultimate solvency of institutions holding those assets—and the ultimate solvency of any of those institutions’ creditors.\nAs investors became more concerned about the quality of mortgage loans, the secondary market for private-label mortgage-backed securities nearly disappeared. As a result, about 90 percent of mortgages originated over the past two years were guaranteed by government-controlled entities such as Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, the Federal Housing Authority, or the Veterans Administration. Investors are willing to purchase mortgages and mortgage-backed securities from these agencies mainly because they have faith that the federal government stands behind those instruments.\nThis heavy reliance on government guarantees is not a sound long-term strategy. Over time, our country needs a mortgage market that returns to greater reliance on private risk-taking and private risk assessment, along with the enhanced regulatory oversight that is already in place. And, in fact, discussions are currently taking place on suitable options for bringing more private capital back into the mortgage market.\nEven more generally, I believe that as a country, we need to take this opportunity to rethink many aspects of our public policy programs in the context of housing finance. Home ownership has long been part of the American dream, in no little part because home owners have invested not just in their houses but in their communities. But, through the mortgage interest tax deduction and other programs, we are encouraging people to buy homes by taking on debt—and sometimes large amounts of debt. If we truly want to encourage home ownership, we should contemplate programs that provide incentives for individuals to save and become equity holders in their homes—and, by extension, in their communities.\nConclusion\nWe have come through a very difficult recession, caused in no little part by the large fall in residential housing prices that took place after 2006. I believe that the size of this shock meant that this recession was going to be a painful and challenging one, regardless of the policy response. Certainly, the Fed has played, and will continue to play, multiple roles in promoting sound, affordable, and accessible housing finance. In our most prominent role as makers of U.S. monetary policy, the Fed is committed to keeping inflation under control, which helps make traditional mortgages more affordable.\nThe Fed also has a key role in overseeing many of the recent financial reforms aimed at preventing the excessive risk-taking that contributed to soaring home prices, imprudent lending, and ultimately, the housing bust. Our safety and soundness and macro-prudential supervisors will be leaders in applying new regulatory approaches for banks and others.\nFinally, as part of our continuing responsibility for implementing the Community Reinvestment Act, our community development unit plans to work with you to develop understanding, institutions, and programs to promote equal access to credit and financial services. I look forward to hearing the results of your discussion groups today, including concrete suggestions for how the Federal Reserve can help via its policies, programs, and research.\nThank you very much.\n\nThank you, Jacqui, for that introduction.

        "content": "Note1\nSargent and Wallace published their classic “Some Unpleasant Monetarist Arithmetic” in the Minneapolis Fed’s Quarterly Review in 1981. Since that date, there has been a growing appreciation of the role of fiscal policy in the determination of the price level. The idea is a simple one. Consider a government that borrows only using non-indexed debt denominated in its own currency. There is an intertemporal government budget constraint that implies that the current real value of government liabilities — including the monetary base — must equal the present value of future real surpluses. Because the liabilities are nominal and non-indexed, the government budget constraint provides a linkage between the public’s assessment of future real tax collections and government spending and the current price level.\nI like John Cochrane’s analogy here.2 He thinks of money and government bonds as being like stock in a company. Just like a firm’s stock, money and bonds implicitly represent claims to the ownership of the government’s stream of surpluses. And just like with financial assets, the variations in their prices are fundamentally linked to variations in the present discounted value of government profits — that is, surpluses.3\nThis simple insight has rather profound consequences for how we think about inflation. Inflation is no longer “always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon”. Instead, even apparently independent central banks may not have control of the price level. Thus, if the public begins to think that the fiscal authority is behaving irresponsibly, that belief will push upward on the price level.\nHowever, in the existing literature, the analysis of fiscal effects on the price level is typically based on the presumption that a fiscal authority will never default on liabilities denominated in its own currency. In my remarks today, I will relax this assumption. Once I do so, it will become clear that a sufficiently tough central bank does have the ability to control the price level, regardless of the behavior of the fiscal authority. 4 I will argue that its ability to do so hinges on the nature of its response to the possibility of default on the part of the fiscal authority. I will talk about some of the short-run versus long-run tensions involved in that response. Throughout, I will refer to the central bank as CB and the fiscal authority as FA. I will refer to the currency as being dollars, but that should not be viewed as suggesting that I am talking about the United States — or Australia.\nLet me start by describing a simple CB policy: a commodity price peg. Suppose the central bank holds X ounces of gold. It commits to being willing to buy and sell p dollars for each ounce of gold, and has a monetary base of $pX. This policy successfully ties the price level to variations in the price of gold, regardless of the behavior of the FA.\nWhat impact does this policy have on the FA? Now, when the FA borrows in dollars, it is essentially borrowing in a real commodity: gold. All of the FA’s debt is essentially indexed to the price of gold, and it is certainly conceivable that various shocks could lead the FA to default on those obligations.5\nOf course, as I have argued elsewhere, this simple policy is generally viewed as suboptimal by macroeconomists. 6 In contrast, suppose that the CB follows an aggressive Taylor rule when determining the path of the short-term interest rate. 7 That policy pins down an inflation path in the usual way, regardless of the FA’s fiscal plans.8 However, given that inflation path, the FA’s nominal debt is now actually real. This means that if the FA is faced with an unexpected decline in its current and expected future real surpluses, it will be forced to default.9\nThus, once we allow for the possibility of default by the FA, a sufficiently tough CB can have considerable control over the price level. Of course, I’ve been arguing through examples. It would be more interesting to deliver a fuller characterization of the term “sufficiently tough” — but I’m not going to attempt to do so. Instead, in what follows, I’ll discuss some aspects of the CB’s response to a particularly critical situation.\nSuppose the FA owes $10 billion on a given Friday. It plans to repay that loan by auctioning new debt on the preceding Monday. However, when it auctions off the new debt, it finds that it can only raise $5 billion. The FA is now in danger of defaulting on its Friday obligation of $10 billion.\nIt is at this stage that the level of commitment of the CB to its chosen inflation path will be severely tested. The FA will ask the CB to take some action that will allow the FA to raise an additional $5 billion on Wednesday. There are many possible actions. The FA might ask the CB to intervene by setting a floor on the price of debt in the Wednesday auction. But there are less overt approaches. For example, the CB can commit to a price peg for the FA’s debt in the secondary market for that debt.\nIn any event, if the CB does intervene in some way to ensure the FA’s solvency, the CB no longer can be said to have independent control over the price level. If the CB’s intervention was largely unanticipated by markets, expected inflation will rise after the CB’s intervention. Then, incipient fiscal insolvency has triggered inflationary pressures. Of course, markets may well have already assigned a positive probability to the possibility that the CB might intervene in this kind of scenario. If so, then past inflation was already influenced by the markets’ expectations of this fiscal policy scenario.\nShould the CB be required to never intervene in this sort of insolvency scenario? I’ve argued that a ban on these interventions will give the CB more independence in its control over the price level. For those who think of CB independence as being the foundational element of macroeconomic policy, that pretty much settles the question.\nBut I see a couple of reasons for caution here. It is certainly conceivable that FA insolvency can be triggered by shocks that are well outside of the control of the FA itself. And, empirically, FA insolvency is associated with large short-term and even medium-term declines in output. Should the CB be prepared to drive the FA into insolvency given the possible adverse economic impact on the country?\nMore subtly, regardless of the FA’s solvency, sovereign debt issues can fail simply through a co-ordination failure among investors. If I, as an investor, don’t anticipate that others will buy into the debt issue, I won’t either. In this sense, sovereign debt issues may be susceptible to suboptimal “runs”. The CB can eliminate this possibility by ensuring the nominal promises of the FA whenever the FA is threatened with default.\nThus, I see trade-offs. On the one hand, the CB is known to be willing to intervene to keep the FA solvent, then inflation is necessarily shaped by fiscal considerations and by the short-run incentives of elected officials. We know from many years of theoretical and empirical research that this effect is not a desirable one. On the other hand, if the CB is fully committed to allow the FA to default if necessary, then even optimal debt management by the FA may end up exposing the country to troubling risks.\nLet me wrap up. I’ve argued that even if the fiscal authority borrows exclusively in its country’s own currency, the central bank can have a large amount of control over the price level. But the central bank can only achieve that control if it is willing to commit to letting the fiscal authority default. Such a commitment may expose the country to risks of short-term and medium-term output losses. How this trade-off should best be resolved awaits future research. But I suspect that it may be optimal for central banks to guarantee fiscal authority debts in some situations. If so, we again have to think of price level determination as something that is done jointly by the fiscal authority and the central bank — just as Sargent and Wallace taught us 30 years ago.\nEndnotes\n1 I thank Marco Bassetto, Ron Feldman, Futoshi Narita, and Juan-Pablo Nicolini for their comments. The views I express here today are my own, and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n2 See Cochrane (2005).\n3 The present-discounted-value formula for stock price evaluation is based on the assumption that the stock price does not have a bubble component. In the same way, the intertemporal government budget constraint relies on the assumption that the price of neither money nor bonds has a bubble component. This assumption is violated in a wide class of models of money (including any of the so-called deep models of money).\n4 See Bassetto (2008) for a related analysis.\n5 As modeled, for example, by Eaton and Gersovitz (1987).\n6 See Kocherlakota (2011).\n7 Here, I’m assuming that the CB is exchanging reserves and FA securities so as to control the path of a short-term nominally risk-free interest rate. This nominally risk-free interest rate may not be the same as the interest rate on FA debt.\n8 Note that Atkeson, Chari, and Kehoe (2010) and Cochrane (2011) both argue that an aggressive Taylor Rule is not sufficient to determine inflation. The former authors suggest how price level determination can be achieved using a hybrid rule which augments an activist Taylor rule with a commodity price peg.\n9 I’m abstracting from at least one subtlety here. In equilibrium, the real value of the outstanding monetary base must be smaller in every date and state than the present discounted value of the government’s surpluses. (In the commodity peg example, this inequality is ensured by the CB’s holding X units of gold.) In this sense, even abstracting from debt management issues, the CB’s rule can only implement its desired inflation path with sufficient support from the FA.\nReferences\nAtkeson, Andrew, Chari, Varadarajan V. and Patrick J.

Since that date, there has been a growing appreciation of the role of fiscal policy in the determination of the price level. The idea is a simple one. Consider a government that borrows only using non-indexed debt denominated in its own currency. There is an intertemporal government budget constraint that implies that the current real value of government liabilities — including the monetary base — must equal the present value of future real surpluses. Because the liabilities are nominal and non-indexed, the government budget constraint provides a linkage between the public’s assessment of future real tax collections and government spending and the current price level.\n\nI like John Cochrane’s analogy here.2 He thinks of money and government bonds as being like stock in a company. Just like a firm’s stock, money and bonds implicitly represent claims to the ownership of the government’s stream of surpluses. And just like with financial assets, the variations in their prices are fundamentally linked to variations in the present discounted value of government profits — that is, surpluses.3\n\nThis simple insight has rather profound consequences for how we think about inflation. Inflation is no longer “always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon”. Instead, even apparently independent central banks may not have control of the price level. Thus, if the public begins to think that the fiscal authority is behaving irresponsibly, that belief will push upward on the price level.\n\nHowever, in the existing literature, the analysis of fiscal effects on the price level is typically based on the presumption that a fiscal authority will never default on liabilities denominated in its own currency. In my remarks today, I will relax this assumption. Once I do so, it will become clear that a sufficiently tough central bank does have the ability to control the price level, regardless of the behavior of the fiscal authority. 4 I will argue that its ability to do so hinges on the nature of its response to the possibility of default on the part of the fiscal authority. I will talk about some of the short-run versus long-run tensions involved in that response. Throughout, I will refer to the central bank as CB and the fiscal authority as FA. I will refer to the currency as being dollars, but that should not be viewed as suggesting that I am talking about the United States — or Australia.\n\nLet me start by describing a simple CB policy: a commodity price peg.

We know from many years of theoretical and empirical research that this effect is not a desirable one. On the other hand, if the CB is fully committed to allow the FA to default if necessary, then even optimal debt management by the FA may end up exposing the country to troubling risks.\n\nLet me wrap up. I’ve argued that even if the fiscal authority borrows exclusively in its country’s own currency, the central bank can have a large amount of control over the price level. But the central bank can only achieve that control if it is willing to commit to letting the fiscal authority default. Such a commitment may expose the country to risks of short-term and medium-term output losses. How this trade-off should best be resolved awaits future research. But I suspect that it may be optimal for central banks to guarantee fiscal authority debts in some situations. If so, we again have to think of price level determination as something that is done jointly by the fiscal authority and the central bank — just as Sargent and Wallace taught us 30 years ago.\n\nAtkeson, Andrew, Chari, Varadarajan V. and Patrick J.
