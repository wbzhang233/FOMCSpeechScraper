            "content": "I thank Governor Ueda, the Bank of Japan, and its Institute for Monetary and Economic Studies for inviting me to participate on this panel. In the brief time allotted for my prepared remarks, I will discuss forward guidance. My basic point will be that the effectiveness of forward guidance as a policy tool in extraordinary times can be enhanced by improving monetary policy communications in normal times. Two phrases you often hear in real life are “use your words” and “connect the dots.” In my view, both should be applied to the FOMC’s monetary policy communications. Of course, the views I will present as a panelist will be my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nForward Guidance as a Policy Tool\n\nIn extraordinary times, in particular, when the policy rate has been lowered to its effective lower bound, theory suggests that explicit forward guidance about the future path of policy can be used as a policy tool and not just for the purpose of transparency and communications. It has the potential to increase the current degree of monetary policy accommodation by influencing the public’s expectations. By reducing uncertainty about the future path of policy, forward guidance can help lower interest rates by reducing the premiums investors demand to compensate them for interest-rate uncertainty. In addition, in theory, if the central bank indicates that the future path of short-term interest rates will be held lower and for longer than would be consistent with the central bank’s past behavior, this can put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, thereby adding accommodation. It has the potential to spur current economic activity because if people believe that the central bank is committed to keeping interest rates very low, they will expect higher economic activity and higher inflation in the future and that will induce them to make investments in capital and labor today. Note, though, that for forward guidance to have this effect, the public must believe that the central bank is committed to setting policy differently than it has in the past. If the public doesn’t understand this but, instead, believes that the central bank is behaving as usual, it could misinterpret a very low policy rate as suggesting a gloomier outlook, and this misinterpretation would work to depress current activity – the exact opposite of the intended effect.1\n\nThe Fed, along with other central banks, used forward guidance as a policy tool during the global financial crisis and during the pandemic.2 As the FOMC gained experience, the form of its forward guidance during the global financial crisis changed over time, from qualitative guidance giving a qualitative characterization of the length of time economic conditions would warrant keeping the policy rate exceptionally low, to calendar-date guidance, to state-contingent guidance giving thresholds for the unemployment rate and inflation that would need to be met before moving off of the effective lower bound on the policy rate.3 In the pandemic, the FOMC used state-contingent forward guidance, indicating that it expected to keep the funds rate target at 0 to 1/4 percent until the economy had reached maximum employment, and inflation had risen to 2 percent and was on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. It put this guidance in place in September 2020, after the August release of the results of the FOMC’s framework review and revised long-term strategy statement. And it kept this guidance in place until December 2021, when PCE inflation had been running over 3 percent since April 2021.\n\nChallenges to Using Forward Guidance as a Policy Tool\n\nReviews undertaken after the global financial crisis suggest that forward guidance was, in general, a useful monetary policy tool, partly as a communications device and partly because it helped to support other unconventional actions taken by central banks.4 But the reviews also suggest that forward guidance was challenging to design and estimates of the resultant reduction in long-term interest rates differ over studies. The changing nature of the forward guidance used during the global financial crisis and the formulation of forward guidance during the pandemic when inflation rose to unanticipated levels support the view that implementing the guidance is not an easy thing to do.\n\nTwo inherent difficulties come to mind. First, theory suggests that to be effective as a policy tool, forward guidance involves committing the policymaker to a future policy path that differs from one implied by the policymaker’s usual policy reaction function. In other words, it commits the policymaker to using a different reaction function. But policymakers are loath to make those types of commitments – time-inconsistency problems loom large.5 Contingencies can be included in the guidance, but that tends to limit the commitment, thereby watering down the potential effectiveness. Also, it is not clear that market participants pay enough attention to the conditional nature of the guidance. If they do not, then a change in policy, even if implicit in the guidance, could lower the central bank’s credibility. Given the time-inconsistency problems, it is challenging for central banks to credibly commit to a policy path that differs from normal policy without a temporary change in the framework, e.g., price-level targeting. This suggests that explicit forward guidance about the rate path should be used judiciously and only in extraordinary times.\n\nA second difficulty is that the effectiveness of forward guidance in extraordinary times depends on the public understanding that the policy path in the forward guidance is a deviation from normal behavior, which means the public needs to understand the policymakers’ normal reaction function, which conveys how policy normally reacts to changes in economic conditions, whether those changes were anticipated or not. It has been challenging to convey how policy is likely to respond conditional on how the economy evolves without implying that policy is pre-committed to a particular policy path regardless of how the economy actually evolves.\n\nEnhancements to Monetary Policy Communications in Normal Times\n\nThe Fed has been enhancing its communications over time. Still, there are times when market participants’ policy expectations differ from the FOMC’s, which raises the question about the effectiveness of our communications in terms of their transparency and/or credibility. Market participants’ expectations of the path of policy can differ from policymakers’ expected path because market participants have a different economic outlook despite seeing the same data or because they don’t understand policymakers’ reaction function or don’t view it as credible. Similarly, research suggests that the public also doesn’t necessarily understand or pay attention to central bank communications, thus limiting the effectiveness of those communications.6 But recent research using randomized trials suggests that the general public’s belief that the central bank will maintain price stability can be enhanced with effective policy communication.7 To the extent that enhancements to policy communications strengthen the public’s understanding of the Fed’s reaction function in normal times, it would make explicit forward guidance more effective when it is used in extraordinary times. I will make two recommendations for FOMC communications: use your words and connect the dots.\n\n(1) Use your words: The FOMC policy statements have become shorter over time, giving less information about the FOMC’s medium-run outlook and risks around that outlook, which form the basis of our policy decisions. While simpler is often seen as a virtue, it can also be a detriment, since policymaking has to be done in an uncertain world, one in which the economy is constantly being buffeted by shocks that can lead economic conditions to evolve differently than anticipated.8 With short statements, each word takes on added significance. Short statements suffer from what I call a “Hotel California” problem: we are reluctant to change particular words because of the possible signal that doing so may send. Words “check in” but it is hard to get them to “check out” even when it is desirable. One could argue that the use of “transitory” to describe inflation stayed in the FOMC statement far too long, given economic conditions.9 Short statements also make it harder for the public to see the linkage between economic developments and policy action or inaction. When members of the public don’t understand the rationale for policy decisions, it can leave them with the impression that policymakers are acting in a discretionary manner and that lessens credibility.\n\nIn my view, it would be preferable for policymakers to take control of the narrative by using more words to describe the current assessment of economic developments, how they have influenced the outlook, and the risks to that outlook. Putting somewhat less weight on the modal outlook and more on potential risks to the outlook would help the public understand that if certain risks are realized, policy may have to deviate from the previously communicated modal path. It would give market participants and the general public a better sense of the contingent, data-dependent nature of policymaking and would raise the central bank’s credibility in that a change in policy would be seen less as a breach of promise. Scenario analysis should also be incorporated as a standard part of communications.10 This could be particularly useful in periods like today when the underlying structural elements of the economy may have changed.\n\n(2) Connect the dots: My second suggestion is for the FOMC to connect the participants’ policy path dots and their economic projections in the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP).11 In other words, the FOMC should publish the anonymized matrix of economic and policy projections so that market participants can see the linkage between each participant’s outlook and his or her view of appropriate monetary policy associated with that outlook. Currently, the variables in the SEP are not linked across participants, and the median paths provided don’t necessarily represent a coherent forecast. For example, there is no guarantee that someone projecting the median inflation path would necessarily be projecting the median output path. There is no way for the public to know whether a person low in the range of unemployment rate forecasts is high in the range of inflation projections. And two participants could project the same federal funds rate paths, but those paths could be associated with very different economic forecasts. If we were to connect the dots to the forecasts within the SEP, the public would get a better sense of each individual policymaker’s reaction function.\n\nOf course, broader enhancements to communications should be considered, including reconsidering the formulation of a consensus forecast of the FOMC, providing more information on how the FOMC considers financial stability issues when setting monetary policy, the interplay between balance-sheet policy and interest-rate policy, and the use of simple monetary policy rules as benchmarks for explaining policy decisions.12 Enhancements to communications would make monetary policy more effective in normal times and also improve the effectiveness of nonconventional policy tools, such as forward guidance, in extraordinary times. I expect that the FOMC will consider communications as part of its next monetary policy framework review, given the central role communications play in the implementation of monetary policy."

            "content": "I thank the Wayne Economic Development Council for inviting me to speak on the economy and monetary policy in the council’s Briefings for Business series. The council’s work to foster economic development in the region aligns with the Federal Reserve’s mission to foster a strong economy.\n\nEddie Steiner is an active member of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s Board of Directors, and chairs the Board’s Audit Committee, and Steve Matthew, who will be moderating the question-and-answer portion of today’s session, is an active member of our Northeast Ohio Business Advisory Council. I will take this opportunity to thank them for their public service, which helps our Bank fulfill its mission. I also thank the many others in this room who regularly provide us with insights into economic conditions. These insights help to inform the Cleveland Fed’s section of the Beige Book, the summary of regional economic developments published by the Federal Reserve prior to each FOMC meeting. The reconnaissance that you provide on business activity, the labor market, community conditions, and financial conditions is often more timely than the official data, and it helps us evaluate not only where the economy is but where it is going. You play a role in monetary policymaking because the information you provide informs my views of the economy and monetary policy, and it helps the FOMC make more informed monetary policy decisions in pursuit of its statutory goals of price stability and maximum employment.\n\nI am especially looking forward to the question-and-answer portion of our session because I learn a lot from hearing what is on your mind. But before we get into today’s dialogue, I thought it would be helpful to frame the discussion by offering some remarks about the economy and monetary policy. Of course, the views I present today will be my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nEconomic Developments\n\nAt our FOMC meeting about two weeks ago, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent and to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings. We have held our policy rate at this restrictive level since July of last year.\n\nThe FOMC reiterated that it does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until the Committee has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward our goal of 2 percent. Substantial progress has been made on the inflation front since inflation peaked in 2022, in the range of 7 to 9 percent, depending on the measure. In the second half of last year, inflation readings came in lower than expected, and PCE inflation was running at about our 2 percent goal over those six months. But the year-over-year measures of inflation remained elevated, and we knew it was too soon to declare victory over inflation. Over the first three months of this year, we have seen no further progress on PCE inflation. In fact, measured year-over-year, headline PCE inflation moved up to 2.7 percent in March and core PCE inflation remained at 2.8 percent. The three-month changes are running considerably above the levels seen over the second half of last year. Over the past three months, PCE inflation in core goods and PCE inflation in core services excluding housing have moved up, and housing services inflation has moved sideways. Yesterday’s CPI inflation report is the first inflation reading for April. We saw a welcome tick down in the monthly readings for total and core CPI inflation, though those readings were higher than those we saw in the second half of last year.\n\nI had expected the progress on inflation to slow this year compared to last year, because I didn’t think we would get as much help from supply-side adjustments. Supply chain disruptions and bottlenecks have improved over the past three years and the labor market has been normalizing. People have returned to the labor force over time, and immigration has also increased the supply of labor. The healing of the supply side of the economy contributed to last year’s disinflation, and we are not likely to get as much help on inflation from the supply side as we saw last year. Progress will depend more on moderating demand.\n\nStill, the lack of progress on inflation so far this year has been disappointing. I think it is too early to conclude that progress on inflation has stalled out or that inflation is poised to reverse course: the journey back to price stability was never expected to follow a smooth path. But the recent readings have not inspired greater confidence in me, and we will need to accumulate further data over the coming months to have a clearer picture of the inflation outlook. I now believe that it will take longer to reach our 2 percent goal than I previously thought. But the Fed remains strongly committed to returning the economy to price stability.\n\nThe good news is that the economy is well positioned to allow us to accumulate those data without concern that monetary policy is overly restrictive. A remarkable thing about last year’s disinflation is that it occurred in the midst of strong economic growth and labor markets. Last year, the economy grew at a pace above 3 percent, which is higher than my 2 percent estimate of trend growth. Indicators point to continued underlying momentum in the economy this year. According to the advance estimate, GDP growth did moderate to a 1.6 percent pace in the first quarter. But that step down reflected the inventory and trade components, which are often revised in subsequent releases as more data come in. Final sales to private domestic purchasers, which is a better indicator of underlying demand, continued to rise at a pace of around 3 percent. Consumer spending has remained healthy, despite rising credit card delinquency rates, and business fixed investment in equipment and software has strengthened, consistent with the anecdotal evidence from business contacts. Indeed, leading up to the FOMC meeting two weeks ago, there was a significant change in tone from the contacts in our District. Many reported that economic activity had strengthened and by more than they had anticipated.\n\nLabor market conditions also remain strong. Payroll job growth has been remarkably resilient. Job gains averaged about 270 thousand per month in the first quarter of this year compared to around 210 thousand per month the previous quarter. Employment did moderate last month to a still healthy gain of 175 thousand. The unemployment rate remains low, at 3.9 percent in April. Still, the labor market has come into better balance over time as demand for workers has moderated while the supply has increased. The gap between the number of open jobs and the number of unemployed workers has narrowed. It is now about 1.3, only slightly above the 1.2 level seen in the strong labor market conditions in 2019. Our regional contacts report that while it remains difficult to find candidates with the skills needed for some jobs, in general, it has become easier to hire over time.\n\nAs labor demand has come into better balance with labor supply, wage pressures have eased. Firms in our District are expecting wage increases to average about 4 percent this year, down from 5 percent a year ago. And the wage premium workers can get from switching jobs compared to staying in their current jobs has moved back down to pre-pandemic levels.1 It had shot up after the pandemic shutdown when firms were in desperate need of workers.\n\nWhether wage growth adds to price pressures depends on whether wages adjusted for inflation are growing faster than the growth in labor productivity. Based on current estimates of trend productivity growth, which lie in the 1 to 1-1/2 percent range, wage growth is still above the level consistent with 2 percent inflation.2 But there is the possibility that changes in technology are leading to higher trend productivity growth. The scarcity of workers during the pandemic gave firms a great incentive to invest in automation, and new technologies such as generative AI hold the promise of increasing productivity over the medium to longer run. If the higher productivity growth readings we saw last year are sustained, then current levels of wage growth could continue without adding to price pressures.\n\nThe Economy in Ohio\n\nThe current developments in activity, employment, and inflation at the national level are also reflected in Ohio’s economy. As in the nation, labor market conditions in the state remain strong but show some signs of moderating. The state’s unemployment rate has ticked up this year, but stood at 3.8 percent in March, which is near its historical low. Employment growth over the first three months of the year has slowed from last year’s strong pace. And as I mentioned, employers in the state tell us it is easier to hire now. Immigration has likely contributed to that easing. Last year, immigration was the main driver of an increase in Ohio’s population, the first yearly rise in population since the pandemic. All in all, we have seen strong labor market performance in the state.\n\nOhio is the seventh largest economy in the nation in terms of gross state product. Manufacturing and, within manufacturing, auto and auto parts constitute an important sector of Ohio’s economy, and compared to the nation, manufacturing represents a larger share of payroll jobs in Ohio. But that differential has fallen over time as the economy here has diversified from one largely dependent on manufacturing and heavy industry to one in which healthcare and education play a significant role. In the 1990s, manufacturing represented about 20 percent of Ohio’s jobs and “eds and meds” represented about 12 percent. Those shares have now nearly reversed. In the past decade, the share of jobs in manufacturing has fallen to under 13 percent and the share in “eds and meds” has risen to nearly 17 percent.4\n\nRegions that have diversified their industrial base have generally fared better over time and have proven to be more resilient. But the types of shocks that hit the economy can have differential effects on regions because of differences in their industrial makeup. For example, the healthcare sector was particularly hard hit by the pandemic. The labor market in healthcare remains particularly tight, with nurses expected to remain in short supply for some time to come. But, even within healthcare, our contacts report that they have seen some improvement in hiring and some normalization in wage growth.\n\nEconomic Outlook and Monetary Policy\n\nIn my view, the most likely scenario for the overall economy and that of the region is that the current restrictive stance of monetary policy will continue to help moderate growth and labor market conditions and that this moderation will contribute to the further easing of price pressures. So I expect progress on inflation over time, but at a slower pace than we saw last year. Analysis at the Cleveland Fed indicates that the past slowdown in wage growth will pass through to lower price inflation in core services and that the declines that have occurred in rents in new leases will pass through to slower inflation in housing services. Both of these effects will be needed in order to get back to 2 percent inflation, but they will take some time.\n\nSetting monetary policy in this environment will take careful consideration of the risks to both parts of our dual mandate as the economy evolves. Recent data showing solid growth and labor market indicators suggest that risks to the employment part of our mandate have diminished. But the recent inflation readings suggest that risks to the inflation part of our mandate have risen.\n\nI am particularly attuned to the upside risks to inflation. Geopolitical tensions have the potential to further raise oil prices and other commodity prices, or to disrupt supply chains. The shortage of housing could keep housing services inflation elevated even though rents have been falling. Medium- and longer-term inflation expectations are important determinants of actual inflation. These expectations have remained reasonably well-anchored at levels consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal throughout this high-inflation episode, and that anchoring has been an important contributor to the disinflation we have seen over time. Nonetheless, recent readings on short-term inflation expectations have moved up again. Were this increase to spread to longer-term expectations, it would be considerably harder to reach our inflation goal. So setting monetary policy to ensure that those expectations remain well-anchored will be very important.\n\nThe FOMC’s job continues to be to assess the implications of economic and financial developments for the outlook and risks around the outlook and, given that assessment, to calibrate monetary policy so that inflation returns sustainably to our 2 percent goal and labor markets remain healthy. The actual path monetary policy takes will depend on how the economy actually evolves; this is the data dependence policymakers often refer to. Our current monetary policy stance puts us in a good position for managing the risks that could be realized. Moving rates down too soon or too quickly without sufficient evidence to give us confidence that inflation is on a sustainable and timely path back to 2 percent would risk undoing the progress we have made on inflation. And with labor markets and economic growth both being very solid, we do not need to take that risk.\n\nIncoming economic information indicates that it will take longer to gain that confidence; holding our restrictive stance for longer is prudent at this point as we gain clarity about the path of inflation. Once the FOMC gains confidence that inflation is moving sustainably back to 2 percent, it will be in a position to begin to gradually normalize policy back to a neutral level as the economy returns to price stability and maximum employment. While it is not my base case, should developments in inflation and inflation expectations warrant it, policymakers will need to be open to tightening policy further. On the other hand, if the labor market unexpectedly deteriorates, policy could ease sooner and by more than currently anticipated. So monetary policy is well positioned for risk management as we gather more evidence on how the economy is evolving.\n\nThe FOMC remains fully committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal because price stability is critical for the long-run health of the labor market, the overall economy, and the stability of the financial system. As we have seen since the pandemic, high inflation can badly affect people’s lives and their view of the country’s economic well being. At a recent meeting of our Business Advisory Council, we discussed the fact that even though the labor market is strong and inflation is down from its peak, many people are not very happy about the economy. Indeed, consumer sentiment and confidence indices are well below their pre-pandemic levels. I believe dissatisfaction with the economy partly reflects the fact that even though inflation has been coming down and wage gains have been relatively high for some people, prices for many things are higher now than before the pandemic and many workers’ wages haven’t kept up with inflation. When inflation persists at levels above our goal of price stability, the price level is moving up faster than we would like, and households and businesses have to pay those higher-than-desired prices. As inflation has been moving down, wages adjusted for inflation, that is, real wages, have begun to move up. As the disinflation process continues, it will help to close the gap between the cumulative increase in prices and the cumulative increase in wages, and people will then begin to feel they have made up for lost ground.5\n\nI believe another reason people are not happy with the economy is that it is much harder to purchase a house than it used to be. The median price of a home in the U.S. is now almost 50 percent higher than it was prior to the pandemic.6 Thirty-year mortgage rates are now over 7 percent; prior to the pandemic they were under 4 percent. A recent survey of consumers by the New York Fed found that renters believe the probability of their ever owning a home has fallen to 40 percent, which is the lowest level since the question was first asked in 2015.7 Owning a house is an important avenue for building wealth but many people feel this part of the American dream is out of reach, at least for now, and that isn't a good feeling.\n\nI am hopeful, though, that the economy will evolve as expected and as inflation returns to our target, economic conditions continue to normalize, and labor markets remain healthy, more people will be able to enjoy the benefits of what a strong U.S. economy has to offer.\n\nThis concludes my prepared remarks. I look forward to our discussion."

            "content": "It is a real pleasure to welcome you to the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. I thank the National Association for Business Economics, its Cleveland Chapter, Team NEO, David Altig, and Bill Koehler for the opportunity to speak with you about the economy. Dave and I go back a long way – perhaps too long for me to admit to. We worked together when we were both research directors, Dave at the Atlanta Fed and me at the Philadelphia Fed. Dave is a first-rate economist, so I know he will keep me on my toes as he moderates this session.\n\nBefore we get into today’s question and answer portion, I thought it would be helpful to frame the discussion by offering a few brief remarks about the economy and monetary policy. I will start by reminding everyone that what I say today will be my views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nEconomic Developments\n\nSubstantial progress has been made on the inflation front since inflation peaked in 2022, in the range of 7 to 9 percent, depending on the measure. But inflation is still above our 2 percent objective. PCE inflation is now running about 2-1/2 percent, whether it is measured year-over-year or over the past six months, annualized. And core PCE inflation is running about 2-3/4 percent, measured year-over-year, and near 3 percent, annualized, over the past six months. The monthly inflation readings in January and February came in firmer than the readings over the second half of last year and are a good reminder of what we already knew: that the disinflation process will not be a smooth path back to 2 percent.\n\nIn my view, the inflation picture has not changed very much since the start of the year, because I had already thought that the pace of disinflation would slow down this year. I continue to think that the most likely scenario is that inflation will continue on its downward trajectory to 2 percent over time. But I need to see more data to raise my confidence. Some further monthly readings will give us a better sense of whether the disinflation process is stalling out or whether the start-of-the-year readings reflect a temporary detour on the downward path back to price stability. I do not expect I will have enough information by the time of the FOMC’s next meeting to make that determination.\n\nA remarkable thing about the disinflation is that it has occurred in the midst of strong labor markets and economic growth. While the broader tightening in financial conditions over time has led to some moderation in the growth of output and employment, both have remained stronger than expected. That relatively strong demand confronts a supply side of the economy that is healing. Supply chain disruptions and bottlenecks have improved over the past three years and the labor market is normalizing. People have returned to the labor force over time, and immigration has also increased the supply of labor. With imbalances between supply and demand in both product markets and labor markets easing, inflation has been easing as well. Now that pressures on supply chains are approaching normal and the labor market is coming into better balance, we are not likely to get as much help on inflation from the supply side as we saw last year.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\n\nI have revised up my projection of growth for the year based on the incoming economic information, including the official statistics and also the reports we receive from our directors and regional contacts, which are forward looking. In the most likely scenario, I still expect growth to moderate compared to last year’s very rapid pace. But instead of the economy growing under trend this year, I now expect it will grow a bit above my 2 percent estimate of trend growth. I expect the labor market to continue to come into better balance this year, with a slight uptick in the unemployment rate from its current very low level. And I expect further progress on inflation but at a slower pace than we saw last year. If the economy evolves as expected, then in my view it will be appropriate for the FOMC to begin reducing the fed funds rate later this year, as inflation continues on its downward path toward 2 percent, and labor markets and economic growth remain solid. These reductions should be viewed as a normalization of policy back to a neutral level as the economy returns to price stability and maximum employment. But, of course, the actual path of policy will depend on how the economy actually evolves.\n\nMy forecast is similar to the median among the FOMC participants in the Summary of Economic Projections that were released after our March meeting,1 except that I see somewhat higher inflation this year. In my projection, I have also raised my estimate of the longer-run federal funds rate to 3 percent compared with 2.5 percent, which had been my estimate for some time. I raised my estimate to reflect the continued resilience in the economy despite high nominal interest rates and higher model-based estimates of the equilibrium interest rate, r-star.\n\nI have been discussing my view of the most likely scenario, but there are several risks to the forecast, including continued heightened geopolitical tensions, slow growth of the Chinese economy, potential deterioration in conditions in commercial real estate markets, renewed stresses in financial markets, and, on the upside, the possibility of stronger than expected productivity growth.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nAt its meeting two weeks ago, the FOMC decided to keep the target range of the fed funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent and reiterated that it does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until the Committee has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.\n\nWith inflation now moving closer to our goal, the risks to achieving both parts of our dual mandate have become more balanced. When we were tightening policy, we needed to focus on the inflation part of our mandate, because inflation was so high and the labor market was strong. Now, risk management with respect to both parts of our mandate will need to be the hallmark of monetary policy decisions going forward. If year-ahead inflation expectations continue to decline, maintaining the current level of the nominal fed funds rate for too long would effectively be a tightening in our policy stance, which would pose an increasing risk to the maximum employment part of our mandate. On the other hand, moving rates down too soon or too quickly without sufficient evidence to give us confidence that inflation is on a sustainable and timely path back to 2 percent would risk undoing the progress we have made on inflation. At this point, I think the bigger risk would be to begin reducing the funds rate too early. And with labor markets and economic growth both being very solid, we do not need to take that risk.\n\nOur current monetary policy stance puts us in a good position for managing risks that could manifest themselves on either side. If the labor market deteriorates, we can move rates down sooner and more quickly than in our baseline. Rather than view this as a normalization, the intention would be to return to an accommodative stance of monetary policy to support the economy. On the other hand, if inflation appears to be stalling at a level above our goal, we can hold our restrictive stance for longer than in the baseline.\n\nIn contrast to where we are now, our policy was not well positioned when we started our tightening cycle because the policy rate was so low and inflation was moving up persistently. We needed to raise rates fairly aggressively. At this point, we are seeking to calibrate our policy well to economic developments so we can avoid having to act in an aggressive fashion. Indeed, if the economy evolves as I expect, I anticipate that we will be able to move rates down gradually as inflation and inflation expectations move down, allowing us to continue to manage the risks to both sides of our mandate.\n\nBut let me reiterate: the actual path of policy will depend on how the economy actually evolves. The FOMC’s job continues to be to assess the implications of economic and financial developments for the outlook and risks around the outlook and, given that assessment, to calibrate monetary policy so that inflation returns sustainably to our 2 percent goal and labor markets remain healthy.\n\nThis concludes my brief prepared remarks. I look forward to our discussion."

            "content": "It is a real pleasure to speak with the European Economics and Financial Centre once again. I especially look forward to taking your questions because I learn a lot from hearing what is on your mind. Let me help frame our discussion by giving some brief remarks about the U.S. economy and monetary policy. Of course, these will be my views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe economy and monetary policy have been on quite a journey since I last spoke to you two years ago. Today, I would say that both the economy and monetary policy are in a good place. Inflation is still above our goal of 2 percent, but it has moved down a lot from its peak in 2022, when inflation hit a 40-year high, in the range of 7 to 9 percent, depending on the measure. Remarkably, this disinflation has occurred in the midst of strong labor markets and economic growth. The FOMC’s job now is to ensure that the economy reaches an even better place by calibrating monetary policy so that inflation returns sustainably to our 2 percent goal and labor markets remain healthy.\n\nEconomic Developments\n\nOver the past four years, the pandemic and its aftermath have been the major forces shaping economic developments and the major sources of uncertainty about the economy. Those forces have made it hard to track the economy because both supply and demand have been affected. Usually, it’s all about demand. But the pandemic affected global supply chains, the supply of and demand for labor, and the mix of household and business spending on housing, goods, and services.\n\nImbalances between supply and demand in both product and labor markets led to significant upward pressure on prices, and inflation began to rise in April 2021. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, an ongoing human tragedy, added to inflationary pressures, spurring higher prices for oil, food, and other commodities. In response to the high inflation, the FOMC began raising its policy rate, the federal funds rate, in March 2022, and over the two years since, the Committee significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy by raising the fed funds rate by a cumulative 5-1/4 percentage points. The Fed is also reducing the size of its balance sheet by allowing assets to roll off in a systematic way according to the plan announced in May 2022. The tightening of monetary policy has led to a broader tightening in financial conditions over time, and, in response, aggregate demand has begun to moderate. The supply side of the economy is also healing. Supply chain disruptions and bottlenecks have improved significantly, and firms have invested in diversifying their supply chains, making them more resilient to disruptions. The labor market is normalizing. People have returned to the labor force over time, and the labor force participation rate of people aged 25 to 54 is now slightly above its pre-pandemic level. With imbalances between supply and demand in both product markets and labor markets easing, inflation has been easing, too.\n\nI expect growth to moderate this year compared to its strong pace last year. Consumer spending has held up well, but in the wake of high prices, many families, especially those with lower incomes, are being more cautious with their spending. There has been an uptick in credit card debt, suggesting that some households have exhausted their ready cash balances. Delinquencies on consumer loans have also edged up, although they are still at low levels. Businesses also slowed their spending on equipment and software last year, and this spending is expected to continue to moderate given restrictive credit conditions. Tighter financial conditions have restrained investment in housing. Sales of existing homes are at low levels, but sales of new single-family homes were fairly resilient given the longer-term shortage of available housing. The shortfall in housing supply has kept home prices relatively high, but rents, especially for new tenants, have moved down and that should lead to the continued tempering of inflation in housing services.\n\nJob growth has been remarkably resilient. The unemployment rate has been 3.7 percent over the past three months and it has been within range of its 50-year low for almost two years. I expect conditions in labor markets to remain healthy but to moderate a bit. Our contacts tell us that, except for the healthcare sector, it is easier to hire than it was a year ago and that they are getting more applicants per job opening. The pace of job quits has also declined since peaking in 2022.\n\nBetter balance between the supply and demand for workers has meant wage growth has slowed. Firms in our District are expecting wage increases to average about 4 percent this year, down from 5 percent a year ago, but still above pre-pandemic levels. Based on current estimates of trend productivity growth, wage growth is still a bit above the level consistent with 2 percent inflation. But it could be that trend productivity growth has moved higher than what it was before the pandemic. Workers were scarce during the pandemic, giving firms a great incentive to do more with fewer workers; many companies invested in automation. New technologies such as generative AI hold the promise of increasing productivity over the medium to longer run. If so, then wages would be able to rise at a faster rate and still be consistent with price stability.\n\nIt is interesting that despite the labor market’s strong performance, until recently, surveys of consumers indicated that most people were not very happy about the economy. I believe that partly reflects the fact that even though inflation has been coming down and wage gains have been relatively high, prices for many things are higher than they were before the pandemic and many people’s wages haven’t kept up with inflation. When inflation persists at levels above our goal of price stability, the price level is moving up faster than we would like, and households and businesses have to pay those higher-than-desired prices. With inflation moving down, wages adjusted for inflation, that is, real wages, have begun to move up, and this is helping to close the gap between the cumulative increase in prices and the cumulative increase in wages. This may be partly why consumers are feeling better about the economy now.\n\nInflation\n\nInflation moved down faster than expected last year even as the economy remained strong. Measured year-over-year, as of January, total PCE inflation was 2.4 percent, core PCE inflation was 2.8 percent, and the Cleveland Fed’s median PCE inflation measure was 3.5 percent.\n\nBut the January inflation report shows that we need to be cautious in assuming that inflation will continue to fall at the same pace as last year. Restrictive monetary policy has played an important role in moving inflation down, but supply-side adjustments have also been important. Now that pressures on supply chains are approaching normal and the labor market is coming into better balance, I don’t think we should count on as much help from the supply side as we saw last year.\n\nEven so, I do expect inflation to continue to move down over time to our 2 percent goal, even if it proves to be somewhat more persistent this year than last year. Anchored inflation expectations are an important component of that forecast. Medium- and longer-term inflation expectations remain reasonably well-anchored in a range consistent with the Fed’s goal of 2 percent inflation. One-year-ahead inflation expectations have also moved down over time but are still above their 2019 averages. Continued progress on inflation will help ensure that these expectations move down to our goal. Progress depends on appropriate monetary policy.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nAt its meeting in January, the FOMC kept the target range of the fed funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent, where it has been since last July. The Committee said that it does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent. The Fed has a dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment. When we began this tightening cycle, inflation was far above our goal and labor markets were strong. So it was clear we needed to focus on the price stability part of our mandate. Now, with inflation moving closer to our goal, we need to balance the risks to achieving both sides of our dual mandate when determining the appropriate stance of policy.\n\nRisk management will be the hallmark of monetary policy decisions going forward. If year-ahead inflation expectations continue to decline, maintaining the current level of the nominal fed funds rate for too long would effectively be a tightening in our policy stance, which would pose an increasing risk to the maximum employment part of our mandate. But at this point, I think the bigger mistake would be to move rates down too soon or too quickly without sufficient evidence that inflation is on a sustainable and timely path back to 2 percent. Doing so would undermine all of the good work that has gone into getting inflation to this point. We don’t want to find ourselves in a situation where we begin easing too soon, undo some of the progress we have made on inflation, potentially destabilize inflation expectations, and then have to reverse course. And with labor markets and economic growth both being very solid, we don’t need to take that risk.\n\nMy baseline forecast is that output and employment will moderate somewhat this year and inflation will continue to move closer to our 2 percent goal over time. I will gain confidence when I see inflation continuing to move down. The FOMC will then be in a position to start reducing the level of restrictiveness by moving the fed funds rate down. If the economy performs as anticipated, I expect we will find ourselves in that position sometime later this year. My base case is that when we do begin to move rates down, we will do so at a gradual pace so that we can continue to manage the risks to both sides of our mandate.\n\nBut this all depends on the economy evolving as expected. And there are a number of risks around this forecast. Heightened geopolitical tensions pose potential implications for financial markets, oil prices, and global demand and supply. Easing financial conditions could spur a resurgence in activity, leading once again to imbalances that fuel inflation. The stress generated by the bank failures last March has subsided and many banks have diversified their sources of liquidity, making them less vulnerable. But stress could come again to banks that continue to rely on uninsured deposits for their funding while having sizable exposures to commercial real estate assets that will need to be repriced at higher interest rates. We also know that monetary policy transmits to the broader economy by affecting overall financial conditions, but the magnitude, speed, and duration with which it affects the economy vary with the nature of the shocks that have hit the economy and other aspects of the economic environment. So while labor markets are currently strong and are expected to only gradually moderate, we need to remain attentive to the possibility that conditions could deteriorate faster than expected. On the other hand, the strong output and employment growth could be an indication that the neutral rate of interest, which rose during the pandemic, might remain high. This would mean policy might be less restrictive than we think it is and that restrictive policy may be needed for longer than anticipated to achieve our goals of price stability and maximum employment.\n\nThe good news is that monetary policy is in a good place from which to assess and respond to these risks to the outlook. Because of the current strength in labor market conditions and the strong spending data, we have the luxury of keeping rates where they are as we gather more evidence that inflation truly is on a sustainable and timely path back to 2 percent. If downside risks materialize, we would have the opportunity to move rates down more quickly, just as we raised rates more aggressively than usual to combat rising inflation. On the other hand, if inflation appears to be stalling at a level above our goal, we would have the opportunity to maintain a restrictive stance for longer. Our policy actions will depend on how the economy and the risks actually evolve. When our goals of price stability and maximum employment are achieved, the economy will be in an even better place than it is today.\n\nOperating Framework\n\nLet me conclude with some remarks about the Fed’s balance sheet. At our meeting later this month, the FOMC will begin to discuss reducing the pace of the runoff in its balance-sheet assets. Since June 2022, the Fed has been allowing maturing Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities to run off its balance sheet at a fairly good clip according to the plan announced in May 2022. The Fed’s holdings of securities total about $7 trillion and have declined by about $1.4 trillion since the runoff began.\n\nWe are implementing monetary policy via an ample reserves operating regime. In this regime, reserve levels are ample enough that control over the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates is executed primarily through setting the Fed’s administered rates: the interest rate paid on bank reserves, the interest rate offered on overnight reverse repurchase agreements (ON RRPs), and the primary credit rate on discount window loans. Under this framework, active management of the supply of reserves is not needed.\n\nAs assets run off our balance sheet, Fed liabilities move down. So far, rather than a reduction in reserves, runoff has resulted in a reduction in ON RRPs, with balances currently under $575 billion. In aggregate, reserve balances are about $3.5 trillion, which is about 15 percent of banking system assets. What constitutes an ample level of reserves is uncertain. It depends on the banking sector’s demand for reserves, as well as the distribution of that demand across institutions, which will evolve over time. The current level is more than ample, but as balance-sheet runoff continues and ON RRP volume reaches a minimum level, reserves will begin declining, too, and more redistribution of reserves will need to occur across institutions. So at some point the FOMC will slow the pace of runoff and then stop the runoff when reserve balances are somewhat above the level it judges to be consistent with ample. This will help ensure that we can continue to reduce our balance sheet to its efficient size for effectively implementing monetary policy. It will also help us move toward our longer-run goal of holding primarily Treasury securities, thereby minimizing the allocation of credit across sectors of the economy. I note that the runoff pace pertains to how we implement monetary policy and not to the stance of monetary policy. Our main tool of monetary policy is the fed funds rate target, and balance-sheet runoff can continue even after we begin to lower the funds rate.\n\nThis concludes my prepared remarks. Thank you for your attention. I look forward to our discussion."

            "content": "I thank Trish Mosser and the organizers at Columbia University and the Bank Policy Institute for inviting me to speak today. I received my undergraduate degree from Barnard College, and it is nice to be back on campus. I appreciate that this conference brings together academic researchers, industry practitioners, and policymakers to discuss research pertinent to financial regulation. I am a firm believer that research should inform policymaking. Academic research has greatly expanded our understanding of how systemic risks can build up and propagate throughout the economy. It informed the regulatory reforms put in place after the global financial crisis, and it should continue to guide regulatory changes going forward. At the same time, we know that models cannot capture all aspects of the real-world financial system. Decisions have to be made in a world that doesn’t match our models and without all the information we would like to have. So the experience of practitioners, in addition to research, has to inform regulation and policy. There are many open issues regarding best practices and policies to promote financial resilience, and my hope is that academic researchers will continue to push the frontier forward. This conference provides an excellent forum to capture the synergies between research, practice, and policy.\n\nToday I will speak about financial system resilience, with a focus on the banking system. The views I present will be my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nFinancial Resilience in a Dynamic Economy\n\nIn less than two decades, the world has experienced two historically deep negative shocks to the global economy and financial system. While their causes were different, the global financial crisis of 2008 and the COVID-19 pandemic that hit in 2020 each necessitated the intervention of central banks in ways not contemplated in earlier decades. Last spring, the Fed was required to intervene again to address stresses in the banking system precipitated by the failures of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank.\n\nThe global financial crisis followed a period of low interest rates in the first half of the 2000s. The stresses of last March occurred in an environment of high and rising interest rates. This is a reminder that regardless of the interest-rate environment, financial system vulnerabilities can help propagate adverse shocks across the financial system and sometimes very quickly. Indeed, both bankers and supervisors were caught off guard by the speed with which deposits flowed out of Silicon Valley Bank. Over $40 billion of deposits left the bank on March 9, 2023, and another $100 billion was expected to leave the next day, making the two-day total about 85 percent of the bank’s deposits. In comparison, when Wachovia failed in 2008, the deposit outflow was lower and slower: about $10 billion flowed out over eight days.\n\nThe failure of SVB was a classic situation but in a new environment. An underlying factor in SVB’s failure was the bank’s poor management of interest-rate risk, one of the traditional risks we look to banks to manage. But the poor management was revealed as the Fed raised interest rates more aggressively than usual in response to very high inflation: in the year before the bank failed, the Fed had raised its policy rate by 450 basis points. Similarly, SVB suffered a classic bank run, but instead of people lining up at the bank to withdraw deposits, the run was aided and abetted by social media that quickly spread news about the bank and by depositors’ ability to move money electronically and very quickly.\n\nAn important lesson is that bankers’ risk management and supervisors’ risk monitoring need to be much more dynamic than they used to be because the economic and financial environment has become more dynamic. The demarcation between illiquidity and insolvency is fluid. A temporary liquidity problem at one institution, if not addressed in a timely manner, can morph into a solvency problem that can spread to other institutions and become amplified throughout the system. And this can happen more rapidly than in the past given the rise in interconnectedness and changes in technology. In other words, “timely manner” is quicker than it used to be. Bank supervisors need to monitor not only risks that are developing at individual institutions but also risks that are seen across similar types of institutions throughout the system; supervisors need to emphasize both micro- and macro supervision.\n\nWhile risk management was at the heart of the bank failures of last year, weaknesses in supervision were also revealed.1 As the Fed’s Vice Chair of Supervision noted in recent remarks at the Columbia Law School, the Federal Reserve is taking steps to improve the speed, force, and agility of its supervision so that supervisors take action as risks build up and pay greater attention to changes in the environment that create new risks.2\n\nRisk management and monitoring are part of a financial resilience framework aimed at ensuring that individual financial institutions are able to withstand the inevitable economic and financial shocks that hit over time and that the entire financial system is resilient. Better resilience means less chance of fire sales of assets, runs on financial firms, shortages of liquid assets, or contraction of credit in the face of unknown counterparty risk. Better resilience will mean banks can continue to offer their important credit, liquidity, and payment services to creditworthy businesses and households during economic downturns and financial markets can continue intermediating in an orderly fashion during periods of stress.\n\nA resilient financial system also limits the times during which monetary policy and financial stability goals come into conflict, so that monetary policy is not disrupted by financial system stress and can continue to transmit to the broader economy. Last March, financial stability tools were used to address stresses in the banking system. This allowed the Fed to continue to use its monetary policy tools for macroeconomic purposes, and we proceeded with an increase in the federal funds rate at our March 2023 meeting. But those financial stability tools involved regulators invoking the systemic risk exception and implementing a new lending facility.3\n\nA more resilient financial system would diminish the need for the Fed and other regulators to have to step in, whether it be to reduce market dysfunction by buying Treasury assets, as we had to do in October 2019 and March 2020, or having to set up special facilities to serve as the lender of last resort, actions that have the potential to change the Fed into the lender of first resort.\n\nThe question is: how do we design a framework that promotes financial resilience in a dynamic economy? I believe that three principles from monetary policy can provide a useful starting point: (1) setting a well-articulated and achievable goal for financial resilience, (2) being more systematic and less discretionary as we apply the tools of supervision and regulation, and (3) being more transparent so that market discipline can work in tandem with regulation and supervision. Let me turn to each of these.\n\nFinancial Resilience Goal\n\nI would like to see the U.S. articulate a goal for financial resilience. Markus Brunnermeier, a professor at Princeton University, defines resilience as the ability to recover from a shock, like a reed that is able to withstand strong winds by bending without breaking.4 He makes a distinction between risk management, which is concerned with how to manage potential shocks of different magnitudes and frequencies, and resilience management, which is concerned with how to adapt and recover once a shock hits. I think this is a useful distinction, and it reminds me of the evolution in the approach taken to address cybersecurity risks. In the past, efforts focused squarely on building up the defenses around IT systems to prevent an attack. But as systems have become more complex and the avenues of attack have multiplied, efforts now pay equal attention to resilience. Improving cybersecurity is now viewed as a battle on two fronts. You must take actions to minimize the chances that your IT systems will be infiltrated but recognize that regardless of your strong defenses, some attackers will infiltrate; so, design your systems so that it is harder for the incursion to spread and so that you can resume operations quickly. Analogously, the regulatory reforms instituted after the global financial crisis were framed in terms of financial “stability.” Now, the discussion is framed in terms of “resilience.”\n\nIn the case of the financial system, a resilience goal has to recognize that banks are able to provide their valuable credit, risk-management, and liquidity services because they are designed to take on risk and leverage. The goal of regulation and supervision cannot be to eliminate all volatility in markets or prevent all bank failures, since this would negate banking’s benefits to the economy, which come through taking and managing risk. Instead, the goal should be to limit tail and systemic risks so that the financial system absorbs shocks rather than amplifies them, and so that the system can recover quickly and continue to provide its services across the business and financial cycles. Regulation and supervision can contribute to financial system resilience, first, by lowering the probability that a shock will become systemic, and second, by reducing the costs imposed on the rest of the economy when a shock hits the financial system.\n\nAppropriately calibrating regulation and supervision involves recognizing a tradeoff: tight regulation will limit bank failures, but it will also limit risk-taking and innovation, raise the cost of intermediation, and put regulated institutions at a competitive disadvantage compared to less regulated firms, all of which could undermine the banking system’s ability to serve its customers and support longer-run economic growth. Loose regulation will lead to a higher probability of multiple failures and/or more costly systemic events. This adversely affects economic growth in both the short and the longer run; research indicates that financial crises tend to make recessions worse and lead to permanent losses of output.5 It is also important to recognize that the nature of the tradeoff is affected by the degree of resilience. Increasing resilience will allow for more risk-taking and innovation ex ante because the financial system will be able to recover from the shock with less cost to the real economy.\n\nThe reforms in regulation and supervision since the global financial crisis have increased the resilience of the U.S. financial system. But the financial system is dynamic, and the nature of the shocks can change over time. So, continued focus on building resilience is warranted. To get the balance right between regulation and innovation, capital and liquidity requirements need to be tailored to the risks a banking organization poses to the financial system. Research and practice suggest these risks are likely to vary according to the bank’s size, range of activities and funding sources, domestic and global interconnectedness, complexity, and the extent to which there is a lack of readily available substitutes for the services provided by the institution. Note that a matrix of factors determines riskiness, not a single characteristic. Tailoring helps to ensure that supervisory resources and attention are allocated efficiently. But because the financial system and economic environment are dynamic, periodic reviews of the tailoring and calibration of regulatory requirements should be undertaken to ensure that the regulatory and supervisory framework still delivers the same level of resilience as new products, business models, and potential sources of risk are introduced.\n\nIn my view, at the larger banks, current minimum capital standards are still below the level where an increase would be counterproductive in terms of thwarting productive risk-taking, beneficial innovation, or economic growth. Bank capital forms the solid foundation for bank lending. Empirical research finds that well-capitalized banks tend to lend more than poorly capitalized ones, to grow their loan and deposit market shares during crises by purchasing assets from less well-capitalized banks,6 and to have more access to market funding during downturns than do less capitalized banks.7 High leverage has been shown to be a major contributor to the severity of financial crises, while a well-capitalized banking system – reflecting both the amount and the quality of the capital – is less likely to amplify negative macroeconomic shocks and is more resilient. I view the Basel III endgame capital proposal as a recalibration aligned with this view.8\n\nWhile much of regulation and supervision has focused on credit risk, last year’s bank stresses shined a bright light on the importance of managing liquidity and interest-rate risks. Providing banks with incentives to choose less risky funding sources, such as tightening the liquidity coverage ratio requirement so that banks have to hold higher levels of liquid assets to cover potential cash outflows, would reduce the probability of a run. We have also learned that even if there is considerable liquidity in the system, impediments that limit the system’s ability to effectively redistribute liquidity to banks that need it can raise systemic risk. The Federal Reserve System serves as lender of last resort by lending against good collateral to healthy banks facing temporary liquidity problems, but last year’s bank failures exposed weaknesses in the ability or desire of banks to utilize the discount window. This undermines the discount window’s ability to limit bank runs and promote resilience. Instead of the discount window, banks have relied on the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) as a reliable source of funding. That is partly because FHLB advances offer some advantages to banks over discount window loans: advances can be longer term; they are cheaper, especially in periods of stress; FHLBs typically give higher lendable value against collateral; and advances are not disclosed, whereas discount window loans are, with a two-year lag. Yet as we saw, FHLB funding was not reliable during the stresses seen last March.\n\nProposed changes to the FHLBs, if enacted, will place some limits on banks’ ability to borrow, especially those banks in a weakened state.9 This likely will increase banks’ demand for alternative funding sources, perhaps making them rely more on uninsured deposits, thereby increasing the potential for bank runs in response to a shock. This increases the need for banks to be prepared to use the discount window as a source of contingency funding.\n\nCurrently, the Reserve Banks are encouraging eligible financial institutions to ensure that they have the legal agreements and collateral in place and have tested their ability to use the discount window in a timely way should the need arise. Testing at this time is not mandatory, but I support requiring such testing as part of sound liquidity management. It is also worth considering requiring banks to pre-position collateral at the window in proportion to their short-term runnable funding, including uninsured deposits, so they would be ready to borrow at the discount window should that funding start to run.10 This requirement would be consistent with a tiered approach to regulation, since banks that are less reliant on runnable funds and that therefore pose fewer risks, a category that includes many smaller banks, would be required to post less collateral. And it would provide some incentive for those banks that find the constraint binding to adjust to a lower-risk funding structure.\n\nSystematic Financial Resilience Policy\n\nI am a proponent of systematic monetary policy, and I would like us to apply our regulatory and supervisory tools in a more systematic manner, too. The benefit of taking a systematic approach to monetary policy is well established. It allows the public to better understand the rationale for the Fed’s policy decisions so that their policy expectations will better align with those of policymakers. This alignment helps households, firms, and financial market participants make better financial and employment decisions, thereby making monetary policy more effective.\n\nAn additional benefit of a systematic approach is that it provides a mechanism through which policymakers can commit to policies aimed at promoting policy goals over the longer run. That is, being systematic can help alleviate time-inconsistency problems. Incentives – those of both financial institutions and regulators – take a central role in the financial system so time-inconsistency and moral hazard problems loom large. This makes it even more important to be systematic in the application of regulatory policy and supervisory actions.\n\nIn times of financial stress, regulators find themselves with a time-inconsistency problem. Forcing one bank to take actions to raise capital or address other risk-management concerns during a period of stress could precipitate a widespread reevaluation of the banking industry by investors and depositors resulting in a systemic event. In such cases, regulators and supervisors might lean toward interventions and forbearance even if this creates bad incentives for financial institutions to manage risks in the future. Time-inconsistency problems mean regulators face a tradeoff between what is better in the short run and what is better over the long run. Adherence to a systematic approach can serve as a commitment device for regulators to focus on long-run goals. This would help to limit moral hazard so that banks themselves internalize more of the risks they are taking and self-insure against losses rather than expect government support. Of course, if the shock were large enough, policymakers would need to step in, but there would likely be fewer situations in which the government would need to offer such support. But getting to this point requires having the right tools in order to align regulatory incentives and reduce the time-inconsistency problem.\n\nThe stresses in the banking system last March underscored the challenge of ensuring that financial institutions can rebuild their capital when their assets decline in value. SVB’s attempt to raise capital after selling assets at a loss raised concerns about the bank’s health among depositors and precipitated the run. Cyclical macroprudential tools aim to solve this problem by having banks build up capital in good times that can be used in bad times. In the U.S., these tools are basically limited to the countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) and the stress test.\n\nThe CCyB is intended to require banks to hold more capital during periods of high credit growth, which often coincides with the accumulation of system-wide risk. However, the lead times needed to use this tool limit its effectiveness in addressing vulnerabilities that may develop rapidly or that can be detected only after they are far along. This suggests the need to raise the buffer in good times before we see the vulnerabilities, yet we have never raised the CCyB above zero in the U.S. The CCyB would be more effective and time consistent if it were recalibrated to be a positive level in normal times, and then raised when credit growth moves up and lowered when credit growth moves down based on a systematic rule that is agreed to in advance of stress.\n\nSimilarly, the current stress tests should be redesigned with an eye to making them a more effective countercyclical capital tool so that banks have to build up their capital buffers when they are better able to do so. In addition, an expanded set of risks should be incorporated into the scenarios. For example, typically, the stress tests focus on recession scenarios, in which interest rates are assumed to decline. Incorporating rising-interest-rate scenarios into the stress tests would be prudent. To augment the stress tests, the Fed is now doing exploratory analysis of the effects that different economic and financial conditions have on the banking system, including scenarios with high inflation and rising interest rates.11\n\nBut the most effective way to limit moral hazard problems and the time-inconsistency problem regulators face with an insolvent bank is to create an effective, credible, and time-consistent bank resolution mechanism that can be applied systematically when a bank fails. If regulators were able to confidently resolve large financial institutions in a way that limits spillovers and avoids causing system-wide instability, they would be in a much better position when the inevitable shock hits the financial system.12 Such a mechanism would also provide bankers with the incentive to better manage their risks. However, while certain steps have been taken, such a credible resolution mechanism remains elusive even as it becomes more important given the speed with which banks can run into problems.\n\nTransparency\n\nLet me finish with a few comments about transparency, another tenet of sound monetary policymaking that I believe should be brought into the realm of financial system regulation and supervision. The financial system is complex, with various types of institutions and multiple regulators. In addition, regulators are likely to have more private information on which to base their policy decisions, making it more difficult for the public and elected officials to assess whether the decisions are appropriate ones. There has been a long-standing view that supervisory information should be kept private so as not to be a source of instability, but greater transparency and more disclosure by both banks and regulators would provide better incentives for risk management and would allow for more market discipline. We have seen more transparency around the stress tests and that has been a positive development.\n\nMuch of bank regulation is tied to book values instead of market values. Moving toward market-value accounting for more of a bank’s balance sheet, basing more of bank regulation on market values, and disclosing more market-value information about a bank’s balance sheet would help align regulation and supervision with market discipline.13 While banks have to account for securities held in their trading books at market values, the current accounting rules allow some banks to classify securities held on their own books as hold-to-maturity assets and account for them according to their book value instead of their market value. In the current environment, many longer-term securities were purchased when interest rates were low, but when rates rose, the market value of these assets fell. Thus, many banks have unrealized losses on their balance sheets. This is not a problem if the bank can, indeed, hold these assets until maturity. But if a bank needs to sell the assets, it will have to realize the loss and take the hit to capital. This is the position SVB found itself in.\n\nEven if accounting regulations are not changed, having supervisors pay more attention to market values would likely spur earlier actions on their part to ensure sound risk management at banks and would help focus supervisory attention on areas of highest vulnerability.14 Requiring banks to be transparent with their supervisors about the underlying assumptions in their risk-management models would also increase supervisors’ ability to better evaluate risk management at the bank. SVB assumed interest rates would be falling; instead they rose, which increased the risk of SVB’s position. In addition, banks and supervisors should incorporate more scenario analysis into their risk management and monitoring. Looking at various stress scenarios involving relevant risks can make banks and supervisors better prepared for what could happen even if it is not viewed as the most likely situation at the time. And the more uncertain the environment, the wider the set of possible scenarios that should be examined.\n\nI have been speaking about the banking system today, but we also need to take steps to increase the structural resilience of nonbank financial firms and markets. To do that, regulators need increased visibility into the nonbank financial sector. Not having the data needed to adequately measure the risks and vulnerabilities in a particular segment of the financial system should not lure us into thinking that the vulnerabilities are small or do not exist. Better risk monitoring will require more disclosure in many segments, including data on the assets backing many stablecoins, central counterparties’ member concentrations, principal trading firms, and nonbank funders.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo conclude, a resilient financial system plays an important role in ensuring a strong economy. After the global financial crisis, steps were taken to shore up the resilience of the banking system. Systemically important banking institutions have higher capital and liquidity buffers and better risk-management systems than they did. The sound banking system was able to lend important support to households and businesses throughout the pandemic. But the financial system is dynamic, with new products, business models, and technologies being introduced, and the economic environment can change rapidly. Last year’s bank stress underscores the importance of not becoming complacent. We need to look holistically at the regulations, our methods of supervision, and our lender of last resort function to address the vulnerabilities that were revealed. This holistic approach should consider the interactions among various regulations, leaning toward simplification when possible. Recalibration should be informed by careful cost-benefit analyses. Identifying and addressing weaknesses will improve the underlying resilience of the financial system, so that we can continue to rely on it to provide its important services across the business and financial cycles and limit the need for government interventions."

            "content": "I thank Michael Adelman, CEO of the Ohio Bankers League, for the opportunity to speak at this year’s Economic Summit. Of course, the views I present today will be my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe last time I spoke at an OBL event was in September 2021. At that time, a strong economic recovery was underway, but it was an uneven one and there were still many challenges and risks, including the Delta variant of the coronavirus, which was emerging. People were starting to return to the workforce but only slowly. The number of payroll jobs and the labor force participation rate were still well below where they were prior to the pandemic, and the unemployment rate, while down from its peak of nearly 15 percent early in the pandemic, was still near 5 percent. Inflation had moved up to over 4 percent. It was expected to rise further and remain elevated until supply constraints and pent-up demand eased, which would take some time. Monetary policy had not yet begun to tighten.\n\nThe economy and monetary policy have certainly been on quite a journey since then. Characterizing both today, I would say that the economy and monetary policy are in a good place. Inflation is still above our goal of 2 percent, but it has moved down considerably from its high level in 2022 and labor markets and economic growth remain strong. The FOMC’s job now is to ensure that the economy reaches an even better place by calibrating monetary policy to achieve our dual mandate goals of price stability and maximum employment. In order to do that calibration, we will need to continue to monitor and assess incoming economic and financial information and its implications not only for the baseline forecast but also for the risks around that forecast. Risk management will take center stage.\n\nBankers have played an important role in determining where the economy is today and where it is going. By providing valuable credit, risk-management, liquidity, and payments services to your customers, you support a strong economy. Ohio bankers supported families, businesses, and communities throughout the pandemic, and they continue to do so, even as the industry faces its own challenges. I want to thank you for managing through the balance-sheet impacts of the sharp rise in interest rates over the past two years and the liquidity stresses that manifested themselves last March. Just as the Fed will be carefully managing risks in determining its appropriate policy stance, banks will need to do so as well, so that they can continue to contribute to a strong economy.\n\nI also want to thank the bankers in Ohio and throughout the Fourth District for the timely information and insights on the economy and banking conditions that they have provided to me in my role as a Federal Reserve policymaker. Several of the Cleveland Fed’s current and former directors and members of our Community Depository Institutions Advisory Council are here today, and they can attest to the rich set of insights provided by our bankers. This information plays a crucial role in helping us better understand what is really happening on the ground in real time and what could be coming.\n\nSo let me now turn to my assessment of the where the economy and monetary policy are and where they are likely going.\n\nEconomic Developments\n\nOver the past four years, the pandemic and its aftermath have been the major forces shaping economic developments and the major sources of uncertainty about the economy. When the pandemic hit, the economy shut down in March 2020, and fiscal and monetary policymakers took aggressive actions to support households and businesses, ensuring that credit continued to flow and limiting lasting damage to the economy. The economy began to reopen in May 2020 when public health statistics began to improve. But it wasn’t business as usual. The pandemic had affected global supply chains, the supply of and demand for labor, and the composition of household and business spending on housing, goods, and services. Imbalances between supply and demand in both product and labor markets led to significant upward pressure on prices, and inflation began to rise in April 2021. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, an ongoing human tragedy, added to inflationary pressures, spurring higher prices for oil, food, and other commodities. In 2022, headline inflation reached levels not seen in 40 years, running 7 to 9 percent, depending on the measure. In response, the FOMC began raising its policy rate, the federal funds rate, in March 2022, and over the two years since, the Committee has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy by raising the fed funds rate by a cumulative 5-1/4 percentage points. The Fed is also reducing the size of its balance sheet by allowing assets to roll off in a systematic way according to the plan announced in May 2022.\n\nThe tightening of monetary policy has led to a broader tightening in financial conditions over time and, in response, aggregate demand has begun to moderate. In addition, the supply side of the economy has been healing. Supply chain disruptions and bottlenecks have improved significantly, and firms have invested in diversifying their supply chains, making them more resilient to disruptions. Growing tensions in the Middle East might undermine supply-chain improvements, but our business contacts tell us that so far there has been minimal effect on their operations and that they expect the increase in shipping costs through the Red Sea to be temporary, but this is a risk worth watching.\n\nThe pandemic had profound effects on the labor market, but the labor market is normalizing. People have returned to the labor force over time, and the labor force participation rate of people aged 25 to 54 is now slightly above its pre-pandemic level.\n\nOver time, the imbalances between supply and demand in both product markets and labor markets, which helped fuel high inflation, have lessened, and inflation has moved down. This disinflation has happened even as the economy has remained very resilient, with both economic growth and the labor market outperforming relative to expectations. As you’ll recall, many CEOs and economists thought that growth last year would be below trend. But the economy didn’t agree. Real GDP growth in the fourth quarter stepped down from its very strong pace in the third quarter, but it was still a solid 3-1/4 percent annual rate. Growth last year is estimated to have been a bit over 3 percent, above my 2 percent estimate of trend growth. The change in firms’ inventories was expected to subtract from growth last quarter, but instead made a slight positive contribution. Growth in final sales, which excludes the change in inventories, was quite strong.\n\nConsumer spending makes up about 70 percent of GDP. Strong income growth and healthy balance sheets have continued to support household spending, and the savings rate has moved below its pre-pandemic level, reflecting strong spending. It is interesting that despite the economy’s strong performance, including strong consumer spending, until recently surveys of consumers indicated that most people were not very happy about the economy. I believe that partly reflects the fact that even though inflation has been coming down and wage gains have been high, many people’s wages haven’t kept up with inflation. When inflation persists at levels above our goal of price stability, the price level is moving up faster than we would like, and households and businesses have to pay those higher-than-desired prices. With inflation moving down, wages adjusted for inflation have begun to move up, and this is helping to close the gap between the cumulative increase in inflation and the cumulative increase in wages.1 This may be partly why consumers are feeling better about the economy.\n\nI expect household spending to moderate somewhat this year. In the wake of high prices, many families, especially those with lower incomes, have spent the savings accumulated during the pandemic. There has been an uptick in credit card debt, suggesting that some households have exhausted their ready cash balances. Delinquencies on consumer loans have also edged up, although they are still at low levels.\n\nTighter financial conditions have restrained investment in housing and business spending. Businesses slowed their spending on equipment and software last year, and it is expected to continue to moderate given restrictive credit conditions. The regional manufacturing surveys from the Federal Reserve Banks and the national ISM survey indicate weaker manufacturing activity. Fourth District manufacturers tell us that their order backlogs are diminishing. In the housing market, residential investment declined in 2022 and was flat last year. Sales of existing homes are at low levels, but sales of new single-family homes were fairly resilient given the longer-term shortage of available housing. The shortfall in housing supply has kept home prices relatively high, but rents, especially for new tenants, have moved down and that should lead to continued tempering of inflation in housing services.\n\nLast Friday’s labor market report for January shows that the labor market has been remarkably resilient. Payroll job growth rose by about 350 thousand jobs in January. Even if some of that reflects seasonal adjustment issues, it was an unexpectedly strong reading, and the job numbers for October, November, and December were revised up. The unemployment rate has been 3.7 percent over the past three months, near a 50-year low. This is very strong performance. Other indicators point to some moderation in the labor market. Our contacts tell us that, except for the healthcare sector, it is easier to hire than it was a year ago and that they are getting more applicants per job opening. The pace of job quits has also declined since peaking in 2022. Now, workers are quitting jobs at about the same pace as before the pandemic and the number of job openings has been declining. There are now about 1.5 openings per unemployed worker. This is above the level we saw in 2019, another period of strong labor market conditions, but it has come down a lot since March 2022 when we began to tighten monetary policy.2 And on the supply side, as I mentioned, the labor force participation rate for workers aged 25 to 54 has normalized.\n\nAs the demand for and the supply of workers have started to come into better balance, wage growth has moderated. Firms in our District are expecting wage increases to average about 4 percent this year, down from 5 percent a year ago, but still above pre-pandemic levels. The employment cost index rose at an annualized rate of 3-1/2 percent over the last three months of 2023, down from about 4-3/4 percent in the first quarter of last year. And the gap between the wages of job switchers and job stayers in the Atlanta Fed’s Wage Growth Tracker narrowed last year to about its average over 2015 to 2019, another sign that the labor market is coming into better balance.3\n\nCurrent estimates of trend productivity growth suggest that the current level of wage growth is still a bit above the level consistent with 2 percent inflation. But the strong recent readings on productivity raise the possibility that trend productivity growth has moved higher than it was before the pandemic. The scarcity of workers during the pandemic gave firms a great incentive to do more with fewer workers and many invested in automation. New technologies such as generative AI hold the promise of increasing productivity over the medium to longer run. If so, then wages would be able to rise at a faster rate and still be consistent with price stability. At this point, though, I suspect we will see further moderation of wage growth, with a gradual slowing in job growth and an uptick in the unemployment rate over the year from its very low level.\n\nInflation\n\nWhile inflation is still above the Fed’s goal of 2 percent, the news on inflation is encouraging. Inflation moved down faster than expected last year even as the economy remained strong. Measured year-over-year, as of December, total PCE inflation is 2.6 percent and core PCE inflation is 2.9 percent. Over the past six months, the levels are even lower. Other measures of inflation, including the median and trimmed-mean measures, have also moved down from their peaks. Retailers in the Fourth District say that consumers are more price-sensitive than they have been. Many of our contacts across sectors have noted that after making frequent price adjustments over the past two years, they have reverted to their usual pre-pandemic practice of setting prices once a year, a sign of easing price pressures.\n\nThe largest declines in inflation have come in goods prices. In fact, core goods prices have been declining, as they were before the pandemic. Inflation in housing services, measured by rents and the imputed rents for owner-occupied housing, and inflation in core services excluding housing, which makes up about half of the consumption basket, have eased less but have improved over time.\n\nThere are reasons to be cautious in assuming that last year’s rapid pace of disinflation will be maintained as inflation gets closer to the 2 percent goal. While restrictive monetary policy has played an important role in moving inflation down, supply-side adjustments were also important. Now that pressures on supply chains are approaching normal and the labor market is coming into better balance, we should not count on as much help from the supply side as we saw last year.\n\nWhile inflation may prove to be more persistent this year, my baseline forecast is that under appropriate monetary policy, inflation will continue to move down over time to our 2 percent goal. Anchored inflation expectations are an important component of that forecast. Medium- and longer-term inflation expectations remain reasonably well-anchored in a range consistent with the Fed’s goal of 2 percent inflation. One-year-ahead inflation expectations from the University of Michigan and New York Fed surveys have also moved down, although they are still about a quarter to a half percentage point, respectively, above their 2019 averages. Continued progress on inflation will help ensure that these expectations move down to our goal. And that progress depends on appropriate monetary policy.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nAt its meeting last week, the FOMC decided to maintain the target range of the fed funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent and to continue running off the Fed’s securities holdings. The FOMC judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance, but it remains highly attentive to inflation risks. The FOMC does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.\n\nIn making its monetary policy decisions, the FOMC is always guided by its strong commitment to achieving its congressionally mandated goals of price stability and maximum employment. When we began this tightening cycle, inflation was far above our goal and labor markets were strong. So it was clear we needed to focus on the price stability part of our mandate. Now, with inflation moving closer to our goal, we need to balance the risks to achieving both sides of our dual mandate when determining the appropriate stance of policy.\n\nIt would be a mistake to move rates down too soon or too quickly without sufficient evidence that inflation was on a sustainable and timely path back to 2 percent. Doing so would undermine all of the good work that has gone into getting inflation to this point. On the other hand, if year-ahead inflation expectations continue to decline, maintaining the current level of the nominal fed funds rate for too long would effectively be a tightening in our policy stance, which would pose an increasing risk to the maximum employment part of our mandate.\n\nRisk management will be the hallmark of monetary policy decisions going forward. Our job is to calibrate monetary policy to the evolving outlook and risks around the outlook so that inflation returns sustainably to our 2 percent goal and labor markets remain healthy. My baseline forecast is that output and employment will moderate this year and inflation will continue to move closer to our 2 percent goal over time. But there are a number of risks around this forecast. Heightened geopolitical tensions have potential implications for financial markets, oil prices, and global demand and supply. A continued easing in financial conditions could spur activity, leading once again to imbalances that fuel inflation. The stress generated by the bank failures last March has subsided. Many banks have diversified their sources of liquidity, making them less vulnerable. But stress could come again to banks that continue to rely on uninsured deposits for their funding while having sizable exposures to CRE assets that will need to be repriced at higher interest rates.\n\nMonetary policy transmits to the broader economy by affecting overall financial conditions, but the magnitude, speed, and duration with which it affects the economy vary with the nature of the shocks that have hit the economy and other aspects of the economic environment. So while labor markets are currently strong and are expected to only gradually moderate, we need to remain attentive to the possibility that conditions could deteriorate faster than expected. On the other hand, the strong output and employment growth could be an indication that the neutral rate of interest, which rose during the pandemic, might remain high, which would mean restrictive policy may be needed for longer to achieve our goals of price stability and maximum employment.\n\nMonetary policy is in a good place from which to assess and respond to these risks to the outlook. The current strength in labor market conditions and the strong spending data give us the opportunity to keep the nominal funds rate at its current level while we gather more evidence that inflation truly is on a sustainable and timely path back to 2 percent. This is better than finding ourselves in a situation where we begin easing too soon, undo some of the progress we have made on inflation, potentially destabilize inflation expectations, and then have to reverse course. If the economy evolves as expected, I think we will gain that confidence later this year, and then we can begin moving rates down. My base case is that we will do so at a gradual pace so that we can continue to manage the risks to both sides of our mandate. Of course, if downside risks materialize, we would have the opportunity to move rates down more quickly, just as we raised rates more aggressively than usual to combat rising inflation. Or if inflation appears to be stalling at a level above our goal, we would have the opportunity to maintain a restrictive stance for longer. Our policy actions will depend on how the economy and the risks evolve. When our goals of price stability and maximum employment are achieved, the economy will be in an even better place than where it is today.\n\nOperating Framework\n\nLet me conclude with some remarks about the Fed’s balance sheet. As Chair Jay Powell indicated at his press briefing last week, the FOMC will be discussing reducing the pace of the runoff in its balance-sheet assets at its next meeting in March. Since June 2022, the Fed has been allowing maturing Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities to run off its balance sheet at a fairly good clip according to the plan announced in May 2022. The Fed’s security holdings total about $7 trillion and have declined by about $1.3 trillion since the runoff began.\n\nWe are implementing monetary policy via an ample reserves operating regime in which reserve levels are ample enough that control over the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates is executed primarily through setting the Fed’s administered rates: the interest rate paid on bank reserves, the interest rate offered on overnight reverse repurchase agreements (ON RRPs), and the primary credit rate on discount window loans. Under this framework, active management of the supply of reserves is not needed. As assets run off our balance sheet, Fed liabilities move down. So far, the balance-sheet runoff has resulted in a reduction in ON RRPs, with balances currently under $575 billion, rather than a reduction in reserves. In aggregate, reserve balances are about $3.5 trillion, which is about 15 percent of banking system assets.\n\nWhat constitutes an ample level of reserves is uncertain. It depends on the banking sector’s demand for reserves, as well as the distribution of that demand across institutions, which will evolve over time. The September Senior Financial Officer Survey4 indicated that for most banks, their reserve levels are above their preferred level of reserves, and money market rates and spreads suggest little in the way of funding pressures. And the Fed’s Standing Repo Facility provides a backstop against such pressures. So the current level and distribution of reserves are more than ample. But as balance-sheet runoff continues and ON RRP volume reaches a minimum level, reserves will begin declining, too, and more redistribution of reserves will need to occur across institutions. As our balance-sheet reduction plan noted, the FOMC will slow and then stop the runoff when reserve balances are somewhat above the level it judges is consistent with ample. This will help ensure that we can continue to reduce our balance sheet to its efficient size for effectively implementing monetary policy and move toward our longer-run goal of holding primarily Treasury securities, thereby minimizing the allocation of credit across sectors of the economy. I note that the runoff pace pertains to how we implement monetary policy and not to the stance of monetary policy. Our main tool of monetary policy is the fed funds rate target, and balance-sheet runoff can continue even after we begin to lower the funds rate.\n\nThis concludes my prepared remarks. Thank you for your attention. I look forward to our discussion."

            "content": "I thank Doug Evanoff and the George G. Kaufman Center for Financial Policy Studies at Loyola University Chicago for inviting me to speak today. It is a particular honor to be part of a program organized by the Kaufman Center. As a researcher working on banking issues, I had the great opportunity to meet George Kaufman early in my career. He was generous with his advice about how to establish a productive research agenda and the importance of participating in conferences like this one. Even though I was not one of his students, George was a role model who inspired me and other researchers to do their best work to help further the safety and soundness of the banking system and foster financial stability.\n\nToday I will speak about financial system resilience, its interactions with monetary policy in the context of today’s economy, and some recommendations for increasing the resilience of the banking system. The views I present will be my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nIn less than two decades, the world has experienced two historically deep negative shocks to the global economy and financial system. While their causes were different, the global financial crisis of 2008 and the COVID-19 pandemic that hit in 2020 each necessitated the intervention of central banks in ways not contemplated in earlier decades. This spring, the Fed was required to intervene again to address stresses in the banking system that were precipitated by the failures of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank. This stress episode was a painful reminder that whether we are operating in a low-interest-rate environment or in a high-interest-rate environment, financial system vulnerabilities can lead to adverse shocks being propagated across the financial system and sometimes very quickly. The episode also underscored that to promote financial system resilience, financial institutions must properly manage risks and supervisors must effectively monitor risks. In the wake of the SVB failure, the Federal Reserve is currently evaluating and taking appropriate steps to improve its supervision, including its speed, force, and agility.1 An underlying factor in SVB’s failure was the bank’s poor management of interest rate risk. This poor management was revealed as the Fed raised interest rates in response to very high inflation in the aftermath of the pandemic.\n\nThe Economy\n\nAlthough the pandemic is over, in many ways its effects are still with us. The changes in household and business spending patterns, workforce participation, housing demand, and supply chains, all of which arose during the pandemic, are in many ways still shaping the economy.\n\nThese changes led to a situation in which demand in both product markets and labor markets became out of balance with supply in those markets. These imbalances occurred in an environment of accommodative fiscal and monetary policy, which helped to sustain the significant increase in inflation that started in 2021. In 2022, headline inflation reached levels not seen in 40 years, running 7 to 9 percent, depending on the measure.\n\nTo combat high inflation, the Fed has tightened monetary policy, raising the fed funds rate, starting in March 2022, by a cumulative 5-1/4 percentage points. We are also reducing the size of the Fed’s balance sheet by allowing assets to roll off in a systematic way according to the plan announced in May 2022. This balance-sheet reduction is also firming the stance of monetary policy through its effect on the term premium on long-term bond yields.\n\nThe tightening of monetary policy has led to a broader tightening in financial conditions, which has been transmitting through the economy, helping to moderate demand. At the same time, supply conditions have improved. Economic activity and employment growth have slowed, although they have remained more resilient than most forecasters, including FOMC participants, had expected earlier this year.\n\nInflation has been running well above the Fed’s goal for more than two years. While it is still above our 2 percent goal, there has been discernible progress on inflation even while the overall economy has remained relatively strong. It will take some time to get inflation back down to 2 percent, but the FOMC is committed to doing so. Monetary policy is in a good place for policymakers to assess incoming information on the economy and financial conditions and judge whether policy is well calibrated to ensure that inflation is on a timely path back to 2 percent. Whether the fed funds rate needs to go higher than its current level and for how long policy needs to remain restrictive will depend importantly on whether the economy is evolving as expected, how the risks are changing, and the progress being made on our dual mandate goals of price stability and maximum employment.\n\nWe are operating in an uncertain economic environment. The Israel-Hamas war is a human tragedy, as is the ongoing war in Ukraine. Heightened geopolitical tensions pose risks to the medium-run outlook, with implications for financial markets, oil prices, and global demand. The slowdown in the Chinese economy also poses a risk to the outlook.\n\nAs the FOMC has communicated, two important considerations for calibrating monetary policy going forward are how much of the past tightening is yet to transmit through the economy and how restrictive monetary policy is. There is some uncertainty around both of these. Monetary policy transmits to the broader economy by affecting overall financial conditions, but the magnitude, speed, and duration with which it affects the economy vary with the nature of the shocks that have hit the economy and other aspects of the economic environment.2 While the policy stance is currently widely viewed as restrictive, the resilience the economy has shown in the face of high interest rates has underscored the difficulty of knowing precisely how restrictive policy is partly because of the uncertainty about the level of the neutral real interest rate, so-called r-star.\n\nWhen policymakers are confronted with uncertainty, scenario analysis can be a helpful guide. In an uncertain economic environment, it is important to look at various models and various scenarios, because the economy could evolve quite a bit differently than expected. If it does, monetary policy will need to be nimble and respond appropriately to the evolving outlook and to the risks to achieving both parts of our dual mandate. I believe the current level of the funds rate positions us well to do that.\n\nFinancial System Vulnerabilities\n\nThe stress in the banking industry generated by the bank failures in March has subsided, but the underlying conditions and causes of this stress remain. As interest rates began rising in 2022, funding risks for banks increased and they remain elevated.\n\nMany banks are holding longer-term securities, which if they had to be sold and marked-to-market would result in losses. Some of these banks have sizable exposure to the segments of commercial real estate that are particularly under stress, such as office buildings, and over the next year many of the CRE assets at banks will need to be refinanced at higher interest rates.\n\nAt some banks, the declines in the fair value of fixed-rate assets have been large relative to their regulatory capital levels, especially for some large but non-globally-systemically-important banks and some regional banks. A portion of these banks have above-average reliance on uninsured deposits, making them particularly vulnerable to shocks.\n\nOf course, it isn’t only banks that are vulnerable to shocks. After the bank failures this spring, some money market funds also experienced high redemptions. Reforms adopted by the SEC in July aim to increase the resilience of money market funds, but they have not yet been put to the test.3\n\nFinancial System Resilience\n\nIn times of banking and financial stress, regulators find themselves with a time-inconsistency problem. Forcing one bank to take actions to raise capital or address other risk-management concerns during a period of stress could precipitate a widespread reevaluation of the banking industry by investors and depositors resulting in a systemic event. In such cases, regulators and supervisors might lean toward forbearance even if this creates bad incentives for financial institutions to manage risks in the future.\n\nAvoiding this potential bias requires fostering a financial system that is resilient to shocks across the business and financial cycles. Financial system resilience supports the attainment of our macroeconomic goals. A resilient financial system is one in which banks may tighten their credit standards but they are able to continue lending to creditworthy businesses and households during economic downturns, financial markets are able to continue intermediating in an orderly fashion during periods of stress, and monetary policy continues to transmit to the broader economy and is not disrupted by financial system stresses.\n\nIncreased resilience has the added benefit of limiting the times in which monetary policy and financial stability goals come into conflict. Usually, these goals are complementary. An unstable financial system can propagate adverse macroeconomic shocks over broad economic sectors and over time to the detriment of macroeconomic stability. In the other direction, well-formulated and well-communicated monetary policy supports financial stability by allowing households, firms, and financial institutions to make better investment, saving, borrowing, and lending decisions, and price stability eliminates a source of asset-price volatility.\n\nBut there may be times when the goals come into conflict. Since monetary policy actions affect financial conditions, they can also affect financial stability risks. For example, a prolonged period of very low interest rates may contribute to financial vulnerabilities by spurring search-for-yield behavior, encouraging higher debt levels, or eroding lending standards. Similarly, a period of rapidly tightening financial conditions raises the risk of increased volatility, market dysfunction, and the potential that a shock could be amplified by known vulnerabilities in the financial system or reveal previously unknown vulnerabilities, including high levels of leverage. This means that, at times, policymakers may be faced with intertemporal tradeoffs between their monetary policy and financial stability policy goals, and these tradeoffs will vary over the business and credit cycles.\n\nThe question is how best to limit these tradeoffs. A general consensus has emerged that it is better to use supervisory, regulatory, and macroprudential tools to address financial stability concerns and monetary policy tools to address macroeconomic stability concerns. This is a desirable separation; indeed, it is optimal in some theoretical models. Increased financial system resilience will help limit the times this separation cannot be maintained.\n\nIn March, financial stability tools were used to address stresses in the banking system. This allowed the Fed to continue to use its monetary policy tools for macroeconomic purposes, and we proceeded with an increase in the federal funds rate at our March meeting. But those financial stability tools involved regulators invoking the systemic risk exception and implementing a new lending facility.4\n\nIncreasing the overall resilience of the financial system would diminish the need for the Fed and other regulators to have to step in, whether it be to reduce market dysfunction by buying Treasury assets, as we had to do in October 2019 and March 2020, or having to set up special facilities to serve as the lender of last resort, actions that have the potential to change us into the lender of first resort.\n\nRecommended Steps to Increase the Resilience of the Banking System\n\nThe stresses in the banking system earlier this year underscored the challenge of ensuring that financial institutions have enough capital when their assets decline in value. Cyclical macroprudential tools aim to solve this problem by mitigating the systemic risk that can build up over the business cycle. In the U.S., these tools are basically limited to the countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) and the stress test. The CCyB is intended to require banks to hold more capital during periods of high credit growth, which often coincides with the accumulation of system-wide risk.\n\nHowever, the lead times needed to use this tool limit its effectiveness in addressing vulnerabilities that may develop rapidly or that can be detected only after they are far along. This suggests the need to raise the buffer in good times before we see the vulnerabilities, yet we have never raised the CCyB above zero in the U.S.\n\nTo make the CCyB more effective and time consistent, it should be recalibrated to be at a positive level in normal times, and then raised when credit growth moves up and lowered when credit growth moves down based on a systematic rule. In my view, being systematic about financial stability policy, including supervision and regulation, is perhaps even more important than it is for monetary policy because of the important role played by incentives and asymmetric information in financial markets and institutions. Applying policy systematically could help tame some of the moral hazard and time-inconsistency problems that policymakers face when promoting financial resilience.5\n\nWith respect to the other main macroprudential tool, I believe that the current stress tests should be redesigned with an eye to making them a more effective countercyclical capital tool so that banks would need to build up their capital buffers when they are better able to do so.\n\nUntil we create more effective macroprudential tools and show that we are willing to use them, we should set standards for the through-the-cycle structural resilience tools, including capital and liquidity requirements, somewhat higher than they otherwise would be. I view the Basel III endgame capital proposal as aligned with this view.6\n\nBanks’ capital positions affect their lending, which in turn affects the macroeconomy. Research indicates that well-capitalized banks tend to lend more than poorly capitalized ones, to grow their loan and deposit market shares during crises by purchasing assets from less well-capitalized banks,7 and to have more access to market funding during downturns than do less capitalized banks.8 A well-capitalized banking system is less likely to amplify negative macroeconomic shocks. This is not to say that ever-increasing levels of required capital would be optimal. There would come a point where the requirement would so thwart risk-taking and beneficial innovation that it would undermine longer-run economic growth.9 Indeed, a recent research paper presents a theoretical model in which the distribution of capital across banks and not just the level determines the socially optimal capital structure for the banking system.10 But in my view, we are still below the level of capital where increasing it would be counterproductive.\n\nThe stresses in the banking system earlier this year point to other reforms that should be considered. First, much of bank regulation is tied to book values instead of market values. Moving toward market-value accounting for more of a bank’s balance sheet and basing more of bank regulation on market values would help align regulation and supervision with market forces. Even if regulations are not changed, having supervisors pay more attention to market values would likely spur earlier actions to ensure adequate risk management at banks and would help focus supervisory attention on areas of highest vulnerability.11\n\nSecond, much of bank regulation aims to lower the probability of financial system instability. But we should also take steps to reduce the costs imposed on the rest of the economy when a shock hits the financial system. Resilience is a combination of both of these. More effort needs to be expended on creating an effective, credible, and time-consistent bank resolution mechanism. If regulators were able to confidently resolve systemically important financial institutions in a way that avoids causing system-wide instability, they would be in a much better position when the inevitable shock hits the financial system.\n\nThird, while much regulation and supervision focuses on credit risk, more attention should be given to liquidity risk and interest rate risk. SVB lost over $40 billion of deposits, about one-quarter of its total deposits, in a day, showing that money can flow out of a bank much more quickly than ever imagined. As lender of last resort, the Federal Reserve System promotes financial stability by lending against good collateral to healthy banks facing temporary liquidity problems. Currently, the Reserve Banks are encouraging eligible financial institutions to ensure that they have the legal agreements and collateral in place and have tested their ability to use the discount window in a timely way should the need arise. Testing at this time is not mandatory, but requiring such testing as part of sound liquidity management is worth considering, as is tightening the liquidity coverage ratio requirement so that banks have to hold higher levels of liquid assets to cover potential cash outflows. Another idea worth consideration is requiring banks to post collateral in proportion to their short-term funding, so they would be ready to borrow at the discount window should that funding start to run.\n\nI have been speaking mostly about banks, but we also need to take steps to increase the structural resilience of nonbank financial firms and markets, ensure that the financial system’s supervisory and regulatory structure keeps pace with innovations, and improve our visibility in the nonbank financial sector. Not having the data needed to adequately measure the risks and vulnerabilities in a particular segment of the financial system should not lure us into thinking that the vulnerabilities are small or don’t exist. For example, there is a general lack of transparency and lack of verifiable information around the assets backing many stablecoins, leading to the possibility of sharp changes in prices and substantial losses for their investors. Stablecoins are one example, but there are several parts of the financial system on which we do not have sufficient data to make a clear assessment of the risks. This includes data on central counterparties’ member concentrations, principal trading firms, and nonbank funders. The fact that we can’t put the risks on a dashboard doesn’t mean the risks don’t exist. The Financial Stability Board has recognized the need to better understand the interconnections between bank and nonbank intermediation, the amplification of shocks, and the overall resilience of the nonbank financial sector.12\n\nCyber resilience is also an area that requires continued focus. All aspects of the financial system, including markets, nonbanks, and banks, are subject to cyber risk and to operational risks more generally. These are not potential risks; these risks are actually being realized. Continued supervisory focus on ensuring that financial institutions are making the investments needed to prevent cyber incidents and the investments needed to ensure they can recover in a timely way when the inevitable cyber event occurs is very important, especially in the current environment when bank profits are under pressure and banks are taking actions to cut costs.\n\nAs with monetary policy, scenario analysis can play an important role in understanding the financial system’s vulnerabilities to various shocks. Looking at various stress scenarios involving relevant risks can make policymakers better prepared for what could happen even if it is not viewed as the most likely situation at the time. And the more uncertain the environment, the wider the set of possible scenarios that should be examined.\n\nIt is important to remember that in a situation of significantly increasing financial stability risks, the blurring between financial stability goals and monetary policy goals increases as well: if the risks to financial stability are sufficiently great, achieving our dual mandate monetary policy goals would also be in jeopardy over the medium run. More work needs to be done to determine how best to handle the nexus between monetary policy and financial stability. The FOMC’s current statement on its monetary policy strategy says that “sustainably achieving maximum employment and price stability depends on a stable financial system” and that the FOMC’s monetary policy decisions do reflect its “assessments of the balance of risks, including risks to the financial system that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals.”13 I would like the FOMC’s next framework review, which Chair Jay Powell has recently indicated will start in the latter half of 2024,14 to develop that further. The revised statement should clarify the strategy for handling the interactions between monetary policy and financial stability policy, shedding more light on how the FOMC takes into account the potential impact of monetary policy on financial stability risks and how those risks influence the Committee’s monetary policy decisions.\n\nFinally, I would also like to encourage the Kaufman Center to continue furthering research on the financial system and its role in promoting economic growth and financial stability. Good policymaking is informed by good research. Advances in research will help ensure that our financial system remains resilient, which is fundamental for a strong economy."

            "content": "I thank the Shadow Open Market Committee for inviting me to speak today. The SOMC is known for fostering an active exchange of diverse views on the economy and monetary policy, with the aim of contributing to better policy decisions. I believe robust policy discussions and deliberations are very constructive, and I am looking forward to the question-and-answer portion of this session. To help frame that discussion, let me start with a review of economic developments and my perspectives on monetary policy. The views I present will be my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nJane Austen is often (erroneously) credited with having written: “It isn’t what we say or think that defines us, but what we do.” That sentiment is only partially true in monetary policymaking. It is true in the sense that a central bank will lose its credibility with the public if it merely says it is committed to 2 percent inflation but does not take action to bring high inflation down. In this case, high inflation could become embedded in people’s view of the economy and affect their behavior in ways inconsistent with price stability, making it much harder for the central bank to achieve its policy goals. But the quote does not fully apply to monetary policymaking because how and what policymakers communicate are very important in aligning the public’s expectations with policy actions, and this alignment can make these actions more effective.\n\nThe FOMC’s policy actions and communications have contributed to discernible progress on inflation. As we calibrate policy to finish the job, both word and deed will continue to be important. This is particularly true because the economic environment is quite uncertain. The events in the Middle East are still unfolding, adding uncertainty to what was already an uncertain geopolitical environment. The Israel-Hamas War is a human tragedy. It is too soon to determine the full economic and financial market ramifications of the war for the global economy, but they will need to be considered as we chart the future path of monetary policy to achieve our dual mandate goals.\n\nOver the past three years, the pandemic and its aftermath have been a major source of uncertainty. When the pandemic hit, the economy shut down in March 2020, and fiscal and monetary policymakers took aggressive actions to support households and businesses, ensuring that credit continued to flow and limiting lasting damage to the economy. When public health statistics began to improve in May 2020, the economy began to reopen. But it was not business as usual. Spending patterns had shifted from services to goods early in the pandemic and have only gradually been shifting back to pre-pandemic trends. Many people decided to leave the workforce when the pandemic hit and only gradually decided to rejoin. The participation rate of workers between the ages of 25 and 54 has now surpassed what it was in 2019, but the overall participation rate is still below its pre-pandemic level. Remote work became much more common. This led to changes in the demand for housing, and sales of new and existing single-family homes surged in 2020 and 2021. In addition, supply chains were disrupted, making it much harder for firms to keep up with the demand for their products.\n\nThe changes in spending patterns, workforce participation, housing demand, and supply chains that arose during the pandemic are in many ways still shaping the economy. They led to a situation in which demand in both product markets and labor markets became out of balance with supply. Those imbalances occurred in an environment of accommodative fiscal and monetary policy, which helped to sustain the significant increase in inflation that started in 2021. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, another ongoing human tragedy, added to inflationary pressures, spurring higher prices for oil, food, and other commodities. In 2022, headline inflation reached levels not seen in 40 years, running 7 to 9 percent, depending on the measure.\n\nEconomic Developments in Response to Monetary Policy\n\nWhen inflation began moving up in April 2021, the FOMC communicated in its post-meeting statements that elevated inflation largely reflected factors that the Committee expected would be transitory. By December 2021, the FOMC’s view had changed and it no longer referred to inflation as transitory. In January 2022, the FOMC said that with inflation well above 2 percent and a strong labor market, the Committee expected it would soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate. Financial conditions tightened in reaction to this forward guidance. Following through on its guidance, the Fed took action by raising the fed funds rate by 25 basis points in March 2022 and has now raised the fed funds rate by a cumulative 5-1/4 percentage points. We are also reducing the size of the Fed’s balance sheet by allowing assets to roll off in a systematic way according to the plan announced in May 2022. This balance-sheet reduction is also firming the stance of monetary policy through its effect on the term premium on long-term bond yields.\n\nThe tightening of monetary policy has led to a broader tightening in financial conditions and, in response, aggregate demand has begun to moderate. At the same time, supply chain disruptions have improved and imbalances between supply and demand are easing. While demand has moderated, economic activity has been considerably more resilient than most forecasters, including FOMC participants, were expecting. Consumer spending makes up about 70 percent of GDP. It has been increasing at a solid pace, supported by strong income growth and the still-elevated savings accumulated during the pandemic. Bankers in the Fourth District report there has been an uptick in usage of home equity lines of credit and credit card debt, suggesting that some households have exhausted ready balances. Delinquencies on consumer loans have also edged up, although they are still at historically low levels. As savings balances normalize and credit conditions remain restrictive, consumer spending is expected to moderate.\n\nBusinesses have slowed their spending on equipment and software this year, and it is expected to continue to moderate given restrictive credit conditions. In the housing market, activity has slowed but the longer-term shortage of available housing has meant less of a slowdown than one would have expected given that the 30-year mortgage rate is near 8 percent. The shortfall in housing supply has kept rents and house prices high.\n\nIn response to the evolving picture, FOMC participants’ projections of economic growth this year were revised up in September.1 Earlier in the year, FOMC participants projected that growth would be well below trend in 2023. In September, the median projection was that growth will be a bit over 2 percent, which is somewhat above trend. Still, growth is expected to slow to below trend next year as tighter credit and financial conditions and waning fiscal support for households weigh on spending.\n\nLabor market conditions also paint a picture of moderation and resilience. Firms have reduced their job postings and more people are coming back into the job market. Firms report it is easier to find the workers they need. Still, labor market conditions remain quite strong. The unemployment rate is low, at 3.8 percent. Job growth has slowed over the course of the year, but the strong reading in September and revisions to the July and August data suggest the slowdown has been less than once thought. Payroll gains averaged about 300 thousand per month over the first three months of the year compared with about 270 thousand per month on average over July through September. Restrictive financial conditions should help to continue to moderate labor demand, bringing demand into better balance with supply. The unemployment rate is likely to move up somewhat as this rebalancing occurs, but I expect overall labor market conditions to remain solid.\n\nDespite strong job growth in September, wage pressures are easing by some measures. Our business contacts expect wage increases to be less over the coming year than last year, except for workers with hard-to-find skills. But at 4 percent, expected wage increases are higher than before the pandemic and well above the level consistent with 2 percent inflation, based on current estimates of trend productivity growth. Wage-price dynamics can be quite complicated. An open question is whether inflation leads wage growth or whether it is the other way around. One wage Phillips curve model from the Cleveland Fed suggests that inflation leads wage growth, with the model attributing much of the high wage growth since the pandemic to the passthrough of higher inflation.2 On the other hand, other research from the Cleveland Fed that uses data from our business survey finds that firms are highly attuned to wage costs when setting prices.3 My conclusion is that we need to continue monitoring both wages and prices to assess whether inflation is moving down in a sustainable and timely way to our longer-run goal of 2 percent.\n\nInflation\n\nInflation has been running well above the Fed’s goal for more than two years, and it is still too high. That said, it is important to acknowledge the discernible progress that has been made on inflation even while the overall economy has remained relatively strong. As of August, the headline PCE inflation rate is running at 3-1/2 percent, which is half of its peak rate in June of last year. The underlying measures of inflation, including the core, median, and trimmed-mean measures, have also moved down from their peaks. The progress is easier to see when you look at the price changes over shorter time horizons, such as three-month or six-month annualized inflation rates. But the CPI report for September is a reminder that we cannot count on the progress continuing at the same good pace we have seen in recent months. The larger declines in inflation have come in goods prices. Inflation in housing services, measured by rents and the imputed rents for owner-occupied housing, has begun to come down, but the recent CPI inflation report suggests that the adjustment could be gradual. The most stubborn part of the index has been inflation in core services excluding housing. This component, which makes up about half of the consumption basket, has shown little improvement over time.\n\nIn my view, it is important to guard against becoming complacent if it takes longer and longer to achieve the Fed’s 2 percent goal. When inflation persists at levels above our goal of price stability, the price level is moving up faster than we would like and households and businesses are having to pay those higher-than-desired prices. In addition, high inflation distorts investment decisions, imposing longer-run costs on the economy.4 In my view, the risks to the inflation forecast remain tilted to the upside. Oil prices are up, on net, since July and may pass through to other core prices. In addition, gasoline prices are higher than at the start of the year and are particularly prominent for households that have to fill up their cars or trucks once or twice a week. Rising gasoline prices could begin to make consumers think inflation will be rising again. I don’t expect that this is going to move inflation back up to the very high levels we saw last year, but it could stall the progress we have seen over the past few months.\n\nA distinguishing feature of this high-inflation episode compared with those in the 1970s and early 1980s has been the fact that despite high inflation rates, medium- and longer-term inflation expectations have remained reasonably well-anchored in a range consistent with the Fed’s goal of 2 percent inflation. There could be several reasons for this, but one likely factor is that the Fed now has an explicit numerical longer-term inflation goal of 2 percent. In addition, over this episode, we have communicated our commitment to achieving this goal, and we have taken actions to support this commitment. Our communications have been an important policy tool, reinforcing the actions we have taken and making them more effective by anchoring inflation expectations. Ensuring that the public views the commitment as credible can reduce the costs of disinflation. Indeed, research indicates that the disinflation that then-Fed Chair Paul Volcker had to engineer in the 1980s was costly in terms of cumulative output losses not only because the Fed had to tighten monetary policy enough to get inflation down from high levels, but also because the Fed had to make the public understand that it would not abandon its commitment to price stability as inflation started to come down. Regaining credibility was important in moving the public’s expectations about inflation down with inflation.5 During the current episode of high inflation, in addition to communicating our commitment to price stability, we have aligned our policy actions with that commitment. Appropriate words and deeds will continue to be crucial as we finish the job. This brings me to monetary policy.\n\nMonetary Policy Calibration\n\nAt its September meeting, the FOMC decided to maintain the target range of the fed funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent and to continue to reduce the Fed’s securities holdings. In determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate, the FOMC will be assessing incoming economic and financial developments, as well as the cumulative effects of the tightening done so far, since we know that monetary policy affects the economy with a lag. The economic projections released by the FOMC in September indicated that the median participant thought that another rate increase would be appropriate this year and that monetary policy would likely have to be held sufficiently restrictive for a while in order to get inflation back down to 2 percent. This is consistent with my own reading of economic conditions, the outlook, and the risks to the outlook.\n\nBut whether the fed funds rate needs to go higher than its current level and for how long policy needs to remain restrictive will depend importantly on how the economy evolves relative to the outlook and how the risks are changing. To guide my policy views, I will be carefully assessing incoming evidence to determine whether the economy is evolving as expected. Risk management considerations are becoming increasingly important as we set monetary policy in a way that balances the costs over time of potentially over-tightening vs. under-tightening monetary policy. Tightening too much would slow the economy more than necessary and entail higher costs than needed to get inflation back to our goal. Tightening too little would allow high inflation to persist, with short- and long-run consequences, and would necessitate a much longer and more costly journey back to price stability.\n\nThere is always uncertainty around the outlook, but uncertainty is higher in the current environment. In addition to upside risks to inflation, geopolitical uncertainty has risen, with implications for financial markets, oil prices, and global demand. The slowdown in the Chinese economy, the possibility of an extended UAW strike, and the potential for a government shutdown later this year all pose some risks around the outlook. The structural changes to the economy since the pandemic, including changes to the labor market and supply chains, also complicate the picture. Indeed, our models are trained on past data, but the pandemic was unprecedented and that has complicated forecasting. Post-pandemic, it has become even more important to look at several models, examine different scenarios, and collect real-time information from regional contacts to inform policymaking.\n\nAs the FOMC has communicated, two important considerations for calibrating monetary policy going forward are how much of the past tightening is yet to transmit through the economy and how restrictive monetary policy is. Monetary policy transmits to the broader economy by affecting overall financial conditions, but the magnitude, speed, and duration with which it affects the economy vary with the nature of the shocks that have hit the economy and other aspects of the economic environment.6 It is possible that the Fed’s use of forward guidance has sped up the transmission of monetary policy to the broader economy, affecting financial conditions before the actual changes in monetary policy have occurred.7 For example, tightening in financial conditions occurred several months in advance of the first Fed rate increase in March 2022. Other research suggests that even controlling for the increased use of forward guidance and balance-sheet policy, the lag in the effect of monetary policy on inflation shortened in the post-2009 period.8 On the other hand, there is a large volume of outstanding corporate debt and commercial real estate debt that will need to be repriced at higher interest rates over time. This suggests that past changes in monetary policy may be felt for some time to come in the economy. Since the lags vary across cycles, the benchmark against which “shorter” or “longer” is evaluated is not well defined; so a definitive conclusion about the length of the lag in this tightening cycle will remain elusive.\n\nA second policy consideration is the stance of monetary policy. While monetary policy is currently widely viewed as restrictive, the resilience the economy has shown in the face of high interest rates has underscored the difficulty of knowing precisely how restrictive policy is partly because of the uncertainty about the level of the neutral real interest rate, so-called r-star. In economic models, the longer-term neutral real interest rate is determined by the long-run growth rate of consumption and, therefore, output, and is influenced by the trend rate of productivity growth, the growth rate of the labor force, and the demand for safe assets, among other factors. Before the pandemic, estimates showed that the longer-run neutral rate in advanced economies had been declining for more than two decades, reflecting the aging of the population, changes in risk preferences, and slower productivity growth.9 But in the aftermath of the pandemic, estimates of the short-run neutral rate rose; whether the increase will persist is an open question. Projected longer-run fiscal imbalances are unlikely to be sustainable, and the government will need to respond with some combination of increased borrowing, reduced benefits, increased taxes, and program restructuring. In the meantime, higher projected U.S. fiscal deficits, requiring higher government debt issuance, will put upward pressure on the neutral rate. If new technologies like generative AI produce significant productivity gains, this would also put upward pressure on the longer-run neutral rate.10 Countervailing those effects are the continued aging of the population in advanced economies and investor demand for safe assets. I think the jury is still out. I have not yet raised my estimate of the long-run equilibrium interest rate but will consider doing so depending on how the economy evolves.\n\nIn light of the cyclical and structural uncertainties and the need to balance risks, policy decisions will need to be guided by actual progress on our dual mandate goals, in particular, whether the rate of progress we have seen on inflation in recent months is sustained and whether labor market conditions remain healthy as they moderate. Because the outlook and balance of risks can change, policymakers will need to be nimble in order to appropriately calibrate policy in the midst of such changes. This will require us to carefully monitor economic, banking, and financial market developments.\n\nOne such recent development is the tightening in financial conditions since our September FOMC meeting. Restrictive monetary policy is intended to tighten financial conditions, but the increase in the nominal 10-year Treasury yield since the last meeting was larger than expected and reflects several factors. Like the Fed, market participants have revised up their expectations for growth this year. They have also likely taken on board the communications from the FOMC that monetary policy is likely to remain restrictive for some time based on the outlook for inflation and employment. Both of those factors suggest a higher expected path of short-term real interest rates and therefore higher longer-term yields. Rising term premia, the compensation that investors require to hold longer-term debt, have also contributed to the increase in Treasury yields. The New York Fed’s estimate of the term premium on 10-year Treasuries, which had been in negative territory since mid-2021, turned positive toward the end of September.11 The recent focus on the U.S. fiscal situation, which will likely necessitate higher issuance of Treasury debt, likely contributed to the rise in the term premium. One factor that does not appear to have contributed to the rise in yields since September is inflation expectations, which have remained relatively stable. If sustained, the increase in longer-term yields will help to moderate demand, and as one of the financial conditions we monitor, it will be one of the factors I consider when evaluating the appropriate path of monetary policy going forward.\n\nPhases of Monetary Policy and Communications\n\nRegardless of the decision made at our next meeting, if the economy evolves as anticipated, in my view, we are likely near or at a holding point on the funds rate as we accumulate more information on economic and financial developments and assess the effects of the tightening in financial conditions that has already occurred. I think it is useful to think of monetary policy during this tightening cycle in phases, although the shifts from one phase to another depend on the evolution of the economy.\n\nDuring the first phase of this tightening cycle, the monetary policy narrative centered on how fast we should raise the policy rate. We began with a 25-basis-point increase in March 2022, then moved the funds rate up by 50 basis points at our next meeting, and then followed with 75-basis-point increases at each of our next four meetings. We then slowed rate increases, with a 50-basis-point increase at the December 2022 meeting and a 25-basis-point increase at the first meeting of this year. Over this phase, the Committee communicated that it anticipated that ongoing increases in the funds rate target would be appropriate.\n\nAt that point, the policy narrative entered a second phase, which centered on how high rates would have to go. The policy language changed to signal that the FOMC would be assessing the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate. If the economy evolves as expected, I believe we are nearing the end of this phase.\n\nThe narrative would then be entering a third phase focused on how long monetary policy will need to remain restrictive. Getting away from the meeting-to-meeting guessing game of will they or won’t they increase the funds rate would seem to add some beneficial stability allowing firms and financial markets to absorb the increases in the pipeline. But communicating how the FOMC is thinking about the economy and monetary policy in this policy phase will be a challenge because it requires some nuance. The FOMC is committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal, and we would not be content with inflation settling in at a level above our goal. But as we travel the last mile of getting inflation back to 2 percent, the balance of risks to our dual mandate goals will continue to shift and it is important that the public understand that the commitment to price stability doesn’t mean ignoring the maximum employment part of the mandate or deliberately taking actions to drive the economy into recession for the sake of achieving price stability as soon as possible. The balance of risks will change over time, and the Fed will continue to calibrate its policy in pursuit of both goals.\n\nGiven the outlook, I anticipate it will be appropriate to keep the funds rate at its peak for some time. Some commentators have suggested that this will result in a passive tightening of policy as inflation moves down. Essentially, they are measuring the real fed funds rate as the nominal funds rate minus actual inflation, which is backward looking. A better measure is the nominal rate minus expected inflation, which is forward looking. While I expect year-ahead inflation expectations to move down as inflation declines, this may take some time, and maintaining the nominal funds rate in order to achieve that decline in inflation expectations is appropriate. Indeed, the projected decline in inflation is conditioned on maintaining restrictive monetary policy. A failure to do so could jeopardize achieving that decline.\n\nEventually, policy will enter a fourth phase, in which it is appropriate to begin reducing the fed funds rate and moving monetary policy toward a more neutral stance. Given the lags with which monetary policy affects the economy, monetary policymakers will need to be forward looking and begin reducing the funds rate when inflation is still somewhat above our goal. At that point, it will be important for the FOMC to communicate that the Fed is not abandoning its 2 percent target and is not content with inflation remaining persistently above target. Rather, the message will be that the Fed is more confident that inflation is on its way back down to 2 percent so less policy restraint is needed.\n\nLonger term, I believe communications could be more effective if the FOMC’s post-meeting statement provided more information on the Committee’s economic outlook, its view of the risks around the outlook, and its evaluation of progress on its goals. Doing so would give the public a better sense of the FOMC’s reaction function. This would be particularly helpful in uncertain times, like today, when it is important to maintain some policy optionality. Policy decisions should be guided in a systematic way by how the economy is evolving relative to our outlook, as well as the shifting risks around the outlook. But because the economy could evolve differently than expected, we need to preserve some policy optionality. This “systematic optionality” is different from setting monetary policy in a discretionary manner in which the policy reaction function is changing. A fuller post-meeting statement would help the public understand this difference and give them a sense of how the FOMC is likely to react if some of the risks are realized or new risks emerge.\n\nLastly, when uncertainty is high, as it has been during and since the pandemic, scenario analysis, as advocated by SOMC members Mike Bordo, Andy Levin, and Mickey Levy, can be a helpful guide to monetary policymaking and communications.12 The FOMC does look at alternative scenarios and alternative interpretations of intermeeting economic developments as part of our meeting preparations, which can help us avoid “group-think” and be better prepared if the economy evolves differently than anticipated. But recasting our SEP submissions to incorporate participants’ views of potential salient scenarios rather than focusing only on the modal outlook could be quite helpful, especially in uncertain times. I essentially did this with my SEP submissions during the pandemic. In this period, forecasting how the economy would evolve was particularly challenging given the uncertainties about the course of the virus and how households and businesses might respond. Indeed, in March 2020, given the immense uncertainty to the outlook, the FOMC refrained from collecting and publishing the SEP. When the SEP resumed in June 2020, I began formulating my outlook conditional on different scenarios on the path of the pandemic and our success at containing it. This approach gave a clearer picture of my view on the economy as distinct from my views on the course of the disease. A similar type of scenario analysis for different kinds of uncertainty would not be too difficult to incorporate into the SEP, and it could form a basis for policy communications that preserve optionality without suggesting that policy is being set in a discretionary manner.\n\nTo conclude, word and deed are important monetary policy tools. And the Fed will be using both to achieve its dual mandate goals of price stability and maximum employment. This concludes my prepared remarks. Thank you for your attention. I look forward to our discussion."

            "content": "I appreciate the opportunity to present closing remarks at the Inflation: Drivers and Dynamics Conference. The views I present will be my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nLet me start by thanking the organizers at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and the European Central Bank for putting together such a strong program and the ECB for its hospitality. It has been a very productive two days focused on frontier research on inflation. High inflation has been the major challenge facing many central banks over the past two years. Returning the economy to price stability in a sustainable and timely way has driven monetary policy decisions.\n\nThe U.S. Economy\n\nIn the U.S., since early last year, the Federal Reserve has been tightening the stance of monetary policy. We have raised the target range of the federal funds rate by 5-1/4 percentage points. We are also reducing the size of the Fed’s balance sheet by allowing assets to roll off in a systematic way according to the plan announced in May 2022, which also helps to firm the stance of monetary policy. The tightening of monetary policy has led to a broader tightening in financial conditions. Banks, which play an important part in monetary policy transmission, have been tightening their credit standards, making credit less available to businesses and households. In addition, Treasury yields, mortgage rates, and credit spreads have risen.\n\nThe monetary policy actions taken to date are helping to moderate demand in both product and labor markets and to alleviate some of the imbalances that have contributed to price pressures. Real output growth has slowed from its robust pace in 2021. Supply is also adjusting, with disruptions in supply chains having generally improved over time. In the labor market, some progress is being made in bringing demand and supply into better balance, but the job market is still strong. Job growth has slowed and job openings are down, but the unemployment rate is low, at 3.8 percent, and the vacancy-to-unemployment ratio is still above its level during the strong labor market conditions in 2019. Labor supply conditions are helping to rebalance the labor market; the labor market participation rate of workers between the ages of 25 and 54 is above what it was before the pandemic.\n\nProgress continues to be made on inflation, with total PCE inflation down significantly from its peak. Underlying measures of inflation have also improved but less so. Despite high inflation rates, medium- and longer-term inflation expectations remain reasonably well-anchored in a range consistent with the Fed’s goal of 2 percent inflation. Although there has been some progress, inflation remains too high. The FOMC is committed to moving inflation down to 2 percent. The monetary policy questions are whether the current level of the federal funds rate is sufficiently restrictive and how long policy will need to remain restrictive to keep inflation moving down in a sustainable and timely way to our goal of 2 percent. Future policy decisions will be about managing the risks and the intertemporal costs of over-tightening vs. under-tightening monetary policy. This assessment will require close monitoring of economic, banking, and financial market developments and using all of that economic reconnaissance to determine whether the economy is evolving in line with the outlook or not. The outlook will need to be informed not only by the incoming data but also by our models of and understanding of inflation dynamics, which has been the topic of this conference.\n\nInflation Research\n\nThe period of high inflation has highlighted that there are many things we do understand about inflation. In particular, when demand is outpacing supply, in an environment of very accommodative fiscal and monetary policy – the conditions that characterized the economy in 2021 after the pandemic-induced shutdown – inflation will begin to rise and it will remain persistent until monetary policy is recalibrated to moderate demand. Nonetheless, making such assessments in real time is difficult, especially when supply conditions are not stable, and forecasting inflation remains challenging. Indeed, FOMC participants underestimated inflation for much of the high-inflation period. But policymakers are required to make decisions based on the available, albeit limited information.\n\nFurther research is needed on many facets of inflation and inflation dynamics. Since I am in a room full of researchers, I want to highlight some of the questions whose answers would help inform monetary policy decisions. I took the same route when I presented keynote remarks at this conference in 2014, and it turns out that several of the questions I asked are still relevant.1 Don’t be too discouraged: Progress has been made in addressing them. But the period of high inflation and structural changes to the economy during the pandemic and its aftermath have presented new questions and different takes on old questions. Further research will be needed to answer these questions, furthering our understanding of inflation as an aid to monetary policymaking.\n\nResearch Questions\n\nThe first question I asked in 2014 remains relevant: How can we best estimate the underlying trend in inflation?\n\nMonetary policymakers are charged with keeping inflation at its longer-run goal and monetary policy affects the economy with long and variable lags. Both factors mean that policymakers need to be able to forecast inflation over the medium and longer run. So they need a method to separate temporary changes from changes that are more persistent. When the economy reopened after the pandemic-induced shutdown, U.S. monetary policymakers attributed much of the increase in inflation to supply shocks that were expected to be transitory, with inflation expected to return to its low pre-pandemic trend. It took some time and repeated under-forecasts of inflation for policymakers to realize that the conditions for high inflation were in place and that aggressive policy action was required. Better understanding of the factors that affect the medium-run inflation trend and ways to separate temporary changes from changes that are more persistent would have helped to avoid the situation.\n\nSeparating temporary from more persistent factors is challenging to do in real time, not only because some of the inflation data get revised (including the PCE inflation measure that the Fed targets), but also because measured inflation reflects a combination of factors: idiosyncratic factors, broader but temporary macroeconomic factors, and more persistent movements that affect the underlying inflation trend. One approach to estimating the underlying trend is to remove items that are often the sources of temporary movements in inflation. The traditional core measures of inflation in the U.S. exclude the prices of food and energy because they are thought to be very volatile. Another approach recognizes that other components can show more volatility than food and energy and derives measures that exclude components with the most extreme movements each month. The median and trimmed-mean inflation rates are of this type.2 Some papers have shown that these types of measures can help to identify the underlying trend and may outperform measures of core inflation in forecasting total (aka headline) inflation.3\n\nThere are also statistical models that try to isolate the trend from the noise and identify the cyclical and acyclical components of core inflation, where the cyclical components are, by definition, those associated with labor market tightness.4\n\nThe literature has not discerned a best way to isolate the inflation trend; so, in practice, to forecast inflation, policymakers tend to look at all the measures of inflation, data on the real side of the economy, anecdotal reports from community and business contacts, and various models. Many of the forecasting models being used are informed by theoretical models of inflation dynamics.\n\nWhich brings me to my second question: Can we reconcile the actual pricing behavior of firms with predictions from the New Keynesian model, the workhorse inflation model used by many central bank economists?\n\nIn recent years, a considerable amount of research has examined the real-world pricing behavior of firms and incorporated these facts into macroeconomic models.5 In fact, several papers presented at the conference explicitly incorporate micro data into macro models.6 I view this as a continuation of the desirable approach of ensuring that our macro models are based on sound micro foundations.\n\nThe availability of data on individual prices has made advances possible. New surveys are also being used to better understand firms’ pricing behavior. For example, a survey conducted by researchers from the Cleveland, Atlanta, and New York Feds found that firms’ prices are strongly influenced by their perceptions about demand for their products, a desire to maintain steady profit margins, and their labor costs.7 The paper based on the survey, and included in the conference’s poster session, estimates that cost-price passthrough at firms was about 60 percent on average, but that there was considerable heterogeneity across the firms. Interestingly, although firms do tend to raise their prices when wages rise, other research from the Cleveland Fed indicates that consumers do not expect their wage growth to keep up with inflation. The researchers find that a 1 percentage point increase in inflation expectations causes expectations of income growth to rise by only two-tenths of a percentage point; in other words, respondents expect rising inflation to hurt their real income. This might help to explain why people dislike high inflation even when the labor market is strong.8\n\nResearch such as this can help to close the gap between the macro models we use to inform our monetary policy decisions and the microeconomic data. In addition, research on actual pricing behavior can also inform the framework for setting monetary policy. For example, at first blush it might seem that having a higher inflation target, all else equal, gives monetary policymakers more room to move the nominal interest rate down before hitting the effective lower bound; they could then provide more stimulus to the economy, if needed. But Cleveland Fed research suggests that all else would not be equal.9 In particular, a higher inflation target would not provide as much policy room as one might expect; raising the inflation target would be subject to the Lucas critique. With higher steady-state inflation, firms would change their price-setting behavior and adjust their prices more frequently. Because monetary policy’s ability to affect real activity depends on the degree of price stickiness, a higher inflation target would make monetary policy less effective because firms would be changing their prices more frequently. The research’s quantitative result suggests that to increase policy space by 2 percentage points, instead of increasing the inflation target from 2 percent to 4 percent, one would need to increase the target to 5 percent. If you add to this the costs of having to change posted prices more often, the higher level of relative price distortions because everything is not indexed, higher shoe-leather costs from searching for the lowest prices, and the higher inflation volatility associated with higher inflation, the benefits of setting a higher inflation target are not compelling.\n\nThe Fed’s inflation target is 2 percent, and we are committed to returning inflation to 2 percent in a sustainable and timely way. This explicit target was first established in the FOMC’s statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy in January 2012, and it has been reaffirmed every year since then. The 2 percent target was taken as given when the FOMC undertook its review of the monetary policy framework in 2019. The revised statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy, which reflects the outcome of the review, recognizes the importance of keeping inflation expectations well-anchored at levels consistent with 2 percent inflation.10 And by “well-anchored” I mean longer-term inflation expectations that are insensitive to data.\n\nOne of the big lessons from the 1970s is that it is much more difficult and costly to bring inflation down once it has become embedded in the economy, that is, once businesses and households expect inflation to remain elevated and those expectations influence their savings and investment decisions and price-setting and wage-setting behavior. Indeed, inflation expectations have been a central factor in models of inflationary dynamics since the 1960s and 1970s.11 The theory indicates that well-anchored longer-term inflation expectations can help to mitigate the pull of resource gaps on inflation, and therefore, the cyclical movements in interest rates that policymakers induce to maintain price stability need not be as large as when inflation expectations are not well-anchored.\n\nPutting the theory into practice brings me to my third question: For the purposes of setting monetary policy, how should inflation expectations be measured and over what time horizon?\n\nOne difficulty in moving from theory to practice is that while the models talk about “inflation expectations,” these expectations are not directly observable. So policymakers look at a number of measures that differ by type of agent and time horizon. These include measures based on surveys of consumers, businesses, and professional forecasters; measures derived from financial markets; and composite indices that combine various measures. A clear signal is not always forthcoming because the inflation expectations of different groups of agents can behave differently from one another. Even within groups there can be variation, and the literature has not firmly established whose expectations are most important for inflation dynamics.12\n\nHouseholds may find it challenging to answer questions about the economic concept of inflation. Recent Cleveland Fed research found that when consumers are asked about what they think inflation will be in the future for the various categories of consumer spending, their answers do not aggregate up using any plausible weighting scheme to what they expect overall inflation will be.13 Aggregated inflation expectations over categories tend to be lower than expectations of overall inflation, and the bottom-up aggregated expectations explain a greater share of planned consumer spending. This inconsistency reinforces the approach taken by policymakers to look at various measures of inflation expectations.\n\nIndeed, several new measures are increasing our understanding of inflation expectations. Researchers at the Cleveland Fed have developed a measure of inflation expectations that does not require the respondents to understand the economic concept of aggregate inflation. The Cleveland Fed’s indirect consumer inflation expectations (ICIE) measure, which started in 2021, is based on a nationwide survey with more than 10,000 responses and is updated on a weekly basis. Instead of asking consumers directly about overall inflation, the survey asks consumers how they expect the prices of the things they buy to change over the next 12 months and how much their incomes would have to change for them to be able to afford the same consumption basket and be equally well-off.14 According to this measure, women’s inflation expectations have tended to run higher than those of men, and older respondents and more educated respondents also have reported higher inflation expectations than their counterparts.\n\nLess information has been available on firms’ inflation expectations, even though firms are the price setters. But new data series are being developed. For example, the Cleveland Fed has begun publishing the Survey of Firms’ Inflation Expectations (SoFIE), a nationally representative, quarterly survey of CEOs and other top business executives, which was started by academics in 2018.15 The survey data indicate that the year-ahead inflation expectations of these business executives rose as inflation increased in 2021 and 2022. Their expectations began to decline in 2023 but remain elevated at 4.3 percent as of July. Perhaps more troubling is that when respondents were asked in April what they thought the Fed’s inflation target was, the mean response was 3.1 percent. This is higher than our target of 2 percent and also nearly a percentage point above the mean response before the pandemic.\n\nMonetary policymakers typically focus on medium- to longer-term inflation expectations because this is the time horizon over which monetary policy can be expected to affect the economy and is more reflective of consumers’ perceptions of the Fed’s commitment and ability to return the economy to price stability. Ample research shows that changes in the prices of particular salient items, including gasoline and food, which are independent of monetary policy, can have an outsized effect on households’ shorter-run inflation expectations.16 However, recent research by Cleveland Fed economists indicates that policymakers should not ignore persistently elevated levels of shorter-term inflation expectations and focus only on longer-term expectations. The researchers find persistent differences in inflation expectations across consumers of different ages and that households form their expectations of inflation based on their lifetime experience of inflation.17 When this mechanism is incorporated into a conventional New Keynesian model, inflation shocks are more persistent than otherwise, and the optimal response is for monetary policy to tighten when short-run inflation expectations rise even if longer-run expectations are stable. Doing so helps to limit the experience households have with high inflation, which helps to keep inflation expectations anchored in the future.\n\nBetter understanding of how households and firms form their inflation expectations will help inform how monetary policymakers should respond when inflation deviates from the target. This brings me to my fourth and final question: How should monetary policymakers respond to supply shocks?\n\nThe current episode of high inflation has been a challenging one. In the U.S., inflation began rising in the spring of 2021. A sequence of supply shocks, driven first by the pandemic and then the war in Ukraine contributed to the high inflation. These supply shocks were concentrated in the goods sector, which was already seeing a surge in demand as consumers shifted spending from services to goods during the pandemic-induced shutdown and when they continued to take social distancing measures once the economy reopened. The supply shocks exacerbated the imbalances between demand and supply, which, in an environment of very accommodative fiscal and monetary policy, led to a significant and persistent increase in inflation.\n\nThe episode has called into question the conventional view that monetary policy should always look through supply shocks. The thinking is that supply shocks tend to be transitory, and while they raise the price level for a time, they do not lead to a persistent increase in inflation or inflation expectations. Moreover, since monetary policy acts with a lag, if policymakers were to react to a transitory supply shock, it would be counterproductive, affecting the economy after the supply shock had dissipated. But to the extent that supply shocks are more persistent or there is a sequence of supply shocks, this thinking need not apply because such shocks can threaten the stability of inflation expectations and this would require policy action. Indeed, when inflation expectations are not firmly anchored, if monetary policy fails to react in an appropriate way, what starts out as a potentially temporary shock could lead to more persistent effects on inflation.18\n\nThis brings up the possibility that monetary policy may want to react differently depending on the nature of the shock that has led to a rise in inflation, with the reaction dependent on the size and persistence of the shock, because different shocks have different implications for inflation expectations. An interesting paper presented at the conference suggests that in an environment where prices are more flexible than wages and agents have bounded rationality rather than fully rational expectations with respect to inflation, policy may want to respond more aggressively to supply shocks when inflation is already high and less aggressively when inflation is low.19 This can lead policymakers to first look through supply shocks and then respond more aggressively as inflation moves up, which arguably characterizes the current high-inflation episode. However, other interesting research shows that optimal monetary policy responses depend critically on how inflation expectations are formed and how well they are anchored. In one model, when expectations differ from rational expectations and are not well-anchored, policymakers are better off responding earlier to signs that inflation is rising rather than delaying and only then responding aggressively.20 The implication is that when there is uncertainty, policymakers should overestimate the degree of persistence of inflation shocks rather than underestimate it.\n\nMore research on the timing and magnitude of the optimal monetary policy response in the face of different types of shocks and when inflation expectations deviate from rational expectations would be helpful to policymakers.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo conclude, let me again thank the organizers at the European Central Bank and at the Cleveland Fed for putting together such a strong conference program. When we started the Cleveland Fed’s Center for Inflation Research in December 2018, some people raised an eyebrow. They questioned the center’s focus because inflation had been so benign for quite some time. It turned out to be precisely the right time to further the research agenda on inflation. Maintaining price stability is the responsibility of the central bank and only the central bank can deliver on this goal over time. While considerable progress has been made on developing inflation models and measures that can better inform monetary policymaking, we still have much to learn about inflation dynamics. I encourage the researchers participating in this conference to continue furthering their research agendas because good policymaking depends on the research that informs it."

Although we bring different perspectives to the table, we share a common goal: to strengthen communities by improving the opportunities for all people to productively engage in our economy. I thank all of the organizers for putting together such a strong program.\n\nThe discussions over the last two days have focused on many of the challenges that face our communities, both long-standing ones and new ones that reflect our changing economy. There are still significant impediments limiting those in low- and moderate-income households and communities from fully benefiting from a strong economy. Not everyone has access to affordable education, transportation, broadband, housing, credit, and other financial services, which are the foundational elements that allow people to achieve the American dream and secure a better living standard for their children. I applaud each and every one of you for persevering in your efforts to improve our economy for all. At times it must be quite discouraging given what still needs to be done. But I have decided to end the summit on a positive note by providing some examples of the progress that has been achieved in supporting communities through partnership and perseverance. Before I continue, I note that the views I present will be my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nCommunity Development and the Federal Reserve System\n\nMy examples of progress come from two areas in which the Federal Reserve System has been particularly interested: housing and workforce development. As many of you know, the origin of the Fed’s community development work lies with the passage of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) in 1977.1 The CRA reaffirmed that insured depository institutions must serve the communities in which they are chartered to do business, helping to ensure equitable access to credit for all individuals and neighborhoods. The Fed and other federal financial supervisory agencies were charged with implementing the act. Today, through its research and outreach efforts, the community development function within the Fed provides information about the economic health of low- and moderate-income households and communities, and small businesses. This information is particularly helpful in tracking emerging developments and monitoring the economy in real time, since this information is available before many of the official statistics are released. It proved particularly useful during the pandemic, which had a disproportionately negative effect on lower-income people and people of color, as well as the post-pandemic economy, which has been characterized by high inflation, a particularly onerous burden for people and businesses with fewer resources. Some of the information gathered is now included in the Beige Book, which is published two weeks before each meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy.\n\nAnother important source of information is the Federal Reserve Banks’ Small Business Credit Survey, which the Cleveland Fed now leads on behalf of the System.2 The survey provides information from a large sample of small businesses on their credit performance, financing needs and choices, and borrower experiences.3 The survey allowed the Fed to document the disparate impact the pandemic had on small Black-owned and women-owned businesses, track the post-pandemic recovery of small businesses, and see how differences in access to credit have changed over time. The data on access to credit have informed the work being done by the federal banking regulators to modernize the regulations to implement the CRA in light of the changes in banking since the 1970s.4\n\nIn addition to real-time reconnaissance, the Fed’s community development function also works to understand the longer-run trends that present challenges and opportunities for lower-income households and communities. At the Cleveland Fed we collect information in a variety of ways, including meeting with our community contacts and our Community Advisory Council, conducting surveys of nonprofits and small businesses, and convening listening sessions and roundtables. An example is yesterday’s Fed Listens event, which allowed Governor Bowman and me to directly hear how lower-income communities are experiencing the post-pandemic economy. Equally important for our work is the collaboration we have with many of your organizations. We have learned over the years that much more can be accomplished by bringing together diverse perspectives to identify problems and then working together as partners with perseverance to solve them.\n\nProgress\n\nLet me turn to examples of progress, first, in the area of housing and neighborhood development.\n\nSince the urban decline of the 1970s, vacant and abandoned properties have posed a problem for neighborhood revitalization. The global financial crisis and Great Recession of 2007-2009 exacerbated this challenge.5 Ohio had one of the highest foreclosure rates in the country during this time. In Slavic Village, a neighborhood in southeast Cleveland, foreclosures affected as many as one in four homes. Between 1990 and 2010, the number of vacant properties more than doubled in places like Cleveland, Detroit, and Baltimore, but increases were also seen in Sun Belt cities, including Atlanta and Miami.6\n\nTo help solve the large number of vacant and abandoned properties in Ohio in the 2000s, a “next generation” land bank was set up, the Cuyahoga Land Bank. Instead of relying on government agencies, this land bank entrusted nongovernmental entities to acquire distressed properties and they were able to convert these properties to alternate uses more efficiently than local governments could.7 This land bank continues to be an important avenue for revitalizing neighborhoods in Cleveland.\n\nAnother example of progress is the remediation of lead in the housing stock in Cleveland. While in some parts of the country lead contamination has come through the drinking water system, in Cleveland, a deteriorating housing stock in distressed neighborhoods was the main contributor to high levels of lead toxicity in children. Even though it has been 45 years since lead paint was banned in 1978, in the mid-2000s, lead testing in Cleveland revealed that a significant share of the city’s children had elevated levels of lead in their bloodstream, and these children disproportionately lived in lower-income and majority minority neighborhoods.8 At elevated levels, lead can cause brain damage that is irreversible and has significant adverse effects on a child’s ability to learn, which can threaten the child’s attachment to the workforce and long-term economic well-being. Lead is a health problem, but it is also an educational problem, a workforce and economic development problem, and a barrier to economic opportunity and an inclusive economy.\n\nAs more people became aware of the dangerous effects of lead in homes, research institutions, hospitals, nonprofits, and foundations joined with the City of Cleveland and Cuyahoga County to form a public-private partnership called the Lead Safe Cleveland Coalition. For the past six years, the Coalition has helped with screening, testing, public outreach, and engagement with residents and landlords, as well as lead paint remediation in homes and clearance. Over time, the group has expanded to include more organizations and state and local governments, and families affected by lead. Many of our Policy Summit partners, including the United Way, Enterprise Community Partners, Cleveland Neighborhood Progress, and the Urban League, are members.9\n\nIn 2016, the Cleveland Fed convened parties interested in solving the lead problem, and in 2022 we hosted a Lead Safe Home Fund investor forum at the Bank. It was clear that a lot of tangible progress had been made over those six years. As of January 2022, $115 million of funding has been designated for making Cleveland homes lead-safe and the City of Cleveland requires all rental properties built before 1978 to have a Lead Safe certification, which requires the property to have been inspected by a certified professional and not have any current lead hazards. The share of tested children who have elevated blood levels of lead has also fallen substantially since the 2000s.10 Still, we should not tolerate any level of toxicity. There is more work to be done, but I am convinced that with perseverance and continued partnership we can make even more progress.\n\nThe second set of examples is in the area of workforce development. Workforce development plays a critical role in helping people and communities further their economic well-being. Currently, our economy is experiencing a skills gap: not enough workers have the skills necessary to fill the jobs in demand. This means that the country is not living up to its economic potential. A skilled workforce that can adapt to change is an essential ingredient in a healthy economy. The Federal Reserve System has worked on several initiatives to promote investment in workforce development and encourage partnerships.11 I use the word “investment” on purpose. There is a growing understanding among businesses that expenditure on employees should not just be viewed as a short-run input cost. Employees are important assets to an organization and investing in employees can pay off in the long run by creating a more attached and productive workforce. Regions are also realizing that investments to draw a highly skilled workforce can pay off by attracting more employers to the region and making the region more competitive when opportunities arise. Workforce development and regional economic development are linked and should be viewed as a common goal.\n\nEven before the pandemic, technological change, automation, and digitalization were driving rapid changes in the nature of work: what we do and how we do it.12 The types of jobs and the skills needed for doing them are changing. Over the past decade, skills-based hiring has become more common and has provided a practical solution for matching employers with workers who have the necessary skills and providing better career paths for more people. According to a Fed survey of young workers, more than 30 percent of young adults did not get information about jobs and careers in high school or college.13 The Federal Reserve has been working to fill this information gap. For example, recognizing that a majority of adults, disproportionately people of color, do not have at least a bachelor’s degree, researchers at the Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland, Atlanta, and Philadelphia have been documenting the types of occupations that do not require a four-year college degree but that do pay a decent wage (at or above the median wage).14 Examples of these types of “opportunity occupations” include nurses, sales representatives, truck drivers, carpenters, and electricians. An examination of the skills in demand for lower-wage and for opportunity occupations led to the development of the Occupational Mobility Explorer tool.15 This tool helps workers in 33 different metro areas learn how the skills used in their current occupation are similar to those used in a higher-paying occupation in their same labor market. For example, if you are a cashier in Cleveland, you have the skills to be a customer service representative, a job that pays, on average, 135 percent more.16\n\nAs the skills gap has widened, community colleges and businesses have partnered to tailor training and curriculums. The Federal Reserve and other evaluators have identified several examples of successful partnerships that have increased opportunity, reduced worker turnover, and increased productivity and wages.17 Many of these programs are sector specific. The Cuyahoga County Workforce Funders Group, a public-private partnership, is working with various local partners on programs in information technology, healthcare, manufacturing, and hospitality. Towards Employment, a nonprofit workforce development organization involved in this effort, bases its work on the WorkAdvance model to help build career paths in high-demand sectors. This model includes pre-screening to ensure that participants understand a sector’s job requirements, occupational skills training, placement services, and post-employment coaching. The model has been shown to be effective, with participants working more regular hours, staying in the workforce, and earning higher salaries.18\n\nOf course, to be able to perform well at a job or in a skills-based development program, one needs to have had a good foundation. It has become increasingly clear through research and experience that early childhood education is critically important for advancement. The benefit comes not only from acquiring skills like reading and math but also from behavioral skills.19 We now know that when children fall behind early on, it is difficult to catch up, and progress has been made in identifying which type of early childhood education programs work.20 The research has shown that well-focused investment in early childhood development pays off for both individuals and the community overall,21 that enrollment in pre K programs has helped to lower racial and income disparities in students’ readiness for kindergarten,22 and that home environment matters, too. For example, a study by a Cleveland Fed economist showed that the number of books at home has a significant impact on achievement in elementary school.23\n\nThe research findings have driven action and the action has led to progress. In 2014, the Cleveland Metropolitan Area School District (CMSD) expanded pre-K education through its PRE4CLE program. In the year prior to its establishment, only 16 percent of children were entering kindergarten fully prepared, as measured by Ohio’s Kindergarten Readiness Assessment, and only about 26 percent of preschool-age children in Cleveland were participating in high-quality preschool. From the program’s launch through 2019, enrollment in high-quality preschool increased by 72 percent, with nearly half of Cleveland’s 3- to 5-year-olds enrolled. Unfortunately, as was true for many childhood education programs, the pandemic caused the enrollment in PRE4CLE to fall significantly, but it did begin to recover last year.\n\nThe Cincinnati Preschool Promise is also working to expand access to high-quality preschool to prepare students for kindergarten. And Akron’s I Promise School has also been successfully implementing a wrap-around approach that ensures that students have access not only to education but also to healthy food and transportation to get to school. Another sign of progress is that policymakers increasingly recognize that they need to take a holistic approach to effectively address the challenges facing lower-income households.\n\nWhat is critically important now is to persevere in educating our children, make up the ground lost during the pandemic, and increase access, so that all of our children will be ready for the changing workforce of the future.24\n\nConclusion\n\nThese are only a few examples of progress. I could point to many others that show what can be achieved through partnership and perseverance. I hope that what you have learned and who you have met at this year’s Policy Summit will inspire you to form new partnerships and to persevere with the important work you are doing. If we remain committed and work together, I am convinced we will make further progress toward a more inclusive economy in which all people benefit. Thank you again for participating in this year’s Policy Summit."

            "content": "I thank the Global Interdependence Center for inviting me to speak in its Central Banking Series and the Central Bank of Ireland for hosting this event.  I have had many great opportunities to participate in GIC programs.  So when I was offered the chance to speak at this event I jumped at it because I knew that what I learn today will give me insights into the economy, which will prove valuable in setting monetary policy.\n\nToday, rather than focus on the current economic outlook and monetary policy, I will focus on the longer run.  While I will frame my discussion in terms of the U.S. economy, many of the trends I will discuss affect other advanced economies, too.  Of course, the views I present will be my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nPolicy economists often talk about the longer run as if it were a destination, but we speak less frequently about the factors that will influence what that destination will look like and how it will evolve.  These slower-moving trends include longer-run potential output growth, labor force growth, demographic changes, and productivity growth. While these trends might get less attention in current policy discussions, they have significant implications for the future health of the U.S. economy.  And while monetary policy cannot directly affect these longer-run trends, it needs to take them into account.\n\nLong-Run Growth\n\nLet me start with long-run potential growth.  Living standards, as measured by income per person, are inextricably tied to an economy’s long-run growth rate.  Over time, even small differences in growth can translate into large differences in average income per person.  For example, if real GDP were to grow at 2-1/4 percent per year over the next 20 years, instead of 1-3/4 percent, the difference in income at the end of that period would amount to about $10,000 per person in today’s dollars, which is about 13 percent of today’s per capita income level in the U.S.1\n\nOver the long term, the U.S. economy has enjoyed solid economic performance.  Save for the Great Depression, sustained growth of per capita real GDP of around 2 percent per year has been a hallmark of the U.S. economy over the past 150 years.2 But this average obscures the fact that long-run growth in the U.S. has been falling over time.  From the end of World War II through the end of the 1990s, real GDP growth averaged 3-1/2 percent per year.  If we concentrate on recent economic expansions, we see that growth averaged about 4-1/4 percent over the 1982-1990 expansion and about 3-1/2 percent over the 1991-2001 expansion.  In contrast, average growth over the pre-pandemic expansion and the current expansion, excluding the rebound quarter after the economic shutdown, has been about 2-3/4 percent.  The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that real GDP will grow by about 2-1/4 percent per year from 2025 to 2030.  This is somewhat above the CBO’s 1-3/4 percent estimate of maximum sustainable or potential growth over that period.3 And that estimate of potential growth is considerably lower than the CBO’s potential growth estimate of 2-3/4 percent for the 1991-2007 period, a period prior to the Great Recession.4\n\nIndeed, economists have been revising down their estimates of longer-run growth since the start of the Great Recession.  When the FOMC began releasing longer-run economic projections in January 2009, the central tendency of the participants’ projections of longer-run real GDP growth was 2-1/2 to 2-3/4 percent.  In the projections released in March of this year, the central tendency was down to 1-3/4 to 2.0 percent.\n\nLabor Force Growth\n\nThe key determinants of an economy’s longer-run growth rate are structural productivity growth – how effectively the economy combines its labor and capital inputs to create output – and labor force growth.\n\nDuring the pandemic many people left the workforce.  Some found it necessary to leave for health reasons or because they had to take care of children or other family members, and many decided to retire.  In fact, the share of the U.S. population that is retired is about 1-1/2 percentage points above what it was before the pandemic, an increase of more than 3-1/2 million people.5 While prime-age labor force participation has now returned to pre-pandemic levels, total labor force participation has not, partly reflecting these “excess retirements.”\n\nBut even before the pandemic, labor force growth had been slowing.  In the 1970s, the labor force grew about 2-1/2 percent per year, on average, as baby boomers and women entered the workforce.  Labor force growth has slowed since then, rising at slightly more than 1/2 percent per year over the pre-pandemic expansion, from 2009-2019.  The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) estimates that labor force growth will average 1/2 percent per year over 2021-2031.6\n\nThe downward trend in labor force growth largely reflects slower population growth, which results from demographic factors, including the aging of the population and a lower birth rate, as well as reduced net international migration when compared to earlier decades.  Demographic change can have significant effects on the economy, influencing not only population and labor force growth, but also savings rates, the long-run unemployment rate, the equilibrium interest rate, and the demand for financial assets.7 The BLS estimates that the U.S. population will grow less than 3/4 percent a year on average from 2021 to 2031, one of the slowest paces since the series started in the 1960s.  The median age of the U.S. population is about 37 years old, about 10 years older than in 1970.8 By 2050, the U.N. projects that the median age in the U.S. will be over 43 years old and that the number of people age 65 or older per 100 working-age people (those ages 25 to 64) will be more than double what it was in 1970.9\n\nIncreased immigration can partially offset the effects of an aging domestic population.  According to the BLS, about 18 percent of the U.S. labor force is foreign born and those who are foreign-born participate in the labor force at a higher rate than native-born Americans.10Yet immigration flows to the U.S. have slowed since the 2000s.11\n\nProductivity Growth\n\nThe dampening effect of slower labor force growth on the potential growth of the economy could be offset by more rapid increases in productivity growth.  Indeed, sustained increases in output and increasing standards of living are determined by productivity growth12 Over the five years prior to the pandemic, labor productivity, measured by output per hour worked in the nonfarm business sector, grew at an annual rate of only about 1-1/2 percent; over the current expansion productivity has not grown much at all.  This is quite a step down from the 2-1/4 percent pace seen over the two expansions prior to the Great Recession.  Some of the slowdown in productivity growth during the current expansion likely reflects the difficulty in measuring productivity given the unusual effects of the pandemic on the labor market.  Some of those effects will likely abate over time, but structural factors have likely been weighing on productivity growth, as well.\n\nOne such factor is a reduced level of economic dynamism.  New firms play a particularly important role in the U.S. economy.  In fact, young firms disproportionately contribute to both overall job creation and job destruction in the U.S.13 An enviable aspect of the U.S. economy around the globe has been our spirit of innovation, entrepreneurship, ease of business entry and exit, and labor market flexibility.  This dynamism has contributed to economic growth and well-being in the U.S. by allowing resources to be reallocated from less-productive to more-productive businesses and allowing workers to move up the career ladder.\n\nBefore the pandemic, a cause for concern about the U.S. economy was that the start-up rate of new businesses had been generally declining at least since 2000.14 Business start-ups were accounting for a smaller share of firms and a smaller share of employment than they once did.15 This slow pace of start-ups and more general decline in business and labor market dynamism likely contributed to the slowdown in productivity growth of the American economy.16; Indeed, by some estimates, if the pace of job reallocation had remained the same as in the 1980s, total factor productivity growth in the U.S. would have been a third higher.17\n\nThe onset of the pandemic hit many small businesses very hard.  From February to April 2020, the number of active small business owners dropped by 3.3 million, a record 22 percent decline.18 But surprisingly, starting in May 2020, there has been a significant increase in new business registrations.19\n\nWhile down from the May 2021 level, monthly business applications remain considerably higher than they were before the pandemic.  Some of these new businesses were likely established out of necessity by people who had lost their jobs during the pandemic or by people who felt dissatisfied with their work situation.  Others were likely formed by people who saw and took advantage of an opportunity.  It is not clear at this point how many of these new businesses will prosper and whether this represents a resurgence of dynamism in the U.S. economy.20 If it does, that will be a positive sign.\n\nIn addition to dynamism, productivity trends can be influenced through investment.  Indeed, economists hold different views about the future growth prospects of the U.S. economy largely because they have different assessments of the prospects for investments in technology and human capital, factors that influence productivity growth.21\n\nThere have been significant advances in technology, such as robotics, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and machine learning.  But not all technological change is obviously productive: note the current discussions about artificial intelligence.  However, changes in technology with widespread applicability can lead to higher levels of productivity growth and output growth.22 But even with productive technology, it takes time to adapt to the change.  Indeed, the disruption caused by technology can have negative effects at first.  Workers need to retrain and some industries may be pushed out by the new technology.  Eventually, as the economy adapts, there are gains, but not all people, industries, and communities will automatically share in the benefits. It is still too early to tell whether the pandemic has changed trend productivity growth.  There has been some speculation that the increased investments in technology that enabled remote work necessitated by the pandemic might eventually do so, but the offsetting effect is the increase in resources needed to manage remote workers.23\n\nHuman capital and technology are linked.  For technology to enhance productivity, workers need to have the abilities and knowledge to apply it.  So, technological change can spur increased investments in human capital.  The reverse is true, too.  The availability of a more highly skilled workforce can induce higher investment in innovation and new technology, since firms know they will be able to hire workers with the requisite skills to use it.\n\nMany studies have documented the importance of investment in human capital to a nation’s economic growth and well-being.  Individuals benefit as well, since higher levels of education are correlated with higher wages – a skill premium – and lower unemployment rates.24 Cleveland Fed economists investigated the overall increase in U.S. wage inequality in the last 30 years and found not only that differences in educational attainment are a key driver of wage inequality, but that education has become fundamental to boosting worker productivity.25\n\nTechnological change is not only driving a rising skill premium but also shifting the distribution of jobs.  Computers are less suited to replacing workers in occupations that require abstract thinking, high levels of cognition, and higher levels of education or workers in non-routine manual types of work.  But computers can replace medium-skill jobs that involve routine non-physical work.26This shift in the distribution of jobs helps to explain the rising gap in wages for highly skilled vs. low-skill workers, and the increasing return to gaining the education needed to acquire those skills.  The adoption of artificial intelligence apps may speed up these distributional changes.\n\nDespite the benefits of education, the U.S. is likely under-investing in it.  Educational attainment levels, which had been rising over successive generations in the first half of the twentieth century, have now flattened out for recent cohorts.27 The U.S. is lagging behind other advanced economies in terms of educational achievements and skill levels.  The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development’s (OECD) latest available survey assessing adult skills indicates that the U.S. ranks 15th in terms of literacy and 24th in terms of numeracy among the 32 OECD countries that participated in the assessment of these skills, and 15th in terms of problem-solving out of the 29 OECD countries that participated in that part of the assessment.28 You may be interested in the comparable rankings for Ireland.  Ireland ranks 22nd in terms of literacy and 23rd in terms of both numeracy and problem-solving.  In a different OECD survey of the skills of 15-year-olds, the U.S. ranked 9th out of 36 OECD countries in reading, 31st out of 37 OECD countries in math, and 13th out of 37 OECD countries in science.  Irish students did considerably better in terms of reading and math, ranking 4th in terms of reading and 15th in terms of math; Irish students ranked 17th in terms of science.29 The pandemic has also had significant negative effects on the math and reading achievement scores of elementary school students in the U.S.30\n\nThese results are troubling given the higher skills that will be needed to drive innovation and productivity growth, and they suggest that investments in making high-quality education and training available at all age levels would reap important benefits for the longer-run health of the economy and increased living standards.\n\nLonger-Run Trends and Their Implications for Monetary Policy and Financial Stability Policy\n\nLet me now turn to some implications of longer-run trends for monetary policy and financial stability policy.\n\nMonetary policy cannot directly affect the long-run growth rate of the economy, but it can contribute to the economy’s ability to reach that potential growth rate by achieving and maintaining price stability.\n\nA sharp rise in inflation in the U.S. began in the spring of 2021, reflecting both demand and supply factors.  In the wake of high and persistent inflation, the FOMC began raising the target range of its policy rate, the federal funds rate, in March of last year.  Including the 25-basis-point increase made two weeks ago, the cumulative increase in the fed funds rate is 5 percentage points in a little over a year.  In addition, the Fed has been allowing assets to run off its balance sheet in a systematic way according to the plan announced last May, and this is also helping to firm the stance of monetary policy.  The Fed is committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent goal.  We all know that high inflation makes it very hard for people to make ends meet.  It is a particularly onerous burden for people and businesses with fewer resources.\n\nBut high inflation also has long-run costs.  High inflation diverts the attention of households and businesses from productive activities to having to protect the purchasing power of their money, and it interferes with their ability to make long-term plans and commitments because of uncertainty about the value of their money.  High inflation distorts the decisions individuals make about getting an education or training for a new job and the decisions firms make about investing in R&D or plants and equipment.  As I just discussed, these investments in human and physical capital determine the pace of innovation in our economy, productivity growth, and the potential growth rate, and our longer-run standard of living.  While these longer-run impacts of high inflation are not always discussed, they underscore the imperative of getting the economy back to price stability in a timely way.\n\nMonetary policy also needs to consider longer-run trends in the economy because these trends affect the general level of interest rates consistent with stable prices and maximum employment.  In economic models, the longer-term equilibrium interest rate is determined by the long-run growth rate of consumption and, therefore, output.  In the near term, the equilibrium interest rate can fluctuate around its longer-run trend, and this equilibrium interest rate is an important benchmark for monetary policymakers in assessing the stance of monetary policy.\n\nFor advanced economies, empirical estimates of the longer-run equilibrium real policy rate, so-called r-star, while highly uncertain, have been declining for more than two decades.31 This decline reflects several factors, including the aging of the population, changes in risk preferences, and slower productivity growth.  In the aftermath of the pandemic, estimates of the short-run equilibrium interest rate rose.  Whether the equilibrium rate will revert to the low level we saw prior to the pandemic remains an open question, but some current estimates suggest that it will.32 If trend productivity growth were to pick up, it would have a positive effect on the long-run equilibrium interest rate, all else equal.  Higher productivity growth would increase the potential return on new investment, and raise firms’ demand for capital, thereby raising the equilibrium interest rate.  But demographic forces could offset that.  Static analysis suggests that as longevity increases, people want to accumulate more assets to fund their retirements, putting upward pressure on asset prices and, therefore, downward pressure on returns.  Moreover, because people prefer to reduce their exposure to risk as they age, we could see a shift toward assets with fixed returns, putting upward pressure on risk premia and downward pressure on risk-free rates.33 One countervailing effect is that older people tend to save less because once people reach retirement age, they need to draw down their savings and perhaps sell assets to fund their retirement.  This dissaving puts upward pressure on interest rates.34\n\nAnother factor that could put upward pressure on interest rates in the longer run is fiscal financing.\n\nThe rising share of older people will put significant pressure on Social Security and Medicare in the U.S., which are structured as pay-as-you-go programs, with current workers providing support for current retirees.  According to CBO projections, under current policy, the federal deficit as a share of GDP will more than double over the next 30 years, from almost 4 percent in 2022 to about 11 percent in 2052.35 Federal debt held by the public as a percent of GDP rises dramatically in the CBO estimates, from 98 percent in 2022 to 185 percent in 2052, well above its historical high of 106 percent during World War II.  Rising debt-to-GDP levels would raise the general level of interest rates, potentially crowd-out productive investments, and lower economic growth.  It would also mean that countercyclical fiscal policy would be constrained, increasing business cycle volatility.  These projected longer-run fiscal imbalances are unlikely to be sustainable and will need to be addressed by some combination of policies to increase revenues and reduce costs.  Policies that increase the growth and productivity of the workforce and that encourage R&D, innovation, and investment would help address fiscal imbalances and also partly offset the downward pressure on longer-run growth from demographics or other sources.\n\nLonger-run trends also need to be considered in policies aimed at ensuring the stability of our financial system.  Technological change and innovation are apparent in the financial services industry, with the rapid digitalization that is occurring and the entry of fintech and big data firms.  Digitalization holds the promise of increasing the efficiency, productivity, and inclusiveness of the financial sector, thereby increasing the economic welfare of households and businesses. But these digital tools need to be well-designed so that they do not have unintended effects and customers need to have sufficient financial literacy to be able to assess their value.\n\nThe changing landscape will require a rethinking of the regulatory framework to ensure that the financial innovations led by digitalization are a net positive.  Such innovations do not reduce the need for risk management, financial regulation and supervision, and good governance, although the form each takes is likely to be different than what has been effective in the past.  Existing regulatory and supervisory structures will need to adapt to keep up with the new ways that financial services are being delivered and the new players delivering them.   Under the principle “If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it’s a duck,” a regulatory approach that shifts the focus from the type of institution offering the service to the type of activity would likely be more effective in fostering the stability of the financial system by improving our ability to monitor risks in the nonbank financial sector and limiting regulatory arbitrage.\n\nWith the entry of big data and fintech firms into the financial services field, the public policy approach will need to change to include a more holistic blending of financial regulation, antitrust policy, and data privacy regulation.  To ensure that the benefits of technological innovation are captured and the risks managed will require not only cooperation across these types of regulators within each country, but also effective international coordination among regulators and supervisors through the Financial Stability Board and other international entities.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, current trends point to slow long-run growth for the U.S. economy.  But steps can be taken to address some of the factors underlying these trends in order to improve the economic health of individuals and communities and to maintain and enhance our future standard of living.  Government policies, if they are well-designed and focused on spurring productive investments in human and physical capital, R&D, and innovation, can lead to higher productivity growth and higher longer-run growth.  Ensuring a resilient financial system, through appropriate regulation and supervision that keeps up with changes in technology, is also an essential part of a healthy economy.  While monetary policy cannot affect the economy’s long-term growth rate, it can do its part by returning the economy to price stability, which is necessary for the longer-run health of labor markets, the financial system, and the overall economy."

            "content": "I thank the Akron Roundtable for inviting me to speak in the Signature Series today about the economy and monetary policy. Of course, the views I present will be my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Akron Roundtable’s work to foster community dialog aligns very well with the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s own efforts to engage with the public. I like that word “dialog.” At the Cleveland Fed we strive to provide our communities with useful research, data, and analysis. For example, our Center for Inflation Research provides various resources to policymakers, researchers, and the general public on inflation and its drivers.1 And in return, we receive economic reconnaissance from a wide variety of contacts from throughout our region. I firmly believe that the Fed’s engagement with the public leads us to make better policy decisions. I also believe that the structure of the Federal Reserve System supports that engagement. So before turning to the outlook, I will give a brief overview of the Fed’s structure.\n\nThe Structure of the Federal Reserve System\n\nCongress established the Fed in 1913 after a period of financial instability as an institution to promote the health of the U.S. economy and the financial system. Congress designed the Fed to operate in the public interest as a decentralized central bank: the Fed is independent within the government but not independent from the government. At the time, there were concerns that the central bank would become dominated by financial interests in New York or political interests in Washington. So the Fed was designed to include representation from across the country and to balance public-sector and private-sector interests, and Wall Street and Main Street concerns.\n\nThe Federal Reserve System has 12 regional Reserve Banks and a seven-member Board of Governors in Washington, D.C. that oversees those Banks. The governors are appointed by the president of the United States and confirmed by the Senate.2\n\nThe 12 Reserve Banks are distributed around the country in locations that were the centers of economic activity back when the Fed was established. Each Reserve Bank has a board of directors whose nine members are chosen in a nonpolitical process, with three representing banks and six representing business, agricultural, industrial, and public interests in the Districts they serve. One important responsibility of the nonbank directors on a Reserve Bank’s board is selecting the Bank’s president, who is subject to approval by the Fed’s Board of Governors. Some Reserve Banks also have Branches with five- to seven-member boards. The Cleveland Fed represents the Fed’s Fourth District and includes the state of Ohio and parts of Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and West Virginia; we have Branches in Cincinnati and Pittsburgh. In addition, we have a number of advisory councils that draw their membership from various sectors and geographies in our District.3\n\nThis regional structure of the Fed has served the country well for more than 100 years. The U.S. is very diverse, encompassing large cities, small towns and communities, and rural areas, with a mix of different industries and occupations, and some places more prosperous than others. The Fed’s structure helps to ensure that a variety of information from all sectors of the economy and all parts of the country is taken into account in our monetary policy decisions.4 The Cleveland Fed is continuously gathering information from a diverse group of business, consumer, community, and labor contacts throughout our District. This information helps me to formulate my views on the regional and national economies and monetary policy, and I bring this information to meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The FOMC is the body within the Fed that is responsible for setting monetary policy.5 Other Reserve Bank presidents are doing the same thing. So the discussions at FOMC meetings contain a mosaic of economic information and analysis from all parts of the country. And this regional information, along with economic and financial data and analysis, informs the FOMC’s setting of national monetary policy in pursuit of its statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability.6\n\nThe Economic Journey So Far\n\nSo, what does the economic information we have been gathering tell us about the economy and what are the implications for monetary policy? I titled my remarks today “Progress and Prudence.” It may sound like the title of a Jane Austen novel, but I think it is a good characterization of where we are and what will be needed to ensure that the economy returns to price stability. To see the progress, it will help to briefly review how the economy got to where it is today.\n\nAt the start of 2020, before the pandemic, the U.S. economy was on very solid footing. It was the 11th year of the expansion, and things looked quite good from the perspective of our monetary policy goals. The unemployment rate was at historically low levels, employment growth was strong, participation in the labor force was solid, and inflation was near the FOMC’s longer-run goal of 2 percent.\n\nThe pandemic changed all of that. The economy shut down in March 2020. Fiscal and monetary policymakers took aggressive actions to support households and businesses, ensuring that credit continued to flow, and to limit lasting damage to the economy. When public health statistics began to improve in May 2020, many parts of the country began to relax some of their stay-at-home restrictions, and the economy began to reopen. As the reopening progressed, it became clear that shutting down an economy can happen much more swiftly than reopening one. Spending patterns had changed, people had left the workforce, and supply chains were disrupted. And these forces are still having an effect on the economy today.\n\nThe economy expanded rapidly in 2021 as demand rebounded. But that strong demand confronted very constrained supply in both product and labor markets. The imbalances in demand and supply led to significant upward pressures on prices in an environment of very accommodative monetary and fiscal policy. A sharp rise in inflation began in the spring of 2021. Russia’s war against Ukraine, which began in February of last year, led to sizable increases in food and commodity prices, also contributing to rising inflation.\n\nHigh inflation makes it harder for people to make ends meet, and it also imposes longer-run costs on our economy by affecting the decisions people make about getting an education or training for a new job, and the decisions businesses make about undertaking R&D or investing in new plants and equipment. These types of investments in human and physical capital help determine our economy’s pace of innovation and productivity growth and its potential growth rate, and so our longer-run standard of living.\n\nThe Fed is responsible for ensuring price stability. So in March of last year in the wake of high and stubborn inflation, the Fed began significantly increasing its policy rate, the fed funds rate. The rate has moved up a cumulative 4-3/4 percentage points and the target range of the funds rate is now 4-3/4 to 5 percent. The Fed has also been allowing assets to run off its balance sheet in a systematic way according to the plan announced last May, which is also helping to firm the stance of monetary policy. These monetary policy actions aim to tighten financial conditions to moderate demand, which will help to reduce price pressures and bring inflation down.\n\nProgress Is Being Made\n\nThe good news is that progress is being made. Underlying demand remains resilient but economic activity has begun to slow. Real GDP grew at a below-trend pace of 1 percent last year, down from a very robust pace of about 5-3/4 percent in 2021. The slowdown in activity is seen most clearly in the housing sector, which is quite sensitive to interest rates, but also in manufacturing and business investment. Consumer spending, which makes up 70 percent of GDP, has been supported by strong household balance sheets and income growth, but it too is moderating. On the supply side of the economy, disruptions in supply chains have generally improved. Our contacts report that bottlenecks have eased, and survey data indicate that delivery times have shortened. This is welcome news because price pressures can be alleviated both through further moderation in demand and further improvement in supply.\n\nProgress is also being made in rebalancing the labor market. Overall labor market conditions remain strong. Payroll job gains averaged 345 thousand per month over the first three months of this year, a pickup from the average monthly gain in the fourth quarter of last year. The unemployment rate remains a very low 3-1/2 percent, near where it has been for much of the past year. These tight labor market conditions have made it challenging for businesses to attract and retain all the workers they need to meet demand for their products and services. But we are beginning to see some moderation. Employment growth has slowed over the past year and firms report that it is somewhat easier to find workers now. In addition, the rate at which people are quitting their jobs is moving down, which is usually a sign of a moderating labor market. On the supply side, there have been gains in prime-age labor force participation. So progress is beginning to be made in rebalancing labor demand and supply. As this continues, it should ease wage pressures, which have contributed to high inflation.\n\nTurning to inflation, the good news is that progress is being made here as well. In February, the year-over-year measures of both total PCE inflation and core PCE inflation were in the 4-1/2 to 5 percent range. They had peaked last year in the 5‑1/4 to 7 percent range. Similarly, CPI inflation is also down. Measured year-over-year, CPI inflation was 5 percent in March, down sharply from its peak of 9 percent last summer. Core CPI inflation is now about 5-1/2 percent, down about 1 percentage point from its peak.\n\nDespite this progress, inflation is still too high. And it is proving to be stubborn. Some measures of underlying inflation, such as the median and trimmed-mean PCE inflation rates, have shown little improvement since their peaks.7 The disaggregated data show that the stubbornness is due mainly to the prices of services. Inflation in core PCE services excluding shelter has not improved. It tends to be sticky, is correlated with wage inflation, and is a much larger share of the overall index than goods or housing, since consumers spend a larger share of their income on these services.\n\nMonetary Policy and the Outlook\n\nSo, what are the implications for monetary policy? We have moved interest rates up significantly over the past year and it is yielding progress. Yet demand is still outpacing supply in both product and labor markets and inflation remains too high. In order to put inflation on a sustained downward trajectory to 2 percent, I anticipate that monetary policy will need to move somewhat further into restrictive territory this year, with the fed funds rate moving above 5 percent and the real fed funds rate staying in positive territory for some time. Precisely how much higher the federal funds rate will need to go from here and for how long policy will need to remain restrictive will depend on economic and financial developments.\n\nWith tighter financial conditions, I expect that demand in product and labor markets will continue to moderate and inflation will continue to move down. Output growth will likely be well below trend this year and pick up a bit next year. I expect that employment growth will continue to slow and the unemployment rate, which is very low, will begin to rise, to about 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent by the end of the year. I expect to see meaningful improvement in inflation this year, with inflation moving down to about 3-3/4 percent this year, continuing to improve next year, and reaching our 2 percent goal in 2025.\n\nThe Economy in Ohio\n\nIn Ohio, I expect to see similar trends. Ohio is the seventh largest economy in the nation in terms of real gross state product. The path of a regional economy reflects its industrial mix and the nature of the shocks that hit the broader U.S. economy. Manufacturing and, within manufacturing, auto and auto parts still constitute an important sector of Ohio’s economy. Compared to the nation, manufacturing represents a larger share of payroll jobs in Ohio, but that differential has fallen over time.8 Ohio’s economy has been transitioning from one that is largely dependent on manufacturing and heavy industry to one that is diversifying into health care and education. In the 1990s, manufacturing represented about 20 percent of Ohio’s jobs and “eds and meds” represented about 12 percent. Those shares have now nearly reversed. In the past decade, the share of jobs in manufacturing has fallen to under 13 percent and the share in “eds and meds” has risen to nearly 17 percent. Regions that have diversified their industrial base have generally fared better over time. And in general, since the pandemic, the economy in Ohio has performed similarly to the national economy. Employers have struggled to find workers throughout the post-pandemic expansion, and since workforce growth tends to be slower in Ohio than in the nation because of slower population growth, it has been a quite challenging period for our employers. Rising inflation has also plagued businesses and households here, too. But as is true in the nation, progress is being made. Employers tell us they are finding it a bit easier to hire and retain workers now and their input costs are beginning to moderate.\n\nPrudence\n\nOf course, I think we all recognize that there is heightened uncertainty around the economic outlook. We have come a long way in tightening monetary policy, and some of those effects are yet to be felt in the economy. In such an environment a policymaker has to be very prudent in collecting and assessing the whole panoply of incoming information, not only official government statistics but also regional information gathered from our business, labor market, and community contacts; a variety of surveys on economic and banking conditions; and higher-frequency data such as credit card spending. All of this information helps to determine not only where the economy has been but also where it is going, which is important since monetary policy affects the economy with a lag. As we gather and assess this information, I am prepared to change my views on the economy and appropriate monetary policy as changes in conditions warrant.\n\nOne of the developments I will be particularly looking at is lending conditions. The U.S. banking system is sound and resilient. But in March, stresses emerged in a small number of banks, and Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank failed. The Fed, the Treasury, and the FDIC took swift action to ensure that these stresses did not spill over to the rest of the U.S. banking and financial system.9 Had such contagion occurred, it could have undermined the public’s confidence in healthy banks and prevented them from doing their important work to support the savings and credit needs of households and businesses. Banks now have access to liquidity through a new Fed lending facility, as well as the traditional discount window, where they can borrow against sound collateral to ensure that they have sufficient liquidity to serve their customers.10 The stresses experienced in the banking system in March have eased, but the Fed is prepared to take further steps as necessary to ensure financial stability. In addition, Chair Powell has directed the Federal Reserve Board’s vice chair of supervision, Michael Barr, to conduct an internal review and to report by May 1 on Silicon Valley Bank’s failure, including the Federal Reserve’s supervision and regulation of the bank.\n\nEven before the recent stresses, as interest rates moved up, banks had begun to tighten their credit standards, making credit less available. This is the typical way in which monetary policy tightening transmits to the broader economy. The recent tensions in the banking system could well result in banks tightening their credit standards even more, which could result in slower spending by households and businesses and a pullback in hiring. This would work in the same direction as tighter monetary policy. So we will need to continue to assess the magnitude and duration of these effects on credit conditions to help us calibrate the appropriate path of monetary policy going forward. This is the prudent thing to do.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, there has been significant tightening of monetary policy over the last year, and as a result, welcome progress is being made in bringing demand into better balance with supply in product and labor markets and reducing inflation. This is good news. But inflation remains too high.\n\nGiven that some of the increases in rates and tightening in financial conditions have yet to be felt in the economy, we need to be prudent in assessing all of the incoming economic and financial information when determining the appropriate path of monetary policy going forward. We are much closer to the end of the tightening journey than the beginning, and how much further tightening is needed will depend on economic and financial developments and progress on our monetary policy goals.\n\nThat said, price stability is critical for the long-run health of the labor market, the overall economy, and the stability of the financial system. So it would be a mistake to declare victory before the job is done. Here, I am reminded of the words of former Fed Chair Paul Volcker when he fought inflation in the 1980s: “…failure to carry through now in the fight on inflation will only make any subsequent effort more difficult, at much greater risk to the economy.”11"

            "content": "I thank the Money Marketeers of New York University for inviting me to speak this evening. I look forward to hearing what is on your minds, but first, I would like to present some prepared remarks on the economy and monetary policy. The views I present will be my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nAt its meeting two weeks ago, the FOMC raised the target range of the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4-3/4 to 5 percent. Since the Fed began raising rates in March of last year, the cumulative increase has been 475 basis points. In addition, the Fed has been allowing assets to run off its balance sheet in a systematic way according to the plan announced last May, and this is also helping to firm the stance of monetary policy.\n\nThe Fed has taken these monetary policy actions because inflation is too high and it is eroding U.S. living standards. High inflation makes it hard for people to make ends meet. High inflation also imposes longer-run costs on our economy. It distorts the decisions households and businesses make about getting an education or training for a new job, or investing in R&D or plants and equipment. In this way, high inflation can harm the pace of innovation, productivity growth, and the potential growth rate of the economy. So it can have lasting detrimental effects on the economy.\n\nThe Fed is responsible for ensuring price stability. Fed policymakers are committed to bringing inflation back to our 2 percent goal. Given where we are on that journey, I plan to remain diligent in setting monetary policy to return the economy to price stability in a timely way and to be judicious in balancing the risks so as to minimize the pain of the journey.\n\nThe U.S. banking system is sound and resilient. But during the two weeks leading up to the March FOMC meeting, stresses emerged in a small number of banks. The Fed, the Treasury, and the FDIC took swift action to ensure that these stresses did not spill over to the rest of the U.S. banking and financial system. Had such contagion occurred it could have undermined the public’s confidence in healthy banks and prevented them from doing their important work to support the savings and credit needs of households and businesses. Banks now have access to liquidity through a new Fed lending facility, as well as the traditional discount window, where they can borrow against sound collateral to ensure that they have sufficient liquidity to serve their customers. The stresses experienced in the banking system in March have eased, but the Fed continues to carefully monitor conditions and is prepared to take further steps as necessary to ensure financial stability.\n\nIn the past, when tensions like this have arisen in banking and financial markets, banks have tended to tighten credit availability, making it harder for households and businesses to borrow. In addition, if households and businesses become concerned about the outlook for the banking sector or the overall economy, they could become more cautious in their spending. Going forward, Fed policymakers will continue to assess the magnitude and duration of these effects and their implications for the outlook for inflation and employment and, therefore, for appropriate monetary policy.\n\nEconomic Growth\n\nIncoming economic information over the first part of the year has pointed to resilience in underlying demand in product and labor markets and persistence in inflation. Partly in response to higher interest rates, tighter lending standards at banks, and tighter overall financial conditions, economic activity has begun to slow. Real GDP grew at a below-trend pace of 1 percent last year, down from a very robust pace of about 5-3/4 percent in 2021. Growth in the final quarter of last year was over 2-1/2 percent, but much of that was due to firms rebuilding inventories. Inventories aside, growth in real final sales was more modest, just over 1 percent. The slowdown in activity is seen most clearly in the housing sector. Residential investment continues to decline sharply in response to higher mortgage rates, but real estate agents and homebuilders have told us that demand has begun to stabilize. There is still a longer-run structural shortage of available housing, which suggests less downward pressure on prices than one might expect given the rise in interest rates.  Construction contacts also indicated that they expect public-sector spending and future infrastructure spending to support activity.\n\nBusiness fixed investment in equipment and manufacturing activity have slowed, but a few of our business contacts have said that they thought investment has been more resilient than expected given higher interest rates. Indicators suggest that consumer spending, which makes up 70 percent of GDP, grew at a relatively strong pace in the first quarter. This spending has been supported by strong household balance sheets and income growth. Debt-to-income levels of households have been fairly stable, and, in the aggregate, households have been able to service their debt in the rising interest rate environment.\n\nOn the supply side of the economy, disruptions in supply chains have generally improved, although not uniformly. Contacts report that bottlenecks have eased, and survey data indicate that delivery times have shortened. This is welcome news because price pressures can be alleviated both through further moderation in demand and further improvement in supply.\n\nLabor Markets\n\nEmployment growth has slowed over the past year, firms report that it is somewhat easier to find workers now, and the rate at which people are quitting their jobs is moving down, which is usually is a sign of a moderating labor market. Nonetheless, overall labor market conditions remain strong, with demand for workers outpacing supply. Payroll job gains averaged over 400 thousand per month in January and February, a pickup from the average monthly gain in the fourth quarter of last year. The unemployment rate remains a very low 3.6 percent, near where it has been for much of the past year. The number of job openings has varied from month to month. They are down from their level a year ago, but the ratio of openings per unemployed worker has been running between 1.7 to 1.9 over the six months that ended in February, compared with 1.2 in the six months before the pandemic started.\n\nRecent gains in prime-age labor force participation may be helping to ease the imbalance between labor demand and supply. But this imbalance has put upward pressure on wages, and because labor costs constitute a significant share of a business’s expenses, especially in the service sector, this imbalance has also contributed to high inflation. Since workers’ wage gains generally have not kept up with inflation, many workers are not better off in real terms. By some measures, wage pressures are beginning to ease, but wages are still growing at an annual rate of about 4-1/2 to 5 percent. This is well above the level consistent with 2 percent inflation given current estimates of trend productivity growth. Indeed, for wage growth at this pace to be consistent with price stability, trend productivity growth would need to be 2-1/2 to 3 percent, instead of the current estimates of 1 to 1‑1/2 percent. We have not seen any evidence that trend productivity growth is rising; in fact, productivity growth has declined over the past year. So, workers are still falling behind in their purchasing power and will continue to do so until we get the economy on a sustained path back to price stability.\n\nInflation\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the sharp rise in inflation that began in the spring of 2021 in the U.S. These factors include the pandemic and how households, businesses, and monetary and fiscal policymakers responded to it, and Russia’s war against Ukraine, which led to sharp increases in food and commodity prices. Imbalances arose between strong demand and constrained supply, and these led to significant upward pressures on prices in an environment of accommodative monetary and fiscal policy.\n\nInflation remains too high and too stubborn. The February PCE inflation data showed some improvement, but recall that, in January, the data were a bit stronger than analysts expected. So while the level of inflation is lower than it was last summer, in February, the year-over-year measures of both total PCE inflation and core PCE inflation were in the 4-1/2 to 5 percent range, which is well above our 2 percent goal. The story is the same with other measures of underlying inflation, such as the median and trimmed-mean PCE inflation rates, which exclude components with the most extreme movements each month. Measured year-over-year, both of these measures are between 4-1/2 and 6 percent and have shown little to no improvement since their peaks last August.1\n\nThe disaggregated data show that the inflation stubbornness is due mainly to the prices of services. Goods inflation has been moving down over time, although it remains considerably above where it was before the pandemic. Shelter price inflation has not improved but the slowdown in housing activity and the deceleration in rents in new leases will eventually show up in the inflation statistics. Inflation in core services excluding shelter has not improved either. It tends to be sticky, is correlated with wage inflation, and is a much larger share of the overall index than goods or housing, since consumers spend a larger share of their income on these services.\n\nFor much of the pre-pandemic expansion, core goods inflation was slightly negative, on average, and falling goods prices were pulling inflation down. By the end of that expansion, inflation was nearing our target. In January 2020, PCE inflation had reached 1.8 percent and core inflation had risen to 1.7 percent. That reading reflected 0.75 percent deflation in core goods prices and 2.5 percent inflation in core services prices. That is very different from today. Since the current period of high inflation started in the spring of 2021, core goods prices have been rising, and through last September, inflation in core goods exceeded inflation in core services. To achieve our longer-run goal of 2 percent inflation, we will need to see continued sustained disinflation in both components.\n\nMy expectation is that with tighter financial conditions, demand in product and labor markets will continue to moderate. Output growth will likely be well below trend this year and pick up a bit next year. Employment growth will slow, with the unemployment rate rising to 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent by the end of the year. So far, high inflation has not unanchored medium- and longer-term inflation expectations, which remain at levels reasonably consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal. The continued anchoring of inflation expectations is an important factor underpinning my outlook that we will see a meaningful improvement in inflation this year, with inflation moving down to about 3-3/4 percent this year, continuing to improve next year, and reaching our 2 percent goal in 2025. In my modal projection, to put inflation on a sustained downward trajectory to 2 percent and to keep inflation expectations anchored, monetary policy moves somewhat further into restrictive territory this year, with the fed funds rate moving above 5 percent and the real fed funds rate staying in positive territory for some time.\n\nMy forecast is similar to the modal forecasts of FOMC participants released two weeks ago, although I see somewhat more persistent inflation pressures than the median forecast among participants. Of course, I also recognize that there is heightened uncertainty around the outlook and, in such an environment, it will be particularly important to continue to collect and assess the whole panoply of incoming information, not only official government statistics but also regional information gathered from our business, labor market, and community contacts; a variety of surveys on economic and banking conditions; and higher-frequency data such as credit card spending. All of this information can help us determine not only where the economy has been but where it is going, which is important when setting appropriate monetary policy since it affects the economy with a lag. The FOMC likes to say that its policy decisions are “data dependent.” It would be wrong to interpret this phrase as saying that we will react to one or two data points. Instead, I view “data dependent” as shorthand for saying that incoming economic information informs my economic outlook and my assessment of risks, which, in turn, inform my view of appropriate monetary policy. (You can see why we needed shorthand!)\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nIn making its monetary policy decisions, the FOMC is always guided by its strong commitment to achieving its statutory goals of price stability and maximum employment. The FOMC has come an appreciable way in bringing policy from a very accommodative stance to a restrictive one. We have taken actions to address the stresses that emerged last month in the banking system. Our decision in March to raise the fed funds rate by another 25 basis points reflected the persistence in underlying inflation and the need to move policy into a sufficiently restrictive stance to return inflation to 2 percent over time.\n\nPrecisely how much higher the federal funds rate will need to go from here and for how long policy will need to remain restrictive will depend on how much inflation and inflation expectations are moving down, and that will depend on how much demand is slowing, supply challenges are being resolved, and price pressures are easing. The FOMC indicated in its March statement that it anticipates that some additional policy firming may be appropriate. In determining the extent of future increases in the target range, the FOMC will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.\n\nEven before the recent stresses, banks had begun to tighten their credit standards. Credit has become less available as interest rates have risen. This is the typical way in which monetary policy tightening transmits to the broader economy. The recent tensions in the banking system could well result in banks further tightening their credit standards, and households and businesses may become more cautious in their spending. Directionally, we know that credit conditions are likely going to be somewhat tighter, and we will be assessing the magnitude and duration of these effects on the economic outlook to help us calibrate the appropriate path of monetary policy going forward.\n\nFinancial Stability\n\nLet me conclude by noting that this is standard operating procedure for monetary policy: evaluating the implications of economic and financial developments for the economic outlook and adjusting the monetary policy path if needed. This is different from using monetary policy to address the stresses in the banking or financial system instead of pursuing our monetary policy goals.\n\nIn fact, both price stability and financial stability are important for a healthy economy, and I do not see a tradeoff between the two. Well-formulated and well-communicated monetary policy that achieves our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability supports financial stability by allowing households, firms, and financial institutions to make better investment, saving, borrowing, and lending decisions. A healthy financial system provides valuable credit, risk-management, payment, and liquidity services to households and businesses in support of a sound economy. An unstable financial system can propagate adverse macroeconomic shocks over broad economic sectors and over time to the detriment of macroeconomic stability.\n\nBecause a safe, sound, and resilient banking system is of first-order importance to our economy, it is vital that we effectively use our microprudential tools of regulation and supervision and our macroprudential tools, including stress tests, to keep the banking system safe, sound, and resilient. Doing so has the benefit of allowing monetary policy to remain focused on bringing inflation back down to 2 percent in a timely way. This is a very important duty because returning to price stability is necessary for the long-run health of the labor market, the overall economy, and the stability of the financial system.\n\nThank you for your attention. I look forward to our discussion."

            "content": "I thank the organizers for inviting me to participate in this year’s U.S. Monetary Policy Forum. I have attended many of the forums, and this is the fourth time I have had the honor of being on the program. So I can say based on experience that the forum always chooses a topic of utmost importance for monetary policymaking and always successfully delivers a paper combining solid research and policy recommendations. This year is no exception.\n\nOver the past year, in the wake of rising inflation, the FOMC has taken deliberate action to remove monetary policy accommodation by raising the federal funds rate by 4‑1/2 percentage points and reducing the size of the Fed’s balance sheet through asset run-off. Returning the economy to price stability is an imperative for sustaining healthy labor markets and the U.S. standard of living. The very high inflation the economy has experienced for almost two years has been painful for households and businesses, especially those with fewer resources. High inflation also imposes longer-run costs on our economy because it distorts the decisions households and businesses make about building human capital and investing in R&D, plants and equipment, and other forms of physical capital. These decisions ultimately affect the pace of innovation, productivity growth, the potential growth rate of the economy, and improvement in our living standards.\n\nIncoming economic information shows that our monetary policy actions are having the intended effect of slowing demand and reducing price pressures. In addition, supply chain disruptions are easing. But inflation remains too high. So the paper is highly relevant for the task at hand as the FOMC manages the necessary disinflation back to our 2 percent goal while minimizing the pain of the journey back to price stability.\n\nIn the time I have, I will comment on three aspects of the paper: the empirical estimation of the Phillips curve, the role of inflation expectations, and the lessons for policymakers operating in an uncertain environment. The views I present will be my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Phillips Curve\n\nIn many inflation models used by central banks, inflation is driven by three key factors: a resource utilization gap or marginal cost of production; lagged inflation; and expectations of inflation. Different models put different weights on these fundamental factors, but empirical work across many specifications of such a Phillips curve relationship generally finds that inflation expectations matter and the resource utilization gap or slack matters when it is large. The finding that inflation expectations matter is an important reminder that estimates of a Phillips curve are dependent on the conduct of monetary policy and that reduced-form Phillips curves are not structural.\n\nIt is not surprising that the estimated inflation dynamics over the period that includes the high inflation of the 1960s and 1970s and the Volcker disinflation over 1979-1984 differ from those over the period of the Great Moderation from 1985 through 2019 because inflation expectations were not well anchored in the earlier period but were in the latter period. Some of the difference could reflect the nature of the shocks that hit the economy in each period, but it also reflects differences in how monetary policy was conducted. The experience of the 1960s and 1970s taught Fed policymakers the importance of setting policy to prevent the unanchoring of inflation expectations and the role that an explicit numerical inflation target can play in keeping expectations anchored. Now, more generally, there is a greater appreciation of monetary policy independence coupled with transparency and accountability, although that appreciation can ebb and flow with economic developments and should not be taken for granted."

            "content": "Let me begin by thanking David Kotok and the Global Interdependence Center for inviting me to speak at today’s conference.  The GIC has a long tradition of organizing sessions to inform us about the important issues affecting the world’s economies.  I am grateful that I have been able to participate in many GIC events over the years.\n\nToday, my topic will be the outlook for the U.S. economy and the appropriate monetary policy settings that will return our economy to price stability. The views I present will be my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nBecause the Super Bowl was played just this past Sunday, I titled my talk “In It to Win It” because the Fed is committed to getting inflation back to our 2 percent goal.  But, of course, returning the economy to price stability is not a game: it is an imperative for sustaining healthy labor markets and our standard of living.  The very high inflation the economy has experienced for almost two years has been painful for households and businesses, especially those with fewer resources, as they have had to cope with increasing costs and make hard choices about where to spend their money. Organizations that offer services to lower-income households have also been struggling with higher costs, limiting their ability to offer aid to as many people.  High inflation also imposes longer-run costs on our economy because it distorts the decisions households and businesses make about building human capital and investing in R&D, plants and equipment, and other forms of physical capital.  These decisions ultimately affect the pace of innovation, productivity growth, the potential growth rate of the economy, and improvement in our living standards.  Because of the negative costs of high inflation, the Fed is resolved and focused on returning to price stability in a timely way: we are in it to win it.\n\nLast year, in the wake of very high inflation, the Fed took deliberate action to remove monetary policy accommodation.  Over the course of 2022, the FOMC raised the federal funds rate, our policy rate, by 4‑1/4 percentage points and began reducing the size of the Fed’s balance sheet by allowing assets to roll off.  At the meeting two weeks ago, the FOMC took another step and raised the target range of the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent and the balance-sheet reduction continues.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the sharp rise in inflation, which started in the spring of 2021 in the U.S., but has also occurred in other advanced economies around the globe.  These factors include the pandemic and how households, businesses, and monetary and fiscal policymakers responded to it, as well as Russia’s war against Ukraine.  An imbalance arose between strong demand and constrained supply, which led to significant upward pressures on prices in an environment of accommodative monetary and fiscal policy.\n\nIncoming economic information shows that our monetary policy actions are having the intended effect of slowing demand and reducing price pressures.  In addition, supply chain disruptions are easing, which is also helping to alleviate some of the imbalance between aggregate demand and aggregate supply.  This is good news, but further monetary policy action is needed to ensure that inflation is on a sustainable downward path to 2 percent.\n\nEconomic Growth\n\nEconomic growth slowed considerably last year, and I expect that growth will be well under trend this year. Real GDP grew at a below-trend pace of 1 percent last year, down from a very robust pace of about 5-3/4 percent in 2021.  Growth in the final quarter of last year was almost 3 percent, but much of that was due to firms rebuilding inventories.  Abstracting from inventories, growth in real final sales was a more modest 1‑1/2 percent, suggesting some dampening in underlying momentum.\n\nInterest-rate-sensitive sectors have been experiencing the sharpest slowdown.  Residential investment continues to decline sharply in response to higher mortgage rates.  Business fixed investment and manufacturing activity have slowed.  Consumer spending, which makes up 70 percent of GDP, has held up, reflecting the strength in household balance sheets.  But it has slowed from the robust pace seen in 2021.\n\nOn the supply side of the economy, supply chain disruptions have improved but not uniformly across sectors and products.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Global Supply Chain Pressure Index fell appreciably during 2022, although it remains above its pre-pandemic level.1  Some of the improvement in this index last month reflects better delivery times from China, consistent with China easing its zero-COVID policy and reopening its economy.  Our business contacts tell us that transportation bottlenecks and delivery times have improved compared to last year but that certain products, including computer chips and electric generators, remain difficult to source.\n\nLabor Markets\n\nDespite the slowdown in growth, labor market conditions remain strong, with labor demand continuing to outpace labor supply.  After some moderation over the past year, there was a sizable gain in payrolls in January, with the economy adding over 500 thousand jobs.  The number of job openings moved down somewhat over the past year, but there are still 1.9 openings per unemployed worker.  The unemployment rate has been running at about 3.5 percent for the past year, a 50-year low, and it actually edged down in January.  Despite these strong numbers, anecdotal reports from our business contacts suggest that conditions are easing in the labor market, except in healthcare where significant hiring challenges remain due to a national shortage of skilled and unskilled healthcare workers.  Although they do not intend to reduce their workforces, many of our business contacts have tempered their demand for workers and those that are hiring say it has become easier to find the workers they need.\n\nOn the supply side, labor force participation has stabilized below its pre-pandemic level.  Over time, it has become apparent that this lower level of participation reflects structural factors such as the high level of retirements over the pandemic, reduced immigration, changes in preferences, and the difficulty in finding affordable childcare.\n\nAn indication that labor demand is outpacing labor supply is strong wage growth.  Labor costs constitute a significant share of a business’s expenses, especially in the service sector.  The strong increase in wages has contributed to higher inflation, yet workers’ wage gains generally have not kept up with inflation.  So, in real terms, many workers are not better off.  Recent data and reports from business contacts suggest that as the economy has slowed, wage growth has started to moderate from its peak last summer.  Nonetheless, nominal wage growth is still around 4-1/2 percent.  Given current estimates of trend productivity growth of between 1 and 1-1/2 percent, this means wage growth is still about 1 to 1‑1/2 percentage points above the level consistent with price stability.\n\nThe imbalance between labor demand and supply will need to continue to shrink to alleviate wage pressures.  Since there is little reason to think that labor force participation will increase significantly in the coming months, labor demand will need to moderate further to reduce the imbalance.  I expect that with the economy growing well below trend, the labor market will cool off, with slower employment growth and a rise in the unemployment rate.  But this moderation in labor demand could come mainly from firms deciding not to add to their payrolls rather than cutting their staffs.  Indeed, many contacts have told me they plan to do all they can to retain workers through the slowdown, given how hard hiring has been over the past couple of years.  This suggests we will see less of an increase in the unemployment rate than is typical in an economic slowdown.\n\nInflation\n\nInflation remains well above our goal of 2 percent.  Recent monthly readings show inflation has eased from its high point last summer, and short-term inflation expectations have moved down with it.  In December, the year-over-year measure of headline PCE inflation moderated to 5 percent, compared to 7 percent in June, with declining energy prices contributing to the decline in overall inflation.  Underlying inflation measures have also shown some improvement.  In December, core PCE inflation was about 4‑1/2 percent compared to 5 percent in June.  Looking at the most recent 3-month period, core PCE inflation is down to 3 percent.  The median and trimmed-mean PCE inflation rates, which exclude components with the most extreme movements each month, have also improved in recent months but to a lesser extent.2\n\nThe improvement in the monthly readings in core inflation has come from the goods sector, where PCE goods prices fell about 3 percent, annualized, over the past three months. Some of that decline reflected an unsustainably sharp drop in used car prices.  So goods inflation is likely to move up in coming months.  Shelter price inflation has not improved, but it is expected to ease later in the year as housing activity continues to weaken and the deceleration in rents in new leases passes through to the inflation measures.  Core services inflation excluding shelter has not improved.  It tends to be sticky, is correlated with wage inflation, and has a large share in the overall index, since consumers spend a larger share of their income on services than on goods.\n\nFor much of the pre-pandemic expansion, core goods inflation was slightly negative, on average, and falling goods prices were pulling inflation down.  By the end of that expansion, inflation was nearing our target.  In January 2020, PCE inflation had reached 1.8 percent and core inflation had risen to 1.7 percent.  That reading reflected 0.75 percent deflation in core goods prices and 2.5 percent inflation in core services prices.  That is very different from today. In the current period of high inflation, which began in the spring of 2021, core goods prices have been rising, and for much of this period until recently, inflation in core goods has exceeded inflation in core services.  To achieve our longer-run goal of 2 percent inflation, we will need to see continued sustained disinflation in both components.\n\nMy expectation is that we will see a meaningful improvement in inflation this year and further improvement over the following year, with inflation reaching our 2 percent goal in 2025.  But my outlook is contingent on appropriate monetary policy.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nIn making its monetary policy decisions, the FOMC is always guided by its strong commitment to achieving its statutory goals of price stability and maximum employment.  The FOMC has come an appreciable way in bringing policy from a very accommodative stance to a restrictive one, but I believe we have more work to do.  Precisely how much higher the federal funds rate will need to go and for how long policy will need to remain restrictive will depend on how much inflation and inflation expectations are moving down, and that will depend on how much demand is slowing, supply challenges are being resolved, and price pressures are easing.  At this juncture, the incoming data have not changed my view that we will need to bring the fed funds rate above 5 percent and hold it there for some time to be sufficiently restrictive to ensure that inflation is on a sustainable path back to 2 percent.  Indeed, at our meeting two weeks ago, setting aside what financial market participants expected us to do, I saw a compelling economic case for a 50-basis-point increase, which would have brought the top of the target range to 5 percent.\n\nMy view of appropriate policy is contingent on my economic outlook, which is informed by incoming data, the real-time reconnaissance provided by our regional contacts, and a variety of economic models and analyses.  The FOMC likes to say that its policy decisions are data dependent, but that doesn’t mean we react to one or two data points.  Instead, I view “data dependent” as shorthand for saying that incoming economic information informs my economic outlook and assessment of risks, which, in turn, informs my view of appropriate monetary policy.\n\nIn addition to my economic outlook, my policy views are also importantly influenced by risk-management considerations, including the risks to the economic outlook and my assessment of the costs of continued high inflation to households, businesses, and the longer-run health of the economy.\n\nIt is welcome news to see some moderation in inflation readings since last summer, but the level of inflation matters and it is still too high. January’s CPI inflation report showed a jump in the monthly rate of overall inflation and no improvement in underlying inflation.  The report provides a cautionary tale against concluding too soon that inflation is on a timely and sustained path back to 2 percent.\n\nI continue to see the risks to the inflation forecast as tilted to the upside for a number of reasons.  Russia’s continuing war in Ukraine adds uncertainty to the inflation picture, particularly for food and energy prices.  While energy prices have moved down, partly because of mild winter weather in Europe, they could move up again, as could food prices.  Indeed, in January, energy prices in the CPI rose strongly and food prices also advanced.  These items constitute a sizable share of the consumption basket for many households, particularly those with lower incomes.  They also influence short-term inflation expectations.\n\nChina is another source of risk.  On the one hand, the reopening of China is helping to ease supply chain disruptions.  But China is also a major world economy and increasing demand there will put upward pressure on commodity prices.\n\nSeveral private-sector forecasters do not expect inflation to return to 2 percent until sometime next year.  According to the median in the December FOMC Summary of Economic Projections, this goal will not be reached until 2025.3 If that comes to pass, it means that inflation will have been above 2 percent for over 4 years, and well above 2 percent for much of that time.  Even that forecast could turn out to be optimistic.  Some recent research by economists at the Cleveland Fed presents a plausible case, based on a model and historical relationships in the data, that inflation could end up being much more persistent than current projections, despite the actions the FOMC has taken.4 While this research has not altered my view that there will be material improvement in inflation this year, it does inform my view that the risks to inflation remain on the upside.\n\nThe upside risks to inflation and historical experience suggest to me that the costs of undershooting on policy or prematurely loosening policy still outweigh the costs of overshooting.  Under-tightening raises the risk that inflation will settle in stubbornly above our goal, imposing both short-run and long-run costs on households and businesses.  It could result in longer-term inflation expectations moving higher, which would make it much harder and more costly to return to price stability.  Over-tightening also has costs, but if inflation begins to move down faster than anticipated, we can react appropriately.\n\nGiven the risks and costs, we need to be prepared to move the federal funds rate higher if the upside risks to inflation are realized and inflation fails to moderate as expected or if the imbalances between demand and supply in product and labor markets persist longer than anticipated.\n\nSummary\n\nIn summary, inflation remains too high and it is the responsibility of the FOMC to bring it down.  So the FOMC is resolute in continuing to bring monetary policy to a sufficiently restrictive stance to ensure that inflation returns to our 2 percent goal in a timely way. Tighter financial conditions will result in growth well below trend this year and some cooling off in labor markets, with slower employment growth and an increase in the unemployment rate from its very low level.  These developments will help to alleviate price and wage pressures.  As a result, I expect to see good progress on inflation this year.\n\nWe are operating in an uncertain environment and economic conditions can evolve in unexpected ways.  With growth well below trend, it wouldn’t take much of a negative shock to push growth into negative territory for a time.  Most of our business contacts are preparing for a mild recession.  Similarly, inflation dynamics over this expansion have been influenced in important ways by the pandemic and the war in Ukraine, and we need to be very open to the idea that inflation can evolve differently than we expect.  To help me formulate my economic outlook and policy views over the year, I will be looking at a variety of incoming data and collecting economic and financial information from our business, labor market, and community contacts.\n\nThe transition back to price stability will take some time and will not be without some pain.  There will be some bumps along the way as the economy slows, but high inflation is also very painful.  I do not view the current situation as one in which there is a tradeoff between our two monetary policy goals because returning to price stability in a timely way is the best way to ensure a healthy labor market over the longer run.  So I plan to remain diligent in setting monetary policy to return the economy to price stability and to be judicious in balancing the risks so as to minimize the pain of the journey.\n\nIn short, I remain in it to win it."

            "content": "diligent (adj): having or showing care and conscientiousness in one’s work or duties\n\nI thank Markus Brunnermeier for inviting me to speak in the webinar series he runs as director of the Princeton Bendheim Center for Finance.  I make it a point to listen to his webcast, so it is a real honor to participate in this series.  Of course, the views I present will be my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nLast week, the FOMC raised its target range of the federal funds rate by 75 basis points to 3-3/4 to 4 percent.  We also indicated that we anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain a monetary policy stance that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent.  Given the level and persistence of inflation, the journey back to 2 percent inflation will likely take some time.  The FOMC is also continuing the process of reducing the size of the Fed’s balance sheet by allowing assets to roll off, which also helps to firm the stance of monetary policy.\n\n[Figure 1. Federal funds rate]\n\nThe move last week was the fourth 75-basis-point increase in as many meetings and the funds rate target is now 375 basis points higher than it was at the start of the year.  Compared to history, this has been a brisk pace of increases in our policy rate.  But compared to history, the economy is experiencing very high and persistent inflation, and the real policy rate is just beginning to move into restrictive territory.  Nonetheless, overall financial conditions are tighter than at the start of the year: Treasury yields, mortgage rates, and credit spreads are higher, the dollar has appreciated, and equity prices are lower.\n\n[Figure 2. Inflation, year-over-year]\n\nIndeed, unacceptably high and persistent inflation remains the key challenge facing the U.S. economy.  Inflation rates remain at 40-year highs.  Measured year-over-year, in September, PCE inflation was still running over 6 percent and core PCE inflation moved up in September to over 5 percent.  The median and trimmed-mean measures, which exclude components with the most extreme movements each month, tell a similar story of persistently high inflation.1\n\n[Figure 3. Inflation, 3-month change, annualized]\n\nA positive sign is that the three-month changes in underlying inflation measures are lower now than they were in June, although they remain high.  Other positive signs are that commodity prices have moved down and goods inflation has begun to ease.  This morning’s October CPI report also suggests some easing in overall and core inflation.  On the other hand, services inflation, which tends to be sticky, has not yet shown signs of slowing.  In addition, inflation continues to be broad-based.  In September’s PCE inflation report, the prices of about half of the items people buy were at least 5 percent higher than they were a year ago, and we’ve seen little improvement in this share.  Inflation is particularly difficult for people in lower-income households, who spend a larger share of their income on essentials like food, shelter, and energy, components that have seen some of the largest price increases.\n\n[Figure 4. GDP growth and sectors]\n\nIn order for inflation to fall, there will need to be further slowing in product and labor markets, bringing demand into better balance with supply to alleviate price pressures.  We are beginning to see demand in product markets slowing, partly in response to higher interest rates.  Real output contracted in the first half of the year.  It grew in the third quarter, but final sales to private domestic purchasers were essentially flat.  Growth in consumer spending slowed and residential investment fell significantly.  While equipment spending grew at a healthy pace in the third quarter, readings of new orders from the ISM and regional Federal Reserve manufacturing surveys indicate that equipment spending is likely to slow in the coming months. On the supply side, improvement in supplier delivery times and anecdotal reports from my business contacts indicate some welcome easing in supply bottlenecks.  On balance, I expect real GDP growth to be well below trend this year and next year.\n\n[Figure 5. Employment growth and the unemployment rate]\n\nThere has been a slight moderation in labor market conditions, but the labor market remains tight.  Job gains have slowed to an average of about 290 thousand per month over the past three months compared to about 540 thousand per month over the comparable period a year ago and job openings are lower than they were in March.  Nonetheless, there are still almost two openings per unemployed person, which is well above the level in the strong labor market in 2019. And even with some slowing in output growth, business contacts continue to report that they cannot find the workers they need.  The unemployment rate, at 3.7 percent, is still very low by historical standards.\n\n[Figure 6. Employment Cost Index]\n\nAnother indication that labor demand is outpacing labor supply is strong wage growth.  The year-over-year growth rate of the employment cost index is 5 percent, well above the level consistent with price stability, based on estimates of trend productivity growth.\n\nAlthough growth is slowing, there continue to be some upside risks to the inflation forecast.  Russia’s continuing war against Ukraine could mean gas and energy prices move higher again this winter and next winter.  And I remain cognizant of the fact that economists’ forecasts – private sector, the FOMC’s, and my own – have underestimated the level of inflation and its persistence for almost two years.  Nonetheless, I do expect inflation to begin to slow meaningfully next year and the following year, reaching our 2 percent goal in 2025.  This is because the FOMC is strongly committed to returning the economy to price stability.  We will be diligent in making that happen, that is, we will proceed with care and conscientiousness.\n\n[Figure 7. Near-term and longer-term inflation expectations]\n\nThe behavior of longer-term inflation expectations reflects that commitment.  Near-term expectations have risen significantly with actual inflation, and they have fallen in recent months as gasoline prices have declined. Inflation expectations over the longer term have risen much less.  They remain reasonably well anchored at levels consistent with our goal and that should help to lower inflation without as large of a slowdown in activity.  However, we cannot take that anchoring for granted. The longer actual inflation and near-term inflation expectations remain elevated, the greater the risk that longer-term inflation expectations become unanchored and high inflation permeates wage- and price-setting behavior and investment decisions, making it much more costly to return inflation to our goal.\n\n[Figure 8. November FOMC statement forward guidance]\n\nWe have moved rates up expeditiously this year, starting from a very accommodative stance to a stance that is becoming restrictive.  The focus had been on how quickly we could get to that restrictive stance.  Now the focus can shift to the appropriate level of restrictiveness that will return the economy to price stability in a timely way.  Given the current level of inflation, its broad-based nature, and its persistence, I believe monetary policy will need to become more restrictive and remain restrictive for a while in order to put inflation on a sustainable downward path to 2 percent.  As indicated in the FOMC statement last week, in determining the pace of future increases, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.  All of these factors figure into the economic outlook and risks around the outlook, which inform our policy decisions.\n\nPrecisely how much higher the fed funds rate will need to go and for how long policy will need to remain restrictive will depend on how much inflation and inflation expectations are moving down, which depends on how much demand is slowing, supply challenges are being resolved, and price pressures are easing.  To help me make the assessment of how high and how long, I will be looking at a variety of incoming information and data, including the official statistics, survey evidence, and reports from our business, labor market, and community contacts, which are more forward looking than other data sources.  In December, the Committee will be releasing a new set of economic projections, which will incorporate each participant’s thinking about the appropriate path of policy.\n\nThe transition back to price stability will take some time and will not be without some pain.  It is likely that there will continue to be higher-than-normal levels of financial market volatility, which can be difficult to navigate.  With growth likely to be well below trend, it could easily turn negative for a time.  Business contacts tell us that given how hard it has been to attract and retain workers over the last two years, they intend to keep their workers even as the economy slows.  If so, we could see less of an increase in the unemployment rate than is typical in an economic slowdown.  However, it is also possible that the unemployment rate could go up more than anticipated and this would impose difficulties on households and businesses.\n\nBut it is important to remember that the current very high inflation is painful as well, as less well-off people and businesses struggle to make ends meet.  Moreover, we should not underestimate the consequences of continued elevated inflation on the long-run health of the economy.  Without price stability, businesses and households have to divert their attention to trying to preserve the purchasing power of their money.  It becomes more difficult to plan for the future and to make long-term commitments, and decisions regarding investments in physical and human capital are distorted.  Without price stability we will not be able to sustain healthy labor market conditions over the medium and long run, which is inconsistent with the maximum employment part of our dual mandate.  This means that continued high inflation can have negative long-run implications for an economy’s potential growth rate and standard of living.  So returning the economy to price stability remains our priority.\n\nAs is always the case when we are transitioning monetary policy, we will need to continue to weigh the risks of tightening too much against the risks of tightening too little.  Tightening too much would slow the economy more than necessary and entail higher costs than needed.  Tightening too little would allow high inflation to persist, with short- and long-run consequences, and necessitate a much more costly journey back to price stability.  We will need to be very diligent in setting monetary policy to return the economy to price stability and be judicious in balancing these risks so as to minimize the pain of the journey.\n\nDespite the moves we have made so far, given that inflation has consistently proven to be more persistent than expected and there are significant costs of continued high inflation, I currently view the larger risks as coming from tightening too little.  As policy moves further into restrictive territory, the effects of our cumulative tightening will work through to the broader economy, and I anticipate that we will see inflation pressures ease.  At that point, I expect that my view of the balance of these risks will shift, and I will welcome that shift because it will mean that inflation is moving down in a meaningful way."

            "content": "I thank the Economic Club of New York for the opportunity to speak with you today. I am looking forward to the dialog. It is likely no surprise that I will focus my prepared remarks on inflation and how monetary policymakers will persevere in fostering a return to price stability. The views I present will be my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nUnacceptably high and persistent inflation remains the key challenge facing the U.S. economy. Inflation has been running well above 2 percent for almost a year and a half, and the risks to inflation forecasts are skewed to the upside. Everyone is feeling the brunt of high inflation. It is imposing a particularly onerous burden on those households and businesses that do not have the wherewithal to pay more for essentials like food, gasoline, and shelter. Lower-income households spend a higher proportion of their income on these essentials, and these components have had some of the strongest price increases. We have moved from a situation in which households and businesses could be rationally inattentive to inflation to one in which inflation is on everyone’s mind, with lower-income households having to make hard choices about how to spend their money to make ends meet.\n\nPrice stability is the foundation of a strong economy. It is necessary for ensuring that the U.S. can sustain healthy labor market conditions over the medium and longer run and that the economy can be productive and live up to its potential for everyone’s benefit. Without price stability, businesses and households have to divert attention to trying to preserve the purchasing power of their money, and it becomes more difficult to plan for the future and to make long-term commitments and investments. Hence, high inflation can have negative long-run implications for an economy’s potential growth rate and standard of living.\n\nThe FOMC is strongly committed to using its tools to return the economy to price stability and it will persevere to make this happen. We are taking decisive action to remove monetary policy accommodation to bring demand into better balance with constrained supply in both product and labor markets. Since March, the FOMC has reduced monetary policy accommodation by raising the target range of the fed funds rate by 3 percentage points and by reducing assets the Fed is holding on its balance sheet.\n\nGiven the current level of inflation, its broad-based nature, and its persistence, I believe monetary policy will need to become more restrictive in order to put inflation on a sustainable downward path to 2 percent. Given appropriately restrictive financial conditions, my modal outlook is that inflation will move down appreciably next year, to about 3-1/2 percent, and continue to decline, reaching our 2 percent goal in 2025. I anticipate that the return to price stability will entail a period of output growth that is well below trend over the next two years. This below-trend growth will lead to slower employment growth, with the unemployment rate moving up to 4-1/2 percent by the end of next year and up a bit more in 2024. We are likely to experience higher-than-normal levels of financial market volatility as well. At this point, indices constructed by the St. Louis Fed and the Kansas City Fed point to low levels of financial stress, but we will need to remain attentive to financial vulnerabilities.1 With growth well below trend over the next couple of years, it is possible that a shock could push the U.S. economy into recession for a time. None of this is painless, but the high inflation we are experiencing is already inflicting pain on many people. The necessary costs incurred now for the economy to transition back to price stability are much lower than the costs borne later were inflation to become embedded in the economy, influencing wage- and price-setting behavior, investment decisions, and longer-term productivity growth. Perhaps Paul Volcker said it best as he fought inflation in the 1980s: “…failure to carry through now in the fight on inflation will only make any subsequent effort more difficult, at much greater risk to the economy.”2\n\nEconomic Growth\n\nThe inflation we are experiencing today stems from many factors, but fundamentally, it reflects an imbalance between strong demand and constrained supply, which has led to significant upward pressures on prices. Indeed, both aggregate demand and aggregate supply were affected by the pandemic and by the responses of households, businesses, and policymakers to it. Mandated shutdowns and the voluntary pullback in demand for high-contact services led to a shift in spending early in the pandemic from services to goods. When the economy reopened, demand surged. This strong demand was supported by the extraordinary level of fiscal transfers and accommodative monetary policy applied during the height of the pandemic.\n\nEconomic growth is slowing down from last year’s robust 5-3/4 percent pace. Indeed, the level of real GDP decreased in the first half of this year, but current estimates suggest that it resumed rising in the second half. Activity is slowing partly in response to the monetary policy actions taken this year, which have led to tighter overall financial conditions. This is most easily seen in the housing market. Housing demand increased during the pandemic as housing preferences shifted. Housing supply, which was already somewhat constrained before the pandemic, could not keep up with increased demand and house prices rose. This year housing market activity has slowed appreciably as mortgage rates have risen 3-1/2 percentage points since the start of the year. Housing starts and sales have moved down. House price inflation is beginning to ease but the year-over-year increase in house prices is still in double digits and well above pre-pandemic levels; growth in rents also remains high.\n\nIn addition to tighter financial conditions, the slowdown in economic activity more broadly reflects how households and businesses are responding to very high inflation and their concerns about the economic outlook, to the waning effects of the pandemic fiscal stimulus, and to slower growth abroad. Both consumer spending and business investment have decelerated from the robust pace seen last year, and as the effects of the pandemic have waned, consumption has begun to shift from goods to services.\n\nThe supply side of the economy remains constrained relative to demand. There are signs that supply chain bottlenecks, which have stemmed from pandemic-related shutdowns across the globe and the war in Ukraine, have begun to ease.3 Our business contacts tell us that supply chain disruptions remain a challenge but over time they have learned to navigate through them more effectively. They report that the larger factor holding back production is the lack of available workers.\n\nLabor Markets\n\nWe are seeing some signs of moderation in the labor market, but overall conditions remain very strong and labor demand is still outpacing labor supply. The number of job openings has fallen this year, but there are still 1.7 openings per unemployed person. Back in 2019, another time of tight labor markets, there were about 1.2 openings per unemployed worker. Last year, job gains averaged over 550 thousand per month. This year, through September, job gains have eased to an average of 420 thousand per month, but that is still very strong job growth by historical standards. The unemployment rate is lower now than it was at the start of the year, and at 3.5 percent is at a 50-year low. The participation rate of prime-age workers has returned to where one would expect it to be based on demographics. Many people chose to retire during the pandemic and left the labor force, and the overall participation rate, which includes those of retirement age, has risen only gradually.\n\nA continued rise in participation would be helpful in easing the imbalance between labor demand and supply. But typically, most people who have retired and have begun to receive Social Security payments do not return to the job market. I don’t expect to get much help from immigration either: net migration has been declining since the late 1990s. So it is likely that much of the rebalancing will need to come on the labor demand side. This could occur mainly through firms reducing the number of workers they are seeking rather than through layoffs. Indeed, many employers have told us that because it has been so hard to attract and retain workers over the past two years, they will strive to keep them on their payrolls even if demand for their products slows down. This would result in a smaller rise in the unemployment rate than has been seen in other economic slowdowns.\n\nThe imbalance between labor demand and supply has put upward pressure on wages. The employment cost index for private industry workers accelerated over the six months ending in June, rising at a 6 percent annual pace. If you squint, more recent reports suggest that wage pressures may be starting to stabilize. For example, average hourly earnings rose at about a 4-1/2 percent annual pace in the three months ending in September, compared to a little over 4-3/4 percent in 2021. With trend productivity growth estimated to be around 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent, nominal wage growth will need to moderate to around 3-1/4 to 3-1/2 percent to be consistent with price stability. Even with the moderation in nominal wage growth that will occur as the economy returns to price stability, workers will be better off. In real terms, workers have been losing ground because wage increases have not kept up with inflation. Indeed, since April of last year, wages adjusted for inflation have been declining. If real wages continue to decline, it will be difficult to attract people back to the workforce, exacerbating the imbalance in the labor market.\n\nInflation\n\nDespite some moderation on the demand side of the economy and nascent signs of improvement in supply side conditions, there has been no progress on inflation. Inflation readings have persisted at the highest levels in 40 years. Measured year-over-year, in August, PCE inflation was still running over 6 percent and CPI inflation was over 8 percent. The core measures, which omit food and energy prices, and the median and trimmed-mean measures, which exclude components with the most extreme movements each month, tell a similar story of broad-based, persistently high inflation.4 I note that we look at these measures not because food and energy prices or the prices of other volatile components, such as apparel, are not important parts of a household’s consumption basket. Indeed, our long-run inflation target is based on total PCE inflation, which includes all components. But we look at these alternative measures because they can give us a better sense of where inflation is likely going. Measured year-over-year, these underlying inflation measures all moved up in August. The month-to-month changes in the inflation measures have shown no real decline, so we cannot even say inflation has peaked yet, let alone that it is on a sustainable downward path to 2 percent. Given developments related to the ongoing war in Ukraine, gas and energy prices may move higher again later this year. In addition, services inflation, which tends to be persistent, is at its highest level since the early 1990s, with growth in housing rent and shelter costs likely to keep inflation elevated for some time.\n\nIn my view, even with appropriate monetary policy actions, given inflation dynamics, it will take a couple of years before inflation returns to the Fed’s 2 percent goal. But I do expect to see meaningful progress over the next year as output growth and employment growth slow and there is some improvement in supply side conditions. A key factor in this outlook is that medium- and longer-term inflation expectations remain anchored at levels consistent with our 2 percent goal despite current high inflation readings. This anchoring should help to bring inflation back to our goal without as large a change in the output gap. It is the job of monetary policymakers to ensure that inflation expectations remain well anchored.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nIn making its monetary policy decisions, the FOMC is always guided by its strong commitment to achieving its congressionally mandated goals of price stability and maximum employment. And as always, we are calibrating our monetary policy based on the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and on the progress toward our monetary policy goals.\n\nMonetary policy acts with a lag on the economy so we need to be forward looking. It is unlikely that we have seen the full effects on households and businesses of the latest rate increases we have implemented and it would not be appropriate to continue moving rates up until inflation is back down to 2 percent. But it is also the case that based on Fed communications, financial conditions began to tighten well before our first rate increase in March and those effects have been passing through to the economy. Yet high inflation persists, an indication that we need to increase rates further.\n\nIn order to put inflation on a sustained downward trajectory to 2 percent, policy will need to move into a restrictive stance. That means that short-term interest rates adjusted for expected inflation, that is, real interest rates, will need to move into positive territory and remain there for some time. Although we have raised the nominal fed funds rate by 300 basis points, policy is not yet restrictive. The median projection for the longer-run nominal fed funds rate in the September Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) of FOMC participants is 2.5 percent, which is my own estimate as well.5 This means that if inflation were 2 percent, and inflation expectations were well anchored at levels consistent with that goal, a real fed funds rate of half of a percent would be neutral in the sense of neither stimulating nor restraining economic activity. But that is an important “if.” Currently, inflation and shorter-term inflation expectations are well above 2 percent. If we adjust the current nominal fed funds rate by the SEP median projection for inflation next year, which is 2.8 percent, policy is still a tad accommodative. Further funds rate increases are needed to get policy into a restrictive stance, and the median fed funds rate path in the SEP has rates moving up to 4.4 percent by the end of this year and to 4.6 percent next year.\n\nBecause I see more persistence in inflation than the median SEP projection, the funds rate path I submitted for the September SEP was a bit higher over the next year than the median path, and I do not anticipate any cuts in the fed funds target range next year. But let me emphasize that this is based on my current reading of the economy and outlook, and I will adjust my views as warranted based on the implications of incoming economic and financial information for the outlook and risks around the outlook. While it is clear that the fed funds rate needs to move up from its current level, the size of rate increases at any particular FOMC meeting and the peak fed funds rate will depend on the inflation outlook, which depends on the assessment of how rapidly aggregate demand and supply are coming back into better balance and price pressures are being reduced. Given lags in the data, the reconnaissance we receive from our contacts about what is happening on the ground in real-time will be particularly important in assessing the effects of the cumulative tightening on the economy. Making this assessment will be challenging because both the demand and the supply sides of the U.S. economy will continue to be affected by a variety of factors. This includes economic and policy developments in the rest of the world, which can affect the U.S. economy through trade and financial market channels.\n\nWe will be operating in an uncertain environment for some time. High uncertainty is usually associated with being cautious, and being cautious is often associated with acting inertially. But in the current environment of high and persistent inflation, a risk management, robust control approach counsels that being cautious does not mean doing less. Instead, it means being very careful to not allow wishful thinking to substitute for compelling evidence, leading one to prematurely declare victory over inflation and pause or reverse rate increases too soon. It means not being complacent that inflation expectations will remain well anchored in this high inflation environment but taking appropriate actions to keep them anchored.\n\nIt has been very helpful that medium- and longer-term inflation expectations have moved up less than short-run expectations. They are below current inflation readings, an indication that the public believes that inflation will move back down. Yet the recent declines in medium- and longer-term expectations occurred as gasoline prices declined; the jury is still out about whether these readings will rise again if gasoline prices move back up. In addition, every month that inflation remains highly elevated raises the chances that inflation expectations will become unanchored and that firms and households will begin to make decisions based on persistently high inflation. If that were to happen, returning to price stability would be more difficult and much more costly in terms of lost output and higher unemployment. Even if one doesn’t think an unanchoring of inflation expectations is the most likely scenario, the costs of being wrong are high given the current state of the economy. So the robust control approach encourages strong action to keep expectations anchored to prevent the worst-case outcome from actually occurring.6 In my view, in the current environment, being cautious means that the FOMC should persevere in taking policy actions to return the economy to price stability.\n\nSummary\n\nIn summary, inflation remains very elevated and is placing a large burden on households and businesses. The FOMC is committed to taking appropriate action to tighten financial conditions by raising the fed funds rate and continuing to reduce the assets on the Fed’s balance sheet in order to return the economy to price stability. Monetary policy is moving into restrictive territory and will need to be there for some time in order to put inflation on a sustained downward path to our 2 percent goal. We will be looking at a variety of incoming data and collecting economic and financial information from our business, labor market, and community contacts to help guide our policy decisions. As is always the case when we are transitioning monetary policy, we will need to continue to weigh the risks of tightening too much against the risks of tightening too little. Given current economic conditions and the outlook, in my view, at this point the larger risks come from tightening too little and allowing very high inflation to persist and become embedded in the economy. As the effects of tighter policy work through the broader economy, I expect my view of the balance of these risks will shift, and I am looking forward to that time because it will mean that we have made meaningful progress on the transition back to price stability."

            "content": "I thank Ellen Bromagen and the other organizers for inviting me to speak again at the Chicago Payments Symposium. It is truly an honor to participate in this symposium, which, under Ellen’s leadership, is a premier event for sharing ideas and for gathering insights from those who are involved in the payment system. At this time of dramatic change in payments, I feel privileged to chair the Fed’s Financial Services Policy Committee (FSPC), which oversees the provision of the Fed’s payment services to deposit institutions and the U.S. Treasury. And I want to thank Ellen for being such a key member of our committee, providing insights from her years of experience working in payments. I would also like to take this opportunity to extend my sincere appreciation to Federal Reserve Bank presidents Charles Evans and Esther George, who will be stepping down from their roles in January. Throughout their careers at the Fed, Charlie and Esther have been strong and dedicated leaders working on behalf of the public. They have made important contributions to all aspects of the Fed’s work, including monetary policy, banking supervision, financial stability, community development, and payments. Indeed, their leadership has been instrumental in the System’s success in supporting the ongoing modernization of the payment system. I am very grateful to count Esther and Charlie as friends and I appreciate their mentorship – although they may have wished for a better student.\n\nThis morning, I will discuss some efforts the Federal Reserve has underway, in collaboration with the industry and other payments stakeholders, to modernize the payment system, a critical part of the infrastructure in the U.S. Of course, the views I present will be my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nThe Fed’s Modernization Efforts\n\nBecause the current payment system works well, most people have spent little time thinking about the backbone that makes these payments possible and ensures that the payment system is reliable and secure. This rational inattention is just as it should be. But with the changes brought by new technology and the entry of new service providers, more people are seeking new ways to execute transactions, whether it be online or via cell phone, and they want to execute them faster. The modernization efforts underway aim to foster a system that is not only efficient, secure, and effective, but also one that is innovative, adaptable, resilient, and accessible to everyone: a payment system that consumers and businesses can rely on with confidence to efficiently make purchases, pay bills, and get paid. Indeed, ensuring that the public can be confident in the system is a critical ingredient in achieving a better payment system, so innovations aimed at efficiency must also be designed for security and resiliency.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has taken a collaborative approach in its modernization efforts. Ten years ago, the Fed recognized that the payment system was at an inflection point. New technologies were being developed and increasingly used, and the expectations of the end users of the payment system were also evolving. These conditions portended a period of rapid transformation in the end-to-end payments landscape. The Fed engaged with a diverse set of payment-system stakeholders, and we all came to agree that the U.S. payment system needed to evolve further and faster to support the changing nature of commerce, keep pace with the global economy, meet the changing needs of end users and offer them better value, and address new and ongoing threats to security. Again engaging with stakeholders, the Fed established strategies to improve the payment system in terms of the speed, security, and efficiency of domestic and cross-border payments.1 These strategies, along with tactics, were published in 2015 and they have guided the Fed’s modernization efforts.\n\nOver the ten years since the Fed recognized that the U.S. payment system needed improvement, two things have happened. First, as foreseen, the payments landscape has undergone significant change. New entrants, shifting user needs, and digitalization have all shaped new models and methods for making payments. Traditional providers and fintech firms are coming to market with products that better meet customers’ needs in terms of convenience and that address long-standing frictions in the payment system. New technologies have shaped the public’s expectations for faster, more efficient, and broadly accessible payment services that, at the same time, are safe and secure.\n\nThe second thing that has occurred is considerable progress toward the goal of a better payment system that benefits all, a goal shared by the Federal Reserve, the industry, and end users. What both the private sector and the public sector have accomplished in a relatively short period of time is impressive, particularly given the complexity and interconnectedness of the U.S. financial infrastructure. This progress underscores the value of collaboration. Indeed, the Fed working collaboratively with a broad array of payment participants was one of the five strategies included in our 2015 paper that catalyzed our current modernization efforts.\n\nLet me now touch on a few examples of current and future innovations.\n\nCurrent Payment Innovations\n\nInnovative digital payments products are filling gaps, addressing inefficiencies, and expanding payments access to underserved consumers. According to a 2021 Fed survey, nearly seven out of 10 consumers use mobile payment devices to send or receive payments, and this usage spans consumers of all ages.2 This is a considerable increase from 2013, when only one in 10 consumers had ever made a mobile payment. In addition to using services from their primary bank or credit union, 83 percent of consumers are using a digital wallet or a fintech payment app at least occasionally to complete transactions, including 71 percent of those age 55 and older.3\n\nOf course, the pandemic has had a wide-ranging and uneven impact on firms’ and households’ payment behaviors and patterns. The share of retail sales done electronically jumped during the pandemic, but this share began increasing much earlier. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, e-commerce sales accounted for about 6 percent of total U.S. retail sales in 2013. That share has now risen to about 14 percent.4 It seems clear that the consumer’s preference for digital payments, which has been spurred by industry innovation, is here to stay. Apps created by financial institutions and fintech providers are increasingly easy to use and access. Other digital tools have significantly improved money management and financial access for consumers, including those with low or moderate incomes, who have historically been underserved. At the same time, because maintaining the public’s confidence in the payment system is a public good, it is important to ensure that consumers using these new payments products understand how these new products compare with other payment instruments, including cash, in terms of risks and benefits. Ensuring that new products and payments rails are built with security and resiliency in mind from the very start is essential if the modernization of the payment system is to live up to its promise.\n\nOne negative trend affecting the payment system is the increase in fraud. Fraud has the potential to undermine the public’s confidence in the payment system, and staying ahead of the fraudsters requires constant vigilance because of the increasing sophistication of the frauds being perpetrated. Scams abound and are constantly changing. Bad actors are hacking into systems by using bots, phishing schemes, and social networks to exploit weaknesses in the system. Payment fraud comes in a variety of forms. According to one estimate, synthetic identity fraud, in which personal identifiable information such as a Social Security number is used to fabricate a person or entity in order to commit a fraudulent act, accounted for $20 billion in losses for U.S. financial institutions in 2020.5, 6 Remote authentication fraud, in which a new account is fraudulently created in someone’ else’s name, or a victim’s account is taken over by using stolen credentials or information, is also on the rise.7\n\nTo help its financial institution customers better fight fraud, the Fed has published a series of research briefs and has expanded educational resources in concert with industry participants. The FraudClassifierSM model is a good example of our recent efforts with the industry. The model can be used regardless of the payment type, payment channel, or payment characteristics to facilitate more consistent fraud classifications. This can help an organization improve its fraud management and responses, as well as more effectively educate its customers on current fraud methods and how to protect themselves.8\n\nThe Fed is also working constantly to strengthen the defenses and enhance the resilience of our clearing and settlement platforms. While we have remained secure from ever-growing cybersecurity threats, we do not take that for granted. We are continuously working to enhance the cybersecurity and resiliency of our own systems, applications, and data, to ensure that we can detect and prevent an attack on our systems, and if one were to occur, making sure we can minimize the time it takes to contain it and limit the business impact on our customers and the broader public. We regularly obtain cyber intelligence on how actors may attempt to attack critical Federal Reserve payment systems; we regularly test our controls to determine their capabilities in preventing these attacks from being successful; and we are continuously improving and testing our preparedness against a potential ransomware attack, which is a top threat for organizations, including the Fed.\n\nThe Fed is also focused on enhancing payment efficiency. Just like consumers, American businesses are eager to go electronic with payment options that provide immediate access to funds and support straight-through processing of invoice, payment, and remittance data. Despite that desire, check usage remains high for business-to-business (B2B) payments because current electronic options pose challenges for payments reconciliation. To help remedy this impediment, the Fed is collaborating with the Business Payments Coalition to modernize B2B payments. One of the fruits of that collaboration is the e-invoice exchange market pilot. This is an effort to build and test a virtual network that will enable businesses of all kinds to exchange e-invoices by establishing a secure and open delivery framework between providers.9 The collaboration has also determined that the electronic exchange framework could be adapted so that businesses could share with one another a payment’s remittance information.\n\nPerhaps the most visible and eagerly anticipated innovation in payments is the establishment of instant payment capabilities. In the Fed’s 2021 payments survey, 62 percent of consumers said they expected to be using faster payment options more extensively in the future, particularly options that offer robust fraud protections.10 Meanwhile, nearly two-thirds of businesses we surveyed in 2020 said that they would factor access to faster payments into future decisions on whether to switch banks.11\n\nThe industry has made great strides in offering faster payments, and building in security features, including identity management, authentication, and robustness. Real-time settlement is an important security feature of faster payments. When settlement is deferred, the payee’s service provider is taking on credit risk until it gets the funds from the payer’s service provider. To reduce this risk, some, but not all, of the faster payment systems around the world couple real-time or near real-time settlement with faster payments.12\n\nThe Federal Reserve will launch its own instant payments rail incorporating real-time clearing and settlement, the FedNow℠ Service, between May and July of next year.13 As was discussed yesterday at the symposium, the Fed’s goals in offering instant payments through FedNow include providing greater flexibility to consumers and businesses through instant access to their funds; increasing access to the payment system for more consumers; offering the potential for greater efficiency in B2B payments by including invoice and remittance data within payment messages; and leveling the playing field for competition. This faster-payments rail and the innovation that will emerge around it hold great promise in making both domestic and cross-border payments more efficient and more accessible to all.\n\nThe Fed has spent several years planning for and investing in FedNow and its launch is fast approaching. Financial institutions will be able to connect to the service either directly, via their core processors, or through a technology service provider. Now is the time for industry stakeholders, including financial institutions and core service providers, to prepare themselves to use the new service, and the Fed is leaning in on stakeholder engagement to ensure everyone is ready. Our pilot testing program has more than 120 participants and our FedNow Community portal is a great place to get information.14 We realize that for many financial institutions, getting ready to use FedNow will take some investment. Some organizations will need to upgrade 40-year-old payment infrastructures, accounting procedures, and other back-office processes to accommodate the expanded 24×7 operating hours. But the Fed is asking you to make those investments so that you’ll be prepared to offer this new instant payments service to your customers, who are increasingly demanding faster payments.\n\nFuture Payment Innovations\n\nAs we continue to make improvements to the payment system today, we also have to prepare for the future. It is important for us to ensure that our payment system evolves in a productive way. Innovation, competition, collaboration, broad accessibility, common standards, risk management, and appropriate supervision and regulation – all are important facets of a well-functioning payment system.\n\nInnovation in payments is not going to stop. Partnerships between traditional financial institutions and newer fintech firms are becoming more common. Indeed, many fintech firms have participated in the Federal Reserve’s FedNow Service Provider Showcase, a one-stop resource that connects financial institutions and businesses with service providers who can help them implement instant payment products using the FedNow Service. Financial institutions are exploring opportunities to improve both back-office and customer-facing operations in partnership with fintech firms. 15, 16 Many banks now use application programming interfaces (APIs) and other tools to provide the underlying financial infrastructure to nonbank technology firms and their customers, including deposit services and access to the payment rails. Fintechs are increasingly becoming significant providers of technological services to smaller banks, which lack the scale to develop such technologies on their own.\n\nThe growing diversity of the providers of payment services, including nonbank and fintech firms, is likely to continue. New tools and techniques previously unavailable to some financial institutions, including machine learning and artificial intelligence, are now being applied to credit underwriting, back-office operations, and various aspects of risk management. And learning how to apply these new technologies more effectively is ongoing. For example, it is now better recognized that just because it is an algorithm does not mean it is immune from producing discriminatory underwriting and pricing decisions. Testing algorithms before they are deployed and designing so-called ethical algorithms, which balance the accuracy of a credit-risk model with other goals such as not producing systematically higher error rates for one racial group than another, are methods that can be used to avoid unintended consequences of the new tools.17\n\nJust like the industry, the Fed is actively monitoring and studying new technologies and approaches to payments, and we are enhancing some of our service offerings to help our customers offer better services to theirs. For example, last month Fed Financial Services launched the FedPayments® Insights Service, an analytical tool that generates reports on a financial institution’s payments settled through the FedACH® Service to help inform business strategy and day-to-day ACH operations.18 We continue to provide APIs to improve payment system efficiency and accessibility.19 And so that we will be better positioned to meet our customers’ needs and those of the public, we have changed how Federal Reserve Financial Services are organized within the Fed. As many of you know, for the past 20 years, we have organized financial services by product line, such as wholesale, retail, and cash. This year we have restructured our services along functional lines, such as technology, operations, and customer service. Mark Gould, who spoke yesterday, serves as our chief payments executive, overseeing Fed financial services.\n\nThe Fed, under direction from the Board of Governors, is also exploring emerging technologies and evaluating whether there is a potential role for a U.S. central bank digital currency (CBDC) in the future. The Federal Reserve has been researching issues raised by a CBDC for some time. To foster public dialog, earlier this year the Board of Governors released a discussion paper outlining potential benefits, risks, and policy considerations of a U.S. CBDC and invited public comment.20 As readers of that paper know, there are numerous issues pertaining to CBDC that have to be evaluated including the implications for financial stability, global financial market functioning, and the transition of monetary policy; how to ensure security and balance privacy with transparency; and whether there is a use case for CBDC in the U.S. No decision has been made about whether to issue a U.S. central bank digital currency. Nonetheless, given the evolving digitalization of the financial system, under coordination by the Board of Governors, the Federal Reserve System is researching and experimenting with the underlying technologies.21 We are gaining insights that will not only help inform a future decision on a CBDC but also aid our current work on faster payments, interoperability between payment systems, and payment system resiliency.\n\nAs the payment system evolves, the safeguards needed to maintain the public’s confidence in the payment system will also need to evolve. Private-sector and public-sector service providers and regulators need to ensure that user protections are in place for responsible data use and privacy, and that safeguards adequately protect customer accounts against cybersecurity breaches, fraud, and data leakage. It is also our collective responsibility to educate consumer and business users of the payment services so they can take appropriate steps to protect themselves from fraud and understand the risks, which may vary across products and services, especially while there is variation in the consumer protections in place. And it is incumbent upon providers and regulators to continue to educate themselves as new technologies emerge. For example, once quantum computing fully develops, it will disrupt the cryptography currently in place that secures our payment services. Data privacy methods will also have to adapt. The traditional way of keeping data private, by taking away names or otherwise anonymizing it, no longer works in a world rich with multiple data sources that can be cross-referenced to de-anonymize the data and reveal identities.22 So we can’t take for granted that our current methods for securing our payment system will remain valid; as technologies evolve, we need to evolve our methods as well.\n\nHow we go about effectively supervising the payment system will also need to evolve to ensure that the system remains secure, effective, and broadly accessible. The public policy approach will need to change to include a more holistic blending of financial regulation, antitrust policy, and data privacy regulation. To ensure that the benefits of a better payment system are captured and the risks managed, there will need to be cooperation across these types of regulators, as well as international cooperation through the Financial Stability Board and other international entities, given the global nature of payments and the entities that are now offering payments services. Extending some regulations to new services is already occurring; for example, payments services offered by bigtech firms are subject to “know your customer” rules.\n\nAs new providers enter the field, we’ll need to focus more on the risks a service entails rather than on the type of entity providing the service. This will help limit regulatory arbitrage while at the same time supporting financial stability and innovation. This risk-focused approach is seen in the final guidelines approved by the Board of Governors in August that Federal Reserve Banks will use when evaluating requests from institutions for access to Fed accounts and payment services.23 The guidelines incorporate a three-tiered review framework that entails more extensive review for entities that entail greater risks. They aim to increase transparency and to foster equitable national treatment of account requests while supporting responsible innovation and appropriate risk management.\n\nConclusion\n\nA well-functioning and secure payment system is vital to our economy. As we modernize the payment system, it is important to remember that the foundation of a successful payment system is the public’s confidence in it: confidence that it will be available whenever the customer needs it; confidence that it will efficiently route and settle payments; confidence that it will be resilient against cyber attacks and fraudulent actors; and confidence that it can be relied upon without having to know the intricacies of the infrastructure behind it. This confidence requires trust in the financial entities offering payment services. Today, the American public does have confidence in the payment services offered by the Federal Reserve System and the industry. But we cannot take that for granted. As the payment system evolves, the Fed, the industry, and end users will need to continue to collaborate to ensure that the modern payment system lives up to its promise of being efficient, safe, resilient, and available to all. That’s the best way to maintain the confidence of the public we serve."

I feel very lucky that I had the opportunity to learn from him during our years at the Federal Reserve, not only about economics, financial stability, and monetary policy, but about how to lead a Reserve Bank. Today, it is probably not surprising that I plan to speak about inflation and the appropriate strategy for monetary policy when there is uncertainty about the path of both inflation and inflation expectations. Of course, the views I present will be my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nInflation\n\nThe key challenge facing our economy is unacceptably high inflation. Inflation has been running well above 2 percent for well over a year now; it is very high not only in the U.S. but in other advanced economies around the globe. This high inflation stems from many factors, but fundamentally, it reflects an imbalance between strong demand and constrained supply, which has led to significant upward pressures on prices. Inflation is a top concern of businesses and households: this is evident in surveys and in my conversations with regional contacts. High inflation is imposing a particularly onerous burden on those who do not have the wherewithal to pay more for essentials like food, gasoline, and shelter, and who are now having to make hard choices about how to spend their money.\n\nPrice stability is the foundation of a strong economy; it is necessary for ensuring that the U.S. can sustain healthy labor market conditions over the medium and longer run and that the economy can be productive and live up to its potential for everyone’s benefit. Stable prices mean businesses and households don’t have to spend time trying to protect the purchasing power of their money; they can make long-term plans and commitments without having to deal with the uncertainty about the value of their money. Price stability and monetary policy are intimately linked, but because of the uncertainties surrounding inflation dynamics, setting monetary policy to achieve price stability is not trivial. It requires being able to measure inflation so that we understand where inflation is relative to our goal. It requires being able to forecast inflation because monetary policy affects the economy with a lag that varies over time and with economic circumstances. It requires understanding the determinants of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. It also requires having the ability to make decisions under uncertainty.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has not always been successful at achieving price stability, and there have been misses on both sides. During the Great Depression in the 1930s, the U.S. experienced deflation. In the aftermath of the oil price shocks in the 1970s, inflation surged and remained high until then-Fed Chairman Paul Volcker began to tighten monetary policy to bring inflation down, at the cost of a deep recession in the early 1980s. The Fed has learned from these historical episodes. One lesson is the importance of a central bank remaining focused on its price stability goal.\n\nThe FOMC is committed to using its tools to bring inflation back down to our longer-run goal of 2 percent. Last week we took another decisive action to remove monetary policy accommodation by raising the target range of the federal funds rate by 75 basis points, and we are continuing the process of reducing assets on the Fed’s balance sheet, which also reduces accommodation. Reductions in monetary policy accommodation and tighter financial conditions will bring demand into better balance with constrained supply in both product and labor markets, resulting in an economic transition to growth in real output that is well below trend, slower employment growth, and a higher unemployment rate.\n\n[FIGURE 1]  Inflation continues to run at rates last seen in the early 1980s in the U.S. This is true whether one looks at CPI or PCE inflation. The strong increase in inflation that started in the spring of last year is very different from what the U.S. experienced during the long pre-pandemic expansion. Until late in that expansion, the concern was that inflation was running below our 2 percent longer-run goal, and this was true in other advanced economies as well. Several common factors contributed to low inflation in this period. First, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, global demand was weak. Prices of energy and other commodities were declining, and in the U.S., a rise in the value of the dollar put downward pressure on the prices of imports into the U.S. Indeed, over the 2009-2011 period, one puzzle for policymakers was actually not why inflation was low, but rather, why it wasn’t lower.1 A major reason was that longer-term inflation expectations were relatively stable at levels consistent with 2 percent inflation, a topic that I’ll return to later.\n\nBut low and stable inflation preceded the Great Recession. Since the mid-1980s, inflation had been relatively stable in spite of several wars, dramatic ups and downs in oil prices, and mild and severe recessions. The fact that inflation had become less correlated with changes in resource utilization in the labor market and in product markets – that is, there had been a flattening of the Phillips curve – suggested a change in inflation dynamics.2 This hypothesis may still hold, but it is an open question as to whether inflation dynamics have once again changed or whether the factors that held down inflation prior to the pandemic will exert their force again over time.\n\n[FIGURE 2]  The overriding message from a variety of measures is that inflation is not only high but it is broad-based. When inflation began to rise in April 2021, it was concentrated in a limited number of categories that were directly related to the effects of the pandemic. But by later last year, those price pressures had broadened across categories.\n\nEnergy prices have been a major contributor to the rise in inflation. Over the last year, the PCE energy price index has increased over 30 percent. Recent readings have eased, but developments related to the ongoing war in Ukraine suggest that gas and energy prices could move higher again later this year or early next year. Food prices have also risen significantly and inflation in this component is at its highest level since the late 1970s. But even excluding these components, core PCE inflation is at its highest level since the 1980s.\n\n[FIGURE 3]  The nature of the pandemic shock and the response to it affected aggregate demand and aggregate supply. The mandated shutdowns and the voluntary pullback in demand for high-contact services led to a shift in spending early in the pandemic from services to goods. When the economy reopened, demand surged. This strong demand was supported by fiscal transfers and accommodative monetary policy. Spending is beginning to shift from goods to services, but neither is back to its pre-pandemic trend.\n\nThe strong demand was met by constrained supply, which was affected by supply chain bottlenecks and the withdrawal of workers from the labor force. Many thought the supply constraints would work themselves out fairly quickly. But rolling pandemic lockdowns across the globe in response to new waves of the virus and the sluggish return of workers to the work force made it difficult for supply to keep up with demand. Our business contacts tell us that supply chain disruptions remain a challenge, although they have learned how to better navigate them over time; they tell us that they have seen less improvement in the imbalance between the demand and supply of labor.\n\n[FIGURE 4]  The continued imbalance between demand and supply has led to intense inflationary pressures. Inflation in both goods and services is high, with goods inflation still exceeding services inflation. This is very different from the pre-pandemic expansion, when core goods inflation was slightly negative on average and falling goods prices were pulling inflation down.\n\nConsumers spend a larger share of their income on services than on goods, so services have a higher weight in the inflation indices. Services inflation also tends to be more persistent than goods inflation. Housing, as measured by rents or imputed rents for owner-occupied housing, is a large and cyclically sensitive component of services inflation; shelter is about a third of the CPI price index. Early in the pandemic, high unemployment and moratoria on foreclosures and evictions initially put downward pressure on housing inflation. Subsequently, there has been strong demand for housing and a rapid rise in house prices and rents. Activity in the housing sector has been slowing rapidly in response to higher mortgage rates, but there is a long-run imbalance between demand and supply of housing. So despite the moderation in activity, housing prices and rents remain quite high. It typically takes some time for higher rents to flow through to the inflation measures, so growth in housing rent and shelter costs will likely keep inflation elevated for some time.\n\n[FIGURE 5]  The July reading of PCE and core PCE inflation showed a bit of moderation, which was welcome news. But the August CPI report underscored that inflation pressures remain intense. Indicators of the underlying inflation trend, including the trimmed-mean and median CPI and PCE measures, which exclude components with the most extreme movements each month, show that inflation pressures remain very elevated and broad-based even though there has been some moderation in economic activity. Measured year-over-year, the median and trimmed-mean inflation rates were either stable or actually increased in July; in August, the median and trimmed-mean CPI rose.3\n\nWage pressures are also contributing to high inflation. They are growing much faster than the pace consistent with price stability and there is little sign that wage pressures are abating.\n\n[FIGURE 6]  The evolution of projections made by FOMC participants shows that inflation has moved up much more and remained high for longer than anticipated. Both the demand and the supply sides of the economy will continue to be affected by a variety of forces, including the war in Ukraine and the energy situation in Europe, the global economic outlook, property market stresses and continued lockdowns in China, the sentiment of consumers and businesses and their reaction to elevated inflation readings, changes in supply chain disruptions, and labor force participation. Since high inflation reflects the imbalance between supply and demand, there will continue to be considerable uncertainty around the inflation forecast.\n\nInflation Expectations\n\nOne of the big lessons from the 1970s is that it is much more difficult and costly to bring inflation down once it has become embedded in the economy, that is, once businesses and households expect inflation to remain elevated and that expectation influences their savings and investment decisions and price-setting and wage-setting behavior. High inflation imposes costs on households and businesses in both the short and the long run. It eats into savings and makes it hard to plan for the future. By making it more difficult to evaluate investment opportunities, high inflation can affect productivity growth, with long-term consequences for the standard of living. The Fed’s monetary policy framework recognizes the importance of keeping inflation expectations well-anchored at levels consistent with 2 percent inflation.4 And by “well-anchored” I mean longer-term inflation expectations that are insensitive to data.\n\nInflation expectations have been a central factor in models of inflationary dynamics since the 1960s and 1970s.5 In many inflation models used by central banks, inflation is driven by three key factors: some measure of a resource utilization gap (for example, the output gap or unemployment rate gap), or marginal cost of production; lagged inflation, which captures the inertia in the inflation process; and expectations of inflation. Different models put different weights on these fundamental factors, but household and business expectations matter, since they affect wage demands and offers, and therefore firms’ price-setting behavior.6 In addition to their role in inflation dynamics and helping to forecast inflation, inflation expectations also provide an indication of how credible the public finds the central bank’s commitment to achieving its policy goals.\n\nTheory indicates that well-anchored longer-term inflation expectations can help to mitigate the pull of resource gaps on inflation, and therefore, the cyclical movements in interest rates that policymakers induce to maintain price stability need not be as large as when inflation expectations are not well anchored. This is particularly useful when the zero lower bound constrains interest rates. Arguably, the U.S. might have suffered much lower inflation during the Great Recession had inflation expectations not been relatively stable, offsetting some of the influence the negative output gap had on inflation. Similarly, in the face of today’s very high inflation readings, keeping inflation expectations well anchored should help to bring inflation back to goal without as large a change in the output gap. Of course, we have to acknowledge that while the theory is compelling, the real world does not always cooperate. For example, in Japan, inflation expectations have run well above actual inflation for a number of years.7\n\n[FIGURE 7]  One difficulty in moving from theory to practice is that inflation expectations are not directly observable. So we look at a number of measures, which differ by type of agent and time horizon. These include measures based on surveys of consumers, businesses, and professional forecasters; measures derived from financial markets; and composite indices that combine various measures.8 A clear signal is not always forthcoming because the inflation expectations of different groups of agents can behave differently from one another, even within groups there can be variation, and the literature has not firmly established whose expectations are most important for inflation dynamics.9, 10\n\nShorter-term expectations tend to move with gasoline prices and the prices of other salient items like food. Longer-term expectations and their level relative to short-term expectations give a better sense of whether expectations are becoming unanchored from the target, an indication of increased risk of inflation becoming embedded in the economy, and, relatedly, the level of the central bank’s credibility in the eyes of the public. For example, longer-term expectations remaining stable in the face of a positive shock to inflation would indicate that the public believes that inflation will come down, although it need not indicate that the public believes monetary policy will be the main driver of the reduction.\n\nThe rise in inflation expectations since last year has been concentrated in short-term expectations, which rose with the rise in gasoline and food prices. More recently, these short-term expectations have moved down with gasoline prices. Still, they indicate that consumers expect high inflation to prevail over the next year.\n\nMedium- and longer-term inflation expectations have moved up less than short-run expectations, and they are below current inflation readings, an indication that the public believes that inflation will move back down. The recent decline in the New York Fed’s medium-term expectations measure and the University of Michigan’s longer-term expectations measure was welcome news. But despite the moderation, these measures are higher than they were before the pandemic. Longer-term expectations should be less affected by changes in gasoline prices than near-term expectations and more reflective of consumers’ perceptions of the Fed’s commitment and ability to return the economy to price stability. The recent improvement in measures of medium- and longer-term inflation expectations occurred as Fed communications emphasized that we were taking decisive action against high inflation. So the decline in the expectations measures could indicate firmer anchoring. But the improvement also coincided with the decline in gasoline prices. So it is not clear yet that the measures won’t move up again if gas prices rise, food prices remain high, or inflation developments take a turn for the worse as the year progresses.\n\n[FIGURE 8]  Dispersion in expectations across survey respondents also indicates how well inflation expectations are anchored, with lower dispersion indicating better anchoring.11 The recent data are mixed. During the current period of high inflation, the dispersion in longer-tern inflation expectations across the respondents to the Survey of Professional Forecasts has risen only modestly. Those forecasters with relatively high and those with relatively low projections of inflation over the next 10 years expect PCE inflation to average more than 2 percent, but this is mainly concentrated in the next five years. The 5-year/5-year forward projection is still basically 2 percent.\n\nIn contrast, dispersion in the longer-run inflation expectations across respondents to the University of Michigan’s survey has increased sharply since the start of the pandemic. Earlier it was driven by an increase in expectations at the top part of the distribution; most recently there has been a sharp drop off in expectations at the bottom part of the distribution, perhaps a reflection of respondents’ outlook for the economy. Such a large and rising level of dispersion suggests that inflation expectations among consumers may not be as well anchored as we would hope.\n\nMonetary Policymaking Strategy\n\nSince March, the FOMC has raised the target range of the fed funds rate a cumulative 3 percentage points, and in June, the FOMC began to reduce the size of the Fed’s balance sheet according to the plan announced in May.12 While this has been a relatively fast pace of tightening, given the current level of inflation and the outlook, I believe that further increases in our policy rate will be needed. In order to put inflation on a sustained downward trajectory to 2 percent, monetary policy will need to be in a restrictive stance, with real interest rates moving into positive territory and remaining there for some time.\n\n[FIGURE 9]  The FOMC released a new Summary of Economic Projections last week. The median path among FOMC participants moved up again in response to the implications of incoming data for the outlook. In particular, high inflation is proving to be more persistent, and more restrictive policy will be needed and for longer to ensure that inflation expectations do not move up and that inflation moves back down.13\n\nWe are operating in an uncertain environment, and assessing the balance between supply and demand will remain challenging as we go. In terms of the appropriate policy responses in an environment with a lot of uncertainty, some results in the literature suggest that when policymakers confront more uncertainty either in their data or in their models, they should be more cautious in acting, that is, be more inertial in their responses.14 However, subsequent research has shown that this is not generally true. For example, Sargent (1999) points out that caution does not necessarily mean doing less. When there is uncertainty, it can be better for policymakers to act more aggressively because aggressive and pre-emptive action can prevent the worst-case outcomes from actually coming about.15 Walsh (2003, 2022) points out that better economic outcomes are achieved by assuming that high inflation will be persistent and acting accordingly.\n\nFollowing this robust-control view, in current circumstances I am going to be very cautious and not assume that one or two improved readings on inflation mean inflation is on a downward path or that inflation expectations are firmly anchored at our goal when expectations measures are elevated. Wishful thinking cannot be a substitute for compelling evidence. So before I conclude that inflation has peaked, I will need to see several months of declines in the month-over-month readings. I will also guard against being complacent that longer-term expectations are well anchored. The longer inflation remains elevated, the higher the risk that inflation expectations become unanchored and firms and households begin making decisions based on persistent high inflation. Were that unanchoring to occur, returning the economy to price stability would be more difficult and much more costly in terms of lost output and higher unemployment.\n\nResearch indicates that erroneously assuming that longer-term inflation expectations are well anchored at the level consistent with price stability when, in fact, they are not is a more costly error for the economy than assuming they are not well-anchored when they actually are.16 If inflation expectations are drifting up and policymakers treat them as stable, policy will be set too loose. Inflation would then move up and this would be reinforced by increasing inflation expectations. And that will be harder to rein in. If, on the other hand, inflation expectations are actually stable and policymakers view the drift up with concern, policy will initially be set tighter than it should. Inflation would move down, perhaps even below target, but not for long, since inflation expectations are anchored at the goal.\n\nIn summary, price stability is the foundation for sustaining maximum employment and a healthy, productive economy over time. So the FOMC will be resolute in putting inflation on a sustainable downward path to 2 percent. There will be some pain and bumps along the way as the growth in output and employment slow and the unemployment rate moves up. But the current persistent high inflation is also very painful for many households and businesses. I do not view the current situation as one in which there is a tradeoff between our two monetary policy goals. If we were to fail to take decisive action to get inflation down and firmly anchor inflation expectations, the costs would be high: we would not be able to sustain healthy labor markets over time, to the detriment of the public."

I will focus my opening remarks on how monetary policy will foster a return to price stability, and I look forward to the question-and-answer portion of the session to hear what is on your mind. Of course, the views I present will be my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Key Economic Challenge Is High Inflation\n\nThe key challenge facing our economy is unacceptably high inflation. Inflation has been running well above 2 percent for over a year now; it is very high not only in the U.S. but in other advanced economies around the globe. This inflation stems from many factors, but fundamentally, it reflects an imbalance between strong demand and constrained supply, which has led to significant upward pressures on prices. Inflation is the number one concern of businesses and households: this is evident in surveys and in my conversations with regional contacts. High inflation imposes a particularly onerous burden on those who do not have the wherewithal to pay more for essentials like food, gasoline, and shelter, and who now have to make some hard choices about how to spend their money.\n\nPrice stability is the foundation of a strong economy; it is necessary for ensuring that the U.S. can sustain healthy labor market conditions over the medium and longer run and that the economy can be productive and live up to its potential for everyone’s benefit. The FOMC is committed to using its tools to bring inflation back down to our longer-run goal of 2 percent; it is taking decisive action to remove monetary policy accommodation to bring demand into better balance with constrained supply in both product and labor markets. Since March of this year, the FOMC has raised the target range of the fed funds rate by 2-1/4 percentage points, and it has begun to reduce the assets the Fed is holding on its balance sheet, which will also reduce accommodation. Given current rates of inflation, I believe that the Fed has more work to do in order to get inflation under control. This will entail further rate increases to tighten financial conditions, resulting in an economic transition to below-trend growth in nominal output, slower employment growth, and a higher unemployment rate.\n\nEconomic Growth\n\nEconomic activity is beginning to slow down from last year’s robust pace. It is responding to our monetary policy actions and to the tightening in overall financial conditions since last year. But the slowdown also reflects how households and businesses are responding to very high inflation and their concerns about the economic outlook, to the waning effects of the pandemic fiscal stimulus, and to slower growth abroad. Consumer spending, housing activity, and business investment have decelerated from the robust pace seen last year. Indeed, the level of real GDP decreased in the first half of this year. Despite this moderation, aggregate demand is still out of balance with aggregate supply, which remains constrained due to supply chain disruptions stemming from pandemic-related shutdowns across the globe and the war in Ukraine. Many firms tell us that they will be investing to make their supply chains more resilient to be better prepared for the future. In the meantime, supply disruptions remain a challenge and they have added to price pressures.\n\nAnalysts often use the rule-of-thumb that two consecutive quarters of negative real GDP growth means the economy is in recession. I do not believe the U.S. economy is currently in a recession because the labor market is so strong. I do believe that the risks of recession over the next two years have moved up because financial conditions are tightening globally, inflation is very high in many countries, global growth is slowing, and the devastating war in Ukraine is adding considerable uncertainty and downside risks to the growth outlook, especially in Europe.\n\nI am in the process of preparing my submission to the Summary of Economic Projections of FOMC participants, which will be released after our next FOMC meeting in two weeks. At this point, I have not incorporated a recession into my baseline outlook for the U.S., but instead expect a fairly sharp slowing in activity, especially when compared to the robust growth the U.S. experienced in 2021. While there is considerable uncertainty, I currently expect that the U.S. economy will return to positive growth in the second half of the year, but for this year as a whole and for next year, I expect growth to run well below 2 percent, which is my estimate of trend growth.\n\nLabor Markets\n\nWith the economy growing below trend, I expect labor market conditions to cool, with the unemployment rate rising somewhat above 4 percent by the end of next year. Some cooling off in the labor market will put it on more sustainable footing compared to the unsustainably tight conditions that exist today. The employment report for August, released last Friday, suggests that we are beginning to see some moderation but that labor market conditions remain strong.\n\nLast year, the economy added 6.7 million jobs, a robust average of over 550 thousand jobs per month. This year, average job gains have slowed to about 440 thousand per month. The unemployment rate rose in August, but at 3.7 percent, it remains very low. The increase in the unemployment rate partly reflects an increase in labor force participation. The participation rate of prime-age workers has returned to where one would expect it to be. Many people chose to retire during the pandemic and left the labor force, and the overall participation rate, which includes those of retirement age, has risen only gradually. A continued rise in participation would be helpful in easing the imbalance between labor market demand and labor market supply. But typically, most people do not return to the job market once they have retired. So there is little reason to think that we will see an influx of workers that is large enough to return the overall participation rate to its pre-pandemic level. Although the number of job openings has eased in recent months, labor demand is still outpacing labor supply. There is still almost double the number of openings per unemployed worker. To put this into perspective: in 2019, another time of tight labor markets, there were about 1.2 openings per unemployed worker.\n\nContacts across a broad spectrum of firms tell us it has been very difficult to find workers. They have been using a variety of ways to attract and retain staff, including offering more flexible work schedules, signing and retention bonuses, expanded benefits, and higher base wages. The employment cost index for private industry workers accelerated over the six months ending in June, rising at a 6.0 percent annual pace. More recent reports suggest that wage pressures may be beginning to stabilize, but they remain high. Even so, for many workers their wage increases have not kept up with inflation, and their purchasing power is being eroded. With trend productivity growth estimated to be around 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent, wage growth will need to moderate to around 3-1/4 to 3-1/2 percent to be consistent with price stability.\n\nInflation\n\nAs their costs have continued to rise, businesses have been raising the prices they charge their customers and finding little resistance. Despite some moderation in economic activity, inflation readings continue to be at the highest levels in 40 years. Measured year-over-year, PCE inflation came in at about 6-1/4 percent in July; CPI inflation was 8-1/2 percent. These readings were down slightly from their June readings, mainly reflecting a sharp drop in the price of gasoline and energy. This was welcome news, but we have to guard against wishful thinking becoming a substitute for compelling evidence.\n\nIn my view, it is far too soon to conclude that inflation has peaked, let alone that it is on a sustainable downward path to 2 percent. Measures of the underlying inflation trend did not uniformly decline in July,1 and given developments related to the ongoing war in Ukraine, gas and energy prices may move higher again later this year. In addition, services inflation, which tends to be persistent, is at its highest level since the early 1990s, with growth in housing rent and shelter costs likely to keep inflation elevated for some time. In my view, it will take a while for inflation to return to the Fed’s 2 percent goal. But I do expect inflation to move down into a range of 5 to 6 percent for this year and then to make more progress toward our goal over the next two years, because I expect the Fed to take further action to make it so.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nIn making its monetary policy decisions, the FOMC is always guided by its strong commitment to achieving its congressionally mandated goals of price stability and maximum employment. Monetary policy cannot affect the supply-side factors that have contributed to the very high inflation readings. Instead, it works on the demand side of the economy. The Fed is being resolute and intentional in tightening financial conditions to bring demand into better balance with supply to alleviate price pressures. Since March, we have raised the target range of the fed funds rate a cumulative 2-1/4 percentage points and financial conditions are tighter than they were at the end of last year.\n\nIn addition, in June we began to reduce the size of our balance sheet according to the plan announced in May.2 Reducing the amount of the Fed’s securities holdings will help to lessen downward pressure on longer-term interest rates by returning duration to the market. The reduction in our balance sheet is being done primarily by adjusting how much we reinvest of the principal payments we receive on our assets. Without asset sales, the process could take three years or so. I would favor the FOMC’s considering selling some of our agency mortgage-backed securities at some point during balance-sheet reduction in order to speed the return of our portfolio’s composition to being primarily Treasury securities.3 Holding mainly Treasuries will help to minimize the effect of the Fed’s holdings on the allocation of credit across economic sectors.4\n\nAs is always the case, we will be calibrating our monetary policy based on the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and on the progress toward our monetary policy goals. Monetary policy acts with a lag on the economy. It is unlikely that we have seen the full effect on households and businesses of the rate increases we have implemented so far. Moreover, because of the lagged effects of monetary policy, it would not be appropriate to continue moving rates up until inflation is back down to 2 percent. That said, given the current level of inflation and the economic outlook, I believe that further increases in our policy rate are needed.\n\nWe will need to move policy into a restrictive stance in order to put inflation on a sustained downward trajectory to 2 percent. That means that short-term interest rates adjusted for expected inflation, that is, real interest rates, will need to move into positive territory and remain there for some time. Right now, nominal short-term interest rates are lower than expected inflation, so short-term real interest rates are still negative and monetary policy is still accommodative. My current view is that it will be necessary to move the nominal fed funds rate up to somewhat above 4 percent by early next year and hold it there; I do not anticipate the Fed cutting the fed funds rate target next year. But let me emphasize that this is based on my current reading of the economy and outlook. While it is clear that the fed funds rate needs to move up from its current level, the size of rate increases at any particular FOMC meeting and the peak fed funds rate will depend on the inflation outlook, which depends on the assessment of how rapidly aggregate demand and supply are coming back into better balance and price pressures are being reduced.\n\nMaking that assessment will remain challenging because there is a high level of uncertainty surrounding the outlook for the global economy. Both the demand side and the supply side of the economy will be affected by a variety of forces, including the war in Ukraine and the energy situation in Europe, the global economic outlook, the sentiment of consumers and businesses and their reaction to elevated inflation readings, changes in supply chain disruptions, and labor force participation.\n\nIn formulating my monetary policy views, I will be guarding against declaring victory over the inflation beast too soon. Doing so would put us back in the stop-and-go monetary policy world of the 1970s, which was very costly to households and businesses.5 Before I conclude that inflation has peaked, I will need to see several months of declines in the month-over-month readings.\n\nI will be carefully watching measures of inflation expectations, particularly expectations of inflation over the medium and longer term. The rise in inflation expectations since last year has been concentrated in shorter-term expectations, which tend to move with gasoline prices and the prices of other salient items like food. Nonetheless, medium- and longer-term expectations remain at the upper end of the range of values consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal, and they could move up further depending on inflation developments over the balance of the year. A risk-management perspective on monetary policymaking strongly argues against being complacent about a rise in longer-term expectations. If longer-term inflation expectations were to become unanchored and move above levels consistent with our longer-run inflation goal, high inflation would become embedded in the economy, affecting the actions of both firms and consumers; at that point, it would be considerably more difficult and more costly to bring inflation down. Better economic outcomes are achieved when policymakers assume that rises in inflation and inflation expectations are persistent and act forcibly to bring both down.6 Such action gives the public more confidence that policymakers are committed to ensuring price stability, and this helps to anchor the public’s expectations about inflation, reinforcing the effect of the policy action itself.\n\nCommitment and Follow-Through\n\nThe return to price stability will take some time and a lot of fortitude. There will be bumps along the road. Financial markets could well remain volatile as financial conditions tighten further; growth could slow more than expected and return to negative territory; and the unemployment rate could move above estimates of its longer-run level. This will be painful in the near term but so is high inflation. High inflation imposes costs on households and businesses in both the short and long run. It eats into savings and makes it hard to plan for the future. Perhaps Paul Volcker said it best as he fought inflation in the 1980s: “…failure to carry through now in the fight on inflation will only make any subsequent effort more difficult, at much greater risk to the economy.”7\n\nIn summary, price stability is the foundation for sustaining maximum employment and a healthy, productive economy over time. I do not view the current situation as one in which there is a tradeoff between our two monetary policy goals. If we fail to take decisive action to get inflation down and firmly anchor inflation expectations, we will not be able to sustain healthy labor markets over the medium and long run, to the detriment of the public."

            "content": "It is a great pleasure to be with you today, and I thank Jackie Gamblin for the kind introduction. As many of you know, in addition to being CEO of JYG Innovations, Jackie is also a director of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. I’d like to take this opportunity to thank Jackie for her public service to my organization and to the country. Jackie and her fellow directors provide a wealth of information on the economic circumstances of households and businesses in their regions. The information comes from their own firms and customers, as well as other business and community contacts like you. In the unprecedented environment we have all had to confront since the start of the pandemic, I cannot overstate the value of this reconnaissance in helping me and my colleagues at the Fed formulate monetary policy.\n\nIndeed, since I last spoke at this breakfast four years ago, much has transpired. At that time, the economy was in the ninth year of an expansion; labor markets were strong; and inflation was finally moving up to our 2 percent goal after running below this goal for some time. The Fed was continuing to increase its policy rate, the fed funds rate, to be consistent with these healthy economic conditions and the outlook. The economic expansion continued for another two years, until the pandemic changed all that. The resilience shown by households and businesses over the past two challenging years has been truly remarkable. Yet many challenges remain; in particular, inflation, which is at a 40-year high, is a serious burden for households, businesses, and the overall economy. Today, I will focus my remarks on how monetary policy will foster a return to price stability. Of course, the views I present will be my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Economy\n\nThe key challenge facing our economy is unacceptably high inflation. Inflation has been running well above 2 percent for over a year now; it is very high not only in the U.S. but in other advanced economies around the globe. This inflation stems from many factors, but fundamentally, it reflects an imbalance between strong demand and constrained supply, which has led to significant upward pressures on prices. Various surveys and my conversations with regional contacts reveal that inflation is the number one concern of businesses and households. It imposes a particularly onerous burden on those who don’t have the wherewithal to pay more for essentials like food, gasoline, and shelter, whose inflation rates have been particularly high.\n\nPrice stability is the foundation of a strong economy; it is necessary for ensuring that the U.S. can sustain healthy labor market conditions over the medium and longer run and that the economy can be productive and live up to its potential for everyone’s benefit. The FOMC is committed to using its tools to bring inflation back down to our longer-run goal of 2 percent; it is taking decisive action to remove monetary policy accommodation to bring demand into better balance with constrained supply in both product and labor markets. Since March of this year, the FOMC has raised the target range of the fed funds rate by 2-1/4 percentage points, and it has begun to reduce the assets the Fed is holding on its balance sheet, which will also reduce accommodation. Given current rates of inflation, I believe that the Fed has more work to do in order to get inflation under control. This will entail further rate increases to tighten financial conditions, resulting in an economic transition to below-trend growth in nominal output, slower employment growth, and a higher unemployment rate.\n\nIn fact, we are beginning to see activity slow down from last year’s robust pace. In part, this can be attributed to our monetary policy actions and the tightening in overall financial conditions compared to a year ago. But it also reflects households’ and businesses’ responses to very high inflation and their concerns about the economic outlook, as well as the waning effects of the pandemic fiscal stimulus, and slower growth abroad. Consumer spending, housing activity, and business investment have decelerated from the robust pace seen last year. Indeed, real GDP moved down in the first half of this year. In the first quarter, the main contributors to the decline in output were declines in net exports and government spending and slower inventory investment, but consumer and business spending remained solid. The second quarter saw slower growth in these components as well. While manufacturing surveys suggest activity has moderated, firms in our region tell us that their strong order books should keep them busy at least through the end of the year. In response to higher mortgage rates, residential investment, one of the most interest-rate-sensitive sectors of the economy, also fell quite sharply in the second quarter. Yet, because the supply of housing has not kept up with demand, housing prices and rents remain quite elevated.\n\nIndeed, supply constraints have posed a significant challenge across a variety of sectors since the economy reopened after the pandemic shutdowns. In product markets, firms have had to deal with a cascading set of disruptions to their global supply chains. These disruptions stem from pandemic-related shutdowns across the globe and the war in Ukraine, which has further constrained supplies in energy, metals, and agricultural commodity markets. Firms in Dayton and other parts of our region tell us that the supply challenges have lasted longer than they expected and they have had to be creative in meeting those challenges. Some manufacturers are stockpiling large volumes of materials to have them on hand to meet future demand or to fill their backlogged orders. Other firms are custom making parts to substitute for those that are unavailable. Many have been trying to adjust their inventories to be better prepared to meet current and future demand, which explains some of the overstocking at the end of last year, followed by slower inventory building this year. Many firms tell us that they will be investing to make their supply chains more resilient to be better prepared for the future.\n\nAnalysts often use the rule-of-thumb that two consecutive quarters of negative real GDP growth means the economy is in recession. I do not believe the U.S. economy is currently in a recession because the labor market remains very strong. I do acknowledge that the risks of recession over the next year or two have moved up because financial conditions are tightening globally, inflation remains at high levels in many countries, and the devastating war in Ukraine adds considerable uncertainty and downside risks to the growth outlook, especially in Europe. That said, at this point, I have not incorporated a recession into my baseline outlook for the U.S., but instead expect a fairly sharp slowing in activity, especially when compared to the robust growth the U.S. experienced in 2021. While there is considerable uncertainty, I currently expect that the U.S. economy will return to positive growth in the second half of the year, but for this year as a whole and for next year, I expect growth to run well below 2 percent, which is my estimate of trend growth.\n\nWith the economy growing below trend, I expect the current very strong labor market conditions to cool, with the unemployment rate rising somewhat above 4 percent by the end of next year. Some cooling off in the labor market will put it on more sustainable footing compared to the unsustainably tight conditions that exist today.\n\nThe economy added 6.7 million jobs last year, an average of over 550 thousand jobs per month, which is very robust. There are widespread reports from a broad spectrum of firms about how hard it has been to find workers. Even so, employment growth has remained very strong this year. Job gains averaged about 460 thousand per month over the first half of the year, and they accelerated in July. The unemployment rate fell to 3.5 percent, matching the lowest level reached during the long pre-pandemic expansion. Although the number of job openings has eased in recent months, they remain at historically high levels: there are close to 2 openings per unemployed worker; in 2019, another time of tight labor markets, there were about 1.2 openings per unemployed worker.\n\nA variety of reasons have contributed to people leaving the workforce early in the pandemic and then only slowly returning. These include responsibilities for caring for children or other family members; fear of the virus; reevaluation of their careers; and retirement. Reduced immigration has also constrained labor supply. The participation rate of prime-age workers has returned to where one would expect it to be. Overall participation, which includes those of retirement age, has improved, but only gradually. Typically, most people don’t return to the job market once they have retired. So there is little reason to think that we will see an influx of workers large enough to return the overall participation rate to its pre-pandemic level.\n\nFirms have been using a variety of ways to attract and retain staff, including offering more flexible work schedules, signing and retention bonuses, expanded benefits, and higher base wages. Wage pressures have been building up for a while and show little sign of abating. The employment cost index for private industry workers accelerated over the six months ending in June, rising at a 6.0 percent annual pace. Even so, these wage increases have not kept up with inflation, so workers’ purchasing power is being eroded. Higher wages that reflect higher productivity growth don’t contribute to inflation, and they are a positive for both workers and firms. But current wage increases are not consistent with inflation returning to our 2 percent goal. With trend productivity growth estimated to be around 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent, wage growth will need to moderate to around 3-1/4 to 3-1/2 percent to be consistent with price stability. As former Fed Chair Paul Volcker pointed out in the midst of his fight against very high inflation in 1981: “[Wage gains], when they are not grounded in real growth and productivity, are a kind of economic ‘shell game’ in which rising incomes disappear at the supermarket or the shoe store… .”1\n\nAs their costs have continued to rise, businesses have been raising the prices they charge their customers and finding little resistance. Over the past year, price pressures have broadened across goods and services, and despite some moderation in economic activity, inflation readings continue to be at the highest levels in 40 years. To assess the inflation situation, I look at a variety of measures. The Fed has set its inflation target in terms of PCE inflation. Measured year-over-year, PCE inflation came in at about 6-1/4 percent in July; CPI inflation was 8-1/2 percent. These readings were down slightly from their June readings, mainly reflecting a sharp drop in the price of gasoline and energy. This was welcome news, but we have to guard against wishful thinking becoming a substitute for compelling evidence.\n\nIn my view, it is far too soon to conclude that inflation has peaked, let alone that it is on a sustainable downward path to 2 percent. First, measures of the underlying inflation trend did not uniformly decline in July. Only the core PCE inflation rate, which excludes food and energy, declined. Measured year-over-year, core CPI inflation and the median and trimmed-mean inflation rates, which exclude the components with extreme movements, were either stable or actually increased.2 Second, in the coming months, goods inflation may slow in response to easing demand and the appreciation of the dollar, but the prices of energy and other commodities are set in global markets, and developments related to the ongoing war in Ukraine may lead to higher prices later this year. Third, inflation in the prices of services tends to be more persistent. Services inflation is at its highest level since the early 1990s, and growth in housing rent and shelter costs, which represent a large share of measured inflation, will likely keep inflation elevated for some time. All of this suggests that it will take a while for inflation to reach the Fed’s 2 percent goal. I expect inflation to move down into a range of 5 to 6 percent for this year and then to make more progress toward our goal over the next two years, but it will require further action on the part of the Fed to make that so.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nIn making its monetary policy decisions, the FOMC is always guided by its strong commitment to achieving its congressionally mandated goals of price stability and maximum employment. Monetary policy cannot affect the supply-side factors that have contributed to the very high inflation readings. Instead, it works on the demand side of the economy. The Fed is being resolute and intentional in tightening financial conditions to bring demand into better balance with supply to alleviate price pressures. Since March, we have raised the target range of the fed funds rate a cumulative 2-1/4 percentage points and financial conditions are tighter than they were at the end of last year.\n\nIn addition, in June we began to reduce the size of our balance sheet according to the plan announced in May.3 Reducing the amount of the Fed’s securities holdings will help to lessen downward pressure on longer-term interest rates by returning duration to the market. The reduction in our balance sheet is being done primarily by adjusting how much we reinvest of the principal payments we receive on our assets. Without asset sales, the process could take three years or so.4\n\nMonetary policy acts with a lag on the economy. So even though other financial conditions, like mortgage rates, have adjusted, it is likely we have not yet seen the full effect of the rate increases we have implemented so far on households and businesses. Given the lagged effects of monetary policy, it would not be appropriate to continue moving rates up until inflation is back down to 2 percent. As is always the case, we will be calibrating our policy based on the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and on the progress toward our monetary policy goals. That said, at our last meeting, the FOMC indicated that it anticipates that ongoing rate increases in the fed funds rate will be appropriate. I certainly agree with that view.\n\nGiven the current level of inflation and the economic outlook, I anticipate that policy will need to move into a restrictive stance in order to put inflation on a sustained downward trajectory to 2 percent. In my view, that means that short-term interest rates adjusted for expected inflation, that is, real interest rates, will need to move into positive territory and remain there for some time. Right now, nominal short-term interest rates are lower than expected inflation, so short-term real interest rates are still negative and monetary policy is still accommodative. The current level of the fed funds rate is near the range of estimates of its longer-run nominal level, and when inflation is at 2 percent and inflation expectations are consistent with 2 percent inflation, this longer-run level would be neutral in the sense of neither stimulating nor restraining economic activity. But in the current high-inflation environment, a 2-1/2 percent nominal funds rate is still accommodative and the Fed has more work to do. My current view is that it will be necessary to move the fed funds rate up to somewhat above 4 percent by early next year and hold it there; I do not anticipate the Fed cutting the fed funds rate target next year. But let me emphasize that this is based on my current reading of the economy and outlook. While it is clear that the fed funds rate needs to move up from its current level, the size of rate increases at any particular FOMC meeting and the peak fed funds rate will depend on the inflation outlook, which depends on the assessment of how rapidly aggregate demand and supply are coming back into better balance and price pressures are being reduced.\n\nMaking that assessment will remain challenging because there is a high level of uncertainty surrounding the outlook for the global economy, with a variety of forces affecting the demand and supply sides of the economy. The war in Ukraine and the energy situation in Europe could impose further costs on the people in that region and on the global economy, posing downside risks to growth but upside risks to inflation. A souring in consumer and business sentiment and reactions to elevated inflation readings could result in a larger than anticipated moderation in activity. There are some potential positives on the supply side of the economy. The newly passed fiscal package may have a larger effect on productivity growth and inflation over the near term than current private-sector estimates suggest.5 And with some luck, supply chain disruptions will abate faster than anticipated and labor market participation will continue to rise, helping to ease supply constraints in product and labor markets and bringing supply into better balance with demand. But we cannot rely on luck.\n\nIt would be a mistake to declare victory over the inflation beast too soon. Doing so would put us back in the stop-and-go monetary policy world of the 1970s, which was very costly to households and businesses.6 In assessing the appropriate stance of policy, I will be looking for compelling evidence that inflation is on a sustainable downward trajectory to our 2 percent goal. Before I conclude that inflation has peaked, I will need to see several months of declines in the month-over-month readings. I will also be carefully watching measures of inflation expectations, particularly expectations of inflation over the medium and longer term. Currently, consumers and businesses expect inflation to be well above 2 percent over the next year. While recent readings of medium- and longer-term expectations have eased off a bit, they have moved up over time and are at the upper end of the range of values consistent with our inflation goal. Research indicates that changes in the prices of particular salient items, including gasoline and food, can have an outsized effect on households’ inflation expectations.7 Gas prices have come down from recent highs but with the uncertainty surrounding world oil supply, gasoline prices could rise again, and food prices might remain high.\n\nWe need to be particularly attuned to inflation expectations. If longer-term inflation expectations were to become unanchored and move above levels consistent with our longer-run inflation goal, high inflation would become embedded in the economy, affecting the actions of both firms and consumers; at that point it would be considerably more difficult and more costly to bring inflation down. A risk-management perspective strongly argues against policymakers being complacent about a rise in longer-term expectations. Instead, better economic outcomes are achieved if policymakers assume rises in inflation and inflation expectations are persistent and act forcibly to bring both down. It is good to remember that inflation expectations are determined not only by movements in inflation but also by policymakers’ actions to follow through on their strongly stated commitment to price stability, thereby justifying the public’s belief in our commitment.\n\nCommitment and Follow-Through\n\nThe return to price stability will take some time and a lot of fortitude. There will be bumps along the road. Financial markets could well remain volatile as financial conditions tighten further; growth could slow more than expected; and the unemployment rate could move above estimates of its longer-run level. This will be painful in the near term but so is high inflation. High inflation imposes costs on households and businesses in both the short and long run. It eats into savings and makes it hard to plan for the future. If we fail to take the actions needed to get inflation down and firmly anchor inflation expectations, we will not be able to sustain healthy labor markets over the medium and long run, to the detriment of the public.\n\nAs Paul Volcker said as he fought inflation in the 1980s: “…failure to carry through now in the fight on inflation will only make any subsequent effort more difficult, at much greater risk to the economy.”8 That statement is as true now as it was then. That is why I remain resolute in setting monetary policy to return the economy to price stability, which is the foundation for sustaining maximum employment and a healthy, productive economy over time."

            "content": "I thank the ECB Forum on Central Banking for inviting me to participate on this panel. In my brief prepared remarks, I will discuss the role of inflation expectations from the practitioner’s perspective. The views I present will be my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nInflation Expectations in Theory\n\nInflation expectations have been a central factor in models of inflationary dynamics since the 1960s and 1970s, with the seminal work of Phelps, Friedman, and Lucas, and they play a key role in New Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models used to inform and evaluate monetary policy.1 In many inflation models used by central banks, inflation is driven by three key factors: some measure of a resource utilization gap (for example, the output gap or unemployment rate gap), or marginal cost of production; lagged inflation, which captures the inertia in the inflation process; and expectations of inflation. Different models put different weights on these fundamental factors, but household and business expectations matter, since they affect wage demands and offers, and therefore firms’ price-setting behavior. Empirical work on the determinants of inflation finds that the output gap matters when it is large and that, in recent years, forward-looking measures of inflation expectations play a larger role in explaining inflation dynamics than do backward-looking measures.2 Work done at the Cleveland Fed and by other researchers finds that including measures of inflation expectations in inflation forecasting models reduces the size of forecast errors.3 Anecdotal information from business contacts indicates that firms do base pricing decisions on their expectations about inflation, and recent empirical research documents that higher inflation expectations cause firms to raise their prices.4 In addition to their role in inflation dynamics and helping to forecast inflation, inflation expectations also provide an indication of how credible the public finds the central bank’s commitment to achieving its policy goals.\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s monetary policy framework emphasizes the role of well-anchored inflation expectations in helping to achieve and maintain price stability. In 2012, the FOMC first established its explicit 2 percent longer-run inflation goal. The FOMC’s statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy, revised in 2020 and reaffirmed since then, says that the Committee judges that longer-term inflation expectations that are well anchored at 2 percent contribute to achieving its monetary policy goals.5 There are various ways to define “well anchored.” Here, I mean longer-term inflation expectations that are insensitive to data and are at levels consistent with 2 percent inflation. Achieving “well anchored” in this sense would depend on how well the public understands the central bank’s inflation goal and how strongly it believes the central bank is committed to returning inflation to goal when it has deviated. This implies that central bank communications can play an important role in keeping inflation expectations anchored and, via this channel, communications can help to mitigate the persistence of shocks to inflation. It is important to note that if inflation expectations are stable but are well anchored at levels inconsistent with price stability, then they would be an impediment to achieving the inflation goal.\n\nTheory indicates that well-anchored inflation expectations can help to mitigate the pull of resource gaps on inflation, and therefore, the cyclical movements in interest rates that policymakers induce to maintain price stability need not be as large as when inflation expectations are not well anchored. This is particularly useful when the zero lower bound constrains interest rates. Arguably, the U.S. might have suffered much lower inflation during the Great Recession had inflation expectations not been relatively stable, offsetting some of the influence the negative output gap had on inflation. Similarly, in the face of today’s very high inflation readings, if inflation expectations were to become unanchored, their influence would offset the impact of any beneficial change in the output gap and monetary policy would have to act more forcefully to return inflation to goal.\n\nWhile the theory is compelling, the real world does not always cooperate. For example, in Japan, inflation expectations have run well above actual inflation for a number of years.6\n\nInflation Expectations in Practice\n\nOne of the first things policymakers need to confront in practice is that while the theory speaks of “inflation expectations,” these expectations are not directly observable. Instead, there are a number of measures, which differ by type of agent and time horizon. These include measures based on surveys of consumers, businesses, and professional forecasters, and measures derived from financial markets.7 So, in practice, to get an indication of where inflation expectations are and where they are going, policymakers need to look at a variety of different indicators or a composite such as the index of common inflation expectations.8 But a clear signal is not always forthcoming, because the inflation expectations of different groups of agents can behave differently from one another and the literature has not firmly established whose expectations are most important for inflation dynamics.9 For example, survey measures of the inflation expectations of professional forecasters and financial industry participants were fairly stable over the course of the Great Recession and recovery, while those of households and businesses drifted down.10\n\nEven within a particular group of agents there is considerable heterogeneity. The inflation expectations of consumers appear to vary with demographic and socioeconomic factors.11 And changes in the prices of particular salient items, including gasoline and food, can have an outsized effect on households’ inflation expectations.12\n\nEmpirical results also raise questions about the direction of causality. Reduced-form forecasting equations are not able to answer the question of whether high inflation leads to increases in inflation expectations, or whether expectations of high inflation affect household and business decisions, leading to higher inflation, or both.13 And while businesses are the ones that set prices, we have only limited information on the inflation expectations of these relevant actors.\n\nAnother practical consideration for policymakers is how to assess whether inflation expectations are becoming unanchored from the target and, relatedly, the level of the central bank’s credibility in the eyes of the public. Levels of longer-term inflation expectations relative to shorter-term expectations can provide some indication. For example, longer-term expectations remaining stable in the face of a positive shock to inflation would indicate that the public believes that inflation will come down, although it need not indicate that the public believes monetary policy will be the main driver of the reduction. In addition to the stability of the median or mean level of inflation expectations across respondents to a survey, dispersion across the respondents might also indicate how well inflation expectations are anchored, with lower dispersion indicating better anchoring.14 Policymakers also need to contend with the possibility that financial markets may have more confidence than the general public in the central bank’s ability and commitment to bring inflation back to goal, which suggests again that policy communications are important for keeping inflation expectations well anchored.\n\nPolicymaking Given the Gap Between Theory and Practice\n\nTaken all together, the research suggests that there is still much to learn about how inflation expectations are formed, yet policymakers need to make decisions based on the available limited information. Recent data in the U.S. indicate that longer-term inflation expectations are below current inflation readings, suggesting that the public expects inflation to move back down from its unacceptably high level. But the level of inflation expectations at longer horizons is rising, and dispersion across respondents in household surveys has begun to increase (see Figures 1  and 2 ). The fact that the salient prices of gasoline and food remain elevated suggests that there is some risk that longer-term inflation expectations of households and businesses will continue to rise.\n\nIn the current situation, from a risk-management perspective, it is important for policymakers to ask which situation would be more costly: erroneously assuming longer-term inflation expectations are well anchored at the level consistent with price stability when, in fact, they are not? Or erroneously assuming that they are moving with economic conditions when they are actually anchored? Simulations of the Board’s FRB/US model suggest that the more costly error is assuming inflation expectations are anchored when they are not.15 If inflation expectations are drifting up and policymakers treat them as stable, policy will be set too loose. Inflation would then move up and this would be reinforced by increasing inflation expectations. If, on the other hand, inflation expectations are actually stable and policymakers view the drift up with concern, policy will initially be set tighter than it should. Inflation would move down, perhaps even below target, but not for long, since inflation expectations are anchored at the goal.\n\nThese simulation results, coupled with research suggesting that persistent elevated inflation poses an increasing risk that inflation expectations could become unanchored, strongly argue against policymakers being complacent about a rise in longer-term expectations. Indeed, inflation expectations are determined not only by movements in inflation but also by policymakers’ actions to follow through on their strongly stated commitment to return inflation to its longer-run goal, thereby justifying the public’s belief in the central bank’s commitment.\n\nThe current inflation situation is a very challenging one. Central banks will need to be resolute and intentional in taking actions to bring inflation down. The low inflation readings during the pre-pandemic expansion led to considerable research on how low equilibrium interest rates and the zero lower bound can create a downward bias to inflation and inflation expectations. The policy implication some drew from this research was that if policy had to err, it should err on the side of being too accommodative, since it would be easier to address high inflation than low inflation. The current challenging situation in which a sequence of supply shocks have contributed to inflation being at a 40-year high belies that view. It also calls into question the conventional view that monetary policy should always look through supply shocks. In some circumstances, such shocks could threaten the stability of inflation expectations and would require policy action. My hope is that just as the period of low inflation generated important research, the current period will generate new research to help the FOMC deliver on its commitment to price stability and maximum employment."

            "content": "I thank Michael Weiss and the Philadelphia Council for Business Economics (PCBE) for inviting me to speak today. It is nice to be back in Philly, if only virtually. I spent many years at the Philadelphia Fed and fondly remember attending many of the PCBE’s programs, which were held at the Bank. The conversations were always relevant, with attendees providing a variety of valuable insights into the economy, financial markets, and policy. So I am looking forward to engaging with you today. But before we start, I need to remind you that the views I present will be my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe key challenge facing the economy is unacceptably high inflation, which reflects the imbalance between strong aggregate demand and constrained aggregate supply. The FOMC is committed to using its tools to get inflation under control, on a downward trajectory to its longer-run inflation goal of 2 percent, and the Committee has begun the process of repositioning monetary policy. This recalibration reflects the evolution of economic conditions, the economic outlook, and the risks around the outlook, and as the recalibration proceeds, it will continue to do so.\n\nThe Economy\n\nLast year, despite the ongoing challenges posed by the pandemic, U.S. economic growth was very strong. Real GDP grew at an annual rate of 5-1/2 percent, the highest since 1984 and well above the trend growth rate, which I estimate to be about 2 percent. Growth this year has been expected to slow from this robust pace, and in the first quarter, growth actually turned negative. But the details of the report suggest that demand momentum remained strong. The main contributors to the decline in output were declines in net exports and government spending, and slower inventory investment. The decline in net exports reflected a pullback in foreign demand for our exports amid continued robust domestic demand for imports. Government spending fell but remained at a high level. The pace at which firms invested in inventories was still very strong, just not as strong as the robust pace seen in the fourth quarter. Supported by savings accumulated during the pandemic, consumer spending grew at a solid pace in the first quarter, and growth in business fixed investment was solid as well. The April personal consumption data indicate that even though consumers are paying higher prices, they are continuing to spend. Indeed, adjusted for inflation, consumer spending increased on nondurable goods, durable goods, and services.\n\nStrong demand has occurred in the face of very constrained supply in both product and labor markets. Product markets have had to deal with a cascading set of disruptions to supply chains, reflecting differences in virus conditions and virus containment policies across the globe. China’s zero-COVID policy has further disrupted supply chains, and Russia’s dastardly invasion of Ukraine has further constrained supplies in energy, metals, and agricultural commodity markets. Some of our business contacts have characterized the situation as akin to Whac-A-Mole. As soon as they figure out how to solve a problem in one part of their supply chain, a problem arises in another part. This has meant that the supply chain disruptions have lasted a lot longer than businesses expected. For example, last December, almost two-thirds of our business contacts who were having supply chain problems thought they would see meaningful improvement this year. Now only a third do. Firms have told us that managing their supply chains and their workforce to meet demand has taken attention away from other activities, such as new product innovation, which could affect the longer-run competitiveness of their firms. The recent industrial production data indicate that manufacturers have been able to maintain solid production, even if doing so has taken considerable effort.\n\nHiring and retention have also required significant effort by businesses. Labor markets are very tight. The economy added 6.7 million jobs last year, and monthly payroll gains have averaged above 500 thousand over the first four months of this year. The unemployment rate has fallen to 3.6 percent and is near the lowest level reached during the long pre-pandemic expansion. Labor force participation remains below its pre-pandemic level. A variety of reasons have contributed to the reduced supply of workers and people leaving the workforce and then only slowly returning to work during the pandemic. These include responsibility for caring for children or other family members; fear of the virus; reevaluation of their careers; retirement; and reduced immigration. Over time, participation has improved significantly, but labor supply has not been able to keep up with robust labor demand. Job openings are at historically high levels: there are almost 2 openings per unemployed worker; in 2019, another time of tight labor markets, there were about 1.2 openings per unemployed worker. The performance of the labor market over the past two years is even more remarkable when you think back to the early months of the pandemic. In just two months, March and April of 2020, the economy lost about 22 million jobs – about the number it had gained over the long pre-pandemic expansion – and the unemployment rate rose to 14.7 percent. Conditions are vastly different now.\n\nWith demand out of balance with supply in both product and labor markets, prices and wages have moved up significantly. When costs first started to rise, firms told us they were reluctant to pass on these higher costs to customers. But as costs have continued to rise, firms have been passing higher costs on in the form of higher prices and finding little resistance. Inflation readings are now at their highest levels in 40 years. Measured year-over-year, in April, total PCE inflation was over 6-1/4 percent, core PCE inflation was nearly 5 percent, and the Cleveland Fed’s median PCE inflation was over 4-1/4 percent. When inflation started to move up earlier last year, it was concentrated mainly in goods and services most directly affected by the pandemic and its effects on supply chains, such as used cars and home furniture. As the economy reopened, people who accumulated savings when things were shut down have been able to travel and eat out more, and prices for these and other services are now rising sharply. Indeed, price pressures have broadened to a wide set of goods and services. One way to see this is to look at the 44 components that are used to construct the Cleveland Fed’s median CPI inflation measure. Measured year-over-year, median CPI rose at a 5.2 percent rate in April, with 64 percent of components having year-over-year inflation rates of 5 percent or more, and 82 percent of components having inflation rates of 3 percent or more. In contrast, a year ago, the median CPI measure of inflation was 2.1 percent, and 41 percent of components had inflation rates under 2 percent.1\n\nWage pressures have also built up over time. The employment cost index for private industry workers accelerated over the three months ending in March, rising at a 5.8 percent annual pace. Higher wages that reflect higher productivity growth are a positive for the economy, and a higher level of wages represents a shift of income share from capital to labor. But the current pace of wage increases is inconsistent with maintaining price stability.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nIn making its monetary policy decisions, the FOMC is always guided by its strong commitment to achieving its goals of price stability and maximum employment. While monetary policy cannot affect the supply-side factors that have contributed to the very high inflation readings, it can affect the demand side of the economy. The Fed is committed to using its tools to get inflation under control by tightening financial conditions to bring excess demand into better balance with constrained supply.\n\nThe FOMC raised its policy rate by 25 basis points at its March meeting and by another 50 basis points at its May meeting, and the Committee indicated that it believes ongoing rate increases will be appropriate. In addition, yesterday the Fed began reducing the size of its balance sheet according to the plan announced in May. Reducing the amount of the Fed’s securities holdings will help to lessen downward pressure on longer-term interest rates by returning duration to the market. The reduction will be done primarily by adjusting the reinvestment amounts of the principal payments the Fed receives on its assets. Without asset sales, the process could take three years or so. The Fed is starting by allowing up to $30 billion per month of Treasury securities and up to $17.5 billion per month of agency securities to run off its balance sheet. In three months, these caps will rise to $60 billion per month for Treasuries and $35 billion per month for agency securities. To the extent that maturing Treasury coupon securities are less than the monthly cap, Treasury bills will make up the rest of the runoff up to the cap. As securities run off the asset side of the Fed’s balance sheet, the Fed’s liabilities, which include reserve balances, will also decline. The balance sheet will continue to shrink until reserve balances are close to the level the FOMC judges is consistent with implementing monetary policy via its ample reserves operating regime. In this regime, reserve levels are ample enough that control over the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates is executed primarily through setting the Fed’s administered rates and active management of the supply of reserves is not needed.\n\nWith the interest rate moves we have made so far, the current target range of the federal funds rate is 75 to 100 basis points. This is well below the range of estimates of the longer-run nominal policy rate that would be neutral in the sense of neither stimulating nor restraining economic activity when inflation is 2 percent. For example, in the March Summary of Economic Projections of FOMC participants, the range of estimates of the longer-run fed funds rate was 2 to 3 percent. My own estimate is 2-1/2 percent. If inflation were 2 percent, with longer-term inflation expectations anchored at levels consistent with the 2 percent goal, this would imply a neutral real fed funds rate of 1/2 percent. But in the current high inflation environment, the real fed funds rate remains very negative. So given economic conditions, ongoing increases in the fed funds rate are called for. Unless there are some big surprises, I expect it to be appropriate to raise the policy rate another 50 basis points at each of our next two meetings.\n\nAt that point, the nominal funds rate will be nearing the lower end of estimates of the longer-run neutral rate and the balance-sheet reduction will have been underway for two months. The FOMC will then be well positioned to consider the appropriate pace at which to continue removing accommodation over the balance of the year and assess how high rates will need to go. In my view, with inflation as elevated as it is, the funds rate will probably need to go above its longer-run neutral level to rein in inflation. But we cannot make that call today because it will depend on how much demand moderates and what happens on the supply side of the economy. So, we need to continue monitoring economic and financial developments closely to gauge the balance between demand and supply and the evolution of price pressures. Making this assessment will be challenging because a variety of forces will be affecting the demand and supply sides of the economy as the year progresses. The ongoing war in Ukraine and the COVID lockdowns in China pose upside risks to inflation but downside risks to growth. On the demand side, broader financial conditions have already tightened considerably, as markets have anticipated further rate increases in light of the Fed’s forward guidance. For example, the 30-year mortgage rate was under 3 percent last September and is now about 5-1/4 percent, and recent data suggest some tempering in housing market activity. It could be that the relatively swift tightening in financial conditions means that monetary policy will transmit throughout the economy faster than in past cycles and that demand will moderate more quickly, too. The effects of the fiscal stimulus provided during the pandemic are also waning, which will help to moderate growth. In addition, elevated inflation readings may also result in a pullback in spending more generally. On the supply side of the economy, with some luck, supply chain disruptions will begin to abate and labor market participation will continue to rise, helping to ease supply constraints and allowing supply in product and labor markets to come into better balance with demand. But we cannot rely on luck.\n\nWith both demand-side and supply-side factors contributing to high inflation, and because inflation tends to be persistent, it will likely take some time for inflation to reach our longer-run goal of 2 percent. I will be looking for compelling evidence that inflation is on a downward trajectory toward our 2 percent goal, and before I conclude that inflation has peaked, I will need to see several months of sustained downward monthly readings of inflation. I have not seen that yet. On the positive side, the monthly increases in the core PCE price index were relatively stable over February, March, and April. But in April, the monthly readings of both core CPI inflation and the Cleveland Fed’s median PCE inflation reversed the declines seen in March. Rising rents and rising prices of energy, agricultural products, and other commodities can be expected to continue to feed through to overall inflation for a time.\n\nIn my view, a risk-management approach argues for being cautious about declaring that inflation is on a sustainable downward path because the inflation risks are to the upside and because the longer inflation runs above our goal, the higher the risk that longer-term inflation expectations will become unanchored, thereby making the return to price stability much more costly. We already see that medium- and longer-term inflation expectations have moved up over time. The Board staff’s measure of common inflation expectations, which summarizes a number of measures, has been rising and is at the upper end of the range of values seen since 2005.2 Some of that rise has been driven by increases in near-term expectations; for example, the Cleveland Fed’s measure of year-ahead indirect consumer inflation expectations, which is based on a nationwide survey of adults with more than 10,000 responses each week, moved above 7 percent for the week ended May 28, 2022, compared to around 4 percent a year ago.3 But even though longer-term inflation expectations have moved up by less, I do not think it is prudent to ignore the rise given the serious harm that would be caused were longer-term expectations to move above levels consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal and high inflation were to become embedded in the economy. So, if by the September FOMC meeting, the monthly readings on inflation provide compelling evidence that inflation is moving down, then the pace of rate increases could slow, but if inflation has failed to moderate, then a faster pace of rate increases could be necessary.\n\nIn the current environment, there is heightened uncertainty around the outlook. The risk of recession has risen, but because underlying aggregate demand momentum and the demand for labor are so strong, a good case can still be made that as demand and supply come into better balance, a sharp slowdown can be avoided, with growth slowing to a trend pace this year, labor market conditions remaining healthy, and inflation moving down to a 4 1/2 to 5 1/2 percent range this year and declining further next year. Of course, if there is anything we have learned over the past two years, it is that the economy can evolve differently than expected and we should be ready for that.\n\nCommitment and Follow-Through\n\nAs this period of recalibration of monetary policy continues, the FOMC will need to be resolute and intentional in removing policy accommodation to tighten financial conditions at the pace needed to get inflation under control. This will take fortitude. There will be bumps along the road. Financial markets could remain very volatile as financial conditions tighten further; growth could slow somewhat more than expected for a couple of quarters; and the unemployment rate could temporarily move above estimates of its longer-run level. This will be painful but so is high inflation. High inflation imposes a real burden on households and businesses, especially those that do not have the wherewithal to pay more for essential goods and services. I do not see the current situation as one involving a trade-off between our two monetary policy goals. If we fail to do what is necessary to get inflation down, we will not be able to sustain healthy labor markets over the medium and longer run, to the detriment of the public we serve. So in formulating my policy views, I will remain focused and committed to using our policy tools to achieve our monetary policy goals of price stability and maximum employment.\n\nThank you for this opportunity to explain my current views on the economy and monetary policy."

            "content": "It is a pleasure to participate in this policy panel at the International Research Forum on Monetary Policy sponsored by the Euro Area Business Cycle Network, the European Central Bank, and the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) met last week; so in my brief prepared remarks, I will review the FOMC’s recent decisions and put them into context. As a reminder, the views I present today will be my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nIn making its monetary policy decisions, the FOMC is always guided by its strong commitment to achieving its goals of price stability and maximum employment. At the start of the pandemic in March 2020, the FOMC reduced the target range of its policy rate, the federal funds rate, to 0 to 1/4 percent, to support the economy in the wake of the unprecedented COVID shock. The FOMC also used its balance sheet as a policy tool, buying large quantities of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities, to reduce the severe strains in financial markets seen early in the pandemic and to support the economy. In March of this year, the FOMC raised its policy rate by 25 basis points. Last week, it raised the fed funds rate by another 50 basis points and indicated that it believes ongoing rate increases will be appropriate. The FOMC also announced that it will begin reducing its balance-sheet assets starting in June.\n\nThese actions are part of what I have called the Great Recalibration of U.S. monetary policy: a shift from the extraordinarily accommodative policy needed earlier in the pandemic to a policy stance that is more appropriate for addressing the key challenge facing the U.S. economy: unacceptably high inflation.1 While liftoff of the funds rate from zero only occurred in March, this recalibration actually began in the autumn of last year. Last September, the FOMC indicated that it would soon be time to taper asset purchases, and it announced the beginning of tapering in November. In December, the FOMC sped up the tapering and released projections indicating that participants now expected an earlier liftoff of the policy rate than they had previously anticipated. In January, the FOMC indicated that it would soon be time to raise its policy rate, and then followed through with the first increase in March. Asset purchases also ended in early March.\n\nThis recalibration of policy has reflected the evolution of economic conditions, the economic outlook, and the risks around the outlook.\n\nDespite the challenges posed by the pandemic, U.S. economic growth was very strong last year, with real GDP growing at a 5-1/2 percent rate, the highest annual pace since 1984 and well above the trend growth rate, which I estimate to be about 2 percent. The decline in real GDP in the first quarter was driven mainly by declines in net exports, government spending, and a still high but lower level of inventory investment compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Growth in consumer spending and business fixed investment remained solid last quarter and there continues to be positive underlying momentum in demand. Household and business balance sheets are healthy, reflecting high savings accumulated during the pandemic.\n\nStrong demand has occurred in the face of very constrained supply in both product and labor markets. In product markets, differences in virus conditions and virus containment policies have resulted in a cascade of disruptions to the global supply chain. China’s zero-COVID policy has further disrupted supply chains and Russia’s dastardly invasion of Ukraine has further constrained supplies in energy, metals, and agricultural commodity markets.\n\nLabor markets remain very tight. The U.S. economy added 6.7 million jobs last year. Despite widespread reports from firms about the difficulty of finding workers, monthly payroll gains have averaged above 500 thousand over the first four months of this year. The unemployment rate has fallen to 3.6 percent, nearly as low as its lowest reading during the pre-pandemic expansion. Labor force participation remains below its pre-pandemic level, but it has improved significantly over time. Still, labor supply has been unable to keep up with the robust demand for labor. Job openings are at very high levels by historical standards: there are almost 2 openings per every unemployed worker; in 2019, this ratio averaged 1.2 openings per unemployed worker.\n\nWith demand out of balance with supply in both product and labor markets, prices and wages have moved up. Price pressures have broadened across goods and services, and inflation readings in the U.S. are now at their highest levels in 40 years. Measured year-over-year, in March, total PCE inflation was over 6-1/2 percent, core PCE inflation was nearly 5-1/4 percent, and the Cleveland Fed’s median PCE inflation was almost 4-1/4 percent. Wage pressures are also building. The employment cost index for private industry workers accelerated over the three months ending in March, rising at a 5.8 percent annual pace. Higher wages that reflect higher productivity growth are a positive for the economy, and a higher level of wages represents a shift of income share from capital to labor. But the current pace of wage increases is inconsistent with maintaining price stability.\n\nThe Fed is committed to using its tools to get inflation under control by bringing excess demand into better balance with constrained supply. It will likely take some time for inflation to reach our longer-run goal of 2 percent because several of the factors that have contributed to the very high inflation readings are supply-side factors, which monetary policy cannot affect, and because inflation tends to be persistent. But as we recalibrate our policy, I will be looking for compelling evidence that inflation is on a downward trajectory toward our 2 percent goal. We will be able to gauge improvement by looking at the monthly changes in inflation readings to see if inflation is beginning to move down. The monthly increase in the core PCE price index in March was little changed from its February reading, and the monthly reading of the Cleveland Fed’s median PCE inflation moved down in March. These are positive signs, but in April, monthly CPI inflation increased, and risks to inflation remain strongly on the upside, especially in the midst of the continuing war in Ukraine and the potential that the zero-COVID policy in China will further disrupt supply chains. I will need to see several months of sustained downward monthly readings of inflation before I conclude that inflation has peaked.\n\nA risk-management perspective argues for such caution because inflation risks are to the upside and because the longer inflation runs above our goal, the higher the risk that long-term inflation expectations will become unanchored, thereby making the return to price stability much more costly. We already see that medium- and longer-term inflation expectations have moved up. The Board staff’s measure of common inflation expectations, which summarizes a number of measures, has been rising and is at the upper end of the range of values seen since 2005.2 Even though some of the rise has been driven by increases in near-term expectations, I do not think it is prudent to ignore the rise given the serious harm that would be caused were long-term expectations to move above levels consistent with our longer-run inflation goal of 2 percent.3\n\nIn my view, the FOMC will need to be resolute and intentional in removing policy accommodation at the pace needed to get inflation under control. High inflation imposes a real burden on households and businesses, especially those that do not have the wherewithal to pay more for essential goods and services. If we fail to do what is necessary to get inflation down, we will be jeopardizing sustaining healthy labor markets over the medium and longer run, again hurting lower-income households. So I do not see the current situation as one involving a trade-off between our two goals.\n\nThe current target range of the federal funds rate is 75 to 100 basis points. This is well below the range of estimates of the longer-run neutral nominal policy rate, which neither stimulates nor restrains economic activity. For example, in the March Summary of Economic Projections of FOMC participants, the range of estimates of the longer-run fed funds rate was 2 to 3 percent. The real fed funds rate is still negative. So given economic conditions, ongoing increases in the fed funds rate are called for, and unless there are some big surprises, I expect it to be appropriate to raise the policy rate another 50 basis points at each of our next two meetings.\n\nAt that point, the nominal funds rate will be nearing the lower end of estimates of the neutral rate and balance-sheet reductions will be underway. The FOMC will then be well positioned to consider the appropriate pace at which to continue removing accommodation over the balance of the year and how far above neutral rates will need to go. It will be challenging to remove accommodation at the pace needed to get inflation under control while sustaining healthy labor market conditions. There are likely to be some bumps along the road; growth could slow a bit more than expected for a couple of quarters and the unemployment rate could move up temporarily. Nonetheless, the FOMC will be aiming to calibrate our policy to bring demand better in line with supply, thereby putting inflation on a downward trajectory toward our 2 percent goal. This calibration will entail assessing the various forces that will be affecting the demand and supply sides of the economy. The ongoing war in Ukraine and the COVID lockdowns in China pose upside risks to inflation but downside risks to growth. Broader financial conditions have already tightened considerably, as markets have anticipated further rate increases in light of the Fed’s forward guidance. For example, the 30-year mortgage rate was under 3 percent last September and is now about 5-1/4 percent. And the Fed’s balance-sheet reduction will soon be underway. These tighter financial conditions will help moderate excess demand. With some luck, supply chain disruptions will begin to abate and labor market participation will continue to rise, helping to ease supply constraints and allowing supply in product and labor markets to come into better balance with demand. But we cannot rely on luck. With both supply and demand adjusting over time, I will be monitoring economic and financial developments closely to gauge the balance between demand and supply and to determine appropriate monetary policy. If by the September FOMC meeting, the monthly readings on inflation provide compelling evidence that inflation is moving down, then the pace of rate increases could slow, but if inflation has failed to moderate, then a faster pace of rate increases may be necessary.\n\nAs I mentioned, in addition to raising our policy rate, we are initiating the balance-sheet reduction in June. This will be done primarily by adjusting the reinvestment amounts of the principal payments the Fed receives on its assets. Starting in June, the Fed will allow up to $30 billion per month of Treasury securities and up to $17.5 billion of agency securities to run off the balance sheet. After three months, these caps will rise to $60 billion per month for Treasuries and $35 billion per month for agency securities. To the extent that maturing Treasury coupon securities are less than the monthly cap, Treasury bills will make up the rest of the runoff up to the cap.\n\nThe plan that the FOMC announced last week did not rule out asset sales, and I would favor the FOMC considering asset sales after balance-sheet reduction is well underway to speed up the return of the portfolio’s composition to being primarily Treasury securities. This would be consistent with the FOMC’s stated desire to minimize the effect of the Fed’s balance-sheet holdings on the allocation of credit across economic sectors.\n\nThe plan also did not indicate what size the balance sheet will be when the FOMC ends the reductions, but it did give some guidance. We are implementing monetary policy via an ample reserves operating regime in which reserve levels are ample enough that control over the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates is executed primarily through setting the Fed’s administered rates and active management of the supply of reserves is not needed. The FOMC intends to slow and then stop the reduction in balance-sheet assets when reserve balances are somewhat above the level it judges is consistent with ample reserves. Once runoff has stopped, reserve balances will likely continue to fall for a time, reflecting growth in other Fed liabilities, until the FOMC judges that they have reached the ample level. At that point, the FOMC will then manage its security holdings to maintain ample reserves over time. The ample level of reserves is uncertain. It will depend on the banking sector’s demand for reserves, as well as the distribution of that demand across institutions, which will evolve over time. So as the process to reduce the size of the balance sheet progresses, we will be monitoring developments in money markets to determine the appropriate level of reserves at which to end balance-sheet runoff, consistent with maintaining ample reserve balances over time.\n\nThis concludes my brief remarks about the Great Recalibration of U.S. monetary policy. I look forward to participating in the discussion."

            "content": "Good afternoon. I thank Raphael Bostic for inviting me to participate in this panel focused on balance-sheet normalization. I have had the opportunity to attend and participate in this conference over the past few years, and it has never disappointed in bringing together interesting research and interesting policy views. This year’s conference is no exception.\n\nIn my brief prepared remarks, I will describe how the FOMC intends to significantly reduce the security holdings on its balance sheet. The views I present today will be my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThroughout the pandemic, in addition to the federal funds rate, the Fed has used its balance sheet as a policy tool, buying large volumes of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities. At nearly $9 trillion in assets, the Fed’s balance sheet is now about double the size it was before the pandemic. These asset purchases were an important policy response to the severe strains in financial markets seen early in the pandemic, and throughout the pandemic, they helped to support the economy in the midst of the unprecedented COVID shock. Markets are now functioning, a solid expansion is underway, and inflation is far above the Fed’s longer-run goal of 2 percent. So at its May meeting last week, the FOMC decided that it will begin reducing the size of its balance sheet in June. To lay the groundwork and to help prepare financial markets for this announcement, the FOMC, after its January meeting, released a set of guiding principles for the reduction, and the Committee gave more specifics about its plans in the minutes to its March meeting. The plans announced last week are consistent with the earlier communications.\n\nBalance-sheet reduction will be done in a predictable manner, primarily by adjusting the reinvestment amounts of the principal payments the Fed receives on its assets. Starting in June, the Fed will allow up to $30 billion per month of Treasury securities and up to $17.5 billion of agency securities to run off the balance sheet. After three months, these caps will rise to $60 billion per month for Treasuries and $35 billion per month for agency securities. To the extent that maturing Treasury coupon securities are less than the monthly cap, Treasury bills will make up the rest of the runoff up to the cap.\n\nThe plan draws on our experience from October 2017 through August 2019 when the FOMC reduced the balance sheet of some of the assets that had been purchased in the wake of the Great Recession. But there are some important differences. Last time, runoff caps were initially set at $6 billion per month for Treasuries and $4 billion per month for agency securities, and the phase-in was very gradual, with caps increasing by $6 billion and $4 billion, respectively, every 3 months over the next 12 months, to $30 billion for Treasuries and $20 billion for agency securities. This time, the phase-in is only 3 months and the monthly runoff caps total $95 billion, almost twice the size as last time. Another difference is that, last time, balance-sheet reduction started almost two years after liftoff of the funds rate from zero; this time it is starting about 2-1/2 months after liftoff. I note, though, that even though the gap between liftoff and the start of balance-sheet reduction is much shorter this time, the level of the target range is not that different – only 25 basis points lower this time – because the funds rate rose very slowly last time.1\n\nThese differences reflect the fact that the economy is in a very different place now than it was then. When the Fed began reductions in October 2017, balance-sheet assets had grown to about $4.5 trillion, or 22 percent of GDP; reserves were about $2.2 trillion, or 11 percent of GDP; the unemployment rate was about 4-1/4 percent; real output growth was near 2.7 percent; and inflation was still running slightly below 2 percent. Now, balance-sheet assets are about $9 trillion, or 37 percent of GDP; reserves have been averaging about $3.8 trillion, or about 15 percent of GDP; labor markets are very tight, with the unemployment rate at 3.6 percent; the economy grew 5.5 percent last year; and instead of being below our goal, PCE inflation is currently 6.6 percent, a 40-year high.\n\nLet me finish by discussing two items that the plan announced last week did not address: asset sales and the size of the balance sheet when reductions will end.\n\nThe plan did not rule out asset sales. The FOMC has not discussed sales, but the minutes of the March meeting indicated that FOMC participants generally agreed that after balance-sheet reduction was well underway, it would be appropriate to consider sales of agency mortgage-backed securities. An important benefit of sales is that they would help to speed the return of our portfolio’s composition to being primarily Treasury securities, consistent with the FOMC’s stated desire to minimize the effect of the Fed’s balance-sheet holdings on the allocation of credit across economic sectors. One potential way to implement sales would be to sell agency securities up to the cap in any month in which principal payments were less than the cap. This is similar to our treatment of Treasuries. Another way to implement sales would be to set a monthly floor on reductions, which would be met first by principal payments received and then by sales. A potential drawback of sales is that, depending on the interest rate path, they could result in realized mark-to-market losses, which would lower the Fed’s remittances to the Treasury. Such losses would not entail any operational challenges for the Fed in setting monetary policy. However, they would pose communication challenges that would need to be appropriately addressed so that the public understands the benefits of returning the balance sheet to a more normal size and composition despite the losses.\n\nSecond, the plan did not indicate the size the balance sheet will be when the FOMC ends the reductions, but it did give some guidance. We are implementing monetary policy via an ample reserves operating regime in which reserve levels are ample enough that control over the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates is executed primarily through setting the Fed’s administered rates and active management of the supply of reserves is not needed. The FOMC intends to slow and then stop the decline in balance-sheet assets when reserve balances are somewhat above the level it judges is consistent with ample reserves. Once runoff has stopped, reserve balances will likely continue to fall for a time, reflecting growth in other Fed liabilities, until the FOMC judges that they have reached the ample level. At that point, the FOMC will then manage its security holdings to maintain ample reserves over time. The ample level of reserves is uncertain. It will depend on the banking sector’s demand for reserves, as well as the distribution of that demand across institutions, which will evolve over time. During the last reduction episode, the FOMC ended runoff when reserve levels were about $1.5 trillion, or 7 percent of GDP. When stresses developed in short-term money markets in mid-September 2019, the FOMC judged that the level of reserves had fallen below the level consistent with ample reserves, and in October 2019, the FOMC began purchasing Treasury bills and conducting term and overnight repurchase agreement operations to maintain reserve balances at or above the level that prevailed in early September 2019.\n\nThis time, as the process to reduce the size of the balance sheet progresses, we will once again be monitoring developments in money markets to determine the appropriate level of reserves at which to end balance-sheet runoff, consistent with maintaining ample reserve balances over time.\n\nThis was a brief summary of the FOMC’s plan for significantly reducing the Federal Reserve’s balance-sheet assets. I look forward to hearing the other panelists’ remarks and participating in the discussion."

For example, Cleveland Fed researchers found that over a 75-year period, education levels were consistently one of the most reliable indicators for each state’s per capita income growth1 and that counties with higher levels of high school graduates tend to have lower poverty rates and higher levels of labor force participation.2 Resilient regions, ones that have been able to avoid persistent declines in population over the longer run, tend to have a more educated population and a more diverse industry mix.3 Better education helps individuals, too. It is correlated with lower levels of unemployment and higher wages.\n\nSince having a skilled workforce benefits people and communities, workforce development is front and center in the work that the Federal Reserve does to promote a sound economy. I suspect that many of you know that the Federal Reserve’s goals in setting monetary policy are to achieve price stability and maximum employment. These goals were formally given to the Fed by Congress in 1977. Currently, labor markets in the U.S. are very tight and inflation is very elevated. The Fed has begun the process of reducing monetary policy accommodation. Our intent is to reduce accommodation at the pace necessary to bring demand into better balance with constrained supply in order to get inflation under control while sustaining the expansion in economic activity and healthy labor markets. So understanding what is happening in the workforce is central to understanding the state of the business cycle and setting appropriate monetary policy.\n\nBut understanding workforce dynamics is also important for assessing the longer-run health of the economy. It is relevant to the Fed’s role in identifying effective community development policies and practices for promoting economic progress and access to credit in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. This role arose from the responsibility that Congress gave to the Fed and other federal banking regulators for implementing the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), which was passed in 1977.\n\nSo understanding all aspects of the U.S. labor force, including how communities can develop and sustain a resilient workforce, has been part of the Fed’s mission for over four decades. Today, I will discuss four important lessons we have learned about successful workforce development from four decades of Federal Reserve research and outreach. As always, the views I’ll present are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Origins of Community Development Work at the Fed\n\nFirst, let me provide a little background. As I mentioned, the Federal Reserve has a long-standing interest in community development. Congress passed the CRA to help address concerns about the deterioration in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods throughout the U.S., a deterioration that many people at the time attributed at least partially to limited access to credit and illegal practices such as redlining. The CRA reaffirmed that insured depository institutions must serve the communities in which they are chartered to do business, helping to ensure equitable access to credit for all individuals and neighborhoods, and the Fed and other federal financial supervisory agencies were charged with implementing the act.4 To do so, the Fed created its Community Affairs function in 1981 to provide technical training and support to depository institutions to help bolster their compliance with the CRA.5 From this targeted beginning, the Federal Reserve’s work in the area of community development has evolved and expanded to include research and community outreach and information gathering on a number of topics, including housing, education, health, transportation, and workforce development.\n\nThe Federal Reserve System comprises 12 regional Reserve Banks that are distributed across the country and a seven-member Board of Governors in Washington that oversees those Banks. The U.S. is very diverse, encompassing large cities, small towns, and rural areas, with a mix of different industries and occupations. That is true of the Cleveland Fed’s District, the Fourth District, which comprises the entire state of Ohio, and parts of Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and West Virginia. The Reserve Banks are very much organizations of their Districts, so they are well positioned to gather information and develop a solid understanding of what is actually happening on the ground in their Districts. This community engagement via outreach and research on relevant issues allows the Fed’s decisions to take into account the diversity of the American economy and its people.\n\nFour Lessons from Four Decades of the Fed’s Work on Workforce Development\n\nBecause having a skilled workforce is a vital component of a healthy economy, the Cleveland Fed, as well as many of our fellow Reserve Banks, focuses a lot of attention on workforce development and what communities can do to enhance it. While the economy is very diverse and workforce development efforts differ by location, four decades of Fed research and outreach have yielded some common themes. In the rest of my remarks, I will highlight four lessons we have learned about what successful workforce development efforts have in common.\n\nThe first lesson is that collaboration across public, private, and nonprofit entities is essential to a successful workforce development program. Community development practitioners have long known that effective workforce initiatives almost always require many different organizations to work together. The Boston Fed examined small and mid-sized cities that had lost manufacturing employment and found that resurgent cities, those that successfully reinvigorated their economies, exhibited a high degree of leadership and collaboration among key institutions and individuals, including nonprofits, private citizens, corporations, and government.6 Importantly, the researchers also found that to have an effect on economic outcomes, leadership and collaboration must be part of long-lasting campaigns. There are no shortcuts or easy fixes. It takes commitment.\n\nIn the last 10 years, much has been learned about the value of sector-led partnerships, often focused on just one or a few industries. Cleveland Fed analysts undertook case studies of five sector-based initiatives across the Fourth District and found that successful programs involve employers who are substantively engaged. That engagement involves people at the highest levels of their organizations so that they can speak on behalf of the firm; it includes providing advice on curricula and interacting with students.7 The case studies also showed that commitment is needed so that the programs have a chance to become established and grow. Because, in many cases, the employers involved in the programs are competitors, trust among the employers and program partners is an important driver of success. Our research also found that having the technical skills required for a position is often not enough to gain employment. Employers are also interested in hiring people who are motivated, aren’t daunted by uncertainty and can be flexible, can work well in teams, can effectively communicate, and can learn new things. This underscores the need for collaboration, because effective workforce development programs combine partners who can educate people on these types of skills with partners who can provide the necessary technical skills.\n\nThe second lesson that is clear from the Fed’s research and outreach is that to improve workforce outcomes there needs to be better communication between employers and workers about what each wants and needs. This avoids wasting effort and funding on programs that are misfocused. In the current labor market, almost every firm we speak to says it has been struggling to find the talent it needs. In a recent survey of more than 750 employers across an 18-county region of Northeast Ohio conducted by ConxusNEO, Fund for Our Economic Future, and Team NEO, over three-quarters of the respondents said they were struggling to find talent and finding it was their biggest challenge, and over 90 percent said their pool of qualified applicants was insufficient to meet their needs.8 Surveyed employers said they have responded by raising wages and by offering more flexible schedules, hybrid work arrangements, and more paid time off. But only 8 percent of firms have taken the simple step of actually asking workers what matters to them. The Fund for Our Economic Future is completing a region-wide survey and holding focus groups asking workers what they are looking for, as input into the fund’s support for strategies that lead to better job outcomes.9\n\nBetter communication can also help employers avoid making assumptions that are unproductive in fostering better employment outcomes. The period before the pandemic hit was also one where labor market conditions were strong and our business contacts reported that they were having trouble finding the qualified labor they needed. A few reported that current employees were sometimes not interested in being promoted to a new role at a higher wage. They did not have a good understanding of why this was the case, since getting a job or a promotion was a path to better economic achievement. A few firms assumed it meant that people just did not want to work. But, of course, the reality was more complicated.\n\nWhile a job or promotion may put someone on the path to higher future income, in the short run, taking a job at the offered wage can actually cost someone more in terms of lost public benefits than he or she would gain in wages from taking the job. While some public benefit programs phase out gradually, others, including Medicaid, have strict income cutoffs for participation. This creates so-called benefits cliffs. These cliffs often differ across localities and with the person’s situation, in part, because benefit programs interact with one another. So it is not a simple task for either workers or employers to calculate the net financial effect on the worker of taking the job offered.\n\nTo help potential workers and employers better understand benefits cliffs, the Cleveland Fed is partnering with the Atlanta Fed and the Ohio Department of Jobs and Family Services to provide an interactive tool in six counties in Ohio as part of the state’s Benefit Bridge pilot program.10 The Career Ladder Identifier and Financial Forecaster (CLIFF) dashboard, developed by the Atlanta Fed, allows people to compare themselves with others in similar economic situations and locations to see how benefits change with increases in income, taking into account local living expenses and state-specific eligibility rules for public benefits.11 The tool allows workers to look at different career path scenarios to help them understand the tradeoffs they would be making in terms of lost benefits in the short run versus potentially higher income from wage gains in the future, and it allows employers and counselors to offer more informed career planning advice to workers.\n\nCommunication between businesses and educational and training organizations is also vital so that they can coordinate their efforts. With the workplace changing so rapidly, it is important that students and those advising them know what skill sets employers are seeking now and in the future so they can prepare themselves for joining the job market. In Pittsburgh, the Allegheny Conference on Community Development is working with businesses, educators, and students in elementary and high schools to raise awareness of the future job market so that curricula can be better matched to the skill sets that will be in demand.\n\nThrough its own surveys and outreach, the Federal Reserve is helping to communicate the challenges faced by lower-income families that hamper their ability to participate in the labor market and advance economically. The Cleveland Fed’s biennial Policy Summit regularly has sessions on workforce development that bring together those with diverse perspectives.12 Our workforce development outreach efforts routinely include both business and labor market participants so that each can communicate their needs and challenges. The Fed’s reputation for objectivity helps us play a role as both a convener and a catalyst, aiming to increase everyone’s understanding of the issues affecting the workforce and to foster effective collaboration.\n\nA third lesson drawn from Fed research and outreach is that place matters.13 Employers are often drawn to places that will attract workers. So those living in lower-quality neighborhoods in terms of schools; housing; access to healthcare, food, and public transportation; and natural amenities like parks and green space typically have less access to good jobs, and without a good job, they have less ability to move to locations that offer better employment prospects. A body of research has shown that economic opportunity is tied not only to individual circumstances but also to place. Upward mobility – the probability that a child will be better off economically than his or her parents – is dependent not only on the family’s characteristics but also on neighborhood characteristics such as neighborhood income, the quality of schools, access to social services, access to transportation, and racial integration.\n\nIt is becoming increasingly apparent that regional economic development, which focuses on growth in economic activity, and workforce development, which focuses on the skill sets of individuals, are linked and should be viewed as a common goal. As part of the Federal Reserve System’s Investing in America’s Workforce initiative, the Fed held listening sessions across the country. During those sessions, we heard that an important challenge to developing the workforce is the lack of critical support services, like transportation, needed by those seeking training. These services are either inaccessible or underfunded, especially for those people living in low- and moderate-income communities.14,15 Training is not as simple as if you build it, they will come. Training needs to be connected to support that enables people to access the training, and then once they complete the training, to be able to take advantage of job opportunities and to move along a career path. Cleveland Fed researchers have found that increasing accessibility to jobs by reducing commuting distance can make a significant difference in keeping people employed, especially for African Americans, women, and older workers, whose jobs require them to be on-site.16 The move to more remote working arrangements presents a great opportunity for bringing more people into the workforce.\n\nSince the characteristics of firms, workers, and available infrastructure differ across localities, to be successful, workforce development efforts need to be tailored to the specifics of the localities. The Boston Fed’s Working Places initiatives recognize this. Its Working Cities and Working Communities Challenges were developed based on the Boston Fed research I mentioned earlier on small and mid-sized cities that had lost manufacturing employment. Those cities in which leaders collaborated across sectors with many local partners to form a localized and shared vision of long-term success were more successful at reinvigorating their economies. Informed by this research and designed in partnership with the Boston Fed’s network of community development stakeholders, the challenges are grant competitions aimed at strengthening civic collaboration and partnerships to help struggling post-industrial cities and rural towns in an enduring way. The funding comes from philanthropic, public-sector, and private-sector partners, with the Boston Fed administering the program and providing technical assistance, including opportunities to learn from other participants.\n\nThis brings me to the last lesson I will discuss today: evaluation is essential. No matter how well intentioned, some workforce development programs will be less effective than others. And because place matters, some programs that work in one region may be less effective in another. Funding is scarce, so it is important that initiatives be regularly evaluated, based on objective evidence and informed by research, to help ensure that the investment in workforce development is money well spent and that programs are designed to be effective so that they can help the most people.\n\nIt is impossible to evaluate the effectiveness of a program without the data to do it. So initiatives should collect complete data on the programs and outcomes by geography and by the race, ethnicity, education, income, and other characteristics of the participants. And initiatives should be willing to share these data so that objective third parties can evaluate the programs.\n\nThe Cleveland Fed and colleagues around the Federal Reserve System are creating and using data to support workforce development. For example, the Atlanta, Cleveland, and Philadelphia Reserve Banks’ project to identify “opportunity occupations,” those occupations that pay higher than the median wage but do not require a bachelor’s degree, grew out of our hearing repeatedly through our outreach of the need for these types of jobs.17 The Cleveland and Philadelphia Feds have created an Occupational Mobility Explorer tool, which helps workers, particularly those without a college degree, identify good-paying jobs based on the skills they have.18 It covers 33 of the largest metropolitan areas in the country and allows an individual to see what other occupations that use similar skills are available and what the pay differentials are across these occupations. For example, cashiers would find that customer service representatives have skills similar to theirs but get paid more. With this type of information, people are better equipped to explore alternative career paths that could enhance their economic outcomes.19 They can also use the tool to determine how much better off they might be financially if they obtained training to enhance their skill sets given current and future employment demands.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, the Federal Reserve has been supporting workforce development efforts for more than four decades by providing research and data, doing outreach to all the stakeholders with an interest in workforce development, and convening these stakeholders so that they can share their perspectives on what is needed to ensure a highly skilled workforce. Through our efforts, we have learned that collaboration, commitment, communication, recognition that place matters, and objective evaluation are all important ingredients in designing and maintaining effective workplace development initiatives that help individuals and communities prosper economically.\n\nIn today’s rapidly changing world, the nature of available jobs and the skill sets needed to perform those jobs are also changing. That is why many people talk about the need for life-long learning. That applies not only to individuals but also to institutions. In that vein, the Cleveland Fed is committed to expanding its knowledge and working with all stakeholders to help support efforts to develop a highly skilled workforce, an essential ingredient in maintaining a strong economy in which everyone can benefit."

            "content": "I thank John Carroll University for inviting me to participate in the Mellen Executive Speaker series. I always enjoy being on college campuses and feeling the vibe from all the learning going on. I had the pleasure of meeting with some John Carroll students earlier today, so I now feel better prepped for the upcoming question and answer session that will be moderated by Professor Frank Navratil.\n\nBut before we get to that, since I have just returned from last week’s meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the body that sets monetary policy in the U.S., I thought it would be helpful to briefly review the FOMC’s decisions and put them into context. As a reminder, the views I present today will be my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nLast Week’s Monetary Policy Decisions\n\nIn making its monetary policy decisions, the FOMC is always guided by its strong commitment to achieving its congressionally mandated goals of price stability and maximum employment. In pursuit of these goals, at its meeting last week, the FOMC took actions to begin removing some of the extraordinary monetary policy accommodation that was necessary earlier in the pandemic. Back in March 2020, at the start of the pandemic, the FOMC had reduced the target range of its policy rate, the federal funds rate, to 0 to 1/4 percent and held it there to support the economy in the wake of the unprecedented COVID shock. Last week, the FOMC raised the target range by one quarter of a percentage point, to 1/4 to 1/2 percent, and indicated that it anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate.\n\nThroughout the pandemic, the FOMC has also used its balance sheet as a policy tool, buying large quantities of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities. These asset purchases were an important policy response to the severe strains in financial markets seen early in the pandemic and have helped to support the economy throughout the pandemic. The Fed ended its asset purchases in early March, and last week, the FOMC indicated that it expects to begin reducing the size of its balance sheet at a coming meeting. As Chair Jay Powell indicated in his post-meeting press conference, that reduction could start as early as our next meeting in May.\n\nI strongly supported the FOMC’s actions last week to begin the process of removing monetary policy accommodation. I based my support on my assessment of economic conditions, the economic outlook, and the risks around the outlook. In my view, inflation, which is at a 40-year high, is the number one challenge for the U.S. economy at this time.\n\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine is a tragedy for the Ukrainian people, who are suffering tremendously; so they need to be first and foremost in our thoughts. In terms of the implications for the U.S. economy, the situation has already led to strong increases in the prices of energy and other commodities, and it has the potential to further disrupt global trade. Events are unfolding, and uncertainty about the economic outlook over the medium run has risen. Despite the uncertainty, I believe it is appropriate that the FOMC take action to get inflation under control and put it on a downward trajectory toward our longer-run goal of 2 percent while sustaining the economic expansion and healthy labor markets.\n\nEconomic Conditions and the Outlook\n\nDespite the challenges posed by the pandemic, U.S. economic growth was very strong last year, with real GDP growing at a 5-1/2 percent rate, the highest annual pace since 1984. This is well above the trend growth rate, which I estimate to be about 2 percent. Economic activity moderated somewhat early this year in the midst of the surge in virus cases from the Omicron variant but picked back up again as cases subsided. The pandemic is still with us, but over time, firms and households have become more resilient to the economic impacts of new variants of the virus. The strength in household and business demand has been supported by extraordinary fiscal policy and monetary policy, as well as the deployment of vaccinations, which has allowed the economy to reopen more fully. Growth will moderate this year compared to last year’s robust pace as fiscal stimulus wanes and monetary policy accommodation is removed. But despite the risks posed by geopolitical events, my base case is that the economy will continue to grow at a pace that is above trend and which will sustain healthy job gains.\n\nStrong demand has occurred in the face of very constrained supply in both product and labor markets. In product markets, differences in virus conditions and virus containment policies across the globe have disrupted global supply chains. At first, firms thought that these supply chain issues would be resolved fairly quickly as virus conditions improved. But successive waves of the virus continued to affect different parts of the supply chain throughout the past year, and firms continue to struggle getting necessary parts and materials through clogged ports and transportation channels.\n\nIn labor markets, the economy added 6.7 million jobs last year, and in the past three months, job gains have averaged over 580 thousand per month. The unemployment rate has fallen to 3.8 percent, only a little above its lowest level during the long expansion before the pandemic. These are extraordinarily strong labor market numbers, especially compared to conditions in the labor market when the economy had to shut down in response to the virus. In just two months, March and April of 2020, the economy lost about 22 million jobs and the unemployment rate rose to 14.7 percent. Over the course of the pandemic, many people ended up leaving the labor force, either because they lost their job or because they needed to care for children or other people affected by the virus; some decided to resign as they reassessed their careers; and many chose to retire. Labor force participation has recovered significantly over time but remains below its pre-pandemic level, and labor supply has been unable to keep up with the robust demand for labor.\n\nAs the economics and finance students at John Carroll know, when demand is out of balance with supply, prices and wages adjust. Supply chain problems have raised firms’ costs of production and because qualified workers are so scarce, wages are rising at rates we have not seen in decades. Our business and labor market contacts from around the region tell us that they do not foresee wage pressures easing any time soon because labor markets are so tight. Average hourly earnings have been rising at a 5 percent pace, and workers with specialized skills in high demand, such as cybersecurity expertise, are seeing significantly higher wage gains. As one of our Reserve Bank directors put it, the economy has moved on from the Great Resignation to the Great Poaching, where firms are bidding away workers from each other at ever increasing rates of pay. While higher wages that reflect higher productivity growth are a positive for the economy, the current increases in wages are likely inconsistent with maintaining price stability.\n\nAs their costs have risen, firms have been able to pass along some of those cost increases to their own customers in the form of higher prices. Inflation readings are now at their highest levels in 40 years. While many firms and economic forecasters expected supply chain disruptions to ease in the second half of last year, supply chains remain challenged and inflation has continued to rise. Measured year-over-year, PCE inflation rose to over 6 percent in January, core PCE inflation rose to nearly 5-1/4 percent, and the Cleveland Fed’s median PCE inflation reached 4 percent. And price pressures that were once seen mainly in the goods and services most directly affected by the pandemic have now broadened to other items. Eighty percent of the components used to compute the Cleveland Fed’s median CPI have year-over-year inflation rates of 3 percent or more, and nearly 60 percent of components have inflation rates of 5 percent or more.\n\nHigh inflation imposes a real burden on households and businesses, especially those that do not have the wherewithal to pay more for essential goods and services. The nominal wage increases over the past year have benefited many families, but for many of them, the increases have not kept up with inflation. In addition, the incidence of inflation has fallen more on lower-income consumers because they spend a larger share of their expenditures on the essentials of food, housing, clothing, and transportation and inflation in these components has far outpaced inflation in nonessentials.\n\nThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia has resulted in significantly higher and more volatile prices of energy and other commodities. Russia and Ukraine are major producers of several important commodities, including wheat and fertilizer, important for the global food supply; pig-iron, used to produce steel; palladium and neon gas, used to produce semiconductors, which are already in short supply; and nickel, used to produce stainless steel and motor vehicle parts. The invasion could further disrupt the already challenged global supply chain. So the situation in Ukraine has added to the upside risks to inflation. Unless the conflict escalates, the direct effects on the U.S. economy are likely to remain manageable. But the invasion does pose some downside risks to growth in the U.S., since higher levels of uncertainty and a sustained increase in gasoline and other prices could temper spending on the part of households and businesses. At this point, I view the upside risks to inflation stemming from the conflict as being more significant than the downside risks to growth in the U.S.\n\nI do expect inflation to begin to move down later this year and next, but it will take some time and inflation will remain above our goal of 2 percent. At some point, the current adjustments underway to increase the resilience of supply chains will help to ease the disruptions, and energy prices will stop increasing, even if they remain somewhat elevated compared to before Russia invaded Ukraine. Monetary policy action by the Fed cannot affect those sources of inflation, but it is an important contributor to the downward trajectory of inflation in my forecast because reducing the level of monetary policy accommodation will help to better align demand with constrained supply, thereby alleviating price pressures.\n\nAbsent such action, with inflation already at very high levels and demand outstripping supply, there are rising risks that too-high inflation will become imbedded in the economy and persist. This can happen if consumers and businesses begin to doubt whether inflation will return to 2 percent over the medium to longer run and their rising expectations about future inflation become part of their pricing plans and wage demands. Consumers and businesses are paying a lot of attention to inflation, and their expectations of inflation over the short term, about one year out, have risen with actual inflation rates. So far, their expectations of inflation over the longer term have risen but remain at levels consistent with our longer-run goal of 2 percent inflation. That is a positive, but persistently high inflation readings impose rising risks that longer-term inflation expectations could become unanchored and this has implications for monetary policy. In an economy that is near our maximum employment and inflation goals, with longer-term inflation expectations that are well anchored, it is appropriate for monetary policy to look through supply shocks that temporarily raise inflation above target. But in the current environment, it seems too risky to allow the high inflation readings to persist and just wait until the supply-side factors putting upward pressure on prices abate. From a risk-management perspective, the Fed needs to take action to reduce excess demand and bring demand into better balance with constrained supply in order to better anchor inflation expectations and put inflation on a downward path to our longer-run goal of 2 percent.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nThe FOMC has begun that process. As I mentioned earlier, at last week’s meeting we raised the fed funds rate target range by one quarter of a percentage point and said that we anticipate that ongoing increases will be appropriate. We also said that at an upcoming meeting we would begin to reduce the amount of assets that we hold on our balance sheet. We will do that in a predictable manner primarily by adjusting the reinvestment amounts of the principal payments we receive on our assets. Other details of the plan for reductions are being finalized. The plan will draw on our experience during 2017 to 2019 when we reduced our balance-sheet assets, which had grown in the wake of the Great Recession. But the balance sheet is much larger, in terms of both the dollar value of assets and assets relative to GDP, and inflation is much higher than it was then. So it is appropriate to start reducing the balance sheet sooner and proceed at a faster pace this time. One benefit of this plan is that we will be removing the downward pressure our holdings put on yields at the long end of the yield curve while we are raising rates at the short end, thereby reducing monetary policy’s distortionary effects on the shape of the yield curve as normalization proceeds.\n\nIn setting policy, the FOMC is always driven by the pursuit of its dual mandate goals of price stability and maximum employment. Inflation is very elevated and labor markets are tight by many metrics, yet monetary policy remains at emergency levels of accommodation needed earlier in the pandemic. We need to bring monetary policy into sync with the current state of the economy. Our intent is to remove accommodation at the pace necessary to bring inflation under control while sustaining the expansion in economic activity and healthy labor markets. Because longer-run inflation expectations are still anchored, and there is strong underlying growth momentum in both product and labor markets, I am optimistic we can achieve this by reducing excess demand via our policy actions. I view getting inflation under control as important for both parts of our mandate. The best thing monetary policy can do to support a healthy labor market is to ensure that the expansion is sustained, and that means taking appropriate actions to return to price stability.\n\nBased on my current outlook and my assessment of the risks to the outlook, I believe it will be appropriate this year to move the target range of the fed funds rate up to its longer-run level, which I estimate to be about 2.5 percent, and to follow with further rate increases next year. My path is somewhat steeper than the median path in the March Summary of Economic Projections of FOMC participants, which also has the funds rate moving above its longer-run level next year.\n\nOf course, the ultimate pace at which monetary policy accommodation is removed will need to be data driven and forward looking. Given the underlying strength in the economy and the current very low level of the funds rate, I find it appealing to front-load some of the needed increases earlier rather than later in the process because it puts policy in a better position to adjust if the economy evolves differently than expected. If by the middle of the year, inflation is not beginning to moderate, we could speed up our rate increases. But if inflation is moving down faster than expected, we could slow the pace of rate increases in the second half of the year compared to the first half. The implications of the unfolding situation in Ukraine for the medium-run economic outlook in the U.S. will also be a consideration in determining the appropriate timing and pace of our monetary policy actions.\n\nAs we have seen over the past two years, the economy can evolve differently than expected. The pandemic is not behind us yet, and unfolding geopolitical events could affect the U.S. economy. So as the FOMC recalibrates monetary policy to meet today’s inflation challenge, I will stay attuned to evolving economic and financial conditions and their implications for the outlook, and I will remain committed to achieving our goals of price stability and maximum employment on behalf of the public."

I had the opportunity to speak at this event in 2019 and enjoyed being on campus. Hopefully, we will have the opportunity to meet in person soon.\n\nIn my remarks three years ago, I characterized 2019 as a year of transition for the economy and monetary policy. At that time, economic growth was expected to transition to a more sustainable pace after above-trend growth in 2018, and we were completing a monetary policy transition that had been underway for some time: a transition away from the emergency monetary policy settings needed in the wake of the Great Recession to more normal policy.\n\nToday, we are at the start of another monetary policy transition, this time away from the extraordinary accommodation that was necessary earlier in the pandemic. I will spend my time discussing the economic rationale for the transition and the implications for monetary policy going forward. As a reminder, the views I present today will be my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Economy\n\nDespite the challenges posed by the pandemic, U.S. economic growth was very strong last year. Real GDP grew at about a 5-1/2 percent rate, the highest annual pace since 1984; firms added a record 6.7 million jobs to their payrolls; and the unemployment rate moved down to about 4 percent, close to its pre-pandemic level. The economy's strength reflected very robust demand by households and businesses. This demand was supported by extraordinary fiscal policy and monetary policy, as well as the deployment of vaccinations, which allowed the economy to reopen more fully. But this strong demand came at the same time that there were constraints on product supply and labor supply. The imbalances between supply and demand have put significant upward pressures on prices and wages. Inflation readings in the U.S. are at their highest levels in about 40 years, and nominal wages are accelerating at a faster pace than we have seen in decades.\n\nThere are risks and uncertainty around the outlook, including those engendered by the geopolitical events unfolding today. My modal outlook continues to be that the strong economic expansion continues this year. Just as the Delta variant did last autumn, the Omicron variant has weighed on activity in high-contact services. But new case counts and hospitalizations are declining sharply, so I expect that households and businesses will once again prove to be resilient in the face of the virus. Once Omicron is behind us, demand should rebound fairly quickly because both business and household balance sheets are very healthy. But compared to last year, demand is likely to moderate this year as the support from the pandemic stimulus programs wanes and financial conditions become less accommodative. Nevertheless, the economy should still expand at an above-trend pace despite facing some challenges.\n\nOne challenge is the imbalance between supply and demand I mentioned earlier. While earlier in the pandemic, the economic effects of the virus were mainly on the demand side, now the effects are seen mainly on the supply side. Differences in virus conditions and virus containment policies across the globe have disrupted global supply chains. Firms are struggling to get necessary parts and materials through clogged ports and transportation channels. Many businesses are facing significantly higher costs for available inputs. Rather than abating over last year, the disruptions continued to constrain economic activity. But now, there are some hopeful signs. Anecdotal reports suggest that some of the constraints may be stabilizing and delivery times appear to be improving. We routinely speak with a large number of business and community contacts in our District, which comprises Ohio and parts of Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and West Virginia. Manufacturers take as a hopeful sign that deliveries have become more predictable even though lead times remain very long, and half of our business contacts expect some easing of the supply disruptions in the second half of this year. Still, more than a third of our contacts do not expect improvement until 2023.\n\nBusinesses are also struggling to find workers. By a number of measures, labor markets are very strong and the demand for workers is well outstripping labor supply. While payroll employment is still nearly 3 million jobs below its February 2020 pre-pandemic level, job gains have been very strong, averaging over 550 thousand per month last year. Broad-based gains continued in January, despite the effects of Omicron, and the November and December payroll gains were revised up, suggesting continued positive momentum in the labor market. The unemployment rate is now 4 percent, down nearly 2-1/2 percentage points from a year ago. The job openings rate is considerably higher than it was before the pandemic. According to government statistics, there are about 1.7 job openings per unemployed person.\n\nPandemic-related factors, including child and elder care responsibilities and fear of the virus, have contributed to the undersupply of workers. These factors should fade over time, though the precise timing and magnitude are open questions. Over a longer horizon, labor force participation has been trending down since early 2000 due to demographics, and many more people retired during the pandemic than predicted solely by demographics. So labor markets are likely to remain tight for some time.\n\nIn response to labor shortages, businesses have been raising wages, offering signing and retention bonuses, allowing much more flexible work schedules and locations, and speeding up automation. Average hourly earnings grew nearly 5 percent last year, and upward pressure on wages continues, although, in many cases, the wage increases are not keeping up with inflation.\n\nThe imbalances between demand and supply in both product and labor markets are contributing to the very high inflation readings. Measured year-over-year, PCE inflation reached almost 6 percent in December, and core PCE inflation reached almost 5 percent. Both are at their highest levels since the early 1980s. The Cleveland Fed's median PCE inflation measure and the median CPI and trimmed-mean CPI measures are useful indicators of the underlying inflation trend and all have moved well above 2 percent.1 As inflationary pressures rose last year, they also broadened considerably across a wider range of goods and services. Inflation forecasts were revised up all year. In the December 2020 Summary of Economic Projections of FOMC participants, the median projection of PCE inflation for 2021 was 1.8 percent. By the December 2021 SEP, that projection had risen to 5.3 percent.\n\nI do expect some improvement in inflation readings later in the year as demand moderates and capacity constraints in both product and labor markets begin to ease. Nonetheless, I expect inflation to remain above 2 percent this year and next, and I see the risks to inflation as tilted to the upside. Geopolitical events add upside risk to the inflation forecast even as they put some downside risk to the near-term growth forecast. My projection of some moderation in inflation is conditioned on the FOMC taking appropriate action to recalibrate monetary policy to an economy in which inflation has been running well above our 2 percent goal for some time, labor markets are very strong, and solid momentum in underlying demand is expected to continue.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nThe FOMC's policy decisions reflect its strong commitment to achieving its dual-mandate goals of price stability and maximum employment. The task before the Fed is to remove accommodation at the pace necessary to bring inflation under control while sustaining the expansion in economic activity and healthy labor markets. Monetary policy cannot alleviate the constraints on supply. But it can help to moderate demand by making broader financial conditions less accommodative, thereby reducing inflationary pressures. Doing so will help sustain the expansion in activity and healthy labor markets.\n\nThe FOMC is beginning the process of reducing accommodation. Since March 2020, the FOMC has maintained the target range of the fed funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent to support the economy. At our January meeting, the Committee announced that it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range. Barring an unexpected turn in the economy, I believe it will be appropriate to move the funds rate up in March and follow with further increases in the coming months. The ultimate pace at which monetary policy accommodation is removed will need to be data driven and forward looking. If, by mid-year, I assess that inflation is not going to moderate as expected, then I would support removing accommodation at a faster pace over the second half of the year. On the other hand, if inflation moves down faster than expected, then the pace of removal could be slower in the second half of the year than in the first half. The implications of the unfolding situation in Ukraine for the medium-run economic outlook in the U.S. will also be a consideration in determining the appropriate pace at which to remove accommodation.\n\nThroughout the pandemic we have also used our balance sheet as a policy tool, buying large volumes of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities. These asset purchases were an important policy response to the severe strains in financial markets seen early in the pandemic, and throughout the pandemic, they have helped to support the economy in the midst of the unprecedented COVID shock. But now, markets are functioning and a solid expansion is underway, so the FOMC has been winding these purchases down. Last September, the FOMC indicated that it would soon be time to moderate the pace of asset purchases; in November, it began reducing the monthly pace of purchases; and in December, it sped up the reductions. This January, the FOMC announced that the purchases would end in March and released a set of principles it plans to follow as it significantly reduces the size of its balance sheet.\n\nAt nearly $9 trillion in assets, the Fed's balance sheet is now about double the size it was before the pandemic. The last time the Fed undertook a process to reduce the size of its balance sheet was after the Great Recession. That process started nearly two years after liftoff of the funds rate from zero and when the target range had risen to 1 to 1-1/4 percent; the reduction process went on for almost two years. This time, the balance sheet is much larger and inflation is much higher. So barring a material change in the economy, I support our beginning to reduce the size of the balance sheet soon and to go at a faster pace than we did last time. I would also support selling some of our mortgage-backed securities at some point during the reduction process, something we did not do last time, in order to speed the conversion of our portfolio's composition to primarily Treasury securities. Holding mainly Treasuries minimizes the effect of our balance-sheet assets on the allocation of credit across economic sectors, which is one of the guiding principles the FOMC released in January.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, this year the FOMC will be transitioning monetary policy away from the emergency levels of accommodation needed earlier in the pandemic and recalibrating policy to today's economic challenges. Accommodation will be removed at the pace necessary to bring inflation under control while sustaining the expansion in activity and healthy labor markets. As last year clearly shows, the economy can evolve differently than expected. We are not through the pandemic yet and other risks, including unfolding geopolitical events, could affect the U.S. economy. So I will be carefully monitoring economic and financial developments and assessing their implications for the outlook and the risks around the outlook, as the FOMC recalibrates monetary policy in pursuit of its goals of maximum employment and price stability."

            "content": "I thank the New York University Stern Center for Global Economy and Business or the opportunity to speak with you this afternoon. I have fond memories of being an adjunct professor of finance at NYU in the late 1990s and co-teaching the Ph.D. Seminar in Financial Institutions. So it feels good to be back in the classroom, so to speak. I am looking forward to the interactive part of today’s program, but let me start the session with some remarks about the economy and monetary policy. As a reminder, the views I present today will be my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThis year will be one of transition for monetary policy. We will be transitioning away from the extraordinarily accommodative monetary policy that was needed earlier in the pandemic and recalibrating policy to today’s economic challenges. The FOMC is taking steps to begin that process. Our main policy tool is the federal funds rate. Since March 2020, the FOMC has maintained the target range of the fed funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent to support the economy. At our January meeting, the Committee announced that it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range.\n\nThroughout the pandemic, we have also used our balance sheet as a policy tool, buying large volumes of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities. These asset purchases were an important policy response to the severe strains in financial markets seen early in the pandemic, and they have continued to support the economy in the midst of the unprecedented COVID shock. But now, markets are functioning and a solid expansion is underway, so the FOMC has been winding down these purchases. Last September, the FOMC indicated that it would soon be time to moderate the pace of asset purchases; in November, it began reducing the monthly pace of purchases; and in December, it sped up the reductions. This January, the FOMC announced that the purchases would end in March and released a set of principles it plans to follow as it significantly reduces the size of its balance sheet.\n\nToday, I will frame my remarks about the monetary policy transition around three key points:\n\nThe Case for Transitioning Away from Emergency Levels of Monetary Policy Accommodation\n\nThe FOMC’s policy decisions reflect its strong commitment to achieving its dual-mandate goals of price stability and maximum employment. Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, economic growth was very strong last year, and the outlook is for continued solid growth this year. Last year, real GDP grew at a 5.5 percent rate, its highest annual pace since 1984. The Omicron variant has weighed on activity in high-contact services and has put a strain on hospitals, healthcare workers, and other essential services employees. But, thankfully, Omicron is less virulent than earlier strains, and new case counts and hospitalizations are declining sharply in many parts of the U.S. Households and businesses are once again proving to be resilient in the face of the virus.\n\nAlthough there continue to be risks and uncertainty around the outlook, when we get beyond Omicron, demand should rebound quickly because the balance sheets of businesses and households are very healthy. I expect some moderation in demand this year compared to last year, as the support from the pandemic stimulus programs wanes and financial conditions become less accommodative. But the economy should still expand at an above-trend pace despite facing some challenges.\n\nOne challenge is the imbalance between demand and supply. The effects of the pandemic on the economy have shifted over time. Early in the pandemic, when the economy shut down, the effects were mainly on the demand side. Now, with the economy reopened, the effects are mainly on the supply side. Demand is strong and supply is struggling to keep up. It turns out that shutting down the economy can happen pretty quickly but starting the economy back up again is slower and more complicated. And this has implications for both parts of the FOMC’s dual mandate.\n\nThe pandemic has disrupted global supply chains, and firms are still struggling to get necessary parts and materials through clogged ports and transportation channels. Many businesses are facing significantly higher costs for available inputs. Rather than abating over last year, the disruptions continued to constrain economic activity. Anecdotal reports suggest that some of the constraints may be stabilizing, delivery times appear to be improving, and half of our business contacts tell us that they expect some easing of the supply disruptions during the second half of this year. Still, more than a third of our contacts do not expect improvement until 2023.\n\nBusinesses are also struggling to get workers. By a number of measures, labor markets are very strong and the demand for workers is well outstripping labor supply. While payroll employment is still nearly 3 million jobs below its February 2020 pre-pandemic level, job gains averaged over 550 thousand per month last year. The January jobs report showed continuing broad-based gains, with Omicron mainly affecting hours worked and absences. The unemployment rate is now 4 percent, down nearly 2-1/2 percentage points from a year ago. The job openings rate is considerably higher than it was before the pandemic. According to government statistics, there are about 1.7 job openings per unemployed person.\n\nPandemic-related factors, including child and elder care responsibilities and fear of the virus, have contributed to the undersupply of workers. These factors should fade over time, but the precise timing and magnitude are open questions. Over a longer horizon, participation has been trending down since early 2000 due to demographics, and many more people retired during the pandemic than predicted solely by demographics. So labor markets are likely to remain tight for some time. Businesses cite the shortage of labor as a very significant issue and have responded by raising wages, offering signing and retention bonuses, allowing much more flexible work schedules and locations, and speeding up automation. Average hourly earnings grew nearly 5 percent last year, and upward pressure on wages continues as firms scramble to retain and attract workers.\n\nThe imbalances between demand and supply in both product and labor markets are contributing to the very high inflation readings. Measured year-over-year, PCE inflation reached 5.8 percent in December, and core PCE inflation reached 4.9 percent. Earlier last year, inflationary pressures were confined to a handful of the most pandemic-affected categories. As the year wore on, the inflationary pressures broadened considerably. In December 2020, about one-third of the components used to compute the Cleveland Fed’s median CPI measure had inflation rates of 3 percent or more; that share has now risen to about three-quarters of the components.\n\nHigh inflation imposes a real burden on households and businesses, especially those that do not have the wherewithal to pay more for essential goods and services. Allowing inflation to remain at high levels can lead firms, households, and financial market participants to expect higher inflation over the longer term. Such a rise in longer-term inflation expectations could then spill over into wage- and price-setting dynamics, leading to even more persistent inflation. And persistently high inflation would undermine sustaining a strong and inclusive expansion.\n\nI do expect some improvement in inflation readings later in the year as demand moderates and capacity constraints in both product and labor markets begin to ease. Nonetheless, I expect inflation to remain above 2 percent this year and next, and I see the risks to inflation as tilted to the upside. My projection of some moderation in inflation is conditioned on the FOMC taking appropriate action to transition away from the current emergency levels of accommodation and recalibrate to an economy in which inflation has been running well above our 2 percent goal for some time, labor markets are very strong, and solid momentum in underlying demand is expected to continue.\n\nThe Economy Is in a Different Place Than During the Last Transition\n\nThis brings me to my next point on what the transition will look like. The last time we began a transition to less accommodative monetary policy was after the Great Recession. The economy is in a very different place now than it was then, so this transition will need to be different, too.\n\nThe recovery from the Great Recession was a slow one. While the recession officially ended in June 2009, the FOMC held the funds rate at zero until December 2015, when it raised the rate by 25 basis points. At that time, inflation was running below 1 percent, the unemployment rate was 5 percent, and real GDP growth was under 2 percent. The FOMC did not raise the funds rate again until a year later. Thereafter, the funds rate was gradually raised, with three 25-basis-point increases in 2017 and four more in 2018, the last one in December of that year, bringing the funds rate target range to 2-1/4 to 2‑1/2 percent.\n\nWith respect to the balance sheet, the FOMC engaged in sizable asset purchases in the wake of the Great Recession, increasing its asset holdings to about $4.5 trillion. The Fed did not begin reducing the size of its balance sheet until October 2017, nearly two years after liftoff and when the target range of the funds rate had risen to 1 to 1-1/4 percent. At that point, the unemployment rate was about 4-1/4 percent, real output growth was near 2.7 percent, and inflation was still running slightly below 2 percent. Gradual reductions in assets continued until August 2019.\n\nThis time is very different. Instead of running below target, inflation has been running well above target for some time and is now at a nearly 40-year high. Labor markets are tight and the economy grew at a 5­‑1/2 percent pace last year. In addition, at nearly $9 trillion in assets, our balance sheet is now about double the size it was when the last reduction process began.\n\nSo, barring a material change in the economy, I anticipate that it will be appropriate to move the funds rate up at a faster pace this time and to begin reducing the size of the balance sheet soon and more quickly than last time. In terms of the balance sheet, I would also support selling some of our mortgage-backed securities at some point during the reduction process, something we did not do last time. Sales would help to speed the return of our portfolio’s composition to primarily Treasury securities, which would minimize the effect of our balance-sheet holdings on the allocation of credit across economic sectors, one of the FOMC’s principles for reducing the size of our balance sheet.\n\nThe ultimate path policy takes will depend on the evolution of the economy, which brings me to my final point which concerns monetary policy communications.\n\nMonetary Policy Communications\n\nAs you know, there was a substantial shift in the FOMC’s view of appropriate policy over the last year. In last March’s Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), the median path of FOMC participants indicated that no change in the policy rate would be appropriate in 2022. By the December SEP, the median appropriate policy path showed the federal funds rate moving up by 75 basis points this year. This change in projections reflected economic and financial developments and the resulting evolution of the FOMC’s economic outlook and the risks around the outlook. For example, last March, the SEP’s median projections for unemployment and inflation for 2021 were 4.5 percent and 2.4 percent, respectively, and the majority of participants saw the risks to each as broadly balanced. Instead, by the fourth quarter of 2021, the unemployment rate had actually fallen to 4.2 percent and year-over-year inflation had risen to 5.5 percent. And as indicated in the December SEP, the majority of participants now saw the inflation risks as weighted to the upside. These economic developments informed the change in the FOMC participants’ assessments of appropriate policy.\n\nAs the FOMC begins the process of reducing accommodation, its communications will need to transition as well. Earlier in the pandemic, in addition to the extraordinarily accommodative settings of our policy rate and asset purchases, we also provided fairly explicit forward guidance about our future policy settings. In extraordinary economic times, forward guidance is more than a communications device. It is also a monetary policy tool that has the potential to increase the degree of monetary policy accommodation, especially when interest rates are essentially at their zero lower bound. By reducing uncertainty about the future path of policy, forward guidance can help lower interest rates by reducing the premiums investors demand to compensate them for interest-rate uncertainty. In addition, at least in theory, if the central bank indicates that the future path of short-term interest rates will be low for a long time – perhaps lower and for longer than would have been consistent with the central bank’s past behavior – this can also put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, thereby spurring current economic activity.\n\nBut now, instead of wanting to increase accommodation, the FOMC will be reducing it, so policy communications need to transition away from providing explicit forward guidance. Instead, we will need to convey the overall trajectory of policy and give the rationale for our policy decisions based on our assessment of the outlook and risks around the outlook, which are informed by economic and financial developments. This change in communications will provide a better sense of the FOMC’s policy reaction function and should not be interpreted as the FOMC backing away from transparency. Clear communications are a very important part of monetary policymaking. First, to the extent that households, businesses, and financial market participants understand how policymakers are likely to react to economic and financial developments – whether the developments are anticipated or unanticipated – their policy expectations will better align with those of policymakers. This means their decisions will be better informed and monetary policy will be more effective. Second, policy transitions are often met with volatility in financial markets, and this time is no exception. By keeping financial market participants’ expectations aligned with those of policymakers, clear communications can mitigate the volatility that would occur if there were a rapid or sizable realignment.\n\nSummary\n\nIn summary, I believe the case for transitioning monetary policy away from emergency levels of accommodation and recalibrating policy to today’s economic challenges in pursuit of our dual-mandate goals is very compelling. While the experience after the Great Recession will inform this transition, the economy is in a very different place, so the transition will be different, too. As monetary policy transitions, our policy communications will also need to transition away from explicit forward guidance and toward conveying a sense of our policy trajectory and explaining the rationale for our policy decisions in terms of economic and financial developments and their implications for the outlook and risks around the outlook.\n\nThe task before the Fed is to remove accommodation at the pace necessary to bring inflation under control while sustaining the expansion in economic activity and healthy labor markets. Barring an unexpected turn in the economy, I believe it will be appropriate to move the funds rate up in March and follow with further increases in the coming months. If by mid-year, I assess that inflation is not going to moderate as expected, then I would support removing accommodation at a faster pace over the second half of the year. On the other hand, if inflation moves down faster than expected, then the pace of removal could be slower in the second half of the year than in the first half. So, the pace at which monetary policy accommodation is removed will need to be data driven and forward looking. The communications challenge will be to convey a good sense of how policy is likely to respond conditional on how the economy evolves without implying that policy is pre-committed to a particular path regardless of how the economy evolves."

            "content": "It is a real pleasure to join you again in the European Economics and Financial Centre's Distinguished Speakers Seminar series. I do hope we will be able to meet together in London sometime soon. But regardless of whether it is held in-person or virtually, I always enjoy this speaking opportunity because your questions present interesting perspectives, which I contemplate long after the session is over. So I will try to keep my prepared remarks on the U.S. economy and what's ahead for monetary policy relatively brief. As a reminder, the views I present will be my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nEconomic Activity\n\nIn an outlook talk at the beginning of the year, it is usually very safe to say that last year was an interesting one and this year is shaping up to be an interesting one as well. That sentiment definitely fits our current situation. When we met early last year, I said that I thought the prospects were good for a much more favorable U.S. economy in 2021 than we had in 2020. That prediction came to pass, but the improvements in the economy obscure the many challenges households, businesses, and policymakers faced because of the ongoing pandemic. Indeed, economic developments continue to reflect the influence of the virus, as well as the extraordinary fiscal policy and monetary policy put in place in response to the pandemic.\n\nDespite the challenges, U.S. economic growth was very strong last year. Real GDP grew at a 5.5 percent pace, the highest annual pace since 1984. Firms added a record 6.7 million jobs to their payrolls and the unemployment rate moved down to about 4 percent, close to its pre-pandemic level. The economy's strength reflected very robust demand by households and businesses. This demand was supported by extraordinary fiscal policy and monetary policy, as well as the deployment of vaccinations, which allowed the economy to reopen more fully. But this strong demand came at the same time there were constraints on product supply and labor supply. The imbalances between supply and demand have put significant upward pressures on prices and wages. Inflation readings in the U.S. are at their highest levels in nearly 40 years, and nominal wages are accelerating at a faster pace than we have seen in decades.\n\nAlthough there continue to be risks and uncertainty around the outlook, I expect the strong economic expansion to continue this year. Just as the Delta variant did last autumn, the Omicron variant is weighing on activity in high-contact services such as travel, dining, and leisure and hospitality. This variant has put a strain on hospitals, healthcare workers, and other essential services employees. Because Omicron is so transmissible, it has exacerbated the labor shortages many businesses have been facing, and in response, many have had to reduce their operating hours. Thankfully, Omicron is less virulent than earlier strains, and new case counts and hospitalizations are declining sharply in many parts of the U.S. Since the start of the pandemic, as vaccination rates have risen and households and businesses have learned to navigate the virus, each new wave of the virus has had less of an economic impact. My expectation is that the immediate economic effects of the Omicron wave will be relatively small and short-lived, and that households and businesses will once again prove to be resilient in the face of the virus.\n\nWhen we get beyond Omicron, demand should rebound quickly. Business balance sheets are healthy. Many consumers have the wherewithal to continue to spend because household balance sheets are also very healthy, bolstered by accumulated savings, higher earnings, and rising net worth. I expect growth to be above trend this year, but to moderate from last year's robust pace, as the support from the pandemic stimulus programs wanes and financial conditions become less accommodative.\n\nSince the economy reopened, supply has struggled to keep up with demand. While shutting the economy down at the start of the pandemic happened very quickly, starting the economy back up again has proved to be slower and more complicated. Differences in virus conditions and virus containment policies across the globe have disrupted global supply chains. Firms have struggled to get necessary parts and materials through clogged ports and transportation channels and are facing significantly higher costs for available inputs. As last year wore on, rather than abating, the disruptions continued to constrain economic activity. A recent sign of improvement comes from manufacturers in our Federal Reserve District, who report that while lead times remain long, deliveries have become more predictable. Nonetheless, while half of our business contacts expect some easing of the supply disruptions during the second half of this year, more than a third do not expect improvement until 2023.\n\nLabor Market Conditions\n\nBy a number of measures, labor markets are very strong and the demand for workers is well outstripping labor supply. Payroll employment is still nearly 3 million jobs below its February 2020 pre-pandemic level, but job gains averaged over 550 thousand per month last year. Despite the effects of Omicron, the January jobs report showed continuing broad-based gains. The unemployment rate is now 4 percent, down nearly 2-1/2 percentage points from a year ago. The job openings rate is considerably higher than it was before the pandemic. According to government statistics, there are about 1.7 job openings per unemployed person.\n\nPandemic-related factors have contributed to the undersupply of workers. Some people, especially women, left the workforce during the pandemic because of child or elder care responsibilities. Some may be waiting until virus conditions improve before reentering the workforce. Others likely took the opportunity that their accumulated savings gave them to retrain for better jobs. These pandemic-related factors that are holding back labor supply should fade over time, but when and by how much are open questions. Over a longer horizon, participation has been trending down since early 2000 due to demographics. In addition, during the pandemic, many more people retired than predicted solely by demographic factors, and in previous business cycles, retirees have not tended to return to the workforce. This means that it will likely take some time before labor demand and labor supply come into balance.\n\nBusinesses cite the shortage of labor as a very significant issue and have responded by raising wages, offering signing and retention bonuses, allowing much more flexible work schedules and locations, and speeding up automation. Average hourly earnings grew nearly 5 percent last year, and upward pressure on wages continues as firms scramble to retain and attract workers. Seventy percent of our business contacts reported increasing wages in the past month, and the share raising their wages has been 60 percent or higher since last July.\n\nInflation\n\nCurrently, the imbalances between demand and supply in product and labor markets are contributing to the very high inflation readings. Firms tell us that they are having little trouble passing on their higher costs to their customers. Measured year-over-year, PCE inflation reached 5.8 percent in December, and core PCE inflation reached 4.9 percent. Both are at their highest levels since the early 1980s. The Cleveland Fed's median PCE inflation, median CPI, and trimmed-mean CPI are useful measures of the underlying inflation trend and all have moved well above 2 percent.1\n\nInflation levels began moving up last year as the economy reopened. At first, inflationary pressures were confined to a handful of the most pandemic-affected categories, like lumber and durable goods. But as the year wore on, the inflationary pressures broadened considerably. In December 2020, one-third of the components used to compute the Cleveland Fed's median CPI measure had inflation rates of 3 percent or more; that share has now risen to three-quarters of the components.\n\nAt the end of 2020, many forecasters, including those at the Fed, thought that as the economy reopened more fully in 2021, inflation rates would move up but remain slightly below our 2 percent target for the year. As supply constraints pushed inflation rates above 2 percent early in 2021, most forecasters expected inflation to move back down as constraints eased. But the supply constraints have persisted, demand has been very strong, and inflation has continued to rise. As a result, inflation forecasts had to be revised up over the year.\n\nYou can see this in our own FOMC projections. As its name suggests, the FOMC's Summary of Economic Projections – or SEP – gives a summary of the economic projections submitted by each FOMC participant. In the December 2020 SEP, the median projection of what PCE inflation would be in 2021 was 1.8 percent. By the December 2021 SEP, that projection had risen to 5.3 percent. In my view, even with the upward revisions, the risks to inflation are still tilted to the upside.\n\nHigh inflation imposes a real burden on households and businesses, especially those that do not have the wherewithal to pay more for essential goods and services. The nominal wage increases over the past year have benefited many families, but for many of them, the increases have not kept up with inflation. Allowing inflation to remain at high levels can lead firms, households, and financial market participants to expect higher inflation over the longer term. A rise in longer-term inflation expectations could then spill over into wage- and price-setting dynamics, leading to even more persistent inflation. And persistently high inflation would undermine sustaining a strong and inclusive expansion.\n\nI do expect some improvement in inflation readings later in the year as demand moderates and capacity constraints in both product and labor markets begin to ease. But the timing and magnitude of that easing of constraints remain uncertain. My expectation is that inflation will moderate but remain above 2 percent this year and next, but this forecast is conditional on the FOMC taking appropriate action.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nJust as demand and supply need rebalancing, so does monetary policy. Inflation has been running well above our 2 percent goal for some time, labor markets are very strong, and solid momentum in underlying demand is expected to continue. So the extraordinarily accommodative monetary policy that was needed earlier in the pandemic is no longer appropriate. Moreover, as inflation rates have risen, real interest rates have moved down, meaning financial conditions have become even more accommodative, further raising demand amid constrained supply. While monetary policy cannot alleviate the constraints on supply, it can help to moderate demand by making broader financial conditions less accommodative, thereby reducing inflationary pressures.\n\nThe FOMC is now taking steps toward beginning the process of reducing accommodation. In November, the FOMC started reducing the monthly pace at which it had been purchasing Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities; in December, it sped up the reductions; and in January, it announced that the purchases would end in March. These asset purchases were an important policy response to the severe strains in financial markets seen early in the pandemic, and they have continued to support the economy in the midst of the unprecedented COVID shock. But now, markets are functioning and a solid expansion is underway, so these purchases are no longer needed.\n\nThe Fed's main policy tool is the federal funds rate. Since March 2020, the FOMC has maintained the target range of the fed funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent. This January, the Committee announced that it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range. While the Omicron variant may weigh on activity in the near term, the high levels of inflation and the tightness in labor markets make a compelling case to begin recalibrating the stance of monetary policy. Barring an unexpected turn in the economy, I support beginning to remove accommodation by moving the funds rate up in March.\n\nWhat about the future course of monetary policy? It is clear that removing the extraordinary monetary policy accommodation is needed to help rebalance the economy. The last time we began such a process was in December 2015, and it was a very gradual process, with the target range of the fed funds rate reaching 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent in December 2018. This time, I anticipate that it will be appropriate to move the funds rate up at a faster pace because inflation is considerably higher and labor markets are much tighter than in 2015. In my view, increases in the fed funds rate in the coming months will be needed, but the ultimate path of the fed funds rate in terms of the number and pace of increases will depend on how the economy evolves. For example, if by mid-year, I assess that inflation is not going to moderate as expected, then I would support removing accommodation at a faster pace over the second half of the year. On the other hand, if inflation moves down faster than expected, then the pace of removal could be slower in the second half of the year than in the first half.\n\nIn terms of our balance sheet, we currently hold nearly $9 trillion in assets, which is about 36 percent of nominal GDP. This is double the asset holdings at the start of the pandemic. In January, the FOMC released a set of principles to guide the planned significant reduction in the size of our balance sheet. These principles affirm that the federal funds rate is our main tool for adjusting monetary policy, that reductions in the balance sheet will commence after the process of increasing the policy rate has begun, and that we intend to reduce our security holdings in a predictable way over time. The principles also reaffirm that in the longer run, the FOMC will hold primarily Treasury securities in its portfolio to minimize the effect of the Fed's holdings on the allocation of credit across sectors of the economy. Today, as a result of our purchases, about a third of our portfolio, over $2.5 trillion, comprises agency securities. While our principles state that we will reduce balance-sheet assets primarily by adjusting the reinvestment amounts of the principal payments we receive on our assets, I would support selling some of our mortgage-backed securities at some point during the reduction period to speed the conversion of our portfolio's composition to primarily Treasuries.\n\nThe FOMC has begun to discuss the plan to implement balance-sheet reduction in accordance with the guiding principles. We have the benefit of having done this once before. In the wake of the Great Recession, the FOMC engaged in sizable asset purchases, increasing its asset holdings to about $4.5 trillion, or about 25 percent of nominal GDP at its peak. In October 2017, nearly two years after liftoff of the fed funds rate from zero and with the target range at 1 to 1-1/4 percent, the FOMC began shrinking its balance sheet at a gradual pace. The reductions lasted until August 2019. While this experience will inform our plans, this time, things are different. First, the balance sheet is about double the size it was then, and even in our ample-reserves operating regime, it is considerably larger than the size needed to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively. Second, inflation is much higher and labor markets are much tighter than they were then. So in my view, conditions warrant that we start balance-sheet reductions soon and go at a faster pace than we did last time.\n\nWhen to stop the reductions will depend on the banking sector's demand for reserves, as well as the distribution of that demand across institutions, which will evolve over time. As the process to reduce the size of the balance sheet progresses, we will be monitoring developments in money markets to determine the appropriate levels of reserves and balance-sheet size at which to stop the reductions. We will remain prepared to adjust the plan in light of economic and financial developments, if necessary.\n\nSummary\n\nIn summary, in setting monetary policy, the Fed is committed to achieving both parts of its dual mandate: price stability and maximum employment. While the current extraordinarily accommodative stance of monetary policy was needed to support the economy earlier in the pandemic, that stance is no longer appropriate. Strong demand in both product and labor markets is outpacing constrained supply, and inflation is at its highest level in nearly 40 years. Inflation well above our goal undermines sustaining a strong and inclusive expansion. So the task before us is to remove accommodation at the pace necessary to bring inflation under control. Doing so will help sustain the expansion in activity and healthy labor markets.\n\nThe process of transitioning to a less accommodative monetary policy stance in the U.S. is beginning. As this process continues, our monetary policy decisions will need to be data driven and forward looking. Economic and financial developments and their implications for the outlook and the risks around the outlook will inform the pace at which we remove accommodation in pursuit of our goals.\n\nWhile their actions are not coordinated, other central banks, including the Bank of England, have also begun to move to a less accommodative monetary policy stance as economic conditions have improved and inflation has risen. Policy transitions are often met with some volatility in financial markets, and this time is no exception. Clear communications can help keep the public's policy expectations aligned with those of policymakers during the policy transitions underway. Despite the challenges and risks, my expectations are that these transitions will be successful, inflation will come under control, and the economic expansion will be sustained."

            "content": "It is a pleasure to welcome you to this year's conference on Managing Cyber Risk from the C-Suite. This is the fourth annual conference in this series, and each year the discussions have both broadened and deepened our understanding of the cyber risks faced by the financial system. It is hard to get through a week without hearing about a new cybersecurity event that has affected an organization and its customers. These events impose costs and affect operations at institutions of all sizes. Efforts to disrupt an institution's operations; to steal, corrupt, or destroy data and intellectual property; or to divert funds have become more prevalent. According to Boston Consulting Group, financial services firms are 300 times as likely as other types of companies to be targeted by a cyber attack.1 Just as the financial system is constantly evolving, so, too, are the cybersecurity risks that institutions need to assess and manage. Given the vital role that financial services firms play in supporting a strong global economy – a role clearly demonstrated throughout the pandemic – it behooves us all to continually expand our knowledge of the risks we face and the best way to combat them.\n\nCybersecurity and Financial Stability\n\nGiven the Federal Reserve System's role in fostering a strong economy and a stable financial system, cybersecurity is a high priority for us. To put it succinctly, there is no financial stability without cybersecurity. Indeed, at a recent European Central Bank Forum, Fed Chair Jay Powell said that a successful cyber attack on a large financial institution or financial market utility is one of the top risks to financial stability.2 And surveys indicate that this view is widely shared by the industry and other financial regulators across the globe.3 While much progress has been made in addressing more typical banking risks, including credit, liquidity, and operational risks, risks to cybersecurity are expanding, very dynamic, and becoming increasingly sophisticated. Cyber attacks have become more systematic, maliciously targeting financial firms and playing out over time for maximum effect.\n\nCyber threats pose some unique hazards to financial stability. Because of the complex interconnections and dependencies among financial firms, cyber threats are more likely to be correlated across institutions and to have wider-spread negative effects than a typical operational problem. An attack that compromises an institution's system or data can impair its ability to service creditors not directly affected by the attack. In addition, an attack on a trading platform, a settlement and payments system, or a central securities depository could have a major impact on the financial system as a whole because these are critical infrastructures on which financial firms depend and for which there are few substitutes. The advent of new technologies like cloud computing creates another concentrated risk, as there are only a handful of third-party providers of these services. Cyber risk can also be amplified by coordination failure. Decision-making tends to be decentralized across financial institutions and across global financial regulatory agencies; so without prior engagement, guidance, and proper communication channels, a small attack can be propagated across the system.\n\nA recent Federal Reserve study analyzed the potential impact of a hypothetical cyber attack on the five largest participants in the U.S. wholesale, large-value payments network, called Fedwire. Because these large players account for close to 40 percent of total payments on the system, an attack on these institutions would have spillover effects on others, with an average spillover impact on about 38 percent of banking system assets, excluding the attacked institutions. Because of the nature of Fedwire, the institutions under attack would be able to receive funds but not send them out, and in the simulation, the average liquidity shortfall in the financial system would grow from $122 billion on the first day of the attack to $1 trillion by the fifth day.\n\nAs much as individual firms are investing in cybersecurity – and it is a lot – as a nation and globally, we are likely underinvesting. This is because cybersecurity is a public good: the overall financial system conveys benefits to us all. Individual institutions certainly have incentives to invest in their own cybersecurity, and banks have been making major investments to monitor and protect their systems against attack. But the social benefit conveyed by a well-functioning and resilient financial system, one in which the public can continue to have a lot of confidence, likely requires a higher level of investment in cybersecurity than what individual firms would decide to do on their own, as they consider the tradeoff between the risk of loss to their firm from a cyber attack versus the cost of that investment. In addition, to the extent that individual firms are relying on shared services, in considering how much to invest in their own cybersecurity, they should be entertaining the possibility that those shared services could be heavily taxed in the event other firms are attacked at the same time they are4 or that the shared service itself could be the entry point for a system-wide attack. These types of externalities may not be part of any one firm's investment decision. Moreover, an individual firm may rely on others in the shared network to make investments that make the network more secure, but if every firm thinks this way, there will be underinvestment in security.5\n\nCybersecurity and the Federal Reserve System\n\nThe public good aspect of cybersecurity and the Federal Reserve's role in ensuring the resiliency of the financial system mean that the Fed has a role to play in helping the financial services industry improve its ability to prevent, detect, and recover from cyber attacks. We are making sure we are doing the same with our own payments systems. Because attacks continue to grow in sophistication, even the best cyber controls will not be able to stop all determined attackers; so ensuring operational resiliency is critical. An institution's being prepared for and having the ability to withstand and effectively recover from an attack are becoming increasingly important. From a systemic resiliency perspective, banks' timely notification to their supervisory authorities when an incident occurs can be a big help. As the Fed improves the efficiency and speed of services like Fedwire, and as we develop the FedNowSM instant payments system, timely reporting is becoming even more important, since it will allow us to coordinate a systemic response that minimizes service disruptions in the event multiple firms are simultaneously attacked.\n\nIn order to promote financial system resiliency, the Fed has taken steps to ensure that our supervision of banks' cyber security posture is effective. We have been developing clear and consistent standards for assessing financial institutions' preparedness; establishing corporate governance best practices with respect to cybersecurity; hiring staff with the necessary technical skills to assess risk-management practices; and encouraging and creating avenues for information sharing among financial institutions and regulators.\n\nThe Fed has increased coordination with the other federal banking agencies in assessing cybersecurity at the nation's largest, most complex firms. We are coordinating our annual reviews of these institutions, targeting key areas of supervisory interest, including cyber risk-management practices and the resiliency and recovery of critical services. This coordination has the added benefit of reducing the regulatory burden for institutions subject to oversight from multiple regulators while making that oversight more effective. We have also raised our expectations of cyber resilience preparedness for all of the institutions we supervise, including regional and community banks.\n\nThe Fed is also focused on enhancing our own cybersecurity. The Fed is a provider of both wholesale and retail financial services to the public and the U.S. government. We need to maintain the public's trust and confidence in our ability to deliver those services. The Fed has remained secure from ever-growing cybersecurity threats. But we do not take that for granted. We are continuously working to enhance the cyber security and resiliency of our own systems, applications, and data, to ensure that we can detect and prevent an attack on our systems, and if one were to occur, making sure we can minimize the time it takes to contain it and limit the business impact on our customers. We regularly obtain cyber intelligence on how actors may attempt to attack critical Federal Reserve payments systems, we regularly test our controls to determine their capabilities in preventing these attacks from being successful, and we are continuously improving and testing our preparedness against a potential ransomware attack, which is a top threat for organizations, including the Fed. The Cleveland Fed provides critical payments services to the U.S. Treasury, including operating several systems to collect funds for federal government agencies. Our staff is constantly monitoring cybersecurity threats and potential fraudulent transactions on our systems.\n\nCybersecurity and the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\n\nThe Cleveland Fed is taking a leading role in the Federal Reserve System's cybersecurity efforts more broadly. The System's Cybersecurity Analytics Support Team, known as CAST, is based at the Cleveland Fed. This team monitors and analyzes threats faced by institutions supervised by the Federal Reserve. The Cleveland Fed recently collaborated with the Ohio Department of Commerce's Division of Financial Institutions' Technology Advisory Group to develop and perform a tabletop ransomware cyber attack exercise to help banks improve their preparedness. The exercise used the latest intelligence from CAST on how ransomware can rapidly compromise an entire network of computers and how attackers attempt to extort payments from firms in exchange for decryption keys and promises to not release stolen customer information.\n\nWe regularly share information and cyber security insights with the management teams of our District's large banks. This information sharing has been especially important during the pandemic. The Cleveland Fed was able to identify and alert firms to new cyber risks that were rapidly arising as banks were transitioning to remote work. Later today, Chad Siegrist, who heads CAST, will share the latest information on ransomware, phishing attacks, account hijacking, and other methods of cyber attacks targeted at banking organizations.\n\nAdvancing cybersecurity supervision is one of the strategic goals of the Cleveland Fed's supervision function. The Cleveland Fed participates in the Federal Reserve System's annual national horizontal review of cybersecurity for banks with assets between $100 billion and $500 billion. Fed examiners assess a bank's cybersecurity along a number of dimensions. Effective cybersecurity requires sound cyber-risk governance, including leadership's engagement in oversight of the firm's cybersecurity programs. The bank needs to have effective programs for identifying and managing risks and vulnerabilities, including those within its own technology infrastructure, those associated with vendors and third-party technology providers, and those posed by new products. The bank is assessed on its processes for incident response and its plans for timely recovery and restoration of critical functions, as well as on the basics, such as adequate technology inventories, data security, access management, and timely software patching. Our next speaker, Jennifer Burns, who is the deputy director of supervision and regulation for the Federal Reserve System, will share more information about the Fed's cyber examination program.\n\nConclusion\n\nI hope my brief remarks have made it clear why the Federal Reserve is so focused on cyber resiliency and what we at the Cleveland Fed are doing to advance both the industry's and the Fed's own resiliency against cyber incidents. The dynamic nature of the cyber landscape, with rapid technological change and ever-evolving risks that are becoming more sophisticated and complex, can make it seem like we are always running to catch up. This can be discouraging. But if one looks back over the previous years of this conference, it is clear that much progress has been made in better understanding cyber threats and how, by working together, we can best handle those threats. My expectation is that perseverance and collaboration will continue to yield benefits in making our financial system ever more resilient. And this resiliency is critical, given the importance of the financial system to our economic health."

Your theme, \"Bouncing Back,\" seems to sum things up very well, so I could probably end my talk right here. But it is probably better if I take a few moments to discuss my views on the shape of the bounce-back and the implications for monetary policy. Of course, these views will be my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nWhen we talk about the economy, it is important to remember that it is made up of households, businesses, including banks, and communities throughout the U.S. All have soldiered on through these extraordinarily difficult and unprecedented times. Ohio bankers have played a very important role in supporting families and businesses throughout the pandemic. You have provided valuable credit, risk-management, and liquidity services. Your significant contributions helped to shorten the recession and they continue to sustain the recovery.\n\nIn addition, throughout the pandemic, bankers have been providing me with valuable insights that have helped me in my role as a Federal Reserve policymaker. The Fed collects and analyzes many different statistics and uses many models to assess the economy, but hearing from the bankers on our boards and advisory councils, and bankers throughout the Fourth Federal Reserve District, helped us understand what was really happening on the ground and what might be coming. Timely information like this is always valuable when setting monetary policy, but over the past 18 months, it has been critical in helping us navigate the uncharted waters of the pandemic. I particularly want to recognize and thank the chair of your board, Tom Fraser, who serves on the Cleveland Fed's Community Depository Institutions Advisory Council; OBL director Eddie Steiner, who is currently a Cleveland Fed board member; and OBL director Todd Mason, who is a former Cleveland Fed director. The public service provided by you and the other bankers throughout our District is greatly appreciated and will continue to be important given the elevated risks and uncertainty that will be with us for some time to come.\n\nEconomic Growth\n\nBefore I discuss current conditions and the outlook, its useful to remember where we have been. Before the pandemic hit last March, the U.S. economy had been on very solid ground. The unemployment rate was at a historically low level, employment growth was strong, participation in the labor force was solid, and inflation was near the FOMC's longer-run goal of 2 percent. All that changed when almost the entire economy had to shut down quickly because of the public health crisis created by the pandemic. The economy fell into the deepest recession since the Great Depression. Real growth fell at an annual rate of over 30 percent in the second quarter of last year. In just two months, March and April 2020, the economy lost over 22 million jobs, about the same number it had added over the previous 11-year expansion. The unemployment rate rose from a pre-pandemic 3-1/2 percent to nearly 15 percent and inflation fell to under 1/2 percent.\n\nBut with the remarkable contributions of healthcare workers, the agility and resiliency of households and businesses, and with strong support from fiscal and monetary policy, the economy was able to reopen and last year's recession was the shortest one on record.\n\nA strong economic recovery is underway, but it has been an uneven one and challenges and risks remain. As the rapid spread of the Delta variant reminds us, we have to remain humble when it comes to predicting the future. Unlike in typical business cycles, virus developments and public health considerations have been critical factors determining the pace and nature of the recovery, and they will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. The initial reopening of the economy last year unleashed pent-up demand and resulted in real output growth rebounding to over 30 percent in the third quarter of last year and firms adding back almost half of the jobs lost during the shutdown, or almost 11 million jobs, over May through August 2020. But as virus cases rose last fall and winter, growth moderated and consumers pulled back on their spending.\n\nAnd then things improved again over the first half of this year. Supported by sizable fiscal stimulus, growth returned to a robust pace of about 6.5 percent as new cases declined and the relatively rapid deployment of vaccinations throughout much of the country gave households and businesses more confidence that it was safe to re-engage in activity.\n\nIn recent months, the Delta variant has led to a sharp increase in new cases, particularly among the unvaccinated. Hospitalizations and deaths have not risen to the levels seen earlier in the pandemic because of the efficacy of the vaccines, but these developments have dampened consumer sentiment and have led to a downturn in some activities that require close physical contact. So far, the adverse effects on consumer demand appear to be smaller than those seen in earlier waves of the virus. It appears that as vaccination rates have risen, households and businesses have learned to better navigate changes in virus conditions. I expect that the monthly indicators and pace of activity will continue to ebb and flow with virus developments. The Delta variant will temper consumer spending and growth over the second half of the year, compared to the first half, but I don't expect it to lead to widespread shutdowns of economic activity or to derail the recovery. Nonetheless, continued increases in vaccination rates and the deployment of safe and effective vaccines to children would contribute significantly to lowering risks and broadening the recovery.\n\nThe pandemic has not only affected the demand side of the economy; it is having significant effects on the supply side, too. Across a number of sectors, demand is strong, but supply-chain disruptions and bottlenecks are constraining activity. These constraints are now expected to last well into next year, considerably longer than originally thought. Our manufacturing contacts report that orders remain strong but backlogs have grown and lead times for deliveries have risen because of virus-related disruptions to production and at ports. Automakers have had to cut back production in the face of ongoing shortages of semiconductors. In the residential real estate market, low mortgage rates and shifts in housing preferences have increased demand. But homebuilders have not been able to ramp up supply enough to meet this demand, partly due to delays in getting building materials and their elevated cost. As a result, house prices have been soaring.\n\nOn balance, I expect growth to be less robust over the second half of this year, compared to the first, but for the year as a whole, growth will be strong, at around 5-1/2 percent, which is well above trend. Next year, I anticipate that the headwinds from supply constraints will begin to ease and the recovery will broaden. Growth is likely to remain above trend but at a more moderate pace of 3-3/4 to 4 percent, as the tailwinds coming from the pandemic-related fiscal support and pent-up demand fade.\n\nThe Labor Market\n\nThe Fed has two monetary policy goals: maximum employment and price stability. So, before I turn to monetary policy, let me discuss the labor market and inflation. Strong output growth this year has been accompanied by strong job growth. Even with the virus-driven slowdown in service-sector hiring last month, payrolls have grown an average of about 585 thousand per month so far this year, and 750 thousand per month over the last three months. The unemployment rate has fallen 1.5 percentage points since last December. Conditions in the labor market have vastly improved since their nadir in April 2020, yet there is still some distance to go. Payrolls are still over 5 million jobs below where they were before the pandemic, the unemployment rate is elevated at 5-1/4 percent, and the labor force participation rate among workers aged 16 to 54 is still about a percentage point below its pre-pandemic level. Despite the progress that has been made, by these measures, it looks like there is still considerable slack in the labor market.\n\nYet, firms across a wide range of industries and across the country have been reporting for some time that they want to hire but are struggling to find workers. The number of job openings is at its highest level since the start of that data series in 2000, and the statistics show more posted job openings than unemployed workers. So by these measures, labor markets appear to be tight.\n\nSome of our business and labor contacts thought that when the supplemental unemployment insurance benefits ended, the number of job applicants would rise. The state of Ohio stopped paying these benefits in June, but almost half of our contacts looking for workers said they had seen no increase in job applicants since May and over a third said they had actually seen a decline. This indicates that the labor market story is more complex. Labor supply has likely been held back by a perfect storm of factors, many of which reflect the unusual nature of the pandemic. The high cost and scarcity of daycare is likely a factor deterring the return of some parents1. Employment of daycare workers is still down about 12 percent from where it was pre-pandemic. That is worse than the 3.5 percent gap across all sectors and the 8 percent gap for the hard-hit food services-restaurant sector2. For those with older children, there is uncertainty about whether schools will be able to stay reliably open in the midst of the Delta wave. In addition, some workers are likely reluctant to return to the workforce until virus cases turn back down. The support received during the pandemic has given some workers the financial wherewithal to retrain for better jobs than they had before the pandemic. This is a promising development, but training takes some time.\n\nIt is possible that with more firms offering remote working arrangements and technological advances that will keep these arrangements productive, we will end up with more people in the labor force after the pandemic than we had before the pandemic. But in the meantime, firms are responding to labor shortages by increasing wages and offering more flexible work schedules and other benefits to attract and retain workers. Even with the uncertainty around the outlook stemming from the virus, my expectation is that, over time, more people will get vaccinated, the public health situation will improve, the factors weighing on labor supply will diminish, and labor supply will come into better balance with labor demand. As this happens, labor market conditions will continue to improve, firms will add to their payrolls, and the unemployment rate will fall. In my baseline forecast, the unemployment rate falls to about 4-3/4 percent by the end of this year and to about 4 percent by the end of next year.\n\nInflation\n\nIn addition to higher wage costs, many firms are having to pay higher costs for materials, components, and shipping because of supply-chain challenges. In response to the higher costs of inputs and labor, firms have increased the prices they are charging to their own customers. Measures of inflation have moved up considerably and by more than expected at the start of the year. In July, the year-over-year measure of PCE inflation moved up to 4.2 percent. Core PCE inflation, which omits food and energy prices, and is one of the measures we look at to get a sense of the underlying inflation rate, rose to 3.6 percent. Other indicators of underlying inflation, including the Cleveland Fed's measures of median CPI and trimmed mean CPI, have also increased. As inflation rates have risen, some measures of consumer and business inflation expectations have also risen after being mired at levels below those consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal over much of the previous expansion.\n\nSo far, the increases in inflation have mainly been driven by price movements in components affected by virus-related supply constraints or pent-up demand. We have already seen the prices of some of these items stabilize and move back down. Used car prices are an example. My baseline expectation is that inflation will be well above 2 percent this year but will begin to move lower as supply constraints and pent-up demand ease. It will take some time for price pressures to abate, and inflation is likely to remain somewhat above 2 percent over the next couple of years.\n\nBecause both demand factors and supply factors are affecting inflation readings, the uncertainty attached to my inflation outlook is particularly high. On the downside, the factors that have held back inflation for much of the last expansion, such as technological change, digitalization, globalization, and a relatively weak relationship between economic activity and inflation, are all still present. The lower level of equilibrium interest rates in the U.S. and other advanced economies also results in a downward bias to inflation. Indeed, offsetting this bias was one reason the Federal Reserve changed its monetary policy strategy to focus on keeping longer-run inflation expectations anchored at levels consistent with our 2 percent goal and aiming for inflation to average 2 percent over time.\n\nBut there are also upside risks to inflation, and I see them as outweighing the downside risks at this time, even though I have revised my inflation forecast up since the start of the year. Many businesses report that cost pressures are intensifying and consumers seem to be willing to pay higher prices. The combination of strong demand and supply-chain challenges could last longer than I anticipate and could lead people and businesses to raise their expectations for future inflation more than we have seen so far. Although this is not my base case, if elevated inflation readings were to persist longer than anticipated and inflation expectations were on a trajectory to move higher than levels consistent with our 2 percent goal, monetary policy would need to be adjusted in order to bring inflation and inflation expectations back to our 2 percent goal on a sustained basis.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nBoth the federal government and the Federal Reserve took swift and significant actions in response to the pandemic. These actions helped to make last year's recession the shortest on record and to avoid long-term economic scarring. The Fed took actions to restore the smooth functioning of the financial markets, to ensure credit could flow to households and businesses, and to increase monetary accommodation in support of the recovery.\n\nAt our meeting earlier this week, the FOMC maintained the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and made no change to the pace of our asset purchases. We are currently purchasing $80 billion per month of Treasury securities and $40 billion per month of agency mortgage-backed securities. We indicated that if progress continues broadly as expected, a moderation in the pace of asset purchases may soon be warranted.\n\nThe Fed's asset purchases were an important policy response to address the severe strains in financial markets early in the pandemic and to support the economy in the midst of this unprecedented shock. Now, market functioning is restored and a solid recovery is underway. Last December, the FOMC issued forward guidance that we would not begin tapering our purchases until substantial further progress had been made toward our goals of maximum employment and price stability. In my view, the economy has met those conditions, and I support starting to dial back our purchases in November and concluding them over the first half of next year.\n\nThe start of asset-purchase tapering should not be taken as a signal that the FOMC plans to raise the fed funds rate any time soon. Even after tapering starts, our balance sheet will be growing and monetary policy will remain very accommodative. As the FOMC said, we expect to keep the funds rate at its current target range of 0 to 1/4 percent until we have reached maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. Inflation developments suggest that the second condition has largely been met. Inflation is running well above 2 percent and is forecasted to be 2 percent or more over the next couple of years; average inflation over the past 5 years is 2 percent, and measures of inflation expectations have moved up after running low over the last expansion. But in my view, the first condition has not been met: the economy is still some distance from maximum employment. The number of payroll jobs and the labor force participation rate are still well below where they were prior to the pandemic, and unemployment rates are still well above their pre-pandemic levels. But as the recovery continues, labor markets will continue to improve, and I expect that the conditions for liftoff of the fed funds rate will be met by the end of next year. Even after liftoff, to ensure that our goals of maximum employment and price stability are sustainably achieved and maintained, I believe it will be appropriate to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy for some time.\n\nEconomists often say that the only thing certain about an economic forecast is that it will certainly be wrong. If we have learned anything over the past 18 months, it is that things can evolve very differently than anticipated. In these unprecedented times, the uncertainty around any economic forecast – including my own – is particularly high. Uncertainty will remain very high until the path of the economy can be decoupled from the virus. I know that I don't need to tell bankers that in such an environment, it is crucial to monitor risks – and stay humble. I plan to do both. I will reassess my outlook against the incoming data and the economic reconnaissance we gather from businesses, bankers, and community contacts. My policy views will depend on how economic conditions, the outlook, and the risks around the outlook actually evolve. I am prepared to change my views on the economy and appropriate monetary policy as conditions warrant.\n\nComing back to your theme of bouncing back, I will close by noting that the economy and the people, businesses, banks, and communities that make it work have shown remarkable adaptability and resiliency in unprecedented times. I'm sure that at some point over the past 18 months, we have all felt as if we were bouncing off the walls. But the good news is that over those months, the U.S. economy has bounced back a considerable way and it is poised to make even more progress over the coming year."

            "content": "I thank the program committee for inviting me to participate in the conference on \"New Avenues for Monetary Policy\" organized by the Bank of Finland and CEPR. I have felt a strong attachment to the Bank of Finland ever since I was invited to participate in an external review of the bank's research activities in 2004. At the time, the bank was interested in building a strong research function so that it could be an active member of the European System of Central Banks. It is easy to see by looking at the strength of today's program, the bank's research output, and its engagement in the profession that the Bank of Finland is achieving this goal.\n\nThe conference's theme of new avenues for monetary policy is particularly relevant given the economic challenges presented by the global pandemic. But even before the pandemic hit, structural changes to the economy, in particular, lower estimates of the neutral real interest rate, presented challenges for monetary policymakers and suggested that new thinking was needed to ensure achievement of our monetary policy goals. Recently, both the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank (ECB) have undertaken reviews of their monetary policy frameworks to determine whether changes were needed to increase the effectiveness of their policy strategies. The ECB released the outcome of its review in July. The Fed's revised strategy is now about a year old. Today, I will discuss the Fed's revised strategy, how the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has put the strategy into practice, and based on that experience, what I believe are areas that would benefit from further clarification. As always, the views I will present are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nReasons for the Monetary Policy Framework Review\n\n[FIGURE 1] In August 2020, the FOMC adopted a revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which was reaffirmed in January of this year.1 The revised statement summarized the outcome of a review of our framework for setting monetary policy. The review began in early 2019 and covered the strategy, tools, and communications we use in setting policy in pursuit of the monetary policy goals given to us by the U.S. Congress. These goals are maximum employment, price stability, and moderate long-term interest rates.2 When prices are stable and the economy is at maximum employment, long-term interest rates are typically at moderate levels. So it is often said that the Fed has a dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment.\n\nThe framework review was informed by our experience during and after the Great Recession, by economic theory and empirical analysis, by consultations with academic researchers and practitioners at research conferences, and by conversations with the public at large through a series of Fed Listens events held across the country.3\n\nThe review was undertaken in light of changes in the economic environment that have emerged since the FOMC's first strategy statement was published in 2012. The 2012 statement was significant because it stated for the first time an explicit numerical definition of price stability, namely, 2 percent inflation, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE inflation.4 The establishment of an explicit inflation target took many years of FOMC discussion: the FOMC was not an early adopter. But the experience of the financial crisis and deep recession of 2007-2009, the sluggish ensuing recovery in the labor market, and the rounds of unconventional monetary policies used to provide accommodation after the federal funds rate was constrained by the zero lower bound all contributed to the FOMC's decision in 2012 to adopt a form of flexible inflation targeting, with an explicit numerical inflation goal.5 The 2012 strategy recognized that, over the longer run, monetary policy can influence only inflation and not the underlying real structural aspects of the economy such as the natural rate of unemployment or maximum employment, but that monetary policy can be used to help offset shorter-run fluctuations in employment around maximum employment.\n\nThis flexible inflation-targeting strategy served the FOMC well. The ensuing economic expansion turned out to be the longest expansion on record in the U.S., with the unemployment rate falling to its lowest level in several decades – until it was cut short by the pandemic. But the experience during this long expansion and structural changes to the economic environment led the FOMC to review our monetary policy strategy to ensure it maintained its effectiveness now and in the future.\n\n[FIGURE 2] One economic development with important implications for monetary policy is the decline in the U.S. and other advanced economies in the general level of real interest rates consistent with sustainable growth and price stability, that is, r-star. This decline reflects several factors, including the aging of the population, changes in risk preferences, and slower productivity growth, which weigh on long-run economic growth and lower the natural rate of unemployment.6 It means that the level of the federal funds rate, the policy rate in the U.S., consistent with maximum employment and price stability is now lower than it has been in the past.\n\n[FIGURE 3] And this means that during economic downturns, it is now more likely that the fed funds rate will be constrained by its effective lower bound. The FOMC will have less policy space to support the economy using the funds rate, its traditional policy tool, and other tools, including asset purchases and forward guidance, will need to be used more often. In past recessions, the FOMC has typically reduced the federal funds rate target by 5 to 6 percentage points. With lower equilibrium interest rates, this policy space will not be available; for example, in last year's recession, the FOMC was able to reduce the funds rate by only 1-1/2 percentage points. Assuming that households, businesses, and financial markets understand that it will be more difficult for monetary policymakers to reach their inflation goal, this constraint imparts a downward bias to inflation and inflation expectations, which reinforces the downside risks to achieving our policy goals.\n\n[FIGURE 4] Another change in the economic environment with implications for monetary policy pertains to inflation dynamics. Until late in the prior economic expansion, inflation readings in the U.S. ran below the 2 percent objective, and this was true in other advanced economies as well. Resource utilization in the labor market and in product markets has become less correlated with actual inflation than in the past – the Phillips curve has become flatter – and inflation expectations now play a larger role in determining inflation outcomes. This makes it even more important that inflation expectations remain well anchored at levels consistent with our longer-run inflation goal. If expectations move persistently below these levels, it is more likely that inflation will run persistently below our goal, which results in even less policy space. Expectations that run persistently above our goal would also be a problem, but could be addressed by raising the policy rate.\n\nThese structural changes in the economic environment are expected to persist and the FOMC undertook the framework review with them in mind, with the aim of enhancing the effectiveness of our monetary policy strategy in promoting our policy goals in the new environment.\n\nWhat Did Not Change in the Revised Strategy\n\n[FIGURE 5] Before discussing the changes in our strategy, it is important to know that several things have not changed.\n\nFirst, the longer-run inflation goal has not changed; it remains at 2 percent as measured by the annual change in the PCE price index.\n\nSecond, the FOMC continues to believe it is not appropriate to set a fixed numerical goal for employment because monetary policy cannot influence nonmonetary structural aspects of the economy, including maximum employment and the natural rate of unemployment, which change over time.\n\nThird, the FOMC continues to be forward looking in setting monetary policy because policy affects the economy with a lag. This means that policy will depend on the economic outlook and the assessment of risks to the outlook.\n\nFourth, the FOMC continues to acknowledge that risks to the financial system could impede the attainment of our monetary policy goals of maximum employment and price stability.\n\nWhat Did Change in the Revised Strategy\n\nWhile the elements I just mentioned were unchanged, several other elements did change.\n\n[FIGURE 6] Regarding our approach to inflation, while the goal hasn't changed, the strategy for achieving the goal now takes into account the downward bias that the lower r-star and zero lower bound on interest rates impart to inflation and inflation expectations. In particular, after periods in which inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, we will likely aim to have inflation run moderately above 2 percent for some time. Aiming for inflation to average 2 percent over time is expected to help anchor inflation expectations, a main determinant of actual inflation, at levels consistent with 2 percent inflation. This revised strategy can be viewed as a shift from flexible inflation targeting to flexible average inflation targeting, whereby policy actions are taken to make up for some past inflation misses in order to have inflation average 2 percent over time.\n\nThis revision is a stronger statement than ones we made in the past as we struggled to effectively convey that the longer-run goal of 2 percent should not be interpreted as a ceiling. In the past, I and many others on the FOMC indicated that we would be comfortable with inflation running above 2 percent for a time after it had run low for some time – a type of opportunistic re-inflation. But now we are being deliberate rather than opportunistic. After inflation has run persistently low, we won't just tolerate serendipitous shocks that move inflation above 2 percent for some time, but we will set policy with that intention. This means that monetary policy will be somewhat more accommodative than in the past, all else equal.\n\nRegarding our employment goal, I view the changes in strategy as a more explicit acknowledgment of the uncertainty around assessments of the level of maximum employment and a clarification of our approach to achieving the employment goal in light of our experience over the past expansion.7 During the pre-pandemic expansion, we learned that employment growth could be stronger and the unemployment rate could move lower without generating inflation than we thought possible based on decades of experience.\n\n[FIGURE 7] It took some time for the FOMC to learn about the structural changes in the economy and the difficulties in assessing maximum employment in real time using the Phillips curve model. As the FOMC was learning, its assessments of the longer-run unemployment rate came down significantly over time. And, as Cleveland Fed staff analysis indicates, in the last two years of the most recent economic expansion, FOMC participants put less weight on the unemployment rate in determining the appropriate monetary policy path than they had earlier in the expansion.8\n\n[FIGURE 8] Unfortunately, this time-to-learn, combined with the previous strategy statement's references to \"deviations\" of employment from maximum employment rather than \"shortfalls,\" gave the impression that the FOMC would at times take deliberate policy action to bring employment down independently of our inflation goal. But this was not the case. Now, the revised strategy statement makes it explicit that the FOMC views its maximum employment goal as a broad-based and inclusive goal and that in the absence of inflationary pressures or risks to financial stability, strong employment is not a concern and monetary policy will not react to it.\n\nExperience with the Revised Strategy over the First Year\n\nThe revised strategy has been in place for about a year and has been guiding our policy decision-making. For the strategy to live up to its promise of better anchoring longer-run inflation expectations at 2 percent and delivering on our goals of maximum employment and longer-run price stability in a low r-star environment, it is important that the public understand the strategy and that the FOMC is committed to it. In the remainder of my remarks, I will present my views on our experience thus far and some aspects of the strategy we should clarify for the public.\n\nPerhaps the new strategy's most obvious influence is on the FOMC's forward guidance on the expected future path of the fed funds rate and on the asset purchase program that has been included in our post-meeting policy statement since adoption of the strategy.\n\n[FIGURE 9] First, since September 2020, the FOMC has indicated that it expects it will be appropriate to maintain the target range of the fed funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with our assessments of maximum employment, and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. After liftoff, the FOMC expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until our goals are met and longer‑term inflation expectations are well anchored at 2 percent. This is outcome-based forward guidance, which the FOMC has used in the past, but it indicates a more accommodative path for the funds rate than likely would have been deemed appropriate under the former strategy in terms of both the employment and inflation conditions. This change acknowledges the need to ensure that policy is accommodative enough to prevent low levels of inflation and inflation expectations as seen in the last expansion from becoming entrenched.\n\nWith regard to the asset purchase program, since December of last year, the FOMC has been indicating that we expect to continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum employment and price stability goals.\n\nThe FOMC's forward guidance is in line with our new policy strategy and is an important part of policy communications. Communications play a critical role in effective monetary policymaking by aligning the public's policy expectations with those of policymakers, enhancing policymakers' credibility, and providing the public the information it needs to hold policymakers accountable. Good communication is particularly important in a low-interest-rate environment because at the zero lower bound, forward policy guidance is a tool that can be used to add monetary accommodation. Whether the revised strategy statement and our policy forward guidance provide enough clarity to achieve our communication goals remains an open question.\n\nFed watchers and others have asked for more context about several aspects of the new strategy and our forward guidance. They are interested in knowing how the FOMC will measure average inflation, how far above 2 percent the FOMC considers \"moderately\" above, and what time period constitutes \"for some time\" when assessing inflation above 2 percent. They are interested in what indicators the FOMC will be using to assess whether labor market conditions are consistent with maximum employment and what constitutes \"substantial further progress\" toward our goals when determining whether it is time to begin tapering our asset purchases. These questions have become particularly relevant as the economy has continued to surprise over the course of the pandemic. Instead of inflation being mired below target, it has surprised on the high side. Similarly, the recovery in the labor market since the nadir in April 2020 has been remarkable.\n\n[FIGURE 10] When the FOMC established the revised strategy, we did not specify a mathematical formula to determine whether average 2 percent inflation had been met, choosing to maintain some flexibility as we had done under our prior flexible inflation targeting strategy. In part, the flexibility recognizes that the Fed has a dual mandate rather than a single inflation mandate. But some clarity on how the FOMC will assess average inflation will help ensure that the new strategy lives up to its promise of anchoring inflation expectations at levels consistent with our longer-run 2 percent goal.\n\n[FIGURE 11] For example, as of the second quarter of this year, PCE inflation has averaged 2 percent over the past 5 years.9 According to many forecasts, even with inflation expected to move down from its elevated levels of the past year, 5-year average inflation is forecasted to move above 2 percent over the next year as earlier low levels of inflation drop out of the calculation. So a reasonable assessment is that we are at or close to meeting the average inflation goal. But this is based on a 5-year window for averaging. Others may prefer a different time horizon. For example, PCE inflation has averaged 1.8 percent over the past 6 years and 1.6 percent over the past 7 years. Or they may prefer a fixed starting point rather than a moving average in order to assess progress on the inflation goal. Depending on your benchmark, you would have different views on how much progress has been made toward the goal, and in order to promote achievement of the average inflation goal, the moderate overshoot you might be willing to tolerate could be different depending on the shortfall you perceive.\n\n[FIGURE 12] A similar issue arises with the employment goal. To interpret \"substantial further progress\" one needs to know how much further there is to go, and this assessment depends on whether it is reasonable to expect labor market conditions to return to their strong pre-pandemic levels of February 2020. That is probably not a bad benchmark to use to assess progress for many indicators, but it is not necessarily the right one for other indicators.\n\n[FIGURE 13] For example, about 3 to 3-1/2 million people in the U.S. have retired since the onset of the pandemic. This is about twice as many as would have been expected based on population aging. Retirees typically don't return to the labor market. This time could be different since the pandemic shock is something new, but we probably shouldn't expect the overall labor force participation rate to approach its pre-pandemic level. It is likely better to assess conditions using the prime-age participation rate to abstract from retirements.\n\nWhile it is important for the FOMC to look at a variety of indicators to assess progress on our employment goal, it is also important that we do so systematically. As a committee, we should examine the same relevant set of indicators over time and communicate our assessment of progress based on that set of indicators. This would be a way to align the public's assessment with the FOMC's so the public will understand when \"substantial further progress\" has been made.\n\n[FIGURE 14] Indeed, the promise of the new strategy is that it will keep the public's inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent even in a low-interest-rate environment. To achieve this, it is important that we give the public a good sense of our policy reaction function under the new strategy and to demonstrate our commitment to it. One helpful step would be if our post-meeting policy statement provided more of a narrative of our assessment of how changes in a consistent set of economic and financial data have or have not changed the medium-run outlook, the risks around that outlook, the appropriate policy path based on that outlook and risk assessment, and the considerations the FOMC will take into account when determining future changes in policy. Changing the policy statement like this would make it longer, but also more informative.\n\n[FIGURE 15] Our experience this year with communications about inflation shows some of the challenges of not including enough narrative in our statement. The sources of this year's inflation increases have complicated communications and have made forecasting inflation considerably more difficult. Supply chain disruptions driven by the pandemic, coupled with pent-up demand let loose by the reopening of the economy, have led to a surge in measured inflation. In July, year-over year PCE inflation was 4.2 percent and core PCE inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, was 3.6 percent. A considerable portion of the rise in inflation this year has been concentrated in a small number of goods and services. Inflation measures that exclude items with the most extreme movements in the price distribution, such as those calculated by the Cleveland Fed, have increased by much less, and the prices of some of these components have begun to fall as supplies have realigned and demand has adjusted.10 Other prices are expected to stabilize and then move back down next year as some of the supply constraints abate. The FOMC first pointed to the rise in inflation in its post-meeting statement in April, and said it was largely due to transitory factors. The statement did not elaborate further.\n\nOne could view the language as a terse way to distinguish supply-side factors that would lead to relative price changes from demand-side pressures that could cause the underlying trend inflation rate to rise. But another way to interpret \"transitory\" is in terms of time. This is perfectly reasonable since Merriam Webster's first definition of the word is \"of brief duration.\"\n\nBut many businesses now tell us that the supply disruptions are lasting longer than they originally thought and many do not expect them to resolve until the middle of next year or later. Many firms have been able to pass on the increased cost of inputs to their customers in the form of higher prices. At the same time, labor shortages have led firms to raise wages. These developments, along with continued elevated inflation readings, mean that the \"transitory\" language has become a less useful description of the inflation situation.\n\nMy own modal forecast is for inflation to remain high this year and then to begin to move back down next year; however, I see upside risks to this forecast. It is possible that the higher prices could cause longer-run inflation expectations to rise above the levels consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal, thereby putting upward pressure on inflation. These levels could only be sustained if monetary policy was too accommodative, and the Fed would need to respond to bring inflation and inflation expectations in line with the 2 percent goal. These dynamics are difficult to communicate in a word or two, especially in an environment where both strong demand and supply factors are in play. But a statement that offered more of an explanation of the FOMC's views on the factors affecting current inflation readings, the outlook for inflation, and the risks around that outlook would give the public a better sense of the FOMC's assessment than merely saying that elevated readings largely reflect transitory factors.\n\nGiven that we have a new strategy and that we continue to live with the uncertainties of the pandemic, giving the public the information it needs to better understand how policymakers are likely to react not only to anticipated economic and financial developments but also to unanticipated developments seems like a very worthwhile endeavor. My expectation is that, over time, as we gain more experience under our new strategy, we will be able to hone our communications in a way that supports the promise offered by the new strategy of better achieving our monetary policy goals."

            "content": "I thank Kasper Roszbach and the Norges Bank for inviting me to present at this workshop on low-interest-rate and unconventional monetary policy. I applaud the Norges Bank for spurring research on this topic. In a period of less than two decades, the world has experienced two historically deep negative shocks to the global economy and financial system. While their causes were different, the global financial crisis of 2008 and the COVID-19 pandemic crisis each necessitated the intervention of central banks in ways not contemplated in earlier decades. Lessons from the actions taken during the 2008 crisis and recovery and from the large body of research that was generated thereafter helped to inform economic policy during the pandemic. I anticipate that our experience over the past year and a half, as well as research driven by that experience, will help guide policymakers now and in the future. Today, I will share my thoughts on the relationship between monetary policy and financial stability in a low-interest-rate environment. These thoughts are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nFinancial Stability and Monetary Policy\n\nLet me start with a working definition of financial stability. When I refer to financial stability, I mean a financial system that is resilient to shocks. That is, one in which banks and nonbank financial institutions not only remain solvent but also continue to lend to creditworthy businesses and households during a significant economic downturn, and one in which financial markets continue to intermediate in an orderly fashion during periods of stress.\n\nWith this definition, it is clear that monetary policy and financial stability are linked in several ways. First, monetary policy affects the real economy by affecting financial conditions. When financial markets are disrupted, as they were during the global financial crisis and at the onset of the pandemic, the transmission of monetary policy to the economy is disrupted.\n\nSecond, the goals of monetary policy and financial stability are interconnected, usually in a complementary way. A stable financial system plays a key role in supporting the achievement of monetary policy goals. In the U.S. these goals are price stability and maximum employment.\n\nIndeed, the FOMC's statement on its monetary policy strategy says that \"sustainably achieving maximum employment and price stability depends on a stable financial system\" and that the FOMC's monetary policy decisions \"reflect its longer-run goals, its medium-term outlook, and its assessments of the balance of risks, including risks to the financial system that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals.\"1\n\nVolatility or minor disruptions in financial markets that represent the ebb and flow of a dynamic economy are not a concern, but disruptions to the financial system that interfere with its ability to provide valuable credit, risk-management, payment, and liquidity services to businesses and households can interfere with the economy's ability to achieve and maintain stable prices and maximum employment. An unstable financial system can propagate adverse macroeconomic shocks over broad economic sectors and over time to the detriment of macroeconomic stability. In the other direction, well-formulated and well-communicated monetary policy supports financial stability by allowing households, firms, and financial institutions to make better investment, saving, borrowing, and lending decisions, and price stability eliminates a source of asset-price volatility.\n\nThe linkages between monetary policy and financial stability are usually complementary, but at times policymakers will be faced with intertemporal tradeoffs and these tradeoffs will vary over the business and credit cycles. For example, if the economy is already near its monetary policy goals of maximum employment and price stability, then continuing to keep policy rates very low to move even closer to these goals could contribute to a buildup of financial vulnerabilities. This creates the potential for a future period of financial instability that could jeopardize the achievement of monetary policy goals over time.\n\nChanges to the Economic Environment\n\nCentral banks have recognized these linkages between financial stability and monetary policy for a long time. What is different now is that the economic environment has changed in ways that affect both monetary policy and financial system stability. These changes in the economic environment were a catalyst for the FOMC's monetary policy framework review, whose conclusions were summarized in a revised monetary policy strategy statement announced in August 2020 and reaffirmed in January 2021.2\n\nOver the past couple of decades, the U.S. and other advanced economies have seen a decline in the general level of interest rates consistent with sustainable growth and price stability. This decline in the equilibrium interest rate, so-called r-star, reflects several structural factors, including the aging of the population; changes in risk preferences, which affect savings and investment decisions; and a slowdown in productivity growth. Lower r-star means that the FOMC will have less policy space to support the economy during economic downturns; that its traditional policy tool, the fed funds rate, will spend more time at its effective lower bound; and that nonconventional policy tools will more often need to be used to add monetary accommodation.\n\nAnother change in the economic environment over the past two decades pertains to inflation dynamics. Resource slack in the labor market and in product markets has become less correlated with actual inflation than in past decades, and inflation expectations now play a larger role in determining inflation outcomes. This, coupled with the proximity of the policy rate to its effective lower bound, means there is a downward bias in inflation expectations and that bouts of low inflation may be more persistent than in the past.\n\nIn recognition of these changes in the economic environment, the FOMC revised its policy strategy by being explicit that in order to reach its 2 percent longer-run inflation goal and promote maximum employment, anchoring longer-term inflation expectations at levels consistent with 2 percent inflation is very important. And to do that, the FOMC would likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent.\n\nNonconventional Monetary Policy Tools and Financial Stability Risks\n\nIn the U.S., the nonconventional policy tools the FOMC has used include large-scale asset purchases, holding the policy rate at its effective lower bound for an extended period, and forward guidance that communicates an intention to maintain a very accommodative stance of monetary policy until certain economic improvements have been realized. Because these nonconventional tools raise the potential for a buildup in financial vulnerabilities and imbalances, monetary policymakers need to expend extra effort in assessing financial stability risks. Since the global financial crisis, the FOMC has increased its monitoring of financial vulnerabilities using a framework that recognizes the complex nature of the financial system in the U.S., with its mix of bank-based and market-based finance and its multiplicity of regulatory and supervisory bodies.3\n\nThere are several avenues through which the use of nonconventional monetary policy might create or contribute to financial system vulnerabilities. A commitment to a protracted period of very low interest rates could encourage risk-taking as investors search for yield; it could lead to a build-up in leverage; and it could lead lenders to lower their credit standards and promote increased borrowing. While all of these are avenues through which monetary policy typically affects the economy, the concern is that these effects could be excessive and create or contribute to financial vulnerabilities.\n\nVery low interest rates can also compress the risk premia in asset prices, leading to excessive valuations. Indeed, some empirical studies indicate that monetary policy affects asset prices mainly through its effect on risk premia.4 Excessive valuations are a vulnerability because if risk appetites were to change suddenly, these valuations could fall suddenly, leading to margin calls and losses, especially if leverage is elevated, which is more likely in a low-interest-rate environment. Low interest rates could more directly impact the profitability of banks by lowering net interest margins and earnings, thereby limiting banks' capital levels and their ability to lend through a downturn and changing their appetite for risk. While the available empirical evidence suggests that the effects of changes in policy rates on asset prices and risk premia have been moderate relative to the typical fluctuations seen in these measures, the evidence is particularly limited since we have not had many extended periods with low interest rates.\n\nHigh debt levels, both private debt and government debt, have to be intermediated by the financial sector, creating another potential vulnerability: periods of dysfunction in financial markets when there is a large shift in demand for liquidity. We experienced this at the beginning of the pandemic when the dash for cash put pressure even on the U.S. Treasury market, one of the most liquid markets in the world.\n\nAlthough I've been speaking about long periods with low interest rates, sizable asset purchases by the central bank can have similar effects by creating imbalances. Depending on how large they are, a central bank's asset purchases could create vulnerabilities by encouraging investors to be less sensitive to risk or could impact market functioning and thereby the transmission mechanism of monetary policy.\n\nForward guidance can provide additional accommodation once the policy rate has been brought down to its effective lower bound by reducing uncertainty about the future path of the policy rate. In addition to the risks of holding interest rates lower for longer, by reducing uncertainty, forward guidance may mute financial market volatility and spur a buildup of leverage.\n\nAddressing Financial Stability Risks\n\nWhile it is clear that monetary policymakers need to be aware of financial stability risks, a less settled question is how monetary policymakers should best address emerging financial stability risks, especially when taking actions to promote monetary policy goals might be in conflict with containing financial stability risks. In the U.K., the Financial Services Act recognizes potential tradeoffs between monetary policy and financial stability policy and explicitly says that the Financial Policy Committee is not authorized to act in a way that it feels is \"likely to have a significant adverse effect on the capacity of the financial sector to contribute to the growth of the U.K. economy in the medium or long term.\"5\n\nArguably, a post-crisis consensus has emerged that it is better to use supervisory, regulatory, and macroprudential tools to address financial stability risks and monetary policy tools to address macroeconomic stability risks. Since this type of separation is optimal in many models, a natural question is: What can we do to maximize the chances that we will be able to maintain this separation between monetary policy and financial stability policy and minimize periods when our macroeconomic stability goals and financial stability goals are in conflict. I will offer three recommendations:\n\nLet me elaborate on each of these to conclude my remarks. Regarding the first recommendation, the benefits of a resilient banking system in supporting the attainment of macroeconomic goals became very clear during the pandemic. After the last financial crisis in which banks were front and center, steps were taken to shore up the resiliency of the commercial banking system through higher capital levels, liquidity requirements, and stress testing. These steps paid off. Banks were in a strong enough position going into the pandemic that, with support from their regulators, they played an important role in ensuring that credit kept flowing to households and small businesses. This helped to mitigate some of the economic effects of the pandemic. The strength of the banking system also allowed monetary policymakers to use their tools fully to support the economy.\n\nIn the U.S., maintaining the structural resiliency of the banking system throughout the cycle is made even more important by the limits on the macroprudential tools available to address vulnerabilities that vary over the business and credit cycles. There is a complex constellation of regulators and a variety of financial institutions in the U.S. The use of macroprudential tools has to be coordinated across multiple regulators and, in some cases, follow legally required administrative procedures like public comment periods, which delay application of the tools. The U.S. does not have some of the tools that Norway and some other countries have, including limits on loan-to-value ratios and debt-to-income ratios that vary over the cycle and are targeted to particular sectors like housing or household credit to control leverage regardless of lender. Instead, the main cyclical macroprudential tools available in the U.S. are the stress tests and countercyclical capital buffer.6\n\nStress tests (the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review) that apply to the largest banks in the U.S. might be adapted to serve as a macroprudential tool to the extent that the systemic vulnerabilities of concern can be built into the stress scenarios. But, typically, these scenarios are set well in advance and are not aimed at macroprudential goals, but rather at microprudential risks. Nonetheless, last year, as the economy shut down because of the pandemic, the Board of Governors adapted stress testing techniques to conduct sensitivity tests of bank capital levels and solvency in several plausible downside scenarios amid great uncertainty about how the pandemic would affect the economy. This information was used to inform decisions about whether to halt dividend payments and stock buybacks.\n\nOur other tool, the countercyclical capital buffer, is designed to be increased so that banks raise capital in good economic times when vulnerabilities build and then lowered to support continued lending when economic conditions deteriorate. The social return to lending in this state of the world would be relatively high, so optimally we should be willing to trade off somewhat lower lending in a healthy economy in order to support lending in a weak economy. The Federal Reserve Board has indicated that it will use this tool only when systemic vulnerabilities are \"meaningfully above normal\" and that, when using the tool, it intends to increase the buffer gradually and give organizations substantial notice.7 This makes the tool less useful as a method for addressing vulnerabilities that arise quickly or may be detected only after they have had time to develop. In the U.S., the buffer has never been raised above zero. In contrast, Norway's countercyclical capital buffer is ordinarily set above zero and varies over the cycle.8 It is worth considering whether recalibrating this tool in the U.S. to be above zero in normal times would lead U.S. policymakers to be more willing to use it.\n\nIn my view, given the limits on cyclical macroprudential tools in the U.S., focus is better placed on improving the resiliency of the financial system's structure across the business and financial cycles. As I discussed, the potential for financial vulnerabilities to build up in a low-equilibrium-interest-rate (r-star) environment is elevated, all else equal. This means that the current minimum capital and liquidity requirements are likely not properly calibrated to deliver the same degree of resiliency as they did when these minimums were set under Basel and r-star was higher.9 As part of their work to ensure a resilient financial system, policymakers and the research staffs that support them should begin an assessment of the benefits and costs of recalibrating these minimums to the new low-interest-rate environment.\n\nMy second recommendation recognizes that much of our regulatory, supervisory, and macroprudential apparatus is focused on banks, yet financial activity is increasingly moving outside of the banking system. Nonbank financial intermediation, through investment funds, insurance companies, pension funds, and other financial entities, has risen over time. These entities now hold almost half of global financial assets, up from 42 percent in 2008.10 This means that credit risk is increasingly being intermediated and held outside the banking sector. Yet limited transparency around the risk exposures of hedge funds, family offices, and other leveraged financial entities makes monitoring emerging risks more difficult for both regulators and counterparties. The Financial Stability Board has recognized the need to better understand the interconnections between bank and nonbank intermediation, the amplification of shocks, and the overall resiliency of the nonbank financial sector.11\n\nSome of the nonbank intermediation is bank-like in that it involves short-run funding of longer-run assets and is subject to runs that can spill over to the broader financial system. During both the global financial crisis and the pandemic, prime (nongovernment) money market mutual funds, because of their structure, were subject to significant outflows in a very short period of time. In the U.S., $125 billion flowed out of prime money market funds in March 2020, which was 11 percent of their assets.12 Outflows forced the funds to redeem their commercial paper holdings, thereby creating more stress in short-term funding markets. These runs were severe enough to require the Fed to intervene with emergency facilities. Reforms to the structure of these funds to reduce the risk of runs are now being considered by U.S. regulators.13 These reforms include swing pricing, widely used in Europe, whereby investors redeeming shares receive a lower price when the fund's redemptions rise above a certain level.\n\nThe pandemic also revealed some structural issues in the U.S. Treasury market, one of the most important and most liquid markets in the global financial system. In March 2020, amid great uncertainty about the emerging global pandemic, many investors sought to move into cash and began liquidating their positions, even their positions in U.S. Treasuries, which are usually viewed as safe-haven assets. Pressure to sell was widespread and overwhelmed the dealers who play a central role in this market by intermediating between buyers and sellers. Stresses rose to a level that necessitated aggressive actions by the Fed, including purchasing large volumes of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities and conducting operations in the repo market. While these actions were able to re-establish smooth functioning in the Treasury market, they did not address the underlying structural issues that propagated the stresses. Several reforms have been suggested, including moving toward centralized clearing with less dependency on broker-dealers and better collection of data and increased transparency around the positions of participants in the market.14 The Treasury market is a crucial global financial market. Improving its structural resiliency needs to be a top priority, and all of the suggested reforms need to be carefully evaluated with some urgency.\n\nMy last recommendation recognizes that while the desire is to maintain separation with macroprudential tools focused on financial stability and monetary policy tools focused on fostering macroeconomic stability, in a low r-star environment and with limited macroprudential tools, it behooves monetary policymakers to consider the financial stability implications of its monetary policy settings. In January 2020, as part of its monetary policy framework review, the FOMC discussed how financial stability considerations should be incorporated into the conduct of monetary policy, with policymakers generally agreeing that supervisory, regulatory, and macroprudential tools should be the primary means to address financial stability risks.15 I do not disagree, but I would like to see financial stability considerations explicitly incorporated into the monetary policy framework, with an acknowledgment that nonconventional monetary policy has the potential to increase the risks to financial stability by spurring search-for-yield behavior, eroding lending standards, and increasing leverage. I do not see financial stability as a separate goal for monetary policy. But monetary policymakers need to be clear-eyed that the actions they take to achieve monetary policy goals, while most often complementary to fostering financial stability, can at times contribute to financial stability risks that could jeopardize the achievement of monetary policy goals over time. Macroprudential and microprudential tools should be the first line of defense against building financial stability risks. However, if these prove inadequate, monetary policymakers should follow a risk-management approach and be open to the possibility of adjusting their monetary policy settings in light of financial stability risk because this might be the best way to foster sustainable attainment of their monetary policy goals over time.\n\nPolicymakers need to consider the intertemporal tradeoffs. For example, in an economy near its monetary policy goals, should financial vulnerability be sufficiently high and not able to be addressed with macroprudential policy, policymakers may want to dial back monetary accommodation. This would likely mean it would take somewhat longer to fully achieve the monetary policy goals, but the benefit would be to lower the risks of a future period of financial instability that could harm macroeconomic stability in the future. In contrast, in an economy that is far from its monetary policy goals, policymakers should be more cautious in tightening monetary policy on financial stability grounds because the likelihood that financial imbalances would rise to problematic levels in such an environment is low and the current macroeconomic costs would likely outweigh the potential gains to future macroeconomic stability.\n\nFollowing this approach suggests that forward guidance on the future path of monetary policy, including the policy rate and asset-purchase programs, should explicitly include escape clauses for financial stability risks, similar to those that have been used by the Bank of England.16 The evolution of financial stability risks is uncertain, and these escape clauses allow policymakers to deviate from their forward guidance if financial vulnerability and risks become sufficiently elevated. Escape clauses have a cost: by increasing flexibility, they undermine the commitment value of the forward guidance and thus can lower its effectiveness. But escape clauses also have some benefits: they allow forward guidance to include longer-run commitments and they preserve the credibility of policymakers who may find themselves having to adjust policy before the conditions in the forward guidance are met. Maintaining the credibility of this policy tool will permit it to be effectively used in the future. In my view, the benefits of escape clauses for forward guidance outweigh the cost, and I would like to see them used routinely when monetary policymakers issue forward guidance.\n\nWhen to trigger the escape clause will depend on the conditions in the economy and financial system. It will involve some judgment, but a decision to trigger should be tied to policymakers' analysis of financial stability vulnerabilities and risks, which is communicated to the public on a regular basis. This regular communication should not be too difficult. In the U.S., this analysis already forms an important part of monetary policy discussions, as indicated in the minutes of FOMC meetings. In addition, the Board of Governors, which constitutes part of the FOMC, now releases a biannual financial stability report, which discusses the framework and their assessment.17 Because some of the tools used to build the resiliency of the financial system are beyond the purview of the FOMC, monetary policymakers will need to develop a good understanding of actions being considered by other financial regulators in evaluating financial vulnerabilities and make a decision on whether to trigger the escape clause. In the U.S. we are still a distance away from developing a clear strategy about the circumstances under which monetary policy would be used to combat financial vulnerabilities, but I believe developing a set of principles to guide these decisions would be a useful addition to our monetary policy deliberations in a low-interest-rate world.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo conclude, maintaining and enhancing the resiliency of the global financial system has clear benefits. It supports the attainment of our macroeconomic goals over time, and it allows monetary policymakers to fully use their policy tools. After the global financial crisis, steps were taken to shore up the resiliency of the commercial banking system. Today, systemically important banking institutions have higher capital and liquidity buffers and better risk-management systems, and the banking system was able to lend important support to households and businesses throughout the pandemic. However, we cannot take this resiliency for granted. The resiliency of the banking system needs to be reassessed in light of the low-interest-rate environment. In addition, the pandemic uncovered vulnerabilities in the nonbank financial sector, in short-term money markets, and in the U.S. Treasury market that need to be addressed. Changes in the economy will necessitate the use of nonconventional policy tools more often than in the past. So enhancing our ability to monitor risks to financial stability, including those that may be heightened by our monetary policy settings, will remain of key importance for monetary policymakers. I am hopeful that conferences like this one will encourage researchers to further develop models and perform empirical studies that enhance our knowledge of the interactions between monetary policy and financial instability. This work has taken on even more urgency in a time of very low equilibrium interest rates."

            "content": "I thank Juhi Dhawan for the invitation to speak with the Boston Economic Club today and to share my thoughts on the economy and monetary policy. Of course, those thoughts will be my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nWhat a difference a year makes! The pandemic has made the past year an incredibly challenging one for so many in the U.S. and across the world. In the U.S., the economic effects have fallen disproportionately on those segments of the population whose economic situations make them the most vulnerable: low-income workers, minority workers, and women and working mothers. Many households and businesses continue to struggle. But with the positive developments on the virus front, including widespread deployment of COVID vaccinations throughout the U.S., with continued support from fiscal and monetary policy, and with the remarkable adaptability and resiliency that households and businesses have shown throughout the pandemic, an economic recovery is now clearly underway. The tone of my talk today will be decidedly different from what you would have heard a year ago. While risks remain, the outlook is bright.\n\nBefore the pandemic hit early last year, the U.S. economy was on very solid footing. The unemployment rate was at a historically low level, employment growth was strong, participation in the labor force was solid, and inflation was near the FOMC's longer-run goal of 2 percent. But once the pandemic hit, all that changed very quickly. Much of the economy shut down swiftly for public health reasons. Economic activity and employment plummeted, the unemployment rate soared, and prices fell. Real growth fell at an annual rate of over 30 percent in the second quarter of last year. In just two months, March and April 2020, the economy lost over 22 million jobs, about the same number it had added over the previous 11-year expansion. The unemployment rate soared to nearly 15 percent in April of last year, and inflation fell to under 1/2 percent.\n\nWhile the shutdown was swift, a broad-based recovery is taking more time to achieve. As the public health statistics began to improve in early summer of last year, many parts of the country began to relax some of their stay-at-home restrictions, and the economy entered what I call a reopening phase. There were sharp rebounds in activity and hiring in those parts of the economy that did not involve close physical contact. Real output growth rebounded to over 30 percent in the third quarter of last year, and firms added over 7 million payroll jobs last May and June.\n\nAfter that initial rebound, the economy entered what I call a pre-vaccination recovery, in which the growth rate of the economy was slower than in the initial reopening phase and the level of activity varied with the course of the virus. Last fall and winter, as the number of virus cases rose, mandatory and voluntary restrictions were reinstated and weighed on economic activity. Businesses had to handle greater variation in their staffing levels. Increased exposure to the virus meant that more workers had to be quarantined or had to tend to children whose schools were closed due to the rise in cases. When the number of cases fell again, these restrictions were relaxed and activity picked back up.\n\nEconomic Growth\n\nSince the start of this year, the vaccination rate has increased, the number of new cases has fallen, and the pace of the recovery has accelerated. Over 100 million Americans are now fully vaccinated, which is over 40 percent of adults. The international virus situation makes it clear that the virus still poses a risk to the outlook and that widespread vaccinations are the key to returning to more normal economic and social activity. I am anticipating that efforts to increase the distribution of vaccinations will continue over the next several months and the U.S. economy will enter what I call the post-vaccination phase of the recovery in the third quarter of this year. In this phase, the recovery will broaden over time as those sectors that involve high physical contact see increases in activity.\n\nAt present, there is still considerable variation across sectors. Manufacturing activity is approaching its pre-pandemic level. Housing, supported by low mortgage rates and strong demand from households reassessing their living situations, has surpassed its pre-pandemic level of activity. On the other hand, the commercial real estate sector, in particular, the retail and office segments, continues to struggle given the uncertainties over the future of working arrangements and shopping preferences.\n\nConsumer spending has risen robustly this year, partly reflecting pent-up demand. Spending has been buoyed over the course of the recovery by significant federal fiscal support in the form of extended unemployment insurance benefits and economic impact payments. In real terms, the level of consumer spending on goods is about 16 percent higher than it was before the pandemic, while that on services is still about 5 percent below. This isn't surprising, since many things classified as services involve high physical contact. Hard-hit sectors in the economy like hospitality and leisure remain weak but they have recently shown improvement. Looking forward, surveys conducted by Cleveland Fed staff indicate that many higher-income consumers expect to increase their spending on high-contact services that they have avoided over the last year.1 In addition, many households have accumulated savings, which will support additional spending this year.\n\nStrong consumer and government spending contributed to real output growth of 6 percent at an annual pace in the first quarter of the year. The level of real GDP is nearly back to where it was at the end of 2019, prior to the pandemic. With many people in a position to fulfill their pent-up demand, I expect growth this year to be in the 6 to 7 percent range, the strongest pace since the early 1980s.\n\nThe Labor Market\n\nAlong with economic activity, labor market conditions have continued to improve and we will get another read on Friday when the employment report for April is released. The March employment report was very strong. Firms added over 900,000 jobs to their payrolls and the unemployment rate fell to 6 percent. In assessing the health of the overall labor market, it is important to look at levels, not just changes. Employment remains about 8-1/2 million jobs below its level last February and the unemployment rate is 2.5 percentage points above its pre-pandemic level. In addition, there is considerable unevenness across different groups. While employment of high-wage workers is basically back to its pre-pandemic level, employment of low-wage workers is still down almost 30 percent. And while employment in the professional and business services sector is about 5 percent lower than it was at the start of last year, employment in the high-contact leisure and hospitality sector is down by more than 30 percent. The labor force participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio have improved over the recovery, but they also remain considerably below their pre-pandemic levels. So further progress and broader progress need to be made before we are back to the generally strong labor market conditions we had before the pandemic hit.\n\nLabor supply is one of the confounding aspects of this recovery. As the employment data show, firms have been able to increase their hiring. But we are receiving widespread reports from business contacts across sectors that they are having a hard time finding the workers they need. The question is why, given that the unemployment rate is still so high and a number of indicators point to continued slack in the labor market. I believe the answer reflects the unusual nature of the pandemic shock that hit the economy. It is likely that some people with the financial means to do so have been cautious about returning to the workforce because of concerns for their health in the midst of the pandemic. Some others have had to withdraw from the workforce to take care of loved ones afflicted by the virus or to tend to children when childcare facilities closed and schools shifted to on-line teaching. Childcare responsibilities fall disproportionately on women and their labor force participation rates fell more sharply during the pandemic than those of men. The fiscal support likely meant that more people had the financial cushion to remain out of the workforce for these or other reasons. That support may also have shifted some bargaining power over wages to workers after decades of decline. Although the aggregate statistics do not show much acceleration in wages, our contacts say that they are beginning to respond to labor shortages by increasing their wage offers and by considering candidates they may have previously passed over because of minor criminal offenses or other reasons.\n\nAs the public health situation continues to improve over the course of the year, I expect that the factors weighing on labor supply will diminish and that there will be strong job gains, with the unemployment rate falling to 4.5 percent or less by the end of the year.\n\nInflation\n\nSupply constraints are affecting product markets, too. While demand can increase quickly, it takes longer to increase production to meet that demand, especially given the length of this pandemic. Manufacturers and builders report that supply-chain challenges have intensified and are proving to be more persistent than they originally anticipated. Builders face longer lead times to secure various materials, including lumber and steel, and more suppliers are rationing basic materials and parts to their customers. These supply-chain issues are a headwind to production and are leading to significant increases in the prices of many materials and components. Many of our contacts say that they have been able to pass on at least some of their cost increases to their customers in the form of higher prices – which brings me to inflation.\n\nIn March, the year-over-year measures of PCE inflation and core PCE inflation moved up to 2.3 percent and 1.8 percent, respectively. I expect that consumer price inflation readings will be significantly higher in the next couple of months. An important reason is simply that the very low readings from last year will fall out of the calculations. Higher energy prices and higher prices of some goods and commodities due to bottlenecks and supply-chain disruptions will also contribute to higher inflation readings, and I expect inflation for the year will be over 2 percent. After that, my baseline outlook is that inflation will move back down next year and then gradually rise above 2 percent the following year, as supply constraints ease, monetary policy remains accommodative, and the factors that have held back inflation for so long, including digitalization, globalization, and the relatively weak relationship between economic slack and inflation, reassert themselves.\n\nBecause both demand factors and supply factors are affecting inflation readings, there is added uncertainty to my outlook for inflation and there are some upside risks to my forecast, something that has not been true for some time. The anecdotal evidence suggesting that the supply-chain disruptions could last longer than expected, that firms may have some pricing power, and that workers may have some bargaining power over wages all point to upward pressures on prices. But these factors would not be expected to lead to sustained higher levels of inflation unless they changed the pricing process by increasing inflation expectations, which would affect the economic decisions of households and businesses and support higher actual inflation. Given that inflation has run low for so long, some increase in inflation expectations and actual inflation would be a welcome development.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nMy positive baseline outlook depends on appropriate monetary policy, which, in my view, will need to be very accommodative for some time to support the broadening of the recovery. The Federal Reserve responded swiftly when the severity of the pandemic became apparent. We took actions to restore the smooth functioning of the financial markets, to ensure credit could flow to households and businesses, and to increase monetary accommodation in support of the recovery and return to our monetary policy goals of maximum employment and price stability.\n\nAt our meeting last week, the FOMC maintained the target range of the fed funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent. We indicated that we expect it will be appropriate to maintain that range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with our assessments of maximum employment, and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. The FOMC also indicated that we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per month. And we expect to continue doing so until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum employment and price stability goals.\n\nThe forward guidance in our policy statement is entirely consistent with our revised monetary policy strategy, which was summarized in a statement we released last August and that we reaffirmed in January.2 The revised strategy has implications for how we will conduct monetary policy in pursuit of our goals. For inflation, we will aim for inflation to run moderately above 2 percent for some time after it has run persistently below 2 percent, so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and inflation expectations are anchored at levels consistent with 2 percent. For employment, in the absence of inflationary pressures or risks to financial stability, we will not react to strong labor market indicators. The revisions to our strategy mean that for a given set of economic conditions, the FOMC will likely set a more accommodative monetary policy than we would have in the past. This does not mean that our strategy will entail more risk than in the past. Pursuit of our goals will still drive our policy decisions, and the new strategy is designed to be more effective given changes to the underlying structure of the economy. In particular, the general level of interest rates is lower than in the past and inflation dynamics have changed so that economic slack plays less of a role and inflation expectations play more of a role in determining inflation outcomes.\n\nThe FOMC is committed to our new strategy and will be following through on the guidance communicated in our FOMC statement. While it may take some time for supply disruptions to abate, the forces that have weighed on inflation are still with us, we have undershot our inflation goal for a while, and we are aiming for inflation to move moderately above 2 percent for some time. I wouldn't consider the increase in inflation I expect this year to be the type of sustainable increase needed to meet the forward guidance on our policy rate. So I expect to be deliberately patient unless there is clear evidence that inflation pressures will push inflation to exceed our desired path.\n\nThe asset purchase forward guidance, which we added to the FOMC statement last December, indicates that we need to see substantial further progress toward our goals before we begin to taper the pace of purchases. In thinking about progress in the labor market, one approach is to look at indices of labor market conditions that summarize a large number of indicators, such as those published by the Kansas City Fed.3 Another approach is to use a technique similar to the spider chart published by the Atlanta Fed, gauging progress against appropriate benchmarks.4 Let's consider how far the labor market has traveled back from the dire conditions of April 2020 to the generally strong pre-pandemic conditions of February 2020. Many labor market conditions are useful for tracking the health of the labor market, but let's look at four: payroll employment, the unemployment rate, the employment-to-population ratio, and the labor force participation rate for people ages 25 to 54. (That latter indicator is often called the prime-age participation rate, but I'm not in that statistic and I consider myself still in my prime!)\n\nConsider employment. Between April and December of last year, when we issued our forward guidance, employment had traveled 55 percent of the way back to its pre-pandemic level. Since December, it has made a bit more progress and is now 62 percent of the way back. The unemployment rate peaked at 14.8 percent last April. By December, it had fallen to 6.7 percent and was 72 percent of the way back to its pre-pandemic level of 3.5 percent. As of now, it is 78 percent back. The employment-to-population ratio was 62 percent back as of December, and now it is 66 percent back. And prime-age labor force participation was 39 percent back in December and is now 48 percent back. These indicators clearly show that things are moving in the right direction and progress has been made since December. But I need to see more improvement before I would consider the conditions of our forward guidance on asset purchases as being met.\n\nOf course, there are several caveats to this type of analysis. First, the labor market conditions in February 2020 were strong along many dimensions, and it is not clear that we should expect every indicator to make it back to the levels we saw then. For example, the longer-run trend in the participation rate is drifting down, reflecting demographics. Moreover, retirement rates increased significantly during the pandemic, and in the past, people who left the workforce through retirement generally didn't return. That's one reason to look at the so-called prime-age participation rate rather than the participation rate of those age 16 and above. Second, while labor markets were generally strong last February, further progress would have been made in some dimensions had the pandemic not hit. For example, the difference in the unemployment rates of Blacks and Hispanics compared to that of whites continued to narrow as the previous expansion progressed; those gaps may have closed further had the expansion continued. Even if we use February 2020 as the benchmark, the unemployment rates for Blacks and Hispanics have made less progress than that of whites.5 Third, there is a large group of indicators, and the rates of progress will vary across them. So the judgment of the FOMC rather than a mathematical formula will be needed to assess the health of the labor market and its progress.\n\nI note that even after the FOMC decides that the conditions for tapering have been met, we will still be purchasing assets and monetary policy will remain highly accommodative. I expect it will appropriate to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy for some time as we make our way back to maximum employment and price stability. Since highly accommodative monetary policy can engender a search for yield and other investment behaviors that can exacerbate financial stability risks, and since a stable financial system plays a key role in supporting the achievement of our monetary policy goals, I am attuned to risks and vulnerabilities in the financial system. Currently, valuations in equity and residential real estate markets are elevated, reflecting investors' high appetite for risk, low interest rates, and positive prospects for the economy. Changes in risk appetite could bring volatility. Volatility isn't concerning in and of itself, but if accompanied by high levels of leverage, it can elevate financial stability risks. For now, I see financial stability risks and vulnerabilities as moderate. They are less concerning to the extent that we have a resilient financial system.\n\nAfter the last financial crisis in which banks were front and center, steps were taken to shore up the resiliency of the commercial banking system through higher capital levels, liquidity requirements, and stress testing. These steps paid off because banks were in a strong enough position going into the pandemic to play an important role, with support from their regulators, in ensuring that credit flowed to households and small businesses. The pandemic revealed some structural issues in the Treasury market and in money market mutual funds, and the Fed needed to take actions to reestablish smooth functioning. More recent developments suggest that limited transparency around the risk exposures of hedge funds, family offices, and other leveraged financial entities could pose risks to financial stability. Just as was done with the banking system after the global financial crisis, addressing fragilities in the Treasury market and the nonbank financial sector should be a top priority in raising the resiliency of the overall financial system. If we've learned one thing during the pandemic, it is that things can evolve in a materially different way than expected and it is better to be prepared for whatever comes our way."

            "content": "I thank Professor Marc Remer for inviting me to speak today as part of Swarthmore College’s lecture series. I had the pleasure of serving as an outside honors examiner in economics at Swarthmore about 20 years ago. I was really impressed with the rigor of the program and the knowledge and engagement of the students I met. So in thinking about a topic for today’s talk, I have chosen to discuss a challenge that will require multi-faceted solutions from the great minds of those being trained at Swarthmore, as well as other individuals, communities, governments, businesses, and institutions. That challenge is the cycle of disparities in economic opportunities that afflict our economy and limit economic inclusion.\n\nThe pandemic has shined a bright light on differences in economic outcomes, but these differences existed long before we had heard of COVID-19. Many stem from the fact that the U.S. economy does not offer the same economic opportunities to all. There are racial disparities in educational attainment, labor market outcomes, and access to credit. People born into areas of concentrated poverty or predominantly minority areas are disadvantaged over their entire lifetimes, and so are their children. These disparities are interrelated, reinforce one another, and have been propagated across generations. In today’s lecture, I will begin by explaining why I think it is important for Fed policymakers to understand the disparities in our economy and then I will walk through a set of figures that clearly illustrate these disparities to give you a sense of the magnitudes. Before continuing, let me mention that, as always, the views I will present are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nUnderstanding Economic Disparities Is Important for Assessing the Health of the Economy\n\nI believe that economic opportunity and inclusion are important to the Federal Reserve System’s mission of promoting a healthy economy and a stable financial system in the United States on behalf of the public. Congress has given the Fed several responsibilities, including setting monetary policy to achieve maximum employment and price stability, fostering financial stability and a safe and efficient payments system, regulating and supervising parts of the financial system, and promoting consumer protection and community development. I believe that the Fed should focus on the responsibilities that Congress has given us. Staying within the boundaries of our assigned responsibilities respects the fact that Fed officials are not elected officials, unlike members of Congress or the executive branch. Staying focused on our responsibilities also helps to maintain the Fed’s independence to make monetary policy decisions in pursuit of our statutory goals, insulated from short-term political pressures. It is important to preserve this independence because a body of research has shown that when central banks formulate monetary policy free from political considerations and are held accountable for their decisions, better economic outcomes result. The Fed is held accountable when it regularly communicates the rationale for its decisions in testimony before Congress, and in policy statements, meeting minutes, reports, and speeches.\n\nTo be able to meet our responsibilities, it is important for the Fed to understand the economic environment in which we are setting our monetary, regulatory, and payments policy. Understanding differences across demographic groups, industries, and areas of the country helps us to assess the strength of the economy, determine what policy is appropriate, identify the consequences of our policy actions, and assess whether the policy actions are achieving their goals. In some cases, the connection between our analysis and our responsibilities is obvious. For example, the Fed is responsible for enforcing the Community Reinvestment Act, which requires banks to serve their entire community and ensure equitable access to credit, in particular for underserved low- and moderate-income areas and individuals. It would be impossible to assess whether a depository institution was complying with the Community Reinvestment Act without understanding the credit conditions that exist in the low- and moderate-income areas it serves. Similarly, the Fed’s broader role in identifying effective community development policies and access to credit depends on understanding the challenges faced by people in these neighborhoods.\n\nIn other cases, the connection between our analysis and our policy responsibilities can be more subtle. While monetary policy is too blunt a tool to be used to close existing gaps in economic outcomes and opportunities across different demographic groups, it does have a positive role to play. By promoting maximum employment and price stability, monetary policy encourages longer expansions, which makes the economy stronger for all, including those individuals and communities that are least able to withstand economic downturns. Even though the effects of monetary policy are indirect, analyzing the size and source of gaps gives us insight into the distributional effects of our policy actions. Understanding the gaps in labor market conditions is directly relevant to our assessment of labor market slack and how close we are to reaching maximum employment, one of our statutory goals, which we view in a broad and inclusive way. Assessing economic opportunity gaps also informs our outlook for the economy over the longer run. It helps us evaluate the overall strength of the aggregate economy and its ability to live up to its full potential. Persistent gaps in economic opportunity can lead to a lower longer-run growth rate for the economy by limiting labor force participation and educational attainment levels, which affect productivity growth. Longer-run economic growth is a determinant of the long-run equilibrium interest rate, an important factor to consider in setting monetary policy. So knowledge about the forces affecting people’s ability to fully participate in the labor market, to gain the skills necessary to create new ideas and technologies, and to use those technologies effectively gives Fed policymakers insights into structural aspects of the economy that are relevant to setting appropriate monetary policy, even though our policy actions cannot directly affect these structural factors.\n\nThe Cleveland Fed has established a Program on Economic Inclusion to conduct research and provide data on economic disparities, their causes, implications, and solutions.1 I invite you to explore this work on our website. Because understanding disparities in economic outcomes and opportunities is important for assessing the economy, I would like to spend the rest of my time today first focusing on some of the disparities that grew during the pandemic and then turning to long-standing disparities.\n\nDisparities in the Economic Effects of the Pandemic\n\nWhile the economy is still far from our policy goals of maximum employment and price stability, progress is being made and the economic outlook is brightening. Sizable support from fiscal and monetary policy, vaccination deployment, and the resiliency shown by households and businesses, all point to a pickup in activity in the second half of this year and for continued progress, albeit uneven progress, as some sectors recover faster than others.\n\nIt probably is not surprising that the recovery has been uneven across business sectors, geographic areas of the country, and demographic groups, because the effects of the pandemic have not been evenly distributed either. Negative effects have been borne by many of the most vulnerable in our economy: lower-income and minority workers and communities; those who do not have the opportunity to work from home; those who don’t have access to reliable telecommunications and internet services or to adequate healthcare; and the smallest of small businesses. A Fed survey released last September showed that during the early stage of the pandemic, between March and July of last year, a larger percentage of low-income workers, less-educated workers, and Black and Hispanic workers were laid off compared to higher-income, more educated, and white workers.2,3 Other data show that from February to April of last year, the number of active small business owners dropped by 3.3 million, a record 22 percent decline.4 Compared to small firms overall, Black-owned businesses were twice as likely to close and Hispanic-owned businesses were one-and-a-half times as likely to close. These closures can have an outsized effect on low- and moderate-income communities, which were already disadvantaged before the pandemic.\n\n[FIGURE 1] As the economy has begun to recover, rehiring by employers has been considerably slower for low-wage workers than for high-wage workers. In these data, seen in the left panel of the figure, high-wage workers are those making above $29 per hour, which is the top quartile of the wage distribution, and low-wage workers are those making below $13 per hour, which is the bottom quartile of the wage distribution. Employment of high-wage workers is basically back to its pre-pandemic level, but employment of low-wage workers is still down almost 30 percent.\n\nAs seen in the right panel, among workers in the prime working ages of 25 to 54, the labor force participation rates of both men and women fell when the economy shut down last year, and the net decline for women has been larger than that for men throughout the pandemic. This partly reflects the larger share of women working in industries hit hardest by the pandemic and the fact that women bore more of the brunt of having to provide childcare for pre-school children or those being schooled remotely.\n\n[FIGURE 2] Disparities in the initial impact of the pandemic and in the recovery can also be seen in the unemployment rates of various demographic groups. All groups’ unemployment rates shot up last spring and have fallen since then, but, as of March of this year, there has been less progress for nonwhites and for those without a college education. Relative to their pre-pandemic levels, the unemployment rates of Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians remain higher than that of whites, and the unemployment rate of high school graduates without any college is higher than that of college graduates.5\n\n[FIGURE 3] Some of these differences in labor market outcomes reflect differences in the distribution of the types of jobs across demographic groups. The drop in employment in leisure and hospitality was severe and the recovery in that sector has been slow, with the number of jobs down more than 30 percent compared to before the pandemic. In contrast, education and health services; trade, transportation, and utilities; and professional and business services saw smaller declines and have made up more ground over the recovery.\n\nBut even before COVID-19, there were already long-standing economic disparities that need to be examined to better understand the overall health of the U.S. economy.\n\nUpward Mobility\n\n[FIGURE 4] All parents want to know that their children will be better off financially than they are. But upward mobility – the probability that a child will be better off economically than his or her parents – has fallen sharply in the U.S. since World War II. Research by Raj Chetty and his co-authors found that around 90 percent of children born in 1940 earned more at age 30 than their parents did. By the mid-1980s, only about 50 percent did.6,7 Although not shown in the figure, the largest declines have been in the middle class.\n\n[FIGURE 5] Rising income inequality has contributed to this decline. Since the 1960s, the median level of income, adjusted for inflation, has risen over time, from about $48,000 in 1967 to about $69,000 in 2019. But those in the top 10 percent of the income distribution have enjoyed sharper gains than those in the bottom 10 percent. The U.S. has one of the lowest rates of intergenerational mobility among advanced economies and more pronounced income inequality.8\n\n[FIGURE 6] Using disaggregated data, Chetty and his co-authors show that upward mobility depends not only on the family’s characteristics but also on neighborhood characteristics such as neighborhood income, racial integration, the quality of schools, and access to social services.9 On this map, areas of relatively high intergenerational mobility are shown in shades of blue-green.10 Children who grew up in these places earn higher average incomes in their mid-thirties than their parents did at the same age. Shades of red indicate areas of low intergenerational mobility: places where children have not progressed very far in terms of income relative to their parents. An important insight from the research is that even areas with fairly good economies in terms of stronger output growth and job growth, like some places in the South, have not necessarily produced high levels of upward mobility for the children growing up there. Strong economic factors certainly help, but they are not a panacea.\n\n[FIGURE 7] Here, I’m showing you the map for Philadelphia. (I have circled Swarthmore in pink.) If you were to drill down even further, you would see differences even within neighborhoods. In fact, research shows that moving a child from a low-mobility neighborhood to a high-mobility neighborhood can have profound effects on his or her future economic outcomes.11,12\n\nIn addition to place, race also matters. Even among those whose parents were at the same income level and who grew up in the same neighborhood, there is a gap in earnings between Black males and white males.13\n\n[FIGURE 8] And there are adverse dynamics as well. The research by Chetty and his co-authors shows that even controlling for where a child grows up, Blacks have a significantly lower chance of moving up in the income distribution than whites or Hispanics and a higher chance of moving down in the distribution. The left panel of bars in this chart shows the percentage of children born to low-income parents who become high income, by race – that is, what we have been calling upward mobility. The middle panel shows downward mobility – the percentage of children born to high-income parents who become low income. And the right panel shows the percentage of children born to high-income parents who remain high income. Strikingly, Blacks who have been born to high-income parents are almost as likely to move down to the lowest income quintile as to stay in the highest one.\n\nGaps in Income and Net Worth\n\n[FIGURE 9] According to the 2019 Federal Reserve Survey of Consumer Finances, median income for white households was about 1-3/4 times that of Black families and Hispanic families.14 These gaps are not a recent phenomenon: they have been around for decades. And because earnings gaps accumulate over time, they lead to much larger gaps in family net worth (financial and nonfinancial assets, like homes and autos, minus debt), often called the wealth gap. The median net worth of white families in 2019 was almost 8 times as high as that of Black families and about 5 times as high as that of Hispanic families.15\n\nResearch by Cleveland Fed economists Aliprantis, Carroll, and Young found that the current gap in net worth between Blacks and whites can be explained much more by differences in earnings than by differences in bequests or in the returns to savings a family has earned.16 Their modeling also shows that if the wealth gap were eliminated today, but without addressing the earnings gap, then in 50 years the wealth gap would be back to about where it is today. This suggests that closing the earnings gap is the key to closing the wealth gap and that increasing access to high-quality education, which will expand labor market opportunities, could be one of the key drivers of a more inclusive economy.\n\nGaps in Education\n\nMany factors play a role in these gaps in income and net worth. Black and white children tend to grow up in different neighborhoods, and this racial stratification leads to other risks, such as differences in access to healthcare and safe housing, which can affect access to quality education and longer-term economic outcomes.\n\n[FIGURE 10] One difference that was illuminated by the pandemic and that poses a risk to learning is lack of internet connectivity. Well before the coronavirus pandemic, access to the internet was an important avenue for education, as well as for healthcare and job access. Usage of broadband at home has been increasing over time for all groups, but it remains comparatively higher for whites, those with higher incomes, and those in urban and suburban areas.17 Data indicate that Blacks and Hispanics are less likely to have a computer or broadband at home than whites, and when they do have a computer, they are less likely to have broadband service at home.18 Lack of connectivity put Black, Hispanic, and lower-income families at a particular disadvantage over the last year when remote in-home learning became the norm.\n\n[FIGURE 11] In fact, as seen on the left-hand side of this figure, last spring, when schools were shut down because of the pandemic, students in low-income and middle-income areas completed significantly fewer math courses online than those in high-income areas.19 As seen on the right-hand side of this figure, this spring, students in middle-income areas have improved, but students in low-income areas are still struggling.20\n\n[FIGURE 12] These differences could have lasting negative effects. The accumulation of human capital via education is an important path to economic inclusion and opportunity, resulting in better economic outcomes not only for individuals and their families, but also for the country at large by raising productivity growth. The median income for families with a college degree is about twice as high as that of a family with only a high school diploma. Similarly, median net worth is considerably higher for those with a college degree.21\n\n[FIGURE 13] The U.S. labor force has become more educated over time, but educational attainment differs by race. In 2019, 41 percent of white families had a college degree compared to 26 percent of Black families and 16 percent of Hispanic families.22\n\nI probably don’t have to tell this audience that cost can be an important barrier to entering college, particularly for those coming from lower-income families. The average cost of tuition and fees at four-year institutions is now over $16,000 a year, and adjusted for inflation, it has more than doubled over the past three decades.23 According to the Fed’s survey on economic well-being, as of late 2019, over 40 percent of those who went to college had taken on debt for their education and about half of those people still owe money on this debt, making it harder to access credit for other purchases.24,25\n\n[FIGURE 14] For those students who do find the financial means to enter college, the likelihood of completing a degree differs by type of institution and by race. The completion rates have remained particularly low at for-profit institutions for all racial groups. At both public and nonprofit private institutions, the graduation rates for whites, Hispanics, and Asians have all risen over time, but those of Blacks remain well below those of these other groups and have shown only a little progress over time.26 The reasons for these differentials are complex. Among other reasons, they partly reflect differential access to high-quality education at the pre-college level that prepares the students for success in college, and they partly reflect the fact that students from lower-income families have more financial responsibilities while attending college that take time away from their studies.\n\nGaps in Labor Markets and Credit Markets\n\n[FIGURE 15] Whatever the cause, the differences in educational attainment follow people as they enter the workforce. Unemployment rates among Blacks and Hispanics have been chronically above those of whites and Asians, and Blacks and Hispanics are more likely to lose their jobs during recessions. Some progress was made in closing those gaps over the long previous expansion, which is good news and points to the value of fostering long-lived expansions. Nonetheless, disparities remain.<27\n\n[FIGURE 16] Worse and more volatile labor market outcomes make it harder for nonwhite households to build assets and achieve sound financial health, limiting their ability to fully participate in the economy. For those families that are able to get a mortgage, job insecurity makes the household less financially resilient and raises the risk that the household might fall behind on its mortgage or even default, putting the family’s longer-term financial health at risk. Housing continues to be an important way for families to build wealth. As shown by the dotted lines on the left-hand side of this figure, homeownership rates rose a lot last year, but part of those increases may reflect difficulties in collecting data remotely during the pandemic. As shown on the right-hand side of this figure, even with last year’s rise, the gap between the homeownership rate of whites and Blacks and between whites and Hispanics remain large. New York Fed analysis indicates that there are sizable racial gaps even after controlling for income and other factors related to creditworthiness.28 This indicates that systemic racial differences in access to credit have persisted well after enactment of fair housing and lending legislation in the 1970s meant to address the scourge of redlining and discrimination in credit markets.29\n\n[FIGURE 17] As seen on the left-hand side of this figure, in terms of access to financial services, Blacks and Hispanics are less likely to have a bank account and more likely to rely on alternative financial services such as money orders and check cashing services than whites. Being unbanked or underbanked makes it harder for these families to build a credit history.30\n\nThe use of bank financing by small businesses also varies significantly with the race of the owner, as seen on the right-hand side of this figure. According to the Fed’s Small Business Credit Survey, compared to small firms with white ownership, those with Black ownership were half as likely to have obtained financing from a bank in the five years before the pandemic, relying more on online lenders, which, according to survey respondents, provide less satisfactory service.31\n\nMoving Toward Economic Inclusion and a Stronger Economy\n\nAs I hope you find clear from this summary of some of the data, the disparities that exist in the economy are interrelated. Lower-income households have less access to high-quality education, which means less access to higher-paying jobs and job security, and less access to high-quality housing, which means less access to credit, which means less access to education, and around it goes. And for many people, being nonwhite puts them into this cycle of disparities with fewer opportunities to escape because of systemic racism.\n\nEliminating racial and economic disparities, which have lasted over generations, is no easy task. One place to start in breaking the cycle is for the country to take steps to increase access to high-quality education and to effective job-skills programs, especially for those who have not had these opportunities in the past. Access should also include the necessary support to help students successfully complete these programs. Workforce development is one of the key focus areas of the Federal Reserve’s community development function and is an important component of a healthy labor market.32\n\nEducation can be transformational, changing the paths of individuals, future generations, and communities. Improving education levels and ensuring that people are well prepared to enter and remain productive in the modern workforce would lead to higher levels of labor force participation and higher productivity growth, key factors driving higher long-run economic growth and higher standards of living. Investments to increase access to education present a good value proposition to the country – the promise of a stronger economy that works for us all."

But more broadly, I also thank the staffs in community development from across the System – at every Federal Reserve Bank and the Board of Governors – for the enormous body of analysis and outreach that you have produced in light of the pandemic. The community development function's efforts have contributed mightily to the Federal Reserve's understanding of the myriad effects the pandemic is having on our communities, households, and small businesses. Your work has informed Federal Reserve policy decisions and I expect that to continue as we work together to ensure a broad-based, sustainable economic recovery. You were able to bring these essential insights to the discussion because of the work you have done over many years to understand the issues affecting low- and moderate-income communities, work that will yield dividends well after the pandemic is behind us. Before I continue, let me remind you that, as always, the views I will present are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nIt is now clear that the adverse effects of the pandemic have not been evenly distributed and there are wide disparities in the recovery across business sectors, geographic areas of the country, and demographic groups. The burdens of the pandemic have been borne by many of the most vulnerable in our economy: lower-income and minority workers and communities; those who do not have the opportunity to work from home; those who don't have access to reliable telecommunications and internet services or to adequate healthcare; and the smallest of small businesses. Since last spring, Blacks and Hispanics have been faring less well in the job market than whites, and those without a bachelor's degree have made less progress than those with a bachelor's degree. Rehiring by employers has been considerably slower for low-wage workers than for high-wage workers, whose employment level has now returned to its pre-pandemic level. Among workers in the prime working ages of 25 to 54, the labor force participation rate of women has recovered less than that of men, because the need to provide childcare for pre-school children or those being schooled remotely is disproportionately affecting women's ability to remain in the workforce or work their usual number of hours.\n\nOne source of the disparities across groups stems the fact that the distribution of the types of jobs held by members of a particular group varies across groups and the pandemic has hit some industries much harder than others. Analysis by the Cleveland Fed indicates that one factor that has contributed to a rising earnings gap between whites and Blacks in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and, Dayton, Ohio, is that the distribution of workers across occupations differs by race.1\n\nIt is important to remember that differences in economic outcomes did not start with COVID-19. Many of the economic disparities in our economy are long-standing ones and stem from the fact that the U.S. economy does not offer the same opportunities to all. There are racial disparities in educational attainment, labor market outcomes, and access to credit. People born into areas of concentrated poverty or predominantly minority areas are disadvantaged over their entire lifetimes, and so are their children. These disparities have been propagated across generations. Things cannot be expected to improve on their own. Actions will need to be taken to promote an inclusive economy – one in which people have the chance to move themselves and their families out of poverty, one in which systemic racism does not limit opportunities, and one in which all people can fully participate and have access to economic opportunity.\n\nEconomic inclusion and opportunity intersect with the Federal Reserve System's mission to promote a healthy economy and stable financial system in the United States. Our monetary policy decisions, our actions as supervisors and regulators of banks, our role in the payments system, and our efforts to promote community development in low- and moderate-income areas all contribute to achieving a well-functioning economy and financial system in which everyone can participate. Opportunity and inclusion are important for achieving a strong economy, one that is able to live up to its full potential. The fact that a more inclusive economy will be a stronger economy is not difficult to see if we take a step back and look at what determines a country's standard of living. Increases in living standards, as measured by income per person, are inextricably tied to a country's long-run, potential growth rate, which is driven by growth in productivity. Important determinants of productivity are investment in human capital to increase the knowledge and skills needed to productively use capital, and investment in R&D and new technologies. If we want to have a strong economy, it is important that we ensure that everyone has the opportunity to fully participate in the labor force and that they have the skills to create new ideas and technology and to use that technology effectively.\n\nA top priority for increasing economic inclusion and opportunity must be increasing access to high-quality education at all levels from pre-school through college. Education can be transformational, changing the path of a person and that of future generations. The GI Bill allowed many soldiers returning from World War II to become the first college graduates in their families, raising their and their children's standard of living. Education is a path toward better economic outcomes not only for individuals and households but also for communities. Education levels tend to predict a state's per capita income growth and poverty rates. And cities with more highly educated populations experience lower unemployment rates, higher productivity growth, and higher growth in entrepreneurship than what would have been predicted by considering only the educational levels of individuals.2 So education provides a positive externality. Education can raise labor force participation rates, and the better educated tend to have higher wages and lower levels of unemployment. The median income for families whose head has a college degree is more than twice as high as that of a family whose head has only a high school diploma. The gap in wages between those with a college degree and those without, the so-called skill premium, has widened substantially over time, more than doubling since the 1970s. Similarly, median net worth is considerably higher for those with a college degree.3 Higher educational attainment gives people more labor market security. Over the last expansion, the unemployment rate for those with a bachelor's degree or higher averaged 3.2 percent compared to 6.6 percent for those with a high school diploma and no college. And while all groups' unemployment rates are higher than they were before the pandemic, the gap between the current unemployment rate (as of December 2020) and the pre-pandemic level (as of February 2020) is 1.9 percentage points for those with a college degree but 4.2 percentage points for those with a high school diploma but no college.\n\nBut not all groups have benefited from a college education. While our workforce as a whole has become more educated over time, educational attainment differs by race. According to the Fed's 2019 Survey of Consumer Finances, 41 percent of white heads of household held a college degree compared to 26 percent of Black heads of household and 16 percent of Hispanic heads of household. The likelihood of completing a degree also differs by race and by type of institution. The completion rates have remained particularly low at for-profit institutions for all races, with less than 20 percent of Black students who started at a for-profit institution in 2012 having earned a degree by 2018 and less than 40 percent of white students having done so. At both public and nonprofit private institutions, the graduation rates for whites, Hispanics, and Asians have all risen over time, but those of Blacks remain well below those of these other groups and have shown no progress over time.\n\nCost can be an important barrier to entering and staying in college, particularly for those coming from lower-income families. According to the Fed's survey of economic well-being, of those respondents who could not complete their associate or bachelor's degree, among other reasons, 56 percent said it was because it was too expensive.4 The average cost of tuition and fees at four-year institutions is now over $16,000 a year, and adjusted for inflation, it has more than doubled over the past three decades.5 According to the Fed's survey on economic well-being, as of late 2019, over 40 percent of those who went to college had taken on debt for their education and about half of those people still owe money on this debt.6 New York Fed analysis shows that compared to borrowers in majority white areas, those in majority Black areas have higher student loan balances and those in majority Black and majority Hispanic areas have higher rates of default on those loans.7 These defaults can follow a person over time, making it harder to access credit in the future. So while on average and for society as a whole, the return to investing in education is positive, for some individuals it is not, especially if they have to take on high levels of debt. Making college more affordable would help align private and social incentives in the choice of education.\n\nIn addition to cost, another barrier to entering and completing college is not being adequately prepared. According to the Fed survey, 22 percent of respondents not completing a college degree said that one of the reasons was low grades.8 This suggests that some people aren't prepared for college when they enter. Research is increasingly pointing to the fact that the foundation has to be laid very early in life – at the pre-school level. When children fall behind early on, it is often difficult to catch up.\n\nSo we need to increase investment in early childhood, elementary, and high school education so that students are better prepared for college. This investment includes financial support to the schools and to families, as well as tutoring and mentoring to support children as they learn. Even before the pandemic, a large part of formal and informal education was being delivered digitally. So one part of the investment has to be in closing the digital divide between low-income areas and higher-income areas. Usage of broadband at home is comparatively higher for whites, those with higher incomes, and those in urban and suburban areas.9 Blacks and Hispanics are less likely than whites to have a computer or broadband at home, and when they do have a computer, they are less likely to have broadband service at home. This puts Black and Hispanic families at a disadvantage, especially now, given the pandemic, when remote in-home learning is the norm rather than the exception. The situation in Cleveland is particularly bad. Among communities with a population of 100,000 or more, the city of Cleveland has among the lowest home broadband access in the nation. Business leaders through the Greater Cleveland Partnership are working with the city's governmental leaders and other organizations to ensure that all residents in the Greater Cleveland area have access to in-home high-quality broadband and the devices needed to access it.\n\nThe need to ensure that all families have access to high-quality education as a path toward economic opportunity and inclusion and a strong economy is becoming even more important over time. Technological change is transforming many aspects of the economy, including work – the topic of this session. For any given type of capital, a more knowledgeable worker is a more productive worker. But changes in technology demand even more highly skilled workers. Technology has changed how we do our jobs, how we recruit for workers, and how we search for new positions. The intersection of technology and work means that the type of skill sets in demand are going to be different than in the past, and include things like problem-solving and how to deal with ambiguity in the face of a rapidly changing environment. A worker's attachment to a particular employer or even a particular career path is likely to be different as well.\n\nEvidence suggests that technological change has led to an increase in demand for high-skill workers relative to low-skill workers. Even industries often viewed as less skill-intensive have increased their demand for skilled labor. The manufacturing plant of the 1970s looks little like the one of today. Middle-skill jobs are less in demand than they used to be because technology is able to do the routinized work of these jobs. Computers are less suited to replacing workers in occupations that require abstract thinking, high levels of cognition, and higher levels of education or workers in non-routine more manual types of work. This shift in the distribution of jobs helps to explain the wider gap in wages for highly skilled vs. low-skill workers, and the increasing return to gaining the education required to obtain those skills. Cleveland Fed economists investigated theoverall increase in U.S. wage inequality in the last 30 years and found not only that educational attainment is a key driver of wage inequality, but that education has become fundamental to boosting worker productivity.10\n\nThe positive externalities from education to the economic health of communities and the country as a whole mean we are likely under-investing in education from society's viewpoint. Indeed, the U.S. does seem to lag behind other advanced economies in terms of educational achievements and skill levels. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's (OECD) latest survey assessing adult skills indicates that the U.S. ranks 15th in terms of literacy and 24th in terms of numeracy among the 32 OECD countries that participated in the assessment of these skills, and 15th in terms of problem-solving out of the 29 OECD countries that participated in that part of the assessment.11 In a different OECD survey of the skills of 15-year-olds, the U.S. ranked 9th out of 36 OECD countries in reading, 31st out of 37 OECD countries in math, and 13th out of 37 OECD countries in science.12\n\nThese results are troubling but not insurmountable. Thoughtful and deliberate policies to make quality education the reality for all students can increase economic opportunity and inclusion for people who have not had those opportunities in the past, better prepare us no matter how the nature of work changes, and strengthen the U.S. economy now and in the future."

            "content": "I thank the European Economics and Financial Centre for the opportunity to share my views on the U.S. economy and monetary policy in the Centre's Distinguished Speakers Seminar series. I last had the honor of speaking to you in July 2019 in London. That was only about a year and a half ago, though time seems to be working differently these days. Someone recently quipped that it's hard to believe that 2020 is over since it started just 12 years ago!\n\nI do wish we could be meeting in person today – not just because London is one of my favorite cities but because it would mean that the scourge of the pandemic was behind us. Unfortunately, we are not there yet. The next few months will be challenging ones, as many countries, including yours and mine, continue to struggle with the increasing number of new cases of the virus as we await wider distribution of vaccines. Nonetheless, as we all turn the page on 2020, the prospects are good for a much more favorable 2021. Today, I will discuss why I think that is the base case. Of course, the views I'll present are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Economy\n\nAt the start of 2020, before the pandemic, the U.S. economy was on very solid footing. It was the 11th year of the expansion, and things looked quite good from the perspective of our monetary policy goals of maximum employment and price stability. The unemployment rate was at historically low levels, employment growth was strong, participation in the labor force was solid, and inflation was near the FOMC's longer-run goal of 2 percent.\n\nBut the pandemic changed all of that.\n\nIn March, the U.S. took aggressive social-distancing measures to limit the spread of the virus and to buy some time for the healthcare system to increase its capacity to care for the sick, learn more about the virus itself, and develop testing and treatments. As nonessential businesses shut down, there were swift and severe effects across the U.S. economy. Our economy began to reopen in May as public health statistics began to improve and many parts of the country began to relax some of their stay-at-home restrictions. During this reopening phase, there were sharp rebounds in activity and hiring in those parts of the economy that did not involve close physical contact. In fact, the rebound in activity was stronger than many analysts were anticipating, a good reminder that we should never count out the resiliency of the U.S. economy or the ability of the American people to adapt to circumstances.\n\nThe U.S. economy is currently in what I call the pre-vaccination recovery phase. The pace of the recovery has slowed compared to last spring and that slowdown is likely to continue in the near term as the current surge in new virus cases has once again led to mandatory and voluntary restrictions on some activities. The recovery, thus far, has varied considerably across sectors. Interest-rate-sensitive sectors, like housing and autos, have been particularly strong. Sales of single-family homes, both new and existing, are now well above pre-pandemic levels, and so is spending on durable goods, including autos. Spending on food in grocery stores surged in March and has remained elevated. But spending in other sectors, including travel, leisure, and hospitality, which involve more person-to-person contact, is still very constrained compared to pre-pandemic levels. Performing arts institutions continue to struggle and lost a substantial income source with the cancelation of holiday performances. The commercial real estate sector is also feeling the strains as many businesses fight to stay afloat.\n\nBefore I turn to the outlook and a discussion of policy, let me show you a few charts to illustrate the phases the U.S. economy has been through.\n\n[FIGURE 1] The official GDP data clearly show the deep plunge in activity associated with the shutdown followed by a rebound as the economy reopened. Economic activity peaked last February and the U.S. economy entered a recession. Real GDP fell at a 5 percent annual pace in the first quarter of last year and a record 31 percent annual pace in the second quarter. In the third quarter, as the economy reopened, growth rebounded, with real GDP rising at a 33 percent annual pace. Growth continued in the fourth quarter, but at a slower pace, and I expect 2020 ended with real GDP still somewhat below where it was at the end of 2019.\n\n[FIGURE 2] We can see the same pattern in the labor market data. The unemployment rate was a low 3.5 percent in February and it surged to 14.8 percent in April. It rapidly declined as the economy reopened and people on temporary furlough or layoff began to be rehired.\n\nSimilarly, payroll employment plunged by 22 million jobs in March and April. To put that into perspective: that was about the same number of jobs the economy had added over the 10-plus years of the previous expansion. When the U.S. economy reopened in May, hiring picked up rapidly. But since the summer, the labor market has cooled. Some of that was expected after the reopening, but more recently, hiring has slowed even more given the re-imposition of some restrictions on activity due to the increase in new virus cases. In fact, payrolls declined by 140 thousand jobs in December and employment remained more than 6 percent, or almost 10 million jobs, below its level in February. A larger share of those currently unemployed are on permanent rather than temporary layoff compared to earlier in 2020, and the unemployment rate remains very elevated, at 6.7 percent in December, unchanged from November.\n\n[FIGURE 3] The disparate nature of the recovery, thus far, can be seen in some of the labor market statistics. In terms of the decline in unemployment rates since February, there has been less progress for nonwhites and for those without a college education, as seen here.1\n\n[FIGURE 4] Rehiring by employers has been considerably slower for low-wage workers than for high-wage workers, whose employment level has now returned to its pre-pandemic level. Among workers in the prime working ages of 25 to 54, the labor force participation rate of women has recovered less than that of men. In part, this reflects the types of jobs held by women and men, with a higher share of women working in industries hit the hardest by the pandemic. But it also likely reflects the fact that the need to provide childcare for pre-school children or those being schooled remotely is disproportionately affecting women's ability to remain in the workforce or work their usual number of hours. On a more positive note, our contacts from staffing companies report that while they have few people looking for job placements, they have seen a significant increase in people taking their online training courses. This suggests that people are preparing themselves to re-enter the labor force when their circumstances allow them to do so.\n\n[FIGURE 5] Weakness in economic activity and the uncertain outlook throughout last year put downward pressure on inflation, even though supply disruptions caused the prices of certain goods and services to rise. During the shutdown phase last spring, total PCE inflation fell to 1/2 percent and core PCE inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, fell to under 1 percent. As the economy reopened and started to recover, inflation firmed. The disparate nature of the recovery is seen in the inflation data, too. High demand has pushed durable goods inflation to a 25-year high, while the inflation rate for services, which includes the prices of travel, hospitality, and other hard-hit sectors, remains in the bottom of its range over the last decade. Overall, inflation remains below the FOMC's longer-run goal of 2 percent as measured by the year-over-year change in PCE inflation.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\n\nThat is a brief review of where the U.S. economy has been. Where it is going will largely depend on the path of the virus, which, in turn, is affected by our actions to control its spread, treat it, test for it, and vaccinate against it. It probably goes without saying that there is still a high degree of uncertainty around the outlook, even though some of the worst-case scenarios and downside risks have lessened over time.\n\nThree key factors are shaping my thinking about the economic outlook. The first is the surge in new virus cases, which well exceed those seen last spring and summer and are straining hospital capacity in some parts of the U.S. The surge is exacting a heavy human toll and casting a shadow on the near-term economic outlook.\n\nA second factor shaping my outlook is the positive developments on the vaccine front. These have made me more confident about the economy's recovery over the medium run, notwithstanding the bumpy start to deployment of the vaccines in the U.S. It will take several months for vaccines to be widely distributed and for a large segment of the U.S. population to be vaccinated. But when that happens, economic conditions will look very different from what they look like today.\n\nThe third factor shaping my outlook is the fact that while the pace of the recovery has slowed from the strong rebound seen in the third quarter of last year, so far the recovery has generally been stronger than anticipated. This suggests that we may have been underestimating the economy's resilience and underlying momentum, as well as the ability of households and businesses to adapt to this unprecedented environment.\n\nTaking these factors into account, I expect the recovery to continue, but to be uneven over the year. In the near term, the current surge in virus cases will likely weigh on economic activity this winter as it is managed through social distancing and targeted shutdowns, albeit ones that are less severe than those last spring. But as the surge is brought under control and more people become vaccinated, I expect economic activity to pick up. Assuming that most people are vaccinated by the third quarter of the year, people and businesses will feel it is safe to re-engage in a broad range of activities and I expect a strong pickup in economic activity in the second half of this year.\n\nThis post-vaccination phase of the recovery is likely to continue over the next few years, with growth above trend, declines in the unemployment rate, and gradually rising inflation. Given the nature and the severity of the pandemic shock, some sectors will recover slower than others. It will take time for some of the workers who have lost jobs to find new ones, either at another firm in their current industry or in a new industry after they retrain. There may well be persistent changes in consumer preferences with respect to shopping, dining, and housing and firms' demand for office space. Those changes, as well as the need to re-establish more robust supply chains, could necessitate structural changes to the economy that will take time to unfold.\n\nPolicy\n\nMy modal outlook, which I just described, depends on appropriate policy. Both monetary and fiscal policy have supported the recovery in the U.S. thus far, and in my view, both will continue to be needed to limit lasting damage to the economy from the pandemic and support the achievement of a broad-based sustainable recovery. Since the start of the pandemic, fiscal policy actions have included grants to individuals, certain businesses hit hardest by the pandemic, and states and municipalities; expanded unemployment benefits; and loans to small businesses that became grants for firms maintaining their payrolls. Federal Reserve actions have included buying Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), implementing emergency facilities to backstop the flow of credit throughout the economy, ensuring our central bank counterparties abroad have access to dollar funding, temporarily relaxing some of the regulatory requirements on banks so they have greater capacity to lend, and lowering the target range of our policy rate, the federal funds rate.\n\nThe FOMC has been maintaining the fed funds rate target range at 0 to 1/4 percent since March. We expect it will be appropriate to maintain that range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with our assessments of maximum employment, and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. The FOMC also continues to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency MBS by at least $40 billion per month. We expect to continue doing so until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum employment and price stability goals.\n\nThe forward guidance in our December policy statement is entirely consistent with our revised monetary policy strategy, which was summarized in a statement we released last August.2 Let me conclude with a few comments on our revised strategy and its implications for monetary policy going forward.\n\nThe FOMC's Revised Monetary Policy Strategy and Its Implications for Monetary Policy\n\nThe revised strategy statement summarizes the FOMC's conclusions from a review of our monetary policy framework that began in early 2019. The review was undertaken in light of changes in the economic environment that have implications for monetary policy. One change that has occurred in the U.S. and other advanced economies is the decline in the general level of interest rates consistent with sustainable growth and price stability. This decline reflects several factors, including the aging of the population, changes in risk preferences, and slower productivity growth. It means that the level of the fed funds rate consistent with maximum employment and price stability is now lower than it has been in the past. So the FOMC will have less policy space to support the economy using its traditional policy tool and during economic downturns, it is now more likely that the fed funds rate will be constrained by its effective lower bound. Households, businesses, and financial markets understand this constraint, so they are likely to think that inflation will remain low because of the lack of policy space. So the constraint imparts a downward bias to inflation expectations and inflation, and so increases the downside risks to achieving our policy goals.\n\nAnother change in the economic environment compared to past decades pertains to inflation dynamics. Resource slack in the labor market and in product markets has become less correlated with actual inflation than in the past, and inflation expectations now play a larger role in determining inflation outcomes. This makes it even more important that inflation expectations remain well anchored at levels consistent with our longer-run 2 percent inflation goal, especially because inflation running below our goal would result in even less policy space in a low-interest-rate environment.\n\nOur revised strategy incorporates these changes in the economic environment. We have reaffirmed that our longer-run inflation goal is 2 percent, but in order to achieve this goal, we will likely aim to have inflation run moderately above 2 percent for some time after periods in which inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent. In other words, not only will we be comfortable with serendipitous shocks that move inflation above 2 percent, but we will set policy to intentionally move inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time. The implication is that, all else equal, monetary policy will be somewhat more accommodative than in the past when inflation has been running persistently low in order to reach our longer-run inflation goal.\n\nWith respect to our employment goal, in the last expansion we learned over time that employment growth could be stronger and the unemployment rate lower without generating inflation than one would have thought possible based on past decades of experience. Our new strategy clarifies that in the absence of inflationary pressures or risks to financial stability, strong employment is not a concern and monetary policy will not react to it. Indeed, the benefits of a strong labor market in fostering economic inclusion for all Americans are clear.\n\nThe approach to monetary policymaking as summarized in our strategy has implications for policy going forward. It is consistent with my view that based on my current outlook and assessment of risks around the outlook, it will be appropriate for monetary policy to be patiently accommodative. A slowdown in the economy in the first part of the year along the lines I am expecting would not require a change in monetary policy so long as the medium-run outlook remains intact. Nor would the strengthening in growth I expect to see later this year necessitate a change in our policy stance because I expect that the economy will still be far from our employment and inflation goals.\n\nOf course, there continues to be substantial uncertainty around the outlook, with both upside and downside risks, and policymakers are not prescient. This is why framing our forward policy guidance in terms of the progress the economy is making toward our policy goals of maximum employment and price stability is so important. The past year reminds us that the economy could evolve in a materially different way than expected and risks, including those to financial stability, might emerge that could impede attainment of our monetary policy goals. On the other hand, the resiliency shown by the economy so far suggests there is also the possibility that the post-vaccination recovery could be stronger than expected. In either case, consistent with our forward guidance, Federal Reserve policymakers stand prepared to respond appropriately to continue to foster a broad-based sustainable recovery."

My remarks today reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nLet me start with a story about myself. One could say that I earned my Ph.D. in economics as the result of a nudge. I was a double major in math and economics at Barnard College. I applied to graduate school in math, but I ended up pursuing a Ph.D. in economics at Princeton because two professors there – male professors, I might add – wrote to me explaining that Princeton's economics program was very mathematical and encouraged me to come to Princeton to study economics. I would not have done that had it not been for their nudge.\n\nThat is just one anecdote. The papers I am discussing today are both systematic investigations of whether particular types of nudges can interest more women and minorities to go into the field of economics.\n\nWhy Diversity in Economics Matters\n\nThe Federal Reserve System is one of the largest employers of economists. We have about 700 Ph.D. economists and many other staff members with bachelor's and master's degrees in economics. I believe we have a vested interest in helping to attract more women and minorities to the field. There are three major reasons. First, economics is a field that influences public policy, policy that affects the lives of all types of people. At the Fed, we work on behalf of the public. So we need to consider the effects of our monetary, regulatory, and payments policies on all of our constituents. That is easier to do when your own staff reflects the public. Second, there is evidence that you end up making better decisions when diverse views inform those decisions. Diverse teams tend to be more objective and to focus on the facts when making decisions; they may process information more carefully because they are forced to confront a different way of thinking and to convince those with alternative views; and firms with more diversity tend to be more innovative.1 Research also shows that firms with diverse management tend to have above-average earnings.2 And third, it is important that the field of economics does not get stymied by group-think. Economics needs to continue to be a vibrant field, tackling new research questions and developing innovative techniques and ways of analysis to arrive at answers to these questions. Broader representation in economics means that a broader set of issues will be tackled and a broader set of research results disseminated. The field will continue to evolve, resulting in better policy outcomes that will improve the economic well-being of a greater share of the population.\n\nSome Data on Diversity in Economics\n\nUnfortunately, economics is not a diverse field. Economics is a popular major in U.S. colleges and universities, but the field has had less success in attracting women or historically under-represented racial and ethnic minorities. While there has been some improvement compared to the 1970s, under-representation of women and minorities in the field of economics has been going on for many years. Women earn between 30 and 35 percent of the bachelor's degrees in economics, and this share has been relatively stable over the past two decades.3 It is higher than the female share of bachelor's degrees in some of the STEM fields, including computer sciences, and engineering and engineering technology, but lower than the female share of bachelor's degrees conferred in the physical sciences and in mathematics and statistics.4 Across all fields, women earn more than half of all bachelor's degrees awarded.5 This means women are choosing to major in economics at only a third of the rate of men.6 But women are attracted to other social sciences and to the natural sciences as well. The humanities, including English, foreign languages, and visual arts, and nursing continue to attract women, as they have traditionally done. But psychology is a relatively large major, accounting for almost 6 percent of all bachelor's degrees conferred in the 2017-2018 academic year, with almost 80 percent earned by women.7 Business is a large major: almost 20 percent of bachelor's degrees conferred were in business, with 47 percent of those earned by women. Biology accounts for about 6 percent of degrees conferred, with over 60 percent earned by women.8\n\nThe numbers in economics are even lower for under-represented minorities, who earn slightly more than 20 percent of bachelor's degrees and slightly less than 12 percent of economics degrees awarded, meaning that minorities are choosing economics over other majors at only about half the rate of white students.9\n\nIn terms of upper-level degrees, about one-third of the Ph.D.s awarded in economics go to women. The shares of women professors in economics across the various ranks have risen over time, but women still make up about 30 percent of assistant professors, about 26 percent of tenured associates, and about 15 percent of full professors in economics.10\n\nRestricting attention to U.S. citizens and permanent residents, of the 464 economics doctorates awarded in 2018, only 46, that is, about 10 percent, were awarded to under-represented minorities.11 In the academic professorial ranks, in the academic year 2018-2019, under-represented minorities made up about 10 percent of assistant professors and a little over 5 percent of full professors.12\n\nWe can certainly applaud the progress that has been made in increasing the representation of women and under-represented minorities in the field of economics since the 1970s, but more work needs to be done. While you do not need to have majored in economics to enter a Ph.D. program in economics, it is a natural path. So the under-representation of women and minorities in economics at the undergraduate level factors into the under-representation of these groups at the graduate level and throughout the ranks of academia. Unless the entry of women and minorities into graduate school picks up, it is hard to see how the numbers of Ph.D.s in the ranks of academia and in nonacademic positions that require a Ph.D. in economics can increase. The fact that women are attracted to other social sciences and to business suggests that it may not just be that women prefer other fields to economics. And even if it were, we should try to shape those preferences because economics is an important and broad field that affects many people's lives. We need to make more progress in attracting those who are currently under-represented to the field of economics.\n\nIncreasing Diversity in Economics with Nudges\n\nThe two papers I've been asked to discuss look at particular nudges aimed at increasing students' awareness of the field of economics and assess whether these nudges influence their choice of major, in particular, for female and minority students.13 The literature indicates that information can affect a college student's choice of major and the American Economic Association recommends sharing information about the economics major as a way of trying to address gender and racial disparities in knowledge about the field.\n\nThe paper by Pugatch and Schroeder looks at whether informing undergraduate females about the value of a degree in economics in terms of future salaries or the positive impact one might have on society will lead more women to choose economics as a field. The researchers used a sample of 2,277 students enrolled in Economics Principles courses at Oregon State University, randomly assigning them into one of five groups, four of which involved getting an email with some type of information about the economics major and one group not getting an email. The four treatments were: basic information about the economics major; basic information plus information on earnings of economics majors; basic information plus a link to an AEA career video; and basic information plus a link to video testimonials by OSU economics students and alumni.\n\nThey then looked at whether the student was an economics major in the winter of 2020, two to four terms after the emails were sent. They found that receiving a message was associated with an increased probability of the student majoring in economics. The likelihood was a statistically significant 2 percentage points higher for those receiving basic information compared to those not receiving information. But this result was driven by male students. In fact, none of the four treatments had a significant effect on majoring in economics for female students, and this was not due to the smaller sample size of female students. The authors do a number of robustness tests and these results survive. When they simulate what would happen to the ratio of male to female majors in economics, they find that if the basic information treatment was applied, the ratio would rise from 1.4 to 2.7; that is, it would almost double the gender disparity. The video information does not seem to have an effect over and above the basic email, but that is not surprising because few students actually clicked on the videos to view them.\n\nPerhaps it is ironic that one of the basic concepts taught in economics – the law of unintended consequences – is rearing its head here. One conclusion from the study is that simple nudges could actually increase gender disparity in the field.\n\nBut before we give up on nudges altogether, we may want to consider whether honing the message could be more effective. The fact that 60-80 percent of students opened the email message and that a simple email message had a significant effect on the selection of a major is striking and gives us something to work with. Further work might investigate whether messages could be better tailored to under-represented groups. Following-up with this group of 2,000+ students after they have chosen a major to see what influenced their choice and whether the email resonated or not might provide useful insights. Given the popularity of the psychology major among women, emphasizing the behavioral aspects of economics and its wide application might help to attract women to the field. Perhaps giving the parents of college students information on the economics major would result in more students selecting economics as a major. Of course, it might result in the exact opposite – another unintended consequence.\n\nBedard, Dodd, and Lundberg also look at the potential for nudges to affect the choice of economics as a major for females and under-represented ethnic and racial groups. Their experiment involved 2,338 students who received a grade of C or better in the introductory principles of microeconomics course at the University of California, Santa Barbara. These students received information about the school's two economics majors (Economics and Economics and Accounting, which prepares the students for certification as a professional accountant), career information, and an invitation to an informational meeting about the majors. Other results in the literature suggest that compared to male students, female students are more sensitive to grades and less likely to go on to major in economics if they feel they did not do well enough in the introductory course. So a random sample of the students who received a B or better in the intro course were given additional positive feedback, including positive information on how they performed in the course, how they were on track to do well in the major, and encouragement to consider majoring in economics. The authors then assessed whether receiving positive feedback was associated with a greater probability of attending the informational meeting and/or selecting the economics major and whether there were differences by race/ethnicity and gender.\n\nThe authors find that the performance information is associated with a statistically significant higher probability of attending the informational meeting, of about 6 percentage points, for both males and females. There is also a statistically significant increase in selection of one of the two economics majors for males and females. The greatest effects are among Hispanic students: the probability of majoring in Economics and Accounting after receiving the positive treatment is almost 17 percentage points higher for Hispanic males and 48 percentage points higher for Hispanic females. The paper does not report the baseline probabilities of attending the introductory meeting and choosing to be an economics major for the control groups so one cannot determine the economic significance of these effects. But they are suggestive that informational nudges can work.\n\nFurther Steps\n\nI applaud the researchers of both papers. Economics is a data-intensive, results-driven field, so research like this is welcome as a way to distinguish what we know from what we think we know. Both papers add to a growing body of literature on what types of interventions could yield a more diverse pool of students going into economics. The basic conclusion I came away with is that the lack of diversity in economics is a complex problem to solve. The approach is likely going to have to be of the \"let a thousand flowers bloom\" variety: trying many things on several fronts, and then evaluating their effects, as these papers do.\n\nThose of us in the profession should do what we can to ensure that we make the field inclusive. This could mean providing information, changing course content, increasing mentoring throughout all university levels, and ensuring that our workplaces have a culture that champions diversity and inclusion, not merely in words but also in deeds.\n\nI think we also need to recognize that we are likely too late if we focus on undergraduates. To drive significant change in broadening the field, we need to start in kindergarten and elementary school, and then continue throughout high school to explain basic economic thinking, what types of problems economics can help solve, and what types of career paths economics opens up.\n\nI serve on the board of the Council for Economic Education (CEE), a nonprofit organization whose mission is to educate students in kindergarten through high school about economics and personal finance. According to the CEE's 2020 Survey of the States, only 25 states require high school students to take an economics course to graduate. Expanding this requirement to more states would also give students a better view of what economics is and, depending on how it is taught, might be effective in drawing more people to the field. Another recent survey found that students who participate in the CEE's National Economics Challenge, a high school quiz bowl competition, do better than the national average on advanced placement exams, with especially strong gains shown by female and minority students, and that participants are more likely than nonparticipants to choose to major in economics.14 This suggests that exposure to economics at a younger age can help spur knowledge of and interest in the field. This year the Cleveland Fed will be hosting the CEE's virtual National Personal Finance Challenge and we are looking for ways to expand and strengthen our internship programs so that more students can learn about careers in economics and that we can develop longer-lasting relationships with the interns over their educational years and as they enter the job market."

            "content": "I thank Professor Yoosoon Chang, president of the Korea-America Economic Association, for the opportunity to speak at this year's annual forum. Over the years, the forum has had a number of distinguished speakers and it is truly an honor to speak with you this evening about the outlook for the economy and monetary policy. Of course, the views I'll present are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nI would like to start with wishing everyone a happy and healthy new year. Wishing someone good health at the start of a new year is a time-honored tradition. But it has taken on a deeper meaning this year as we turn the page on 2020, a year in which the coronavirus pandemic inflicted pain and hardship on people all over the world. The pandemic was an unprecedented shock to global health and to the economy – the largest shock in most of our lifetimes. With the distribution of vaccines now underway and with further fiscal policy relief for households and businesses on the way, the prospects are good for a much more favorable 2021. Nonetheless, the next few months will be challenging ones, as the country continues to struggle with increasing new cases of COVID-19, which are putting strains on our healthcare system and limiting economic activity.\n\nI believe patience will prove to be a virtue as the year unfolds. Until the vaccines have been widely distributed and many people have been vaccinated, we will all need to be patient and continue to follow public health experts' advice to socially distance, wear a mask, and wash our hands to help control the virus's spread. In addition, monetary policy will also need to remain patiently accommodative to support a broad-based and sustainable recovery and achievement of our longer-run goals of maximum employment and price stability.\n\nThe Economy\n\nIn thinking about the impact of the pandemic on the economy, I find it helps to think in terms of phases. The pre-pandemic phase at the start of last year found the economy on very solid footing. It was the 11th year of the expansion, and from the perspective of our monetary policy goals, things looked quite good. The unemployment rate was at historically low levels, employment growth was strong, and participation in the labor force was higher than what was expected given the aging of the population. And after several years of running low, inflation was near our longer-run goal of 2 percent.\n\nBut the pandemic changed all of that. In March, the country took aggressive social-distancing measures to limit the spread of the virus and to buy some time for the healthcare system to increase its capacity to care for the sick, learn more about the virus itself, and develop testing and treatments. In this shutdown phase, there were swift and severe effects across the economy as nonessential businesses stopped operating and many activities came to a halt. But as public health statistics began to improve and many parts of the country began to relax some of their stay-at-home restrictions, a reopening phase began in May. This reopening phase saw sharp rebounds in activity and hiring in those parts of the economy that did not involve close physical contact.\n\nAs the summer wore on, the economy entered its current phase – a pre-vaccination recovery phase. The economy continued to recover but, as expected, at a slower pace than in the reopening phase. More recently, the pace of activity has also been constrained by the current surge in new virus cases, which has resulted in mandatory and voluntary restrictions on some activities.\n\nIn this phase, the recovery has varied considerably across sectors. Interest-rate-sensitive sectors, like housing and autos, have been particularly strong. Sales of single-family homes, both new and existing, are now well above pre-pandemic levels, and so is spending on durable goods, including autos. Spending on food in grocery stores surged in March and has remained elevated. But spending in other sectors, including travel, leisure, and hospitality, which involve more person-to-person contact, is still very constrained compared to pre-pandemic levels. Performing arts institutions continue to struggle and lost a substantial income source with the cancelation of holiday performances. The commercial real estate sector is also feeling the strains as many businesses fight to stay afloat.\n\nThese phases of the economy – shutdown, reopening, pre-vaccination recovery – are clearly seen in the data. So I would like to illustrate where things stand with a couple of slides before turning to the outlook. Economists tend to look at growth rates when assessing the economy, but in this unprecedented situation, looking at the level of activity also provides an important perspective.\n\n[FIGURE 1] The official GDP data clearly show the deep plunge in activity associated with the shutdown followed by a rebound as the economy reopened. Economic activity peaked in February and the U.S. economy entered a recession. Real GDP fell at a 5 percent annual pace in the first quarter and a record 31 percent annual pace in the second quarter. The level of real GDP in the second quarter was back down to its level in early 2015 – a loss of over five years of output growth. Growth rebounded in the third quarter as the economy reopened, with real GDP rising at a 33 percent annual pace; its level was back to where it was in early 2018. The rebound in activity was stronger than many analysts were anticipating, a good reminder that we should never count out the resiliency of the U.S. economy or of the American people. Growth continued in the fourth quarter, but at a slower pace, and I expect 2020 ended with real GDP still somewhat below where it was at the end of 2019.\n\n[FIGURE 2] The economic phases are also clearly seen in the labor market data. April saw an unprecedented rise in unemployment and loss of jobs, particularly in sectors where people could not work from home. The unemployment rate hit 14.7 percent in April, up from 3.5 percent in February. But as the economy reopened, there was a rapid decline in the unemployment rate as people on temporary furlough or layoff began to be rehired. The improvement in the labor market was faster than anticipated, but the pace has slowed and the overall unemployment rate remains very elevated, at 6.7 percent in November.\n\n[FIGURE 3] Moreover, some of the disparities in the recovery thus far can be seen in labor market outcomes for different racial/ethnic groups and different educational attainment groups. All groups' unemployment rates surged last spring and have fallen since then but, as of November, there has been less progress for nonwhites and for those without a college education. Relative to their pre-pandemic levels, the unemployment rates of Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians remain higher than that of whites, and the unemployment rate of high school graduates without any college is higher than that of college graduates.1\n\n[FIGURE 4] These unemployment rates would be even higher if people had not left the labor force over the course of last year. As of November, the labor force participation rate for those age 16 or older was almost 2 percentage points lower than it was in February. Among workers in the prime working ages of 25 to 54, women's participation is down 2-1/2 percentage points compared to about 2 percentage points for men. In part, this reflects the types of jobs held by women and men, with a higher share of women working in industries hit the hardest by the pandemic. Reports from regional contacts, as well as survey results from the Cleveland Fed's national daily Consumers and COVID-19 Survey, indicate that the need to provide childcare for pre-school children or those being schooled remotely is disproportionately impacting the ability of women to remain in the workforce or work their usual number of hours. Firms also tell us that maintaining productivity is now harder because of the variability they are experiencing in their workforce levels – on any given day there are some workers who unexpectedly have to stay home because a school is closed or because they have been exposed to the virus.\n\nOn a more positive note, our contacts from staffing companies report that while they have few people looking for job placements, they have seen a significant increase in people taking their online training courses. This suggests that people are preparing themselves to re-enter the labor force when their circumstances allow them to do so.\n\n[FIGURE 5] The payroll employment data also tell a similar story across the economic phases caused by the pandemic. In just the two months of March and April, the economy lost 22 million jobs, the same number of jobs it had added over the entire previous expansion, which lasted over 10 years. More than three-quarters of those losses were in the sectors paying below-average wages. When the economy reopened in May, hiring picked up rapidly. As expected, the pace has slowed since that rebound, and more recently, hiring has slowed even more given the re-imposition of some restrictions on activity due to the increase in new COVID cases. As of November, employment remained more than 6 percent, or almost 10 million jobs, below its level in February, and a larger share of those currently unemployed are on permanent rather than temporary layoff compared to earlier in the year. It will take some time for these workers to get re-employed as they may need to retrain for other occupations.\n\n[FIGURE 6] Weakness in economic activity and the uncertain outlook throughout last year put downward pressure on inflation, even though supply disruptions caused the prices of certain goods and services to rise. During the shutdown phase in the spring, total PCE inflation fell to 1/2 percent and core PCE inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, fell to under 1 percent. As the economy reopened and started to recover, inflation firmed. This is especially true for durable goods, where high demand has driven inflation for these goods to a 25-year high. The inflation rates for services, which include sectors hardest hit by the pandemic, including travel and hospitality, have remained near the bottom of their ranges over the last decade. Overall, inflation remains below the FOMC's longer-run goal of 2 percent.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\n\nThat is a brief review of where the economy is, but I bet you are even more interested in where the economy is headed. It continues to be the case that the path of the economy depends largely on the path of the virus, which is affected by our actions to control its spread, treat it, test for it, and vaccinate against it. This means there is still a high degree of uncertainty around the outlook, although some of the worst-case scenarios and downside risks have lessened over time. As shown in the December Summary of Economic Projections, fewer FOMC participants see the balance of risks as weighted to the downside than they did in September.2\n\nThree key factors are shaping my thinking about the economic outlook. They suggest that the near-term outlook is likely to be weak, while the medium-run outlook is likely to show considerable improvement. First, the U.S. and many other countries are experiencing a surge in new virus cases. The latest data for the U.S. show some tempering over the past two weeks, but new case counts still well exceed those seen last spring and summer. They are straining hospital capacity, necessitating more voluntary and mandated restrictions on activity and casting a shadow on the near-term economic outlook.\n\nA second factor shaping my outlook is the positive developments on the vaccine front, which have made me more confident about the economy's recovery over the medium run. It will take several months for vaccines to be widely distributed and for a large segment of the population to be vaccinated. But widespread vaccinations will create economic conditions that look very different from the current conditions in the midst of the rapid rise in virus cases, hospitalizations, and deaths.\n\nThe third factor shaping my outlook is the fact that while the pace of the recovery is slowing from the strong rebound seen in the third quarter of last year, so far the recovery has generally been stronger than anticipated. This suggests that we may have been underestimating the economy's resilience and underlying momentum, as well as the ability of households and businesses to adapt to this unprecedented environment.\n\nTaking these factors into account, I expect the recovery to continue, but to be uneven over the year. In the near term, the current surge in virus cases is likely to weigh on activity this winter as the surge is managed through social distancing and targeted shutdowns, albeit ones that are less severe than those last spring. As the surge is brought under control and more people become vaccinated, I expect economic activity to pick up. Assuming that most people are vaccinated by the third quarter of the year, I expect to see a strong pickup in economic activity in the second half of this year as people and businesses feel it is safe to re-engage in a broad range of activities.\n\nI expect this post-vaccination phase of the recovery to continue over the next few years, with growth above trend, declines in the unemployment rate, and gradually rising inflation. Given the severity of the pandemic shock, it will take time to move to a more broad-based sustainable recovery. The recovery will likely remain uneven for some time, as some sectors will recover faster than others. It will take time for some of the workers who have lost jobs to find new ones, either at another firm in their current industry or in a new industry after they retrain. Changes in consumer preferences with respect to shopping, dining, and housing, firms' demand for office space, and the re-establishment of more robust supply chains could all necessitate structural changes to the economy that will take time to unfold.\n\nPolicy\n\nMy modal outlook, which I just described, depends on appropriate policy. In my view, both fiscal policy and monetary policy will continue to be needed to limit lasting damage to the economy from the pandemic and support the achievement of a broader, sustainable recovery. Monetary and fiscal policy are not substitutes; they are complements and we saw them working together very effectively earlier last year when the pandemic hit. Fiscal policy actions included grants to individuals, certain businesses hit hardest by the pandemic, and states and municipalities; expanded unemployment benefits; and loans to small businesses that became grants for firms maintaining their payrolls. The recently passed $900 billion of additional fiscal relief will help support households and businesses hardest hit by the pandemic in the first half of 2021, helping to provide a bridge until the economy improves later in the year. Further investment in vaccine deployment and aid to states responsible for distributing the vaccines would support a broader and faster recovery.\n\nFor its part, the Federal Reserve took actions to ensure that financial markets had enough liquidity to continue to function well, that credit could continue to flow to households and businesses, and that the stance of monetary policy was highly accommodative. These actions have included buying Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), implementing emergency facilities to backstop the flow of credit throughout the economy, ensuring our central bank counterparties abroad have access to dollar funding, temporarily relaxing some of the regulatory requirements on banks so they have greater capacity to lend, and lowering the target range of our policy rate, the fed funds rate.\n\nThe FOMC has been maintaining the fed funds rate target range at 0 to 1/4 percent since March. We expect it will be appropriate to maintain that range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with our assessments of maximum employment, and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. The FOMC also continues to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency MBS by at least $40 billion per month. We expect to continue doing so until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum employment and price stability goals. The forward guidance on our policy rate and asset purchases is entirely consistent with our revised monetary policy strategy, which was summarized in a statement we released last August.3 The forward guidance ties the stance of monetary policy to progress on our mandated goals.\n\nThe guidance is also consistent with my view that policy patience will prove to be a virtue. The current stance of policy is well calibrated to my outlook. A slowdown in the economy in the first part of the year along the lines I am expecting would not require a change in monetary policy so long as the medium-run outlook remains intact. Nor would the strengthening in growth I expect to see later this year necessitate a change in our policy stance because I expect that the economy will still be far from our employment and inflation goals. Of course, if the economy evolves materially differently than expected or if risks, including those to financial stability, emerge that could impede attainment of our monetary policy goals, we would be prepared to respond appropriately.\n\nBut given my outlook and assessment of risks, in my view, monetary policy will need to remain highly accommodative for quite some time because achieving our monetary policy goals is likely to be a journey and not a sprint. While achieving our goals will take some time, I do not view this as a failure of monetary policy or a lack of commitment on the part of policymakers to achieve our goals. The economy's intrinsic dynamics suggest that inflation is not going to move up quickly above 2 percent. And the severity of the pandemic shock and its disparate impact across households, communities, and sectors suggest that it will take time to return to strong labor market conditions like those we experienced prior to the pandemic. The FOMC is, and will remain, fully committed to using our policy tools to achieve our goals, in support of a broad-based and sustainable recovery."

            "content": "I thank the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and the other organizers for inviting me to speak at the fourth annual Fintech Conference. I spent most of my career at the Philadelphia Fed, so it is always a pleasure to participate in one of its events. Since the beginning of this conference series, the discussions have consistently been very topical, and the agenda for the next two days does not disappoint on that score. The conference will cover many of the hot issues confronting practitioners, academics, and policymakers as financial system innovation proceeds at a rapid pace. Today I will discuss the implications of digitalization for financial inclusion and some steps that need to be taken to ensure that digitalization helps to foster inclusion rather than promote exclusion. The views I will present today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nFinancial Inclusion Has Benefits\n\nIt is probably best to start off with a definition of financial inclusion, and the World Bank provides us with a workable one: financial inclusion refers to individuals and businesses having access to useful and affordable financial products and services that meet their needs and that are delivered in a responsible and sustainable way.1 Much of the literature measures financial inclusion as households' and businesses' use of formal financial services from banks or other traditional providers, so-called mainstream financial services. With the entry of fintech providers, that definition is expanding because fintech financial services are moving into the mainstream.\n\nThe World Bank's Global Findex database provides data on how people in 140 economies access accounts, make payments, save, borrow, and manage risks. It includes data on formal and informal financial services and the use of financial technology to conduct financial transactions.2 The data indicate that across the globe financial inclusion has risen. The share of adults with an account at a financial institution or through a mobile money service rose from 62 percent in 2014 to 69 percent in 2017. Nonetheless, there is still a large portion of the population that does not have access to or use financial services. As of 2017, an estimated 1.7 billion adults around the world are unbanked or underserved. Women lag behind men; the poor lag behind the wealthy; and developing economies lag behind developed economies in the shares having formal accounts.\n\nIn the U.S., the level of financial inclusion is high: 93 percent of adults have an account at a bank or other type of financial institution or use a mobile money service. But disparities exist: there is a 13 percentage point gap between those in the richest 60 percent of households and those in the poorest 40 percent. Federal Reserve data indicate that, compared to whites, Blacks and Hispanics in the U.S. are less likely to have a bank account and more likely to rely on alternative financial services such as money orders and check cashing services.3 And compared to small firms with white ownership, those with Black ownership were half as likely to have obtained financing from a bank in the past five years, relying more on online lenders, which, according to the survey respondents, provide less satisfactory service.4\n\nTo address these types of gaps, many countries have set financial inclusion as a formal target.5 This is reasonable because numerous studies have documented the contribution of a well-functioning financial system and higher levels of financial inclusion to longer-run macroeconomic goals of output and productivity growth.6 On the macro level, healthy financial markets and institutions allow for more efficient allocation of capital and better monitoring and broader diversification of risk, which can enable higher levels of overall growth. At the micro level, access to savings and credit via financial intermediaries connects households and businesses to economic opportunities that would not be available otherwise. A sound financial system can spur entrepreneurship and support the competitive forces that drive productivity in the economy.\n\nIn addition to these benefits, the distributional impacts of finance are worth considering. A body of work has shown that finance can expand economic opportunities for those at the bottom of the income and wealth distributions and does not merely benefit those at the top.7 For example, access to credit allows access to education, which can have profound effects on an individual's economic well-being, and it also allows households to build wealth through homeownership, which remains the most significant asset on many U.S. families' balance sheets.\n\nDigitalization Is Transforming Financial Services\n\nDigitalization of financial services is transforming the industry and expanding the range of financial service providers to include not only fintech lending and payments firms but also so-called bigtech firms, including technology, social media, search platform, and e-commerce companies. Consumer demand is one factor driving the rise in these services. EMarketer estimates that in 2019, 1.9 billion people worldwide purchased goods online.8 In 2020, despite the global pandemic, retail e-commerce sales are estimated to rise to over $3.9 trillion and yearly sales growth has been in the 15 to 25 percent range over the past three years.9 As the costs of computing have declined and the demand for new services that offer speed and convenience at a lower price has risen, new firms have entered the financial services space. According to the U.S. Treasury, from 2010 to the third quarter of 2017, more than 3,330 new technology-based firms serving the financial services industry have been founded. The global market capitalization of fintech firms grew to $22 billion in 2017, 13 times what it was in 2010. Lending by these firms accounts for over 36 percent of personal loans in the U.S., up from under 1 percent in 2010. New tools and techniques, including machine learning and artificial intelligence, are now routinely being applied in finance.\n\nDigitalization Has the Potential to Increase Financial Inclusion\n\nLike past financial innovations, digitalization holds the promise of increasing the efficiency, productivity, and inclusiveness of the financial sector, thereby increasing the economic welfare of households and businesses. For example, a wide body of research indicates that tools that increase a household's savings behavior can have a substantial impact on household welfare.10 Digital tools that give households and small businesses across the income spectrum the ability to track and understand their spending and savings patterns can improve their ability to manage their finances, allow them to avoid more costly sources of credit, and increase their savings rate. There is evidence, reflected in several countries' experiences, that access to savings accounts not only increases savings but also results in households shifting more of their spending to education and to healthier food.11 Digitalization also provides customers with tools to search for and compare financial services across various vendors to determine which is more likely to meet their specific needs.\n\nOn the credit side, digital lending platforms hold the potential for more objective credit decisions, helping to guard against personal prejudices influencing those decisions. Bigtech companies have access to large amounts of data, for example, from e-commerce platforms or search engines. Models to assess credit risk based on these alternative data hold the potential to increase credit access for households and small firms that do not necessarily have a long credit history, audited financial statements, or collateral, which are traditionally used to underwrite and monitor credit risk. And there is some research to back this up. A study co-authored by Julapa Jagtiani, one of the organizers of this conference, found that consumer loans made by LendingClub, a large fintech lending platform, reached areas with fewer bank branches and lower-income borrowers.12 Research published by the Bank for International Settlements found that the internal credit scoring model built by and applied to small merchant customers of Mercado Libre, a large e-commerce platform in Latin America now offering financial services, has outperformed (at least in the short run) models based on credit bureau ratings and traditional borrower characteristics.13 And Mercado Libre was able to provide credit to merchants who would have been assessed as high risk by the credit bureau.\n\nInnovations in payments services also hold the potential to increase inclusion. Across the globe there is a move toward faster, cashless payment systems, which can lower costs and provide more secure transactions than cash. Early evidence from several countries shows that the move to digital payments has had a positive impact on the well-being of individuals by strengthening their ties to other financial services.14 There is also evidence that the use of digital systems by governments to make transfer payments to individuals can significantly reduce the cost of distribution and the amount of fraud.15\n\nThe Federal Reserve's FedNowSM service, which is currently being built, will be an around-the-clock service whereby payments can be originated, cleared, and settled within seconds.16 The service is expected to provide clear public benefits in the form of safety, efficiency, and accessibility of instant payments. By lowering the cost of making payments in a secure way, FedNow can help promote financial inclusion by drawing more people into the financial system. This service, coupled with a directory service with accurate information on where to route payments for final distribution to households and businesses, could also make distribution of government benefits more efficient and solve some of the challenges the government faced when distributing pandemic relief payments earlier this year.\n\nSteps Need to Be Taken So That Digitalization Lives Up to Its Potential\n\nWhile digitalization holds a lot of promise to bring more households and businesses into the financial system, there is no guarantee this will happen. Indeed, digitalization could create more exclusion and increase disparities rather than close the gaps. But steps can be taken to help ensure that digitalization lives up to its potential. Let me discuss five of these.\n\nFirst, the digital divide in the U.S. needs to close so that more people can take advantage of digital financial services. Among communities with a population of 100,000 or more, the city of Cleveland has among the lowest home broadband access in the nation.17 Only about 69 percent of households have broadband subscriptions compared to over 84 percent in the city of Philadelphia and over 86 percent for the nation as a whole. In the meantime, mobile phone technology, which has wide distribution, could significantly improve financial system access for unbanked adults.18\n\nSecond, steps must also be taken to improve the reach and the effectiveness of financial literacy programs. Digitalization increases the number of financial services providers and the types of services being offered. But to take advantage of these, people need to be able to assess their value. One study of 188 financial literacy programs indicated that they had not, on average, increased financial knowledge or resulted in better financial choices. But the research also suggested that programs that included simple rules-of-thumb were more effective.19 Businesses also have to understand the costs and benefits of credit coming from a fintech firm versus a traditional banking relationship, which may prove to be more stable in an economic downturn. Increasing the ability of the consumers of financial services to evaluate new services will help ensure that these products add value.\n\nThird, in order to increase inclusion, steps must be taken to build trust between potential customers and the financial services industry. One Federal Reserve analysis indicated that one reason people do not have a transaction account is the lack of trust in financial institutions.20 Effective consumer protection regulations encompassing all providers of financial services would give potential customers more confidence to use the services. Trust also depends on providers of financial services adequately protecting their customers' accounts against cybersecurity breaches, fraud, and data leakage. With the changes in technology and rapid expansion of available data, the methods for protecting the data will need to adapt. The traditional way of keeping data private, by taking away names or otherwise anonymizing it, no longer works in a world rich with multiple data sources that can be cross-referenced to de-anonymize the data and reveal identities.21 New methods have to be evaluated. An example is the technique used to achieve differential privacy by carefully adding some statistical noise to the data to maintain individual privacy while maintaining statistical accuracy.22 The U.S. Census Bureau plans to apply differential privacy techniques to the statistics released as part of the 2020 census.23\n\nFourth, it must be recognized that just because it is an algorithm does not mean it is immune from producing discriminatory underwriting and pricing decisions. Algorithms should be tested for bias before they are deployed. Credit and pricing models produced by algorithms through machine learning are necessarily complex because they are designed to reveal relationships in the data that are not revealed by standard modeling. But their opacity and complexity – their black-box quality – make it more difficult to identify these relationships and more difficult to uncover statistical discrimination or disparate impact and to enforce fair lending laws.24\n\nWell-meaning algorithms can have unintended effects. Algorithms are trained on past data that may have reflected biased decisions or may not be representative of the entire population. With more pieces of data available, there is more risk that data correlated with race or gender could be used in discriminatory ways. This means machine learning algorithms could exacerbate disparities by reinforcing past decisions. Kearns and Roth point out the need for what they call ethical algorithms, which are built to balance the accuracy of the model, for, say, assessing credit risk, with other desirable goals.25 For example, the developer could build the algorithm so that it has low error rates in identifying creditworthy borrowers and the error rate for one racial group is not disproportionately higher than that for another.\n\nAt present, much of the auditing of algorithms occurs in an ad hoc way after the algorithm has been put into place and has had the opportunity to have a disparate impact.26 A well-known example is the Apple Card: gender discrimination was alleged by some customers about the algorithms used by Goldman Sachs, the issuer of the card, after the card was deployed.27 Who should do the testing is an open question. A report from the Brookings Institution's Artificial Intelligence and Emerging Technologies Initiative recommends that the developer test the algorithm for disparate impact. Companies that use such algorithms could engage independent third parties to evaluate them, with appropriate restrictions to guard the firms' intellectual property. Regulators may also have to play a larger role in testing algorithms.\n\nSince adequate data sets are needed for testing, the rules pertaining to data collections should be reviewed. The Equal Credit Opportunity Act restricts creditors from discriminating in credit transactions against credit applicants on any prohibited basis, including race and gender. The collection of data on applicants' personal characteristics for home purchase and refinance loan transactions is required and the data must be publicly disclosed. The Dodd-Frank Act also requires small business lenders to collect and report race and gender data to federal regulators. But for other nonmortgage loans, creditors' collection of these data is prohibited except for the creditors' own use to conduct a limited self-test of their compliance with the law.8 The original prohibition was based on the notion that the data might be used in discriminatory ways. But experience with the collection of mortgage data suggests that this has not been the case and that the data have made it easier to monitor compliance and enforce the law. Extending mandatory data collection of personal characteristics for nonmortgage credit applicants may allow for better testing for compliance. But it would also entail costs for creditors that could partially be passed on to borrowers. With more entities offering credit, it is time to undertake a new review of the costs and benefits of data collection for different types of nonmortgage credit.29\n\nFifth, a rethinking of the regulatory framework is needed to ensure that the financial innovations led by digitalization are a net positive. Such innovations do not reduce the need for risk management, financial regulation and supervision, and good governance, although the form each takes is likely to be different than what has been effective in the past. Existing regulatory and supervisory structures will need to adapt to keep up with the new ways that financial services are being delivered and the new players delivering them. Under the principle, \"If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck,\" a regulatory approach that shifts the focus from the type of institution offering the service to the type of activity would likely be more effective in fostering the stability of the financial system and limiting regulatory arbitrage. The extension of some regulations to new service providers is already occurring; for example, bigtech firms' payments services are subject to know your customer rules.\n\nBut the entry of fintech and bigtech providers of financial services also raises new issues. Data produced by bigtech firms are what make it attractive for these firms to enter into financial services in the first place. But their ability to control the data also makes it harder for other firms to enter the market, thus limiting competition. There are different approaches to regulating data usage in order to limit the market power of bigtech firm entrants and facilitate market contestability without stifling entry.30 Two examples are the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation and the open banking regulations, which are in place in many countries. Both approaches allow certain data to be shared directly with third parties but place restrictions on the type of data and the kinds of authorizations that need to be garnered in order to allow for data sharing.\n\nThe ability of bigtech firms to produce and to capture the benefits of big data depends on network effects. Benefits to users grow when there are more users of the services, and as the number of users increases, more data are produced that can be garnered for use by the bigtech firm for the development of new services, pricing, and marketing. For example, a firm that may have begun as an e-commerce firm may find it beneficial to offer payment services as an adjunct to generate more e-commerce business, but the transactions data can then be used to offer more services.31 Once a bigtech firm is well established, it becomes more difficult for other firms to enter. This adds concerns about market power to data privacy concerns. Issues of pricing, cross-subsidization, product tying, and other anti-competitive practices that lead to less innovation, not more, deserve increased attention from financial services regulators.\n\nWith the entry of bigtech and fintech firms into financial services, the public policy approach will need to change to include a more holistic blending of financial regulation, antitrust policy, and data privacy regulation. There will need to be cooperation across these types of regulators within each country, and this may entail creating structures that allow for more formal or systematic coordination across different types of regulators. The growth of digitalization also calls for a modernization of the antitrust laws and policy, which is occurring in several countries.32 The global nature of the bigtech firms entering financial services means that effective international coordination among regulators and supervisors through the Financial Stability Board and other international entities will be critical to ensuring that the benefits can be captured and the risks managed.33\n\nFinally, it is important that regulators and those responsible for enforcing fair lending and consumer protections increase their expertise regarding the technologies being used in the marketplace. This is beginning to happen as financial system regulators and supervisors are starting to use big data and data analytics to improve their own assessments of banking and financial stability risks and to understand trends in the industry more generally. Several countries have set up innovation hubs and regulatory sandboxes to encourage innovation in financial services. The Fed has been researching new technologies and innovations in financial services for some time. The System Payments Researchers, co-chaired by Fumiko Hayashi of the Kansas City Fed and Bob Hunt of the Philadelphia Fed, are producing research on fintechs and digital currencies. The Board of Governors has set up a technology lab where researchers across the System are building and testing a range of distributed ledger platforms to understand their potential benefits and tradeoffs.34 The Boston Fed is working with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to experiment with digital currency technologies, and the New York Fed has established an innovation center, in partnership with the Bank for International Settlements, to identify and develop in-depth insights into critical trends and financial technology of relevance to central banks.35\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, fintech, bigtech, algorithms, machine learning, and digitalization are rapidly transforming the financial services industry. These innovations hold the promise of increasing financial inclusion for the benefit of individuals, businesses, and the overall macroeconomy. But as with past innovations, they also present challenges that will need to be addressed to ensure that the promised benefits are attained and risks are well managed."

            "content": "I thank Paul Mizen and the Money Macro and Finance Society for the opportunity to speak at your 6th Annual Conference. In my brief remarks today, I will give an overview of the changes to our monetary policy strategy that the Federal Open Market Committee, the monetary policymaking body within the Federal Reserve, recently announced and discuss their implications for monetary policy going forward. As always, the views I will present are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nRevised Statement on Long-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy\n\nIn early 2019, the FOMC began a review of our framework for setting monetary policy – the strategy, tools, and communications we use in setting policy in pursuit of the monetary policy goals given to us by the U.S. Congress. These goals are maximum employment, price stability, and moderate long-term interest rates. When prices are stable and the economy is at full employment, long-term interest rates are typically at moderate levels. So it is often said that the U.S. Congress has given the Fed a dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment. The framework review was informed by our experience during and after the Great Recession, by economic theory and empirical analysis, and by consultations with academic researchers and practitioners at research conferences. It was also informed by conversations with the public at large, through a series of Fed Listens events held across the country.1 The main conclusions of the review are captured in our revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which the FOMC approved this August.\n\nThe framework review was undertaken in light of changes in the economic environment that have emerged since the FOMC's first strategy statement was published in 2012. One change with important implications for monetary policy is the decline in the U.S. and other advanced economies in the general level of interest rates consistent with sustainable growth and price stability. This decline reflects several factors, including the aging of the population, changes in risk preferences, and slower productivity growth. It means that the level of the federal funds rate, the policy rate in the U.S., consistent with maximum employment and price stability is now lower than it has been in the past. This means that during economic downturns, it is now more likely that the fed funds rate will be constrained by its effective lower bound, and the FOMC will have less policy space to support the economy using its traditional policy tool. This constraint, being understood by households, businesses, and financial markets, imparts a downward bias to inflation and inflation expectations, and so increases the downside risks to achieving our policy goals.\n\nAnother change in the economic environment with implications for monetary policy pertains to inflation dynamics. Resource slack in the labor market and in product markets has become less correlated with actual inflation than in the past, and inflation expectations now play a larger role in determining inflation outcomes. This means it is even more important that inflation expectations remain well anchored at levels consistent with our longer-run inflation goal. If expectations move below these levels, then it is more likely that inflation will run below our goal, which would then result in even less policy space in a low-interest-rate environment.\n\nThese changes in the economic environment warranted asking ourselves whether there were revisions to our monetary policy strategy that would make it more effective in promoting our policy goals. The review led us to conclude that the answer was yes. And we made changes to our approach to both the inflation goal and the employment goal, which are summarized in our revised strategy statement.\n\nRevised Strategy Statement: Inflation Goal\n\nRegarding our approach to inflation, the first thing I want to note is something that did not change. The FOMC has reaffirmed the explicit inflation target first announced in 2012, namely, that a longer-run inflation rate of 2 percent is most consistent with our statutory mandate. But our strategy statement is now more explicit about how we will go about achieving this inflation goal. In particular, after periods in which inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, we will likely aim to have inflation run moderately above 2 percent for some time. Doing so will help anchor inflation expectations, a main determinant of actual inflation, at levels consistent with 2 percent inflation.\n\nThis new language is a stronger statement than we have made in the past as we have struggled to effectively convey that the longer-run goal of 2 percent should not be interpreted as a ceiling. In the past, many of us on the FOMC have indicated that we would be comfortable with inflation running above 2 percent for a time after it has run low for some time – a type of opportunistic reinflation. But now we are going to be deliberate rather than opportunistic. As the revised strategy indicates, after inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, not only will we tolerate serendipitous shocks that move inflation above 2 percent, but we will likely set policy with the intention of moving inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time. The implication is that monetary policy will be somewhat more accommodative than in the past when inflation has been running persistently low in order to reach our longer-run inflation goal.\n\nRevised Strategy Statement: Employment Goal\n\nRegarding our employment goal, I view the changes we made in the strategy statement as an acknowledgment of the uncertainty around assessments of the level of maximum employment and a clarification to our approach to achieving this goal. This is consistent with something I have advocated for some time: that policy communications should acknowledge uncertainty.2In the recent expansion, we saw that employment growth could be stronger and the unemployment rate lower without generating inflation than one would have thought possible based on past decades of experience. Over the expansion, it took time to learn about these structural changes in the economy, and as the FOMC learned, its assessments of the longer-run unemployment rate came down significantly over time. Unfortunately, this time-to-learn, combined with the previous strategy statement's references to \"deviations\" of employment from maximum employment, has been misinterpreted by some as suggesting that the FOMC, at times, takes deliberate policy action to bring employment down independently of our inflation goal. This is not the case. The benefits of a strong labor market in fostering economic inclusion are clear.\n\nChanges in the economy underscore the difficulties in using the Phillips curve model to forecast inflation or to assess maximum employment in real time. The revised strategy statement clarifies that in the absence of inflationary pressures or risks to financial stability, strong employment is not a concern and monetary policy will not react to it. This approach is consistent with the recent behavior of the FOMC. Estimates of simple monetary policy rules by the Cleveland Fed staff indicate that FOMC participants put less weight on the unemployment rate in determining the appropriate policy path in the last two years of the most recent economic expansion than they did earlier in the expansion.3\n\nAn Area for Further Work: Systematic Policymaking and Communications\n\nThe new strategy statement will guide FOMC monetary policy decisions both during and beyond the pandemic. But bringing the new strategy to bear in our policymaking is a work in progress. So I will end my remarks by discussing two areas for further work: first, systematic policymaking and communications, and second, the nexus between financial stability and monetary policy.\n\nOur September FOMC statement was the first to incorporate the new strategy.4 The statement indicated that because inflation has been running persistently low, we will be aiming to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time and that we expect to maintain the current funds rate target range of 0 to 1/4 percent until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with our assessment of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. As of September, the forecasts of FOMC participants, as indicated in the Summary of Economic Projections, showed that the majority thought it would not be appropriate to raise rates until after 2023.5 However, importantly, the guidance is based on the state of the economy and not on calendar dates. The economy could evolve so that the stipulated inflation and employment conditions are achieved earlier or later than currently projected, in which case, the anticipated policy path would appropriately adjust.\n\nI strongly believe that clear policy communications are an important part of effective monetary policymaking. When the public has a better understanding of the goals and rationale for monetary policy decisions, they are better able to hold policymakers accountable for their actions. Clear communication also makes monetary policy itself more effective by providing the public with information about the economic outlook and aligning the public's expectations about future policy actions. When households, businesses, and investors have a better sense of how monetary policy is likely to change conditional on the outlook, they can make better economic and financial decisions.\n\nEven though the September statement incorporated some aspects of the new strategy, Fed watchers and others have asked for more context about what indicators the FOMC would be using to assess whether labor market conditions are consistent with maximum employment, and how far above 2 percent would the FOMC aim for inflation to be and for how long. While the context has changed, similar kinds of questions about how the FOMC assessed whether or not its goals had been met were asked when we operated under the previous strategy as well. Work still needs to be done to ensure that our policy decisions are systematically guided by our outlook and risks around the outlook and that our policy communications convey a good sense of the FOMC's reaction function, especially now under the new strategy.\n\nThe revised strategy leans heavily on the relationship between inflation expectations, inflation, and the ability of monetary policy to influence both, but there is still much to learn about inflation dynamics and inflation expectations. The benefits of the move to a type of make-up strategy for inflation – that is, running policy to achieve inflation somewhat above 2 percent for a time after it has run persistently low – depend on our ability to communicate that we have shifted to and will pursue this new strategy and our ability to explain clearly how the new strategy differs from the old.\n\nRecent research from the Cleveland Fed's Center for Inflation Research suggests that we may have further to go on this score. Center researchers used the Cleveland Fed's daily national survey of consumers to examine the effect of Chair Jay Powell's announcement of the new strategy on households' understanding of monetary policy and their expectations of inflation.6 They obtained four interesting results.\n\nFirst, while there was a surge in news coverage about monetary policy around the time of the Chair's speech, there was only a small increase in the number of respondents who reported having heard news about monetary policy; most people did not recall anything.\n\nSecond, among the small group who had heard news, there was a sense that something had changed, but little recognition of what had changed in the approach to monetary policy.\n\nThird, there is considerable confusion about our goals: when presented with a list of options, more respondents said that the Fed sets monetary policy with the aim of maintaining a strong dollar or keeping interest rates low to reduce the government's cost of borrowing than said we set policy to promote maximum employment and price stability.\n\nFourth, when some individuals were selected at random and given information about average inflation targeting, their expectations about future inflation over the next five years were no different than those of individuals who were, instead, given information about traditional inflation targeting.\n\nOf course, it is important to remember that some of the gains from the new strategy will likely come from the expectations and actions of sophisticated financial market participants who closely follow monetary policy, thereby helping policy to transmit throughout the economy. It is also true that the survey was taken over only a short period following the announcement, and as anyone who has ever taught or been a student knows, it takes time to master new material. Still, the results do suggest that more work needs to be done on policy communications to ensure that households will understand the policy strategy and then incorporate it into their expectations and actions.\n\nAnother Area for Further Work: Financial Stability and Monetary Policy\n\nA second area that needs further work is understanding the nexus between monetary policy and financial stability. Our revised strategy statement explicitly acknowledges that sustainably achieving maximum employment and price stability depends on a stable financial system. As part of its framework review, the FOMC considered the interactions between financial stability and monetary policy, particularly in the current environment of low neutral interest rates.7 While monetary policy that leads to a stable macroeconomy encourages financial stability, it is also possible that in an environment with low neutral rates, a persistently accommodative monetary policy could, in some cases, increase the vulnerabilities of the financial system by encouraging higher levels of borrowing and financial leverage, increased valuation pressures, and search-for-yield behavior. How best to approach the nexus between monetary policy and financial stability in a low-interest-rate world deserves more consideration.\n\nAs indicated in the minutes of the January 2020 FOMC meeting, in discussing the framework, most FOMC participants agreed that supervisory, regulatory, and macroprudential tools, including the countercyclical capital buffer and stress tests, should be the primary way to address financial stability risks rather than using monetary policy. But in the U.S., there are few countercyclical tools and they are not designed to address vulnerabilities outside of the banking system. Therefore, there may be certain circumstances where monetary policy may need to be adjusted in order to mitigate risks to financial stability. But when and how to do that needs further study. In addition, more study is needed of the tradeoffs and complementarities among our three sets of relevant policies: monetary policy, macroprudential policy, and microprudential policy, which includes tools, such as capital and liquidity requirements, that work throughout the business and financial cycles. As our framework review did with monetary policy, the implications of a low-interest-rate world for both macroprudential policy and microprudential policy should be considered."

            "content": "It is a pleasure to be with you today.* Let me start by congratulating Joe Roman on his upcoming retirement as president and CEO of the Greater Cleveland Partnership. Joe was one of the first civic leaders I met when I moved to Cleveland in 2014. From our very first conversation, it was clear that Joe was passionate about Cleveland. Over his entire career, he has been a strong advocate for our region and a strong adherent to the view that by working together, business, civic, and community leaders can get important things done. I am sure that Joe will show that same dedication and optimism in his new endeavors and I wish him well.\n\nWishing someone well has taken on new meaning this year. The coronavirus pandemic is a global public health crisis that has inflicted pain and hardship on people all over the world. The pandemic was an unprecedented shock to the economy – the largest in most of our lifetimes.\n\nIn March, all but essential economic activity shut down when the country took aggressive social distancing measures to limit the spread of the virus and to buy some time for the healthcare system to increase its capacity to care for the sick, learn more about the virus itself, and develop testing and treatments.\n\n[FIGURE 1] In the second quarter of the year, real output declined at a rate of about 31 percent measured on an annual basis. In just the two months of March and April, payroll jobs dropped by 22 million. That is about the same number of jobs that the economy had added over the entire recent expansion that lasted over 10 years. The unemployment rate, which had been at a fifty-year low of 3.5 percent in February, spiked to 14.7 percent in April. And despite supply disruptions, inflation moved down with the drop in demand.\n\nIn May, as public health statistics began to improve, many parts of the country began to relax some of their stay-at-home restrictions, and the economy began to reopen. Activity, hiring, and inflation picked up – all good news. But there is quite a bit of difference across sectors.\n\nInterest-rate-sensitive sectors, like housing and autos, have seen the sharpest rebounds. Other sectors, especially service sectors like travel, hospitality, and leisure, are still very depressed.\n\n[FIGURE 2] September's jobs report shows a continued pickup in hiring, although at a slower pace than in the summer. We have made up a little over half of the jobs lost in March and April as people returned to work from temporary furlough. But that still means we are down almost 11 million jobs from February's level. The unemployment rate fell to just under 8 percent (7.9 percent) in September, better than expected. But part of that drop reflects a drop in labor force participation, which remains well below February's level.\n\n[FIGURE 3] It is clear that the adverse effects of the pandemic have not been evenly distributed. They have been borne by the most vulnerable in our economy: lower-income and minority workers and communities; those who do not have the opportunity to work from home; those who do not live in areas with reliable telecommunications and internet services or access to adequate healthcare; and the smaller of small businesses.\n\nRehiring by employers has been slower for lower-income workers than for higher-income workers – at the national level and in Cuyahoga county.\n\n[FIGURE 4] Over the course of the reopening, there has been less progress on reducing the unemployment rate for minorities than for whites and for those with lower levels of education compared with those with higher levels.\n\nSo while the economy is recovering, it is still in a deep hole. Employment is about where it was in the middle of 2015 – so we've lost more than five years of job growth. Even if growth rebounds in the third quarter at the same pace at which it contracted in the second quarter, the level of output will be about where it was at the end of 2017, so the economy will have lost almost three years of output growth.\n\nBoth monetary policy and fiscal policy reacted swiftly and strongly to support the economy thus far. We have in place very accommodative monetary policy: the fed funds rate is at its effective lower bound, we are purchasing Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, we have a number of liquidity and lending facilities in place to ensure that markets continue to function and that credit continues to flow to businesses and households, and we have temporarily relaxed some of the regulatory requirements on banks so they have greater capacity to lend.\n\nFiscal policy actions have included grants to individuals, certain businesses hit hardest by the pandemic, and states and municipalities; expanded unemployment benefits; and the Paycheck Protection Program, which offered loans to small businesses that became grants for firms maintaining their payrolls.\n\nIt will take some time to move from the somewhat fragile, disparate recovery we have now to a more sustainable, broader recovery. The path of the recovery is likely to be bumpy, with some fits and starts and uneven progress. It will take time for workers who have lost jobs to find new ones, either at another firm in their current industry or in a new industry after they retrain. The commercial real estate market has been particularly hard hit. There was already a trend toward online shopping and remote work; the pandemic has greatly accelerated that trend. The structural changes in the commercial real estate market will take some time to sort out.\n\nProvided we continue to make progress on controlling the virus, activity and hiring will continue to expand. By the end of this year, I expect that output will still be somewhat below its level at the end of last year; that the unemployment rate will remain in the high single digits; and that inflation will be well below our longer-run 2 percent goal. The recovery should continue over the next couple of years provided it is supported by very accommodative monetary policy and further fiscal policy actions. Fiscal policy in the form of aid to households and small businesses most affected by the pandemic and to states and municipal governments, and increased investment in testing, contract tracing, treatment, and vaccine development would provide important support for the recovery.\n\nOf course, there is a lot of uncertainty around the forecast. It is highly dependent on the virus and our actions to control its spread. It is easy to think of downside scenarios. Many of our contacts in the region, across all sectors, tell us that uncertainty about the course of the virus and about whether there is going to be additional fiscal support is clouding their outlook and holding back larger investments.\n\nBut there are upside scenarios as well. Development of a safe and effective vaccine that people have confidence in and that can be widely distributed fairly quickly would be very positive for the outlook. In addition, we should not discount the fact that the pickup in activity we have seen so far has exceeded expectations. It is a good reminder that we should never count out the resiliency of the U.S. economy and the American people.\n\n* The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee."

As you may know, Doris is a member of the board of directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. In the best of times, the valuable insights provided by Doris, her fellow directors, and all of our contacts help us assess economic conditions and formulate monetary policy. But these are not the best of times. And I cannot overstate the importance of the information that Doris and our other contacts are providing – real-time, on-the-ground reconnaissance on how businesses and households are faring during the evolving pandemic. While the outlook remains uncertain, one thing I am certain of is that we have a better understanding of the economic impacts of the pandemic because of the public service of our directors and contacts. So, thank you, Doris.\n\nIt is clear that the adverse effects of the pandemic have not been evenly distributed. They have been borne by the most vulnerable in our economy: lower-income and minority workers and communities; those who do not have the opportunity to work from home; those who do not live in areas with reliable telecommunications and internet services or access to adequate healthcare; and the smaller of small businesses.1 Indeed, the results from a recent Fed survey show that between March and July, a larger percentage of low-income workers, less educated workers, and Black and Hispanic workers were laid off compared to higher-income, more educated, and white workers. Rehiring by employers has been slower for lower-income workers than for higher-income workers.2 In addition, from February to April, the number of active small business owners dropped by 3.3 million, a record 22 percent decline.3 Compared to small firms overall, Black-owned businesses have been twice as likely to close and Hispanic-owned businesses have been one-and-a-half times as likely to close. It is distressing to see the disparate impact of the pandemic, but the differences in economic outcomes did not start with COVID-19. There were already long-standing economic disparities in our economy.\n\nIn my remarks today, I will step back from the effects of the pandemic per se and examine the differences in economic opportunity that so many in America still experience at every phase of their lives. I will conclude with some thoughts, based on the research, on where we might focus in order to reduce these gaps and promote economic inclusion. As always, the views I will present are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nWhy Economic Inclusion Matters\n\nThe Federal Reserve System's mission is to promote a healthy economy and stable financial system in the United States. Our monetary policy decisions, our actions as supervisors and regulators of banks, our role in the payments system, and our efforts to promote community development in low- and moderate-income areas all contribute to achieving a well-functioning economy and financial system in which everyone can participate. Opportunity and inclusion are important for achieving a strong economy, and the recently announced revision to the Fed's strategy for setting monetary policy explicitly states that we view maximum employment, one part of our statutory mandate, as a broad-based and inclusive goal.\n\nUnfortunately, today, the U.S. economy does not offer the same opportunities to all. There are racial disparities in educational attainment, labor market outcomes, and access to credit. People born into areas of concentrated poverty or predominantly minority areas are disadvantaged over their entire lifetimes, and so are their children. Unless actions are taken to promote an inclusive economy – one in which people have the chance to move themselves and their families out of poverty, one in which systemic racism does not limit opportunities, and one in which all people can fully participate – the U.S. economy will not be able to live up to its full potential and the country will suffer.\n\nUpward Mobility\n\n[FIGURE 1] All parents want to know that their children will be better off financially than they are. An important part of the American Dream is the idea that anyone can climb up the ladder through hard work and perseverance. But upward mobility – the probability that a child will be better off economically than his or her parents – has fallen sharply in the U.S. since World War II. At last year's Cleveland Fed Policy Summit, Harvard professor Raj Chetty presented some of his seminal research on income mobility.4 Around 90 percent of children born in 1940 earned more at age 30 than their parents did.5 By the mid-1980s, only about 50 percent did. And, although not shown in the figure, the largest declines have been in the middle class.\n\n[FIGURE 2] Many factors have contributed to this decline. One contributor is rising income inequality, which leads to advantages in terms of education and other social factors for those in the higher-income groups compared to those in the bottom. Since the 1960s, the median level of income, adjusted for inflation, has risen over time, from about $48,000 in 1967 to about $69,000 in 2019. But those in the top 10 percent of the income distribution have enjoyed sharper gains than those in the bottom 10 percent. The U.S. has one of the lowest rates of intergenerational mobility among advanced economies and more pronounced income inequality.6\n\n[FIGURE 3] To get the full picture, we need to look at disaggregated data.7 Research by Chetty and his co-authors shows that upward mobility depends not only on the family's characteristics but also on neighborhood characteristics such as neighborhood income, racial integration, the quality of schools, and access to social services.8 On this map, areas of relatively high intergenerational mobility are shown in shades of blue-green. Children who grew up in these places earn higher average income in their mid-thirties than their parents did at the same age. Shades of red indicate areas of low intergenerational mobility: places where children have not progressed very far in terms of income relative to their parents. An important insight is that even areas with fairly good economies in terms of stronger output growth and job growth, like some places in the South, have not necessarily produced high levels of upward mobility for the children growing up there. Strong economic factors certainly help, but they are not a panacea.\n\n[FIGURE 4] In Pittsburgh, mobility differs quite a bit across the city, and if you were to drill down even further, you would see differences even within neighborhoods.\n\nIn fact, research shows that moving a child from a low-mobility neighborhood to a high-mobility neighborhood can have profound effects on his or her future economic outcomes.9 This is true not only in the U.S., but also in countries, like Australia, where income inequality is lower than it is here.10\n\nSo place matters. But so does race. Research by Chetty and co-authors has found that there is a gap in earnings between Black males and white males even if their parents were at the same income level and they grew up in the same neighborhood.11\n\n[FIGURE 5] The research also shows that even conditional on where a child grows up, Blacks have a significantly lower chance of moving up in the income distribution than whites or Hispanics and a higher chance of moving down in the distribution. Strikingly, Blacks who happen to have been born to parents in the highest income quintile are almost as likely to move down to the lowest quintile as to stay in the highest one.\n\nGaps in Income and Net Worth\n\n[FIGURE 6] According to the most recent Federal Reserve triennial Survey of Consumer Finances, in 2016, median income for white households was about 1-3/4 times that of Black families and 1-1/2 times that of Hispanic families.12 Earnings are an important driver of family net worth (financial and nonfinancial assets, like homes and autos, minus debt).13 Racial gaps in net worth are much larger than income gaps: the median net worth of white families in 2016 was almost 10 times as high as that of Black families and about 8 times as high as that of Hispanic families.14 These gaps are not a recent phenomenon: they have been around for decades.\n\nGaps over the Life Cycle: Early Years\n\n[FIGURE7]Many factors play a role in these gaps in income and net worth; in fact, if we look over a person's life, racial gaps exist every step of the way. From the beginning of life, Black children are about twice as likely as either white or Hispanic children to not reach their first birthday. These gaps in infant mortality have existed over many years, and even if you control for the educational level of the mother, the gaps remain.\n\nBlack and white children tend to grow up in different neighborhoods, and this racial stratification leads to other risks that can affect longer-term economic outcomes. One example is children's lead toxicity – the amount of lead in one's bloodstream – which at elevated levels causes brain damage and has significant adverse effects on a child's ability to learn. A study of Chicago neighborhoods found that even though lead poisoning in children has fallen significantly over time as a result of public health policy, it is still the case that those neighborhoods with the highest levels of toxicity are predominantly Black neighborhoods.15\n\n[FIGURE 8] While lead poses one significant disadvantage to learning, lack of internet connectivity poses another. Well before the coronavirus pandemic, access to the internet was an important avenue for education, as well as for healthcare and job access. Usage of broadband at home is comparatively higher for whites, those with higher incomes, and those in urban and suburban areas.16 Blacks and Hispanics are less likely to have a computer or broadband at home than whites, and when they do have a computer, they are less likely to have broadband service at home. This puts Black and Hispanic families at a disadvantage, especially now, given the pandemic, when remote in-home learning is the norm rather than the exception.\n\n[FIGURE 9] In fact, during the spring, students in lower-income areas completed significantly fewer math courses online than those in higher-income areas.18 If these differences continue, there could be lasting effects on students' earning potential throughout their lives, leading to further inequality.\n\nGaps over the Life Cycle: College Ages\n\n[FIGURE 10] Indeed, the accumulation of human capital via education is an important path to economic inclusion and opportunity, resulting in better economic outcomes for individuals, households, and the country at large. The median income for families whose head has a college degree is more than twice as high as that of a family whose head has only a high school diploma. Similarly, median net worth is considerably higher for those with a college degree.19\n\n[FIGURE 11] While our workforce as a whole has become more educated over time, educational attainment differs by race, as does the likelihood of completing a degree. In the Fed's Survey of Consumer Finances, 39 percent of white heads of household held a college degree compared to 23 percent of Black heads of household and 17 percent of Hispanic heads of household.20\n\nCost can be an important barrier to entering college, particularly for those coming from lower-income families. The average cost of tuition and fees at four-year institutions is now over $16,000 a year, and adjusted for inflation, it has more than doubled over the past three decades.21 According to the Fed's survey on economic well-being, as of late 2019, over 40 percent of those who went to college had taken on debt for their education and about half of those people still owe money on this debt.22 New York Fed analysis shows that compared to borrowers in majority white areas, those in majority Black areas have higher student loan balances and those in majority Black and majority Hispanic areas have higher rates of default on those loans.23 These defaults can follow a person over time, making it harder to access credit in the future.\n\n[FIGURE 12] For those students who do find the financial means to enter college, the likelihood of completing a degree differs by type of institution and by race. The completion rates have remained particularly low at for-profit institutions. At both public and nonprofit private institutions, the graduation rates for whites, Hispanics, and Asians have all risen over time, but those of Blacks remain well below those of these other groups and have shown no progress over time.\n\nSatisfaction with college also varies by race. About 70 percent of white recipients of bachelor's degrees felt that their education was worth the cost, but only slightly more than half of Black recipients did.24\n\nGaps over the Life Cycle: Earning Years – Labor Markets and Credit Markets\n\n[FIGURE 13] The differences in educational attainment across races follow people as they enter the workforce. There are significant racial disparities in labor market outcomes. Unemployment rates among Blacks and Hispanics have been chronically above those of whites and Asians, and Blacks and Hispanics are more likely to lose their jobs during recessions. Although some progress had been made over the long economic expansion that ended in February, racial disparities remained. Research from Fed economists indicates that while lower educational attainment explains much of the difference in the unemployment experience of Hispanics, this is not true for the Black-white gap. In fact, observable characteristics, like education, age, or marital status, cannot fully account for the higher and more cyclical unemployment of Blacks relative to whites.25\n\n[FIGURE 14] These long-standing labor market disparities spill over in other ways that limit Black households' ability to fully participate in the economy. Worse and more volatile labor market outcomes make it harder for nonwhite families to build assets and achieve sound financial health.\n\nFor those families that are able to get a mortgage, job insecurity makes the household less financially resilient and raises the risk that the household might fall behind on its mortgage or even default, putting the family's longer-term financial health at risk. Housing continues to be an important way for families to build wealth, but even controlling for income and other factors related to creditworthiness, there is a rising gap between the homeownership rate of whites and Blacks. This indicates that systemic racial differences in access to credit have persisted well after enactment of fair housing and lending legislation in the 1970s meant to address the scourge of redlining and discrimination in credit markets.26,27\n\n[FIGURE 15] In terms of access to financial services, Blacks and Hispanics are less likely to have a bank account and more likely to rely on alternative financial services such as money orders and check cashing services than whites. Being unbanked or underbanked makes it harder for these families to build a credit history.28\n\nThe use of bank financing by small businesses also varies significantly with the race of the owner. According to the Fed's Small Business Credit Survey, compared to small firms with white ownership, those with Black ownership were half as likely to have obtained financing from a bank in the past five years, relying more on online lenders, which, according to survey respondents, provide less satisfactory service.29\n\nMuch Needs to Be Done to Address Economic Disparities and Promote Economic Inclusion\n\nEliminating racial and economic disparities, which have lasted over generations, is no easy task. It will take concerted action at the individual, professional, and institutional level to change structures and systems that perpetuate these gaps. But this work needs to be done so that all people have the opportunity to fully participate in the U.S. economy. The research I discussed today points to four priorities.\n\nInvesting in neighborhoods and communities must be a priority. Place matters and at smaller geographical divisions than might be expected. Localized, neighborhood-based community development work and investments aimed at reducing poverty rates, improving school quality and housing choices, and revitalizing neighborhoods can offer families more stability. Focusing on improving neighborhoods can have results. In 2016, the Cleveland Fed convened all those interested in contributing to the efforts of the Lead Safe Cleveland Coalition and the city of Cleveland in preventing lead poisoning in the city.30 And last July, Cleveland City Council passed an important piece of legislation requiring, among other provisions, that landlords pay for private inspections and certifications that their occupied units are lead-safe, with penalties for noncompliance.31\n\nClosing the digital divide must be a priority. Among communities with a population of 100,000 or more, the city of Cleveland has among the lowest home broadband access in the nation.32 Business leaders through the Greater Cleveland Partnership are working with the city's governmental leaders and other organizations to ensure that all residents in the Greater Cleveland area have access to in-home high-quality broadband and devices to access it. Similar work is being done in Pittsburgh by the Allegheny Conference on Community Development.\n\nIncreasing access to high-quality education at all levels must be a priority. Education is a significant avenue to economic opportunity. Recognizing that a higher-skilled workforce benefits communities, Ohio has a project underway to try to increase educational attainment.33 Issues with cost and preparation need to be addressed. Respondents to recent Fed surveys said that the cost of college and family obligations are among the reasons they did not complete their degree.34 Low grades were also cited as a reason. Adequate preparation for college has an impact on completion rates and likely on satisfaction. Research is increasingly pointing to the fact that children who fall behind have difficulty catching up.35 Tutoring and mentoring throughout a student's elementary, high school, and college years can support a student through to earning a degree.\n\nIn addition, financial literacy should be included in elementary and high school curricula. Such courses will give students the skills to evaluate the various options for financing their education, determine which types of educational institutions offer a good return on their investment, and lead to better savings, investment, and credit decisions throughout their lives. The Cleveland Fed actively supports economic and financial literacy programs, and this year we will be hosting the Council of Economic Education's National Personal Finance Challenge, a competition for high school students that encourages development of financial management skills.\n\nEliminating systemic inequities in access to credit and financial services must be a priority. The racial disparities that still exist in banking and credit markets mean institutions need to reassess their business practices and change those that are found to be sources of such disparities. Similarly, policymakers need to strengthen policies meant to address such inequities. The Federal Reserve is currently working to strengthen the regulations that implement the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). The act, passed in 1977, was intended to help address concerns about disinvestment in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods and the impact of illegal practices such as redlining. The CRA reaffirmed that insured depository institutions must serve the communities in which they are chartered to do business. Evidence shows that the CRA has provided tangible benefits to low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. With the many changes in banking since the 1970s, it is time to modernize the regulation so that it can help to address systemic inequities in access to financial services and credit for low- and moderate-income and minority communities and individuals.36\n\nOf course, much more needs to be done. But if we have focus, perseverance, and a shared commitment to eliminating systemic racism and increasing the breadth of economic opportunity, then together we can ensure that instead of being a pipe dream for some, the American Dream is available to all."

            "content": "It is a great pleasure being with you today as part of the 20th Anniversary Chicago Payments Symposium. Over the last two decades, this symposium has established itself as a valuable forum at which those interested in the payments system can gather to learn and share ideas. In recent years, the symposium has fostered important conversations between industry practitioners and policymakers. Those conversations have helped inform the Federal Reserve System's initiative to improve and modernize the U.S. payments system. That work is ongoing and has reached important milestones this year, despite the pandemic. Today, I will discuss some of the effects the pandemic has had on the U.S. payments system and update you on some of our ongoing efforts to modernize the payments system. As always, the views I'll express are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nI know I do not need to tell this audience that the payments system is a crucial part of the infrastructure of the U.S. and a well-functioning and secure payments system is vital for a sound economy. As is true of pretty much every aspect of life this year, the pandemic has affected the payments business, including payment patterns and volumes. The most important thing to recognize is that the U.S. payments system has been weathering the pandemic without significant disruptions. This has taken the hard work of many people in both the public sector and the private sector. Many of these workers were deemed to be essential, and we owe them all our deep gratitude for their dedication and public service. Because of the vital role played by the payments system, priorities had to change to meet the challenges posed by the pandemic. At the same time, progress continued on important projects that have longer-run consequences for the payments system.\n\nThere will be many lessons to take away from the current pandemic situation; two seem particularly relevant to the payments work in which we are all engaged. First, although it is safe to say no one anticipated an event quite like the pandemic, the industry's forethought, investment, and preparation to ensure that the payments system would be resilient to extreme scenarios has paid off greatly. It has allowed us to avoid a collapse of the payments system – an event that would have made what was already a grave situation much, much worse. One big takeaway is that once we get through the current pandemic, making necessary investments to ensure that the U.S. payments system remains resilient in the face of extreme stress events will need to remain a priority.\n\nAnother key lesson is that having the right technology in place can make a big difference in being able to address the challenges posed in an environment of rapid change in payments behavior. Industry participants may need to rethink their payments technology investment strategy once we are through the pandemic. The changes we have seen in customers' payment behavior since February have happened quickly. The spread of COVID-19 heightened the reliance of businesses and individuals on digital services and faster connectivity, as many employees began to work from home and consumers turned to online shopping. This is a global pandemic, and demand for consumer-to-consumer and cross-border payments has risen, as people want to send and receive payments in support of family and friends. Some payments technology is more resilient, scalable, and adaptable to such rapid changes in user behavior and volume. Some industry participants note that cloud technologies are inherently more scalable and adaptable, and early adopters of the cloud are likely better positioned during these times compared to those operating on mainframes.1 It would be wrong to say that the pandemic has been the catalyst for payments system modernization: the Federal Reserve Banks have been assessing our payments technology for some time. We are investing in cloud technology and have platform modernization initiatives at various stages of completion across nearly all of our business lines. However, the pandemic does underscore the need to have a technology strategy that will meet the needs of the future. Industry efforts to replace decades-old core banking systems with more flexible, resilient, and cloud-friendly platforms, and to integrate the old with the new along the way, may need to be accelerated to ensure that we are prepared for the future.\n\nLet me review some of the changes we have seen in payments activity during the pandemic.\n\nPayments Volume and Mix\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic and actions taken to contain its spread have had tremendous effects on households, businesses, and communities across America and on economic activity. So it is not surprising that the pandemic has had significant effects on the types and volumes of payments flowing through the payments system. In March, the country took aggressive social-distancing measures to limit the spread of the virus and to buy some time for the healthcare system to increase its capacity to care for the sick, learn more about the virus itself, and develop testing and treatments. In March and April, with stay-at-home orders issued by state and local authorities in full swing, the number of checks processed by the Reserve Banks declined substantially.\n\nBut at the same time, global demand for U.S. currency notes increased at unprecedented rates in March as currency orders from domestic and international banks spiked dramatically. At times of crisis, people often turn toward safety, and the U.S. dollar is viewed as a stable and safe asset across the world. So it is not unusual that the pandemic has led to a shift toward cash, but the scale has been unprecedented. Adding to that, the fiscal support in the form of economic impact payments issued by the U.S. government to millions of households also likely contributed to the higher demand in the U.S. as many people converted the payments into cash for spending. On the supply side, just as in other industries, the pandemic has affected the supply chain of cash. With the shutdown in full swing earlier this year, currency deposits to the Fed decreased, as retailers had less cash to deposit and banks wanted to maintain higher inventories in their vaults. The Federal Reserve Banks had to adjust their usual cash operations to ensure that cash inventories were maintained and cash was delivered to meet the higher demand.\n\nAccording to a Federal Reserve survey of consumers taken in May of this year, participants reported that, on average, during the pandemic, they had increased their holdings of cash on their person from $69 to $81, a 17 percent increase.2 And the amount of cash stored at home or elsewhere rose even more, nearly 90 percent, from an average of $250 to over $475. Thirty percent of consumers did report they were avoiding using cash to pay for transactions, in favor of debit and credit cards. But even they were holding more cash in May than they were before the pandemic. Now, since May, as states and localities have relaxed stay-at-home restrictions and the economy has entered a reopening phase, the cash volumes at Reserve Banks have begun to return to more normal levels.\n\nThe pandemic has also caused a disruption to normal patterns of coin circulation. Deposits by banks to the Fed normally account for roughly 80 percent of the coins that the Federal Reserve puts back into circulation, with the remaining 20 percent coming from new coin produced by the U.S. Mint, the issuing authority for U.S. coin. While about $48 billion of coin is already in circulation, because coin-intensive businesses and bank branches have been less accessible during the pandemic, much of that coin has piled up in people's homes and piggybanks and in businesses that were shuttered by the pandemic.3 This has made it more difficult to recirculate the coin where needed. This temporary supply disruption is likely to dissipate because as the reopening phase continues and more businesses resume normal activity, more coins will flow back into retail and banking channels.\n\nElectronic payments have also been affected by the pandemic. Automated Clearing House (ACH) volumes declined in late March and early April, driven by lower payroll processing, business-to-business payments, and online bill payments. Once the federal government's economic impact payments were disbursed and the Small Business Administration's payroll protection plan loans were funded, there was a rapid rebound in these types of payments and ACH volume has nearly recovered to its pre-pandemic growth trend.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland is the primary collection agent for the U.S. Treasury, and in late March and early April, our receipts of credit and debit card payments to the Treasury dropped to about half of what they were compared to last year. On the other hand, the use of debit and credit card payments increased for some types of payments. In the Fed survey of consumers, about 20 percent of respondents reported switching to paying online or over the phone for items from restaurants and big-box stores, and nearly two-thirds reported that they had made no in-person payments during the first several weeks of the pandemic.4\n\nFinally, I will note that payments related to securities transactions have increased dramatically during the pandemic amid increased volatility in financial markets, higher levels of government bond issuance, and a surge in mortgage refinancings prompted by low interest rates.5\n\nAll in all, the pandemic has had a wide-ranging and uneven impact across firms' and households' payment behaviors and patterns. Some of the changes seen early during the pandemic have already reverted to pre-pandemic norms and others are likely to revert as the pandemic recedes. But it is also the case that the changes we have seen for some forms of payment will be longer lasting. A consumer's decision to use a different form of payment during the pandemic may have been driven by circumstances, but now that the consumer has had experience with it, that payment method may become a more routine choice. Similarly, some of the changes in work and consumption patterns may last after the pandemic has ended, altering payment mix and types of transactions more permanently.\n\nFederal Reserve Payments Actions\n\nGiven the importance of the payments system to the U.S. economy and the potential for wide-ranging effects of the pandemic and the actions taken to stem its spread, the Federal Reserve has been focused on mitigating disruptions and preparing for the unexpected. The Fed has established an active inventory management program to coordinate existing stores of cash and coin between Federal Reserve distribution locations. This has allowed us to better serve areas in the country experiencing high demand for cash and to increase the supply of fit notes available to the public. To help address the national coin circulation issues brought on by the pandemic, the Federal Reserve established temporary caps on coin orders in June. These caps, which have risen over time in response to changes in demand and supply conditions, have helped to ensure smooth ordering and fair distribution to financial institutions of all sizes. The Fed has also convened a U.S. Coin Task Force, with representatives from the Fed, the U.S. Mint, and the industry, to identify actions that could be taken to improve coin circulation.\n\nThe Fed understands that financial institutions have had to cope with several pandemic-related challenges – after all, we have faced similar challenges. So to ease some of the burden, in May through July of this year, the Fed offered a customer assistance package, including some fee concessions on reporting, transactional, and electronic access services, and provided temporary relief from certain operational requirements. We also announced that in 2021 we would hold our prices for most Federal Reserve financial services at their current levels.\n\nAs fiscal agent to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve Banks also provided service to the Treasury by processing more than 160 million economic impact payments to households and small businesses authorized by the CARES Act to help recipients cope with the financial effects of the pandemic. Payments were disbursed via ACH, check, and debit card in waves between April and August. The payments were made relatively quickly to those recipients whose bank account details were available to the government from prior tax returns or Social Security payments. Recipients whose bank account details were not known by the government could enter their account information on a specially created IRS website. Even so, this experience showed that the quality of recipients' routing information needs to improve in order to reduce the proportion of payments that cannot be posted automatically to the payee. And when exceptions occur, the processes for handling exceptions need to be sped up in order to avoid delays. It was a much bigger challenge to reach those without a bank account. This is a sizeable group: in 2017, this number was almost 8-1/2 million households, or about 6.5 percent of U.S. households.6 Recipients without bank accounts had to wait much longer for their relief payments to be disbursed by checks or debit cards through the mail, and unfortunately, many of these households tend to be lower income and have the greatest need for speedy financial assistance. The pandemic has underscored the need to ensure that during a crisis, payments can flow quickly and to everyone: those with and those without a bank account.7\n\nAs many in this audience know, one of the goals of the Fed's recent efforts to modernize the U.S. payments system is to speed up the flow of payments between payer and payees. Another goal is to make sure that all Americans have access to the payments system.\n\nFedNowSM\n\nThe Federal Reserve's FedNow service, which is currently being built, will be an around-the-clock service whereby payments can be originated, cleared, and settled within seconds. The service is expected to provide clear public benefits in the form of safety, efficiency, and accessibility of instant payments. Yesterday, my colleague Ken Montgomery provided an excellent overview of FedNow features and functions, so let me touch upon a few points about how we'll be rolling the service out.\n\nWhile COVID-19 has affected many parts of the payments system, it has not slowed down our work on FedNow. Our goal is to bring FedNow to market as soon as practicably possible. The target release date remains 2023 or 2024, but we will announce a more specific time frame once additional work is completed. In order to get the service up and running as soon as possible, we are taking a phased approach to its features. We will begin with the most important features and introduce enhancements quickly and iteratively thereafter. To inform the design and to determine which features to include at the start, we have been engaging extensively with stakeholders through focus groups, industry meetings, and the establishment of a stakeholder-wide FedNow community, and through the more formal public comment process. We are working to finalize a technology strategy that will create a flexible infrastructure, one that is scalable and can evolve with the times.\n\nIn addition to offering secure instant payments, an important goal of FedNow is to establish a nationwide reach for the service so that this new type of payment is broadly accessible to consumers and businesses alike. The Federal Reserve's payments services have a broad reach, with connections to and customer relationships with more than 10,000 diverse financial institutions across the country. This existing reach will help support a nationwide infrastructure for FedNow instant payments. We are also working closely with private-sector payment providers to explore the best approach to achieve wide accessibility.\n\nThinking ahead, a service like FedNow, coupled with a directory service with accurate information on where to route payments for final distribution to households and businesses, has the potential to solve some of the challenges the government faced when distributing pandemic relief payments. Of course, creating such a directory and ensuring it is kept up-to-date is complex, and several challenges, including data privacy considerations, account information maintenance demands, and business case considerations, would have to be solved. The Federal Reserve understands the potential value of such a service, and has been exploring these issues as it evaluates the features to eventually include in FedNow.\n\nCentral Bank Digital Currencies\n\nThe experience with pandemic emergency payments has brought forward an idea that was already gaining increased attention at central banks around the world, that is, central bank digital currency (CBDC). Legislation has proposed that each American have an account at the Fed in which digital dollars could be deposited, as liabilities of the Federal Reserve Banks, which could be used for emergency payments. Other proposals would create a new payments instrument, digital cash, which would be just like the physical currency issued by central banks today, but in a digital form and, potentially, without the anonymity of physical currency. Depending on how these currencies are designed, central banks could support them without the need for commercial bank involvement via direct issuance into the end-users' digital wallets combined with central-bank-facilitated transfer and redemption services.8 The demand for and use of such instruments need further consideration in order to evaluate whether such a central bank digital currency would allow for quicker and more ubiquitous payments in times of emergency and more generally. In addition, a range of potential risks and policy issues surrounding central bank digital currency need to be better understood, and the costs and benefits evaluated.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has been researching issues raised by central bank digital currency for some time. The Board of Governors has a technology lab that has been building and testing a range of distributed ledger platforms to understand their potential benefits and tradeoffs.9 Staff members from several Reserve Banks, including Cleveland Fed software developers, are contributing to this effort. The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston is also engaged in a multiyear effort, working with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, to experiment with technologies that could be used for a central bank digital currency. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York has established an innovation center, in partnership with the Bank for International Settlements, to identify and develop in-depth insights into critical trends and financial technology of relevance to central banks.10 Experimentation like this is an important ingredient in assessing the benefits and costs of a central bank digital currency, but does not signal any decision by the Federal Reserve to adopt such a currency. Issues raised by central bank digital currency related to financial stability, market structure, security, privacy, and monetary policy all need to be better understood.\n\nImproving Traditional Federal Reserve Financial Services\n\nFedNow and central bank digital currency have to do with the future, but the Fed is also working to enhance our current portfolio of payment services to ensure they meet evolving customer needs. We continue to make investments to modernize the technical platforms for traditional payment services, including the Fedwire Funds Service, FedACH, FedLine access channels, and currency-processing services.\n\nWe are investigating expanding the operating hours of wholesale payment services to meet the interbank settlement demands of a 24x7x365 world. We are enhancing services to facilitate cross-border payments, including expanding the reach of our FedGlobal ACH service and adopting the ISO 20022 global standard for several of our payment services. We are investigating emerging technical approaches, like APIs, to see whether they can be leveraged to facilitate broader access and efficiency. And, of course, we are doing what needs to be done to enhance the resilience of our platforms so that our services can run efficiently, reliably, and securely every day.\n\nConclusion\n\nI hope my remarks today give you some sense of the payments work that has been going on at the Federal Reserve during the pandemic. The pandemic has triggered notable short-term changes to payments system patterns, practices, and usage. But the Federal Reserve and industry participants have responded to ensure that our payments system, a critical part of the U.S. infrastructure, continues to function well and to meet stakeholder needs. We have all learned a lot during the pandemic. We have seen that we can respond to unforeseen events and that we can be flexible. We have seen the importance of investing in the resilience of our payments system – such resilience helped ensure that the payments system was not disrupted and did not add another challenge to the long list caused by the pandemic. We have seen the important role the payments system can play in an emergency by distributing funds to those in need. There is some uncertainty about the extent to which some of the changes we have seen in consumer and business behavior with respect to their payment choices will continue after the pandemic. But one thing is certain: we must ensure that our payments system remains modern, resilient, and able to adapt to changing customer needs as they evolve. I am confident that by working together, the Fed and the industry will be able to achieve that goal for the benefit of the public."

We know Ohioans are experiencing employment challenges unlike any in recent history, and we cannot be complacent in doing all that we can to ensure our students are ready to compete in the workforce of the future.\n\nAs we move together to recover from the COVID-19 slowdown, we must build an even stronger state by getting behind efforts to aggressively increase the number of Ohioans with the skills needed to secure high-paying, in-demand jobs.\n\nThis is not just cheerleading. Cleveland Fed researchers have found that over a 75-year period, in the Cleveland Fed's Fourth District—all of Ohio and parts of Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Kentucky—education levels were consistently one of the most reliable indicators for each state's per capita income growth and that counties with higher levels of high school graduates tend to have lower poverty rates and higher levels of labor force participation.1 In other words, acquiring skills and education matters to everyone's bottom line.\n\nThe earning power advantages of a four-year degree are generally well-known. A few years ago, a Cleveland Fed economist measured them and found that the median young household headed by a college graduate earned $42,693 per year in wage income, while the median noncollege household earned only $26,429, a premium of 61.5 percent.2\n\nBut more than two-thirds of adults don't have college degrees. What about them? For the past five years, the Cleveland Fed has been researching what we call \"opportunity occupations,\" those positions that pay above the national median wage and don't typically require a bachelor's degree—think registered nurses, heavy truck drivers, maintenance and repair workers, carpenters, electricians. All of these positions are what we find critical now during the pandemic.\n\nSome of the largest opportunity occupations, including a number in healthcare fields and skilled trades, are projected to experience above-average growth through 2026, and what's more, they're not considered to be at significant risk of automation.3\n\nThese types of jobs still require training, but it often takes less time and money for a person to transition into them. What's needed for both the college-track jobs and the opportunity occupations are investments in education and training.\n\nThat brings me to Bridging Ohio's Workforce Gap. I encourage each of you to read the statewide action plan and to figure out a way that you can get involved in helping us carry it out. The plan proposes numerous strategies, including helping businesses expand training of current and potential workers so they obtain high-value credentials and postsecondary degrees; increasing internships, apprenticeships and co-ops for young people and postsecondary students; expanding the number of students who apply for federal aid; and providing help so formerly incarcerated individuals can become skilled and gain employment.\n\nThese are not new ideas, but their implementation has become even more critical—and I believe even more attainable—in our current situation. The collaboration that resulted in the development of this plan is only the beginning; it's now up to all of us to make these objectives a reality.\n\nPlease join with us to make our state not just Ohio Strong, but also Knowledge Strong – start to finish.\n\nAnd now I am going to turn it over to my colleague Reggie Wilkinson to say a few words."

            "content": "I thank Jack Kleinhenz for inviting me to participate in the NABE Foundation's 2020 Economic Measurement Seminar. I last spoke at a NABE conference in February. That was only six short months ago, but it seems like a lifetime. Many things have changed since then, including current economic conditions and the outlook for the economy and monetary policy. I want to compliment NABE for maintaining its important programming throughout the pandemic. It is a demonstration of perseverance and resilience in the face of extraordinary circumstances, traits exhibited by many households, businesses, and organizations over the past several months. Such resilience is a hallmark of the U.S. economy, and it will prove useful as the economy makes its way to a sustainable recovery. Before we turn to the question and answer part of this session, I'll give you a brief update on the economic outlook and monetary policy, and touch on the changes to the FOMC's policy strategy that were announced last week. The views I'll present are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Economy\n\nIn thinking about the economic impact of the pandemic, I find it helps to think in terms of phases. The shutdown phase started in March when the country took aggressive social distancing measures to limit the spread of the virus and to buy some time for the healthcare system to increase its capacity to care for the sick, learn more about the virus itself, and develop testing and treatments. There were swift and severe effects on the economy from the shutdown of nonessential businesses and activities.\n\nThe reopening phase started in May, as public health statistics began to improve and many parts of the country began to relax some of their stay-at-home restrictions. Economic activity and hiring in many sectors began to improve in May and June as businesses began to reopen and consumers began to re-engage. Even sectors such as travel and leisure and hospitality saw some improvement, although these sectors are likely to remain weak for some time. Early in the reopening phase, many of our business contacts in the Fourth Federal Reserve District, which includes Ohio and parts of Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and West Virginia, told us that activity was picking up more than they had expected. And some of the official statistics have come in stronger than economists had expected. The housing market has been particularly strong, with both new home and existing home sales now back to or above pre-pandemic levels. Spending on durable goods, including autos, is well above pre-pandemic levels.\n\nThis is all good news. But the recovery in activity appears to be a fragile one. The most recent high-frequency data and discussions with regional contacts indicate that the pickup in activity seen in May and June has slowed over the past couple of months. This slowdown has occurred as the number of virus cases began to rise again in some parts of the country in late June, causing some localities to put their reopening plans on pause or to reimpose restrictions on activity. Even in areas where authorities did not change reopening plans, the rise in virus cases seems to have had a dampening effect on activity as people pulled back, out of concern for their safety. The most recent virus data suggest the number of new cases, while still elevated, has turned back down, so I'll be watching to see if the pace of activity picks up again.\n\nSince this is a measurement conference, it seems fitting that I should show you some charts illustrating some of the data. Economists tend to look at growth rates when assessing the economy, but in this unprecedented situation of a shutdown followed by a reopening, looking at the level of activity compared to what it was before the pandemic is helpful in gauging the economic outlook.\n\n[FIGURE 1] The official GDP data clearly show the deep plunge in activity associated with the shutdown. Economic activity peaked in February and the U.S. economy entered a recession. Real GDP fell at a 5 percent annual pace in the first quarter and a record 32 percent annual pace in the second quarter, with nonresidential business fixed investment down 26 percent, and personal consumption down 34 percent, at an annual rate. The level of real GDP in the second quarter was back down to the level it was in 2014 – so we have lost six years of output growth.\n\nThe recovery in some sectors, like services, will take longer than in others, and there will be fits and starts, depending on the course of the virus. But I expect the second quarter to be the trough, a strong rebound in growth in the third quarter, and continued positive growth in the fourth quarter, but with the level of output still ending the year somewhat below where it was at the end of last year.\n\n[FIGURE 2] The decline in activity in the first half of the year when the economy shut down put downward pressure on inflation, even though supply disruptions have caused the prices of certain goods and services to rise. During the reopening phase, there has been some recovery in the inflation measures, but I expect inflation to remain below our longer-run 2 percent goal for some time to come.\n\n[FIGURE 3] The shutdown and reopening had clear effects on the labor market. In April there was an unprecedented rise in unemployment and loss of jobs, particularly in sectors where people cannot work from home. Many workers reported that they expected their unemployment spell would be temporary, and as the economy has been reopening, we have seen a rapid decline in the unemployment rate as people on temporary furlough began to be rehired. This is good news. But it is also good to keep these numbers in perspective. The unemployment rate was 10.2 percent in July, still slightly above its peak after the Great Recession. There are still 16 million unemployed workers in the U.S., compared with 6 million in February. This means that about one in 16 Americans over the age of 16 is unemployed, near the level after the Great Recession. Moreover, the deterioration in the labor market has not been evenly shared, with the net increase in the unemployment rate since February being higher for Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians than for whites.\n\n[FIGURE 4] The payroll employment data tell a similar story. In just the two months of March and April, the economy lost 22 million jobs, the same number of jobs it had added over the entire recent expansion that lasted over 10 years. More than three-quarters of those losses were in the sectors paying below-average wages. The good news is that in just three months, the economy has added back over 9 million jobs. Of course, this means we are less than half way back up to the pre-pandemic level of jobs, and the current level of employment is about what it was back in 2014. So like output, about 6 years' worth of job growth has been lost.\n\nGiven the unprecedented nature of the pandemic and economic shutdown, many economists, including those at the Fed, have been looking at higher-frequency indicators to track developments. The Cleveland Fed has been surveying our contacts with greater frequency and we have added a nationwide survey of consumers to gauge how the virus has affected their attitudes and activities. These higher-frequency indicators clearly show the rebound in activity that came with the reopening of the economy, but they also show that activity is correlated with data on the course of the virus.\n\n[FIGURE 5] For example, when virus cases began to rise again in late June, the data on mobility, or the percentage of time spent away from home, and the data on restaurant visits began to level off compared to May when reopening began. Our contacts in the restaurant industry also confirmed that the pace of business activity was dampening and some have begun to question the longer-run viability of many establishments, especially those that have not been able to transition to takeout.\n\n[FIGURE 6] As the pandemic has worn on, businesses have begun to change their plans. Early on, many contacts told us that they were not planning to make permanent reductions to their work force; however, they eventually had to let some workers go. In our latest survey, over half of the firms told us that in light of the increase in virus cases since late June, they have made meaningful changes to their plans, including for hiring and capital spending.\n\nSmall businesses have been disproportionately affected by the virus, and the smallest of the small businesses particularly so. Data from Homebase show that the strides made since April on employment at small businesses have now begun to stall, with the number of hourly staff down about 20 percent since January. As documented by researchers at the New York Fed, Black-owned businesses have been particularly hard hit by the pandemic, and have been twice as likely to close as other firms during the pandemic. The researchers point to a number of contributing factors including these firms' weaker financial cushions, weaker bank relationships, and funding gaps that existed prior to the pandemic, plus less access to federal relief funds.1\n\n[FIGURE 7] The Cleveland Fed's survey data show that both businesses and consumers are thinking differently about the pandemic than they did at the start. In our survey taken in late June, about half of our regional business contacts said it will take at least a year for their firms' activity to return to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nThe Cleveland Fed's national daily survey shows that consumers are now more willing to engage in certain activities than they were at the start, but they also believe that the pandemic will last much longer than they originally thought.2 In March, over 80 percent of respondents thought the pandemic would last a year or less. In early August, only half think that, and the other half thinks it will be two years or even longer.\n\nThe Economic Outlook and Policy\n\nThe link we've seen between the rise in virus cases and the dampening of activity underscores the fact that the path of the economy depends on the path of the virus. Of course, the path of the virus can be affected by our actions. These include public- and private-sector investments in expanded testing, contact tracing, treatments, and vaccines, as well as our own individual actions to safely engage in activity by wearing a mask that covers our noses and mouths, avoiding social gatherings, maintaining distance from others, and washing our hands frequently.\n\nAssuming that we get the virus under control and people feel safe enough and businesses confident enough to re-engage in economic activity, the economy will move from the reopening phase to a more sustained recovery phase. This recovery is likely to take some time because the pandemic was a significant shock to the economy.\n\nBoth the federal government and the Federal Reserve took swift and significant actions to provide households and businesses with relief during the shutdown. Fiscal actions have included grants to individuals, certain businesses hit hardest by the pandemic, and states and municipalities; expanded unemployment benefits; and loans to small businesses that became grants for firms maintaining their payrolls.\n\nThe Federal Reserve took actions to ensure that financial markets had enough liquidity to continue to function well and that credit could continue to flow to households and businesses, thereby avoiding financial instability on top of the pandemic. These actions have included buying Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities to address strains in these markets; making sure our central bank counterparties abroad have access to dollar funding; setting up a variety of so-called 13(3) emergency facilities, backed by the U.S. Treasury, that serve as a backstop to other key credit markets and support the flow of credit to households, businesses of all sizes, and state and local governments; temporarily relaxing some of the regulatory requirements on banks so they have greater capacity to lend; and since March, maintaining the fed funds rate target range at 0 to 1/4 percent.\n\nBy the end of this year, I expect that output will still be somewhat below its level at the end of last year; that the unemployment rate will remain in the high single digits; and that inflation will be well below our longer-run 2 percent goal. Of course, the uncertainty around this forecast is extremely high: we are in an unprecedented situation and outcomes depend on public health considerations. The outlook also depends on appropriate economic policy. In my view, fiscal policy and monetary policy support are needed to limit lasting damage to the economy and achieve a broader, sustainable recovery. Several key parts of the fiscal policy support already in place are expiring. Given economic conditions, it seems clear that further fiscal support is needed to provide a bridge for households, small businesses, and state and local municipalities that have borne the brunt of the pandemic until the recovery is sustainably in place.3\n\nFor the Fed's part, the FOMC has indicated that we expect to maintain the fed funds rate target range at 0 to 1/4 percent until we are confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Our asset purchases continue to support market functioning and accommodative financial conditions. In addition, clear communications about our policy strategy can also make any monetary policy actions we take more effective. Last week, the FOMC released a revised statement outlining our longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy, which should help clarify and reinforce the FOMC's policy intentions.4 So let me conclude with a few highlights from this statement. I direct you to Fed Chair Powell's recent remarks for a fuller discussion of the statement.5\n\nRevised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy\n\nFor the past year and a half, the FOMC has been engaged in a review of our framework – the strategy, tools, and communications – for setting monetary policy in pursuit of our statutory goals to promote maximum employment, price stability, and moderate long-term interest rates. The review was informed by our experience during and after the Great Recession, by economic theory and empirical analysis, and by consultations with academic researchers and practitioners at research conferences and with the public at large, through a series of Fed Listens events held across the country.\n\nThe review, whose main conclusions are captured in the strategy statement, was undertaken in light of changes in the economic environment that have emerged since our first strategy statement was published in 2012. One important change is the decline both here and abroad in the general level of interest rates consistent with sustainable growth and price stability. This decline reflects several factors, including the aging of the population, changes in risk preferences, and slower productivity growth. It means that the level of the fed funds rate consistent with maximum employment and price stability is now lower than it has been in the past. This means that during economic downturns, it is now more likely that the fed funds rate will be constrained by its effective lower bound. In other words, in the wake of a downturn, the FOMC will have less policy space to support the economy using its traditional policy tool. With households, businesses, and financial markets all understanding this constraint, this imparts a downward bias to inflation and inflation expectations, and increases the downside risks to achieving both of our policy goals.\n\nAnother change in the economic environment pertains to inflation dynamics. Resource slack has become less correlated with actual inflation than in the past, and inflation expectations now play a larger role in determining inflation outcomes. This makes it even more important that inflation expectations remain well anchored at levels consistent with our longer-run 2 percent inflation goal, especially since inflation running below our goal would result in even less policy space in a low-interest-rate environment.\n\nThe first thing to note about the revised strategy statement is that the FOMC has reaffirmed that a longer-run inflation rate of 2 percent is most consistent with our statutory mandate. But our strategy statement is now more explicit about how we will go about achieving this inflation goal. Namely, after periods in which inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, we will likely aim to have inflation run moderately above 2 percent for some time. Doing so will help anchor inflation expectations, a main determinant of actual inflation, at levels consistent with 2 percent inflation. The new language is a stronger statement than we have made in the past as we have struggled to effectively convey that 2 percent should not be interpreted as a ceiling. We are now clear that after inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, not only will we tolerate serendipitous shocks that move inflation above 2 percent, but that we will likely set policy with the intention to move inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.\n\nI have spoken many times on the fact that policy communications should acknowledge uncertainty.6 The changes made in the strategy statement about our employment goal are an acknowledgment of the uncertainty around assessments of the level of maximum employment. Indeed, the FOMC's assessments of the longer-run unemployment rate have come down significantly over time, and employment growth over the expansion ended up being considerably stronger without generating inflation than past experience suggested was possible. It took time to learn about these structural changes in the economy. And this time-to-learn, combined with the previous strategy statement's references to \"deviations\" of employment from maximum employment, has been misinterpreted by some as suggesting that the FOMC, at times, takes deliberate policy action to bring employment down independently of our inflation goal. This is not the case. The benefits of a strong labor market in fostering economic inclusion for all Americans are clear and we need to be humble about our abilities to assess maximum employment in real time. The new statement language clarifies that in the absence of inflationary pressures or risks to financial stability, strong employment is not a concern and monetary policy will not react to it.\n\nI strongly believe that clear policy communications are an important part of effective monetary policymaking. The completion of the framework review and the revised strategy statement come at an opportune time, in support of the FOMC's commitment to doing all that it can to support a sustainable recovery back to maximum employment and price stability in service to the public."

            "content": "I thank Dean Croushore and the organizers of the 2020 Liberal Arts Macroeconomics Conference for inviting me to present in the keynote session. I also want to acknowledge the important role that the participants in this conference play in our economy and in society. In recent years, some have questioned whether a liberal arts education offers the same value as it once did, and point to other types of programs that, in their view, better prepare students for the job market. I take the opposite view: to me the value of a liberal arts education has never been clearer. The current pandemic underscores the fact that the future is uncertain. A year ago, I certainly wasn't imagining we would be in the place we find ourselves today. If we want students to be prepared for the future, then we must give them the tools they will need to successfully stand up to future challenges, think critically through possible approaches and solutions to those challenges, be resilient in the face of adversity, and question the status quo. A broad-based liberal arts education, which encompasses the study of history, literature, and the arts, as well as mathematics and the natural and social sciences, holds the best promise to prepare students for the future, whatever it may bring. I applaud the professors taking part in this conference. Not only do you have to be inspirational teachers, but you also have to be excellent researchers who are pushing the boundaries of knowledge in economics forward. Both roles have become more challenging during the pandemic, with the sudden need to move to remote teaching and the difficulty in keeping ongoing research on track. I appreciate your efforts and ask that you persevere in these very important roles.\n\nToday, before we open it up to questions, I'll give you an update on the economy and on the Federal Reserve's policy response. As always, the views I'll present are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Economy\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic is a global public health crisis that has inflicted pain and hardship on people all over the world. This is an unprecedented situation and unprecedented actions have been taken in response.\n\nIn thinking about the economic impact of the pandemic, it helps to think in terms of phases: the shutdown phase, the reopening phase, and a more traditional economic recovery phase. The shutdown phase began in March when the country took aggressive social distancing measures to limit the spread of the virus and to buy some time for the healthcare system to increase its capacity to care for the sick, learn more about the virus itself, and develop testing and treatments. The shutdown had swift and severe effects on the economy.\n\nThe economy entered the reopening phase in May, as the public health statistics began to improve in some parts of the country. Many states began to relax some of their stay-at-home restrictions, with some states doing so more quickly and more broadly than others. We began to see some welcome rebound in the economic data in May and June. But it is good to keep in mind that growth rates after a shutdown are going to look good as activity resumes. Given the deep hole we are digging out of, it is more informative to look at levels when gauging the economy and assessing the outlook.\n\nThe reopening phase has proved to be challenging. In late June, virus cases in many parts of the country began rising again and, in response, some states have hit the pause button on their reopening plans, while other states have reimposed some restrictions on activities. Although we don't yet see the effects of the pause in many of the official economic statistics, the higher-frequency data and discussions with regional contacts do indicate that economic activity has slowed in recent weeks. Thus, the reopening phase may be more protracted than many had anticipated when it started.\n\n[FIGURE 1] At this point, the most dated of our official statistics are the GDP data. These statistics show that economic activity peaked in February and the U.S. economy entered a recession. After declining at a 5 percent annual pace in the first quarter, real GDP plunged at a record 33 percent annual pace in the second quarter, with nonresidential business fixed investment down 27 percent, and personal consumption down almost 35 percent, at an annual rate. I expect that the second quarter will be the trough in economic activity. Consumer spending rebounded in May and June, with June's spending on goods higher than it was in February, before the shutdown. But while spending on services, which includes dining at restaurants, air travel, and hotel stays, moved up in May and June, it remains well below pre-pandemic levels.\n\n[FIGURE 2] The decline in activity has put downward pressure on inflation. Both headline and core inflation readings moved down in March and April and remained low in May and June. It is true that supply disruptions have caused the prices of certain goods and services to rise, but this upward pressure has been more than offset by the downward pressure driven by the pullback in demand. And I expect inflation to remain low for some time to come.\n\n[FIGURE 3] The shutdown of the economy earlier this year led to an unprecedented rise in unemployment and loss of jobs. While many people can work from home, many others cannot. As reopening began, we started to see some improvement in labor markets. Both the unemployment rate and payroll employment have improved over the past two months. Recall that in February, the unemployment rate was 3.5 percent, its 50-year low. In April, the unemployment rate surged to 14.7 percent. As reopening commenced in May, people on temporary furlough began to be rehired. As of June, the unemployment rate is down to 11.1 percent. The fact that the unemployment rate is coming down is good news. But we also need to put this into perspective. The current level is still above its peak in the aftermath of the Great Recession. And there are still almost 18 million unemployed workers in the U.S., compared with 6 million in February. This means one in 15 Americans over the age of 16 is unemployed, about the same as at the height after the Great Recession.\n\n[FIGURE 4] The economy lost over 22 million jobs in March and April. This is a staggering number. It would have been literally off the charts if I hadn't changed the scale. In fact, the losses in just the two months of March and April were about the same as the number of jobs the economy added over the entire recent expansion that lasted more than 10 years. The jobs added in May and June make up only about one-third of the jobs lost.\n\n[FIGURE 5] To get a sense of where we are, it is helpful to look at employment in levels rather than monthly changes. The current level of payroll jobs is now back to where it was in 2014. In other words, the economy is still down about 6 years' worth of job growth.\n\nThe deterioration in the labor market is even sharper than these numbers indicate. Many people left the work force at the beginning of the shutdown and consequently they do not show up in the unemployment rate, and many workers had their hours cut. Our survey of firms in the Fourth District, which includes Ohio and parts of Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and West Virginia, indicates that firms have recalled workers more slowly than they originally intended to. As of mid-July, over half of District contacts have told us they are meaningfully altering their plans in response to the rise in virus cases, including reducing employment or employee compensation or cancelling or postponing planned capital expenditures.\n\nThe deterioration in the labor market has not been evenly shared. Net job losses have been predominantly in lower-paying jobs. Nearly half of the net private-sector job losses since February have been in the leisure and hospitality and the retail trade sectors, the two sectors ranked lowest in terms of average hourly earnings. Three-quarters of the job losses are in the sectors that pay below-average wages.\n\n[FIGURE 6] There are racial disparities as well. Unemployment rates among Blacks and Hispanics have been chronically above those of whites and Asians. Over the long expansion, we had finally seen some progress being made on that front, as the gap in unemployment rates narrowed. But the pandemic has increased the disparities. The net increase in the unemployment rate since February is higher for Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians than for whites. It is particularly distressing that much of the sacrifice over the pandemic period is being borne by the most vulnerable in our economy: lower-income and minority workers and communities, and the smaller of the small businesses.\n\n[FIGURE 7] And it shines a bright light on long-standing economic inequality that needs to be addressed if the economy is to perform up to its potential. Education is a path to better economic outcomes for individuals, households, and the country at large. According to data from the 2016 Survey of Consumer Finances, the median income for families whose head has a college degree was over $90,000 compared with only $40,000 for families whose head has only a high school diploma. Similarly, median net worth is considerably higher for those with a college degree.1\n\n[FIGURE 8 Our work force has become more educated over time. But educational attainment differs by race, as does the likelihood of completing a degree. In the Fed's survey, 39 percent of white heads of households held a college degree compared to 23 percent of Black heads of household and 17 percent of Hispanic heads of household.2\n\n[FIGURE 9] Graduation rates for whites, Hispanics, and Asians have all risen over time, but those of Blacks remain well below those of these other groups and have shown no progress over time. Because economic well-being rises with education, unless more is done to support those entering college so they can complete their degrees, economic inequality is likely to continue to rise.3\n\nThe Economic Outlook and Policy\n\nLet me now turn to the outlook and policy. Macroeconomic forecasting has been particularly challenging during the pandemic. Higher-frequency indicators, including data on mobility, restaurant visits, debit and credit card transactions, employment in small businesses, and the weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance, all suggest that activity has begun to decelerate with the rise in virus cases. These recent developments add uncertainty to what was already an uncertain outlook. Whether the rise in cases and the deceleration in activity prove to be temporary or more persistent remains to be seen. At the very least, they suggest that the economy will be in the reopening phase for a while longer.\n\nIt is clear that the path of the economy depends on the path of the virus. But that does not mean we are helpless. The actions we take can help control the virus and thereby change the impact of the virus on the economy. Increased government and private-sector investment in expanded testing, contact tracing, and developments of therapeutics and vaccines will influence the path of the virus and our ability to re-engage in economic activity. Each individual can also influence the path of the virus: we can wear a mask that covers our noses and mouths when out and about, we can avoid social gatherings and maintain our distance from others, and we can wash our hands frequently. These simple steps have been shown to make a difference in infection rates. According to the Cleveland Clinic, the latest estimates indicate that if 95 percent of Americans wore face coverings in public, COVID-related deaths could be reduced by up to 40,000 to 50,000.4\n\nIn response to the increase in cases seen in Ohio, the governor recently upgraded the mask-wearing recommendation to a mandate. This is occurring in other states as well. Evidence from the Cleveland Fed's daily national survey of households shows that the vast majority of the more than 1,000 survey respondents would comply with such a mandate, with older people more likely to comply than younger people. The vast majority also thought that mask-wearing is helpful in reducing transmission of the virus, and those who believed this are more likely to wear a mask. About 70 percent of respondents also reported that they feel more comfortable shopping when they see others wearing masks.5\n\nAssuming that the virus gets under control once again and people feel safe enough and businesses confident enough to re-engage in economic activity, the economy will move from the reopening phase to the recovery phase. I anticipate that the recovery will take some time because significant sectoral reallocations are going to need to occur. Changes in consumers' behavior, including their shopping, dining, and housing preferences; changes in firms' demand for office space and work arrangements; and changes in supply chains will all take time to sort out. The pandemic was a significant shock to the economy – the largest in most of our lifetimes. A significant number of firms have already declared bankruptcy. Many workers will need to be rehired; some will have to find jobs in different industries. It will take continued fiscal and monetary policy support to limit lasting damage to the economy and achieve a sustainable recovery.\n\nPolicy Actions\n\nBoth the federal government and the Federal Reserve took swift and significant actions to provide households and businesses with relief during the shutdown. Fiscal policymakers made grants to individuals, certain businesses hit hardest by the pandemic, and states and municipalities. They offered expanded unemployment benefits and loans to small businesses that turn into grants if they maintain their payrolls. It is clear that these programs made a significant difference; it is also clear that more fiscal support is needed to provide a bridge for households, small businesses, and state and local municipalities that have borne the brunt of the economic shutdown until the recovery is sustainably in place.\n\nAs one indicator of the need, I point you to recent analysis by a Brookings Institution researcher of data from the Census Bureau's Pulse Survey from the third week in June. These data show that 16.5 percent of households with children reported that sometimes or often their children were not eating enough due to a lack of resources. This is more than 5 times as high as in 2018. It translates into 14 million children, which is over 2-1/2 times the number at the peak of the Great Recession.6\n\nUnlike the federal government, the Federal Reserve is not legally able to make grants, but it has taken significant actions to ensure that financial markets have enough liquidity to continue to function well and that credit can flow to households and businesses. Actions include buying Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities to address strains in these markets, and setting up a variety of so-called 13(3) facilities. These emergency lending facilities, with the backing of the U.S. Treasury, serve as a backstop to other key credit markets and support the flow of credit to households, businesses of all sizes, and state and local governments. The Fed is also ensuring that our central bank counterparties abroad have access to dollar funding. Because much of the flow of credit to households and businesses relies on the banking system, the Fed has encouraged banks to use its discount window as a source of liquidity and to work with their borrowers affected by the virus. The Fed has temporarily relaxed some of the regulatory requirements and supervisory oversight so that banks have greater capacity to lend, but it has also suspended share buybacks, limited dividend distributions, and is requiring large banks to reassess their long-run capital plans to ensure they remain adequately capitalized to sustain lending through the downturn. Since March, the FOMC has set its fed funds rate target range at 0 to 1/4 percent. At our meeting last week, we reiterated that we expect to maintain this target range until we are confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals.\n\nThe portfolio of Fed actions has helped to relieve stress in financial markets, improve market functioning, support the flow of credit to businesses and households, and contribute to very accommodative financial conditions in support of economic activity.\n\nAs the economy emerges from the reopening phase and moves into the recovery phase, the focus of Fed policy will expand from supporting market functioning and the flow of credit to ensuring that appropriate monetary policy accommodation remains in place to support the economy's return to more normal levels of economic activity and employment and inflation's moving back up. Although our policy rate is already at its effective lower bound, the tools that we used to support the recovery from the Great Recession, including forward guidance about the future path of policy and purchases of longer-term Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities, can be used to provide additional accommodation. Clear communications about our policy strategy, which is part of our current review of our monetary policy framework, can also make the monetary policy actions we take more effective.7 As Fed Chair Powell indicated in his recent press conference, we plan to wrap up the review in the near future.8\n\nBy the end of this year, I expect that output will still be about 6 percent below its level at the end of last year; that the unemployment rate will remain elevated, at around 9 percent or so; and that inflation will be well below our 2 percent goal. Of course, the uncertainty around this forecast is extremely high: we are in an unprecedented situation and outcomes depend not only on appropriate economic policy but also on public health considerations. The increase in virus cases that we've seen in recent weeks has raised the downside risks to the outlook and is a stark reminder that there are several different scenarios that could play out. While there are many uncertainties, there is one thing you can be certain of: the Federal Reserve is committed to using all of its policy tools to provide relief to households and businesses, to foster stability in the financial system, and to support the recovery back to maximum employment and price stability in service to the public."

            "content": "Let me start by thanking Nan Morrison and the Council for Economic Education for the opportunity to speak today. I have the pleasure of serving on the council's board so I have seen firsthand the important work the council is doing to increase economic and financial literacy in the country. As the council's mission statement explains, equipping students with this knowledge can help them make better decisions for themselves, their families, and their communities. It is noteworthy that despite the burdens of the pandemic, the council has found creative ways to carry on its mission, including its support of teachers, the National Economics Challenge, and this speakers' series.\n\nToday, before we open it up to questions, I'll give you an update on the economy and on the Federal Reserve's policy response. As always, the views I'll present are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Current Economy\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic is a global public health crisis that has inflicted pain and hardship on people all over the world. This is an unprecedented situation and unprecedented actions have been taken in response. The country took aggressive social distancing measures to limit the spread of the virus, resulting in a shutdown of much of the economy starting in March. This was an investment in public health that bought some time for the healthcare system to increase its capacity to care for the sick, for doctors and scientists to learn more about the disease itself, and for the country to begin to develop tests and treatments. But at the same time, the effect of the shutdown on the economy was swift and severe.\n\n[FIGURE 1] In the first quarter, real output declined at a 5 percent annual rate, with real consumption down almost 7 percent and nonresidential business fixed investment down nearly 8 percent. These declines reflect what occurred in a single month, March. Earlier this month, the National Bureau of Economic Research's Business Cycle Dating Committee determined that economic activity peaked in February and that the U.S. economy entered a recession. I anticipate that the second quarter will show the most severe effects of the pandemic shutdown on economic activity. Most private-sector forecasts for second quarter GDP growth range from minus 25 down to minus 40 percent, measured at an annual rate. I agree that second quarter growth could be the largest quarterly decline on record.\n\n[FIGURE 2] The decline in activity led to both headline and core inflation readings moving down in March and April. I expect inflation to decline further this year because the sharp pullback in demand will outweigh any upward pressure coming from limited supplies of certain goods and services.\n\nIn recent weeks, states have begun to relax some of their stay-at-home restrictions, and we are beginning to see some positive signs in the data. Retail sales rebounded significantly in May, with sales up in all major categories. In the Fourth District, which includes Ohio and parts of Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and West Virginia, some activities have picked up faster than our business contacts had expected. Tourism activity increased after Memorial Day and foot traffic at retail stores in the region moved up. Even so, about 40 percent of our contacts do not expect activity to recover to pre-pandemic levels for at least a year.\n\nAs more regions and sectors of the economy reopen, rates of growth are going to look very good, but we are digging out from a very deep hole and it is more informative to think in terms of levels.\n\nOne of the most positive pieces of news we've received is the employment report for May. Instead of rising as most economists expected, the unemployment rate fell. And instead of losing jobs, payrolls increased by 2.5 million jobs. This is great news and points to some stabilization in the labor market after two months of deep declines. I am hoping we will continue to see positive reports over coming months as more of the economy opens up.\n\nBut it is also important to put May's report into perspective.\n\n[FIGURE 3] In April, the unemployment rate surged to 14.7 percent. In May, it fell to 13.3 percent, still considerably above its previous peak in October 2009, in the aftermath of the Great Recession, and well above the 3.5 percent it was as recently as February. In May, 21 million workers were unemployed compared with 6 million in February. That is about one in 12 Americans aged 16 or older. This is worse than in October 2009, when about one in 15 people were unemployed.\n\n[FIGURE 4] The gain of 2.5 million jobs in May was a record monthly gain, but it is only about 11 percent of the job losses in March and April.\n\n[FIGURE 5] In fact, the level of employment is near the lows we saw right after the Great Recession. So that means the economy has lost almost all of the jobs it added over the entire expansion of 10-plus years. Employment is 13 percent below February's level.\n\nThe deterioration in the labor market is even sharper than these numbers indicate. Many people left the work force at the beginning of the shutdown and they do not show up in the unemployment rate, and many workers had their hours cut. Our survey of firms in the Fourth District indicates that while layoffs began to slow in May, firms have recalled workers more slowly than they originally intended to.\n\nMoreover, the improvements in May were not evenly shared. Indeed, half of the net private-sector job losses since February have been in the leisure and hospitality and the retail trade sectors, the two sectors ranked lowest in terms of average hourly earnings.\n\n[FIGURE 6] The unemployment rates among blacks and Hispanics have been chronically above those of whites and Asians. Over the long expansion, we had finally seen some progress being made on that front, as the gap in unemployment rates narrowed. But the pandemic has increased the disparities. All groups have experienced an increase in their unemployment rate since February, but the increase was less for whites than for the other groups. And in May, the unemployment rate for both blacks and Asians continued to edge up rather than fall. It is particularly distressing that much of the sacrifice over the pandemic period is being borne by the most vulnerable in our economy: lower-income and minority workers and communities, and the smaller of the small businesses.\n\n[FIGURE 7] And it shines a bright light on long-standing economic inequality that needs to be addressed if the economy is to perform up to its potential. Like the Council for Economic Education, I believe that education is a path to better economic outcomes for individuals, households, and the country at large. Our work force has become more educated over time. But the likelihood of completing a degree varies by race. Graduation rates for whites, Hispanics, and Asians have risen over time, but those of blacks remain well below those of these other groups and have shown no progress over time. Economic well-being rises with education, so if more is not done to ensure that blacks who enter college have the support to complete their degrees, economic inequality is likely to continue to rise.1\n\nThe Economic Outlook and Policy\n\nLet me now turn to the outlook and policy. Macroeconomic forecasting is particularly challenging at this time. With states relaxing stay-at-home restrictions, I expect economic activity to pick up in the second half of the year. But there is considerable uncertainty about what the recovery will look like after the economy reopens. The shape of the recovery will depend on the path of the virus and our ability to handle its spread through testing, contact tracing, treatment, and risk-focused restrictions on activity. It will also depend on the behavior of households and businesses and how comfortable they feel in re-engaging in economic activity. The Cleveland Fed's daily national survey of households suggests widely varying views about the pandemic and how people plan to behave. About 60 percent of the respondents think the pandemic will last a year or less, and on average, this group says they are likely to return to their pre-pandemic usage of bars and restaurants, public spaces, public transportation, and crowded events. The other 40 percent of the respondents expect the pandemic to last more than a year, and on average, this group says they will not engage in these activities to the same extent they once did, even after the pandemic has ended.2 It will be important to continue to monitor household and business attitudes in assessing the outlook.\n\nThe other important factor that will determine the path of the recovery is how successful policy actions are in ensuring that the temporary disruption in activity we have seen so far does not cause lasting damage to the economy and that the recovery has enough support to be sustained.\n\nLet me discuss some of these policy actions and then talk about the outlook. Both the federal government and the Federal Reserve took significant actions quickly to provide households and businesses with relief during the shutdown. Fiscal policymakers made grants to individuals, certain businesses hit hardest by the pandemic, and states and municipalities. They have expanded unemployment benefits and have funded the Paycheck Protection Program, which provides small businesses with loans that turn into grants if they maintain their payrolls. As the magnitude of the need has come into better focus, the federal government has increased its level of support. Although the amount of support has been sizable, so is the depth of the economic downturn. In my view, further direct fiscal support will be needed for states and municipal governments and for households most affected by the pandemic.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is not legally able to make grants, but it has taken significant actions and has committed to using its full set of tools to support the economy, guided by our congressional mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability.\n\nEarly in the pandemic, the Fed began taking actions to help ensure that financial markets have enough liquidity to continue to function well. Well-functioning financial markets are what allow credit to flow to households and businesses and monetary policy to effectively transmit to broader financial conditions. So when conditions became strained, the Fed began buying Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities and conducted operations in the repo market to ease those strains. At our meeting last week, the FOMC said that over the coming months, the Fed would increase its holdings of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities at least at the current pace.\n\nThe Fed has also set up emergency lending facilities, with the backing of the U.S. Treasury, to serve as a backstop to other key credit markets, including money market mutual funds and the commercial paper market. The Fed is also ensuring that our central bank counterparties abroad have access to dollar funding. Although volatility and risk spreads have not returned to pre-pandemic levels, there has been a significant lessening of stress and an improvement in market functioning in many markets since these actions have been taken.\n\nAnother set of our emergency lending facilities focuses more directly on supporting the flow of credit to households, to businesses of all sizes, and to state and local governments.3 Included in this group are the Municipal Liquidity Facility, which purchases short-term notes from states to help them manage cash-flow pressures, and the Main Street Lending Program, which supports lending to small and medium-sized businesses that were in sound financial condition before the onset of the pandemic. Based on consultations with both lenders and potential borrowers, the Fed has adjusted the terms on some of these programs to ensure that they will support the economy as effectively as they can while safeguarding taxpayer funds. And earlier this week the Fed announced it was seeking public feedback on a proposed expansion of the Main Street program to nonprofits, which provide vital services in the economy.\n\nBecause much of the flow of credit to households and businesses relies on the banking system, the Fed has encouraged banks to use its discount window as a source of liquidity and to work with their borrowers affected by the virus. The Fed has temporarily relaxed some of the regulatory requirements and supervisory oversight so that banks have greater capacity to lend.\n\nLast, but not least, in March the FOMC reduced its target range for the fed funds rate to 0 to 1/4 percent. At our meeting last week, we maintained the funds rate at that level and reiterated that we expect to maintain this target range until we are confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals.\n\nAs more states relax restrictions on activity, the economy is moving from a shutdown phase, through a re-opening phase, and into a recovery phase. As this happens, the focus of Fed policy will expand from supporting market functioning and the flow of credit to supporting the recovery. I expect to see an improvement in the second half of the year as the economy reopens. But after that, I believe it will take quite some time for economic activity and job levels to approach more normal levels. The improvement will vary across sectors, because even if people can resume some of their normal activities, they need to feel some reassurance that it is safe to do so. In some industries, like travel and leisure and hospitality, it will likely take quite a while longer for activity to pick up than in others. By the end of this year, I expect that output will still be about 6 percent below its level at the end of last year, and the unemployment rate, while down from its peak, will still be around 9 percent. I expect inflation to remain below our 2 percent goal for some time to come.\n\nIn my view, very accommodative monetary policy will be needed to support the recovery and the return to the FOMC's goals of price stability and maximum employment over time. My economic forecast is very similar to the median forecasts of the FOMC participants that were released last week, which show an economic recovery starting in the second half of the year and continuing over the next couple of years. Almost all of my FOMC colleagues agree with me that it will be appropriate for the fed funds rate to remain at its current level through 2022, the end of our projection horizon, in support of the recovery.4\n\nOver the next several weeks as more states reopen, we will get further readings on the condition of the economy. The uncertainty surrounding the outlook is extremely high because we are in an unprecedented situation. Outcomes depend not only on appropriate economic policy but also on public health considerations. Epidemiologists tell us to expect periodic upswings in the number of cases until a vaccine can be distributed. We are seeing that today in some locations. People often say that the virus determines the timeline. I agree, but that does not mean we are helpless to affect the outcomes. Increased investment would speed up the progress on testing, contact tracing, and treatments, and help ensure that the healthcare system has adequate capacity. Better adherence to the guidelines on social distancing, mask wearing, and hygiene would help to control the virus's spread. These actions would make it safer for people to re-engage in activity and would allow for interventions to become more focused on helping those at highest risk from the disease, thereby supporting the recovery. And May's positive employment and retail sales reports remind us of the resiliency of the U.S. economy. Of course, if the number of cases of the virus is not well-controlled and the healthcare system gets overwhelmed, then the economic outcomes I have discussed could turn out to be much more dire, with people and businesses restricting their own activity even if states do not reinstate restrictions.\n\nSo at this juncture, I think it makes sense for monetary policymakers to continue to monitor the economy as the country begins to re-engage in economic activity, to continue to support the flow of credit to households and businesses and ensure the smooth functioning of financial markets, to remember that there are several different scenarios that could play out, and to stand ready to use all of our tools to mitigate lasting damage and to support the economy's recovery back to maximum employment and price stability."

            "content": "I thank the CFA Society Chicago and the CFA's Women's Network for inviting me to speak today. In preparing my remarks, I noticed that the last formal speech I gave on the economy was on March 3, which seems like a lifetime ago, and it was in London, which seems like a world away. A lot has happened since then. So before the question and answer portion of today's session, I'd like to start with a brief update on the economy and the Federal Reserve's policy response. As always, the views I'll present are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic is a global public health crisis that has inflicted pain and hardship on people all over the world. I want to express my deepest sympathies to those who have been affected by the virus. This is an unprecedented situation. In the interests of public health, the country has taken aggressive social distancing measures to limit the spread of the virus, resulting in a shutdown of much of the economy. This investment in public health is buying time for the healthcare system to increase its capacity to care for the sick, for doctors and scientists to learn more about the disease itself, and for the country to develop tests and treatments. This investment is beginning to pay off in terms of fewer new hospitalizations in some locations. We owe a great deal of thanks to the healthcare workers, public health officials, scientists, and all those who support them as they battle the virus, and to all the people working in essential activities, including grocery stores, delivery companies, and municipal services, whose dedication allows many of us to stay safely at home.\n\nWhile the shutdown has yielded public health benefits, its effects on the economy have been swift and severe. In the first quarter, real output declined at a nearly 5 percent annual rate, with real consumption down over 7-1/2 percent and nonresidential business fixed investment down nearly 9 percent. And these sharp declines reflect mainly what occurred in just one month, March. In April, the unemployment rate surged to 14.7 percent, its highest level since the Great Depression. Remember, it was only this past February when the unemployment rate was a low 3.5 percent. Over the past two months, payrolls declined by more than 21 million jobs; that is nearly the same the number of jobs added over the entire 10-plus-year expansion. There were losses across all major sectors. The deterioration in the labor market is even sharper than these numbers indicate. A large number of people left the workforce last month and they do not show up in the unemployment rate, and many workers had their hours cut. Certainly, this is the worst and speediest deterioration in the labor market many of us have ever seen.\n\nBoth headline and core inflation readings moved down in March, reflecting the drop in oil prices due to both supply and demand conditions in global markets, and the start of the shutdown in activity. I expect inflation will move down further this year because the sharp pullback in demand will outweigh any upward pressure due to limited supply in certain goods and services.\n\nOur outreach at the Cleveland Fed is painting a very painful picture. Since mid-March, we have watched confidence among regional businesses and households drop from week to week as the negative effects of the virus have risen. Regional firms are taking defensive positions, pulling back from risk taking, conserving cash, putting capital expenditures on hold, and drawing on their credit lines. At the start of the shutdown, many told us that they intended to keep their employees on their payrolls, but over time, an increasing number have felt the need to lay off or furlough workers. The Cleveland Fed's national survey of consumers indicates that most respondents initially thought the virus outbreak would last less than six months. More now believe it will last one year, and a growing number think it could last two years.1\n\nIn some sense, the sharp contraction we are seeing should not come as a surprise: it is a direct result of the necessary actions taken to shut down activity to try to limit the spread of the virus. Nevertheless, the numbers are eye-popping. And it is worth noting that much of the sacrifice is being borne by the most vulnerable in our economy: lower-income workers and communities and small businesses. In fact, the job losses in April fell disproportionately on lower-wage workers. This resulted in a sharp rise in average hourly earnings in the report, which was not indicative of the state of the job market. Our outreach paints a more accurate picture. Over three-quarters of the regional community development organizations recently surveyed by the Cleveland Fed said that the low- and moderate-income areas they serve are experiencing significant disruptions that will hamper recovery.\n\nI anticipate that the second quarter will show the most severe effects on the economy. Given the unprecedented nature of the shutdown, private-sector forecasters are offering a wide range of estimates for second quarter real GDP growth, with most falling in the range of minus 25 to minus 40 percent. My own estimate is in the middle of this range, but with numbers so bad, the precision seems less relevant. I anticipate that the reported unemployment rate is likely to go up further, perhaps to 20 percent or even more.\n\nLooking ahead, parts of the country are beginning to relax some of the stay-at-home orders, and economic activity will likely begin to pick up in the second half of the year. But these are still early days, and there is considerable uncertainty around what the recovery will look like. It will depend on the evolution of the virus and the success of our methods to control its spread while it is still among us. It will also depend on how successful policy actions are in ensuring that the temporary disruption in activity does not cause more persistent damage to the economy and that the economy is well staged for a recovery. Let me discuss some of these policy actions and then talk about the outlook.\n\nUnprecedented times require unprecedented actions. Both the federal government and the Federal Reserve took action quickly. These relief efforts can be viewed as building a bridge to get households and businesses from the generally good economy we had in February to the other side of the pandemic shutdown period. The shutdown period has lengthened over time, driven by the course of the disease. So the bridge has to be longer than first assumed, and it also has to be wider, as more households and firms are in need of some kind of help.\n\nFiscal policymakers have taken significant actions, including making grants to individuals, certain businesses hit hardest by the pandemic, and states and municipalities. They have expanded unemployment benefits and have funded the Paycheck Protection Program, which provides small businesses with loans that turn into grants if they maintain their payrolls. As the magnitude of the need has come into better focus, the federal government has increased its level of support. Although the amount of support has been sizable, so is the depth of the economic downturn. In my view, further direct fiscal support will be needed if we are to avoid the longer-lasting damage to the economy that would happen if job losses become persistent and a large share of otherwise viable businesses fail.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is not legally able to make grants, but it has taken significant actions and has committed to using its full set of tools to support the economy, guided by our congressional mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability. The actions fall into three general categories. First, some of the Fed's actions focus on ensuring that financial markets have enough liquidity to continue to function well. Well-functioning financial markets allow credit to flow to households and businesses and monetary policy to effectively transmit to broader financial conditions. The Fed aggressively responded to stresses in the U.S. Treasury market by purchasing Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities and by conducting operations in the repo market. With the approval and financial backing of the U.S. Treasury, the Fed is also setting up emergency lending facilities to serve as a backstop to other key credit markets, including money market mutual funds and the commercial paper market. And the Fed is ensuring that primary dealers have access to liquidity and that our central bank counterparties abroad have access to dollar funding. Although volatility and risk spreads have not returned to pre-pandemic levels, there has been a significant lessening of stress and an improvement in market functioning in many markets since these actions have been taken.\n\nA second set of Fed actions focuses more directly on supporting the flow of credit to households, to businesses of all sizes, and to state and local governments. These programs include the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility, the Main Street Lending Program, the Primary and Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facilities, the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, and the Municipal Liquidity Facility.2 Based on consultations with both lenders and potential borrowers, the Fed adjusted the terms on some of these programs to ensure that they will support the economy as effectively as they can while safeguarding taxpayer funds.\n\nThe third category of Fed actions focuses on banks because much of the flow of credit to households and businesses relies on the banking system. The Fed has encouraged banks to use its discount window as a source of liquidity and to work with their borrowers affected by the virus. The Board of Governors has temporarily relaxed some of the regulatory requirements and supervisory oversight so that banks have greater capacity to lend in a safe and sound manner through the downturn. Our current situation highlights the value of a resilient banking system, one that builds up sufficient capital and liquidity buffers in good economic times in preparation for bad ones.\n\nWhile this is a long list of actions, the Fed continues to look for gaps where our tools can be used to benefit the economy. For example, the Board of Governors is evaluating an approach to meet the needs of nonprofits, including institutions of higher education, because they play an important role in the economy. And I shouldn't conclude this list of policy actions without discussing our usual tool of monetary policy, the federal funds rate. The FOMC has reduced its target range for the fed funds rate to 0 to 1/4 percent, and we have said that we expect to maintain this target range until we are confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Low rates cannot stop the sharp drop in activity caused by the pandemic shutdown, but once the economy begins to reopen, accommodative monetary policy will be needed for some time to support the recovery.\n\nSo what might that recovery look like? A reasonable baseline outlook is that as some of the stay-at-home restrictions are lifted, the economy will begin to grow again in the second half of this year and unemployment will begin to move down, with continued recovery in 2021. I would expect this improvement to start off slowly, with variation across sectors, because even if people can resume some of their normal activities, they need to feel some reassurance that it is safe to do so. In some industries, like travel and leisure and hospitality, it will likely take quite a while longer for activity to pick up than in others. Under this baseline, by the end of this year, output would still be below its level at the end of last year, by 5 percent or even somewhat more, and the unemployment rate would still be in the high single digits or low double digits. I expect inflation to remain low for the remainder of this year and for some time to come.\n\nAchieving this outcome depends on a number of things falling into place. It depends on there being a solid enough bridge of economic relief and support. It depends on the relaxation of stay-at-home restrictions being based on public health criteria and being done in a careful and responsible way, respecting guidelines on social distancing, mask-wearing, and hygiene. It depends on more progress being made on testing and treatments so that the virus can be better controlled and people feel safe re-engaging in activity. And it depends on the medical system being prepared to handle the periodic increases in cases that epidemiologists tell us to expect. These are a lot of conditions, which is another way of saying there is considerable risk around this outcome. It isn't difficult to imagine more pessimistic scenarios, especially if an upsurge in virus cases necessitates shutting down activity again or if there is considerably more harm in terms of business and personal bankruptcies or if instabilities in the banking system arise. At this point, I think some of the more pessimistic outcomes are almost as likely as the reasonable baseline I just described.\n\nSo I think it makes sense for policymakers to continue to monitor the economy, continue to support the flow of credit to households and businesses and the smooth functioning of financial markets, evaluate several scenarios rather than focusing only on a modal forecast, and stand ready to address the challenges that will arise as the country incrementally re-engages in economic activity as the year progresses."

            "content": "I usually discuss my views on the economy and monetary policy in public speeches. Because of the coronavirus, my upcoming speeches have been canceled, so I am providing this statement in lieu of a speech.\n\nOn March 15, 2020, I dissented from the action of the majority of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). As the post-meeting statement issued by the Committee notes, I was fully supportive of all of the actions taken to promote the smooth functioning of markets and the flow of credit to households and businesses but preferred to reduce the target range of the federal funds rate to 1/2 to 3/4 percent instead of to 0 to 1/4 percent as was done.\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak is harming communities and disrupting economic activity in the U.S. and other countries. In the Fourth Federal Reserve District and elsewhere in the country, steps are being taken to protect people’s health, including practicing social distancing, canceling gatherings, and closing schools. When they are able to, businesses have invoked work-from-home practices and many have restricted all nonessential travel. These are necessary steps taken in the interest of public health. There will be a sharp pullback in economic activity, at least in the near term, as the country focuses on tackling the challenges posed by the virus. The recent fiscal policy actions to increase access to testing and healthcare for those who are sick, to support public and private healthcare providers who are dealing with virus containment and the treatment of ill patients, and to help workers and small businesses that will be most affected by work stoppages are the types of government policy measures that can be most helpful in defending against the adverse consequences of the disease for individuals and the economy.\n\nIn the wake of the widening spread of the virus and the rising level of uncertainty it brings, global financial conditions have tightened considerably, as investors, businesses, and financial institutions reassess their tolerance for risk and their economic outlooks. In the week leading up to our recent FOMC meeting, increased stress and illiquidity were seen in financial markets, including the U.S. Treasury market, a foundational market for the world’s financial system. In response, the Federal Reserve expanded its overnight and term repurchase agreement operations to help to improve liquidity, and I fully supported this action. However, illiquid market conditions continued.\n\nLack of liquidity in financial markets is a first-order problem that can reverberate through the financial system and the economy and hinder the transmission of monetary policy throughout the economy. It is critical that there is sufficient liquidity to allow markets to function in an orderly way so that credit continues to flow to households and businesses. So I fully supported all of the actions that the Federal Reserve announced on March 15 to help ensure that there is adequate liquidity in financial markets so that trades can be made and credit can continue to flow. These measures include increasing our holdings of U.S. Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities; lowering the rate on the standing U.S. dollar liquidity swap arrangements; reducing the spread between the rate at which depository institutions can borrow at the Federal Reserve’s discount window (the primary credit rate) and the top of the federal funds rate target range to 0 basis points; instituting term discount window lending; encouraging banks to use the liquidity and intraday credit available at the Federal Reserve’s discount window and to use their own capital and liquidity buffers as they lend to households and businesses affected by the coronavirus; and reducing reserve requirement ratios to zero percent.\n\nIf market illiquidity continues, I will support our taking further actions to address funding needs, including activating facilities like those the Federal Reserve has used in the past, including the commercial paper funding facility, to help ensure access to credit by small businesses, and the term auction facility to auction term funds to depository institutions should their use of the discount window prove insufficient.\n\nWhen markets are not functioning well, the transmission mechanism of monetary policy to the economy is disrupted, and any reduction in the target federal funds rate will have less of an impact on the real economy. In current circumstances, with social distancing and the stoppage of spending activity, rate cuts are also less impactful. I dissented because I viewed a 50 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate as appropriate, in support of the liquidity actions we were taking and in light of the outlook. I did not favor returning the funds rate to zero and using up all of our interest-rate policy space at this time when the transmission mechanism of monetary policy to the economy is impaired. I preferred to stage our policy actions by first providing liquidity to improve market functioning, supported by a smaller reduction in the funds rate. This would have preserved the option of a further cut in the funds rate, if needed, for a time when market functioning had improved and such an action could be expected to be most effective in supporting the economy as it emerges from the health crisis after the medical response has been put in place, new cases of the virus have begun to stabilize, social distancing has eased, and life begins to return to some semblance of normal.\n\nDespite my dissent at our recent meeting, I have the utmost respect for Chair Jay Powell and other colleagues on the FOMC who reached a different conclusion than I did and for the Federal Reserve’s policymaking process, which allows for a full discussion of the issues and the opportunity to express dissenting views, as we all work to set monetary policy to promote our longer-run goals of price stability and maximum employment on behalf of the American public.\n\n*The views expressed here are those of the author and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee."

            "content": "A tradition at FOMC meetings is that the research directors go out for dinner the night before the meetings. Sometimes some of the Reserve Bank presidents join this group. Shortly after I had been appointed research director at the Philadelphia Fed in 2000, a group of us, which included my president and Marvin Goodfriend, were walking to dinner when an accident happened. In the midst of a robust conversation, the Philadelphia Fed president walked into a metal parking sign and cut his forehead. The prospect of losing the Bank's president to a bout of tetanus flashed through my mind: it was clear he had to go to the emergency room to get patched up. It took some convincing, but he and I headed over to George Washington University hospital where he was quickly taken to the back for triage. That was the last I saw of him for a very long time. If any of you have ever experienced the waiting area of a large urban emergency room you understand that it's not the most comfortable place to be. After a couple of hours, you can imagine my surprise when I saw Marvin Goodfriend walking through the emergency room door. Dinner was over and he had come back to check on me, knowing it was going to be a long night. I have never forgotten this act of kindness and caring for an individual. I tell you this story now to illustrate the kind of person Marvin was. He a great scholar who advanced knowledge in the field of monetary policy, not just out of intellectual curiosity but because he cared about people. He understood that if policymakers did things right they could improve how the economy works for real people. I feel very fortunate to be a part of this conference that honors Marvin Goodfriend and recognizes his many contributions to the theory and practice of monetary policy.\n\nOur session discusses the contributions Marvin made to our understanding of the role of transparency and communication in monetary policymaking. I will frame my remarks around the two things Marvin indicated in his confirmation hearing statement that he would pursue if confirmed. First, Marvin planned to draw on his \"academic and professional experience to promote policies that would further increase transparency and accountability at the Federal Reserve.\"1 This is a worthy pursuit. Congress has given the Fed a mandate to promote price stability and maximum employment, and it has given the Fed independence in making monetary policy decisions in pursuit of those goals. This independence has been shown to yield better economic outcomes. But a central bank cannot expect to remain independent from the political process unless it is held accountable for its policy decisions and is transparent about the basis for these decisions.\n\nMarvin was a strong advocate of transparency in monetary policymaking and clear communications about the strategy policymakers use to set policy. He was also a persuasive advocate: many of Marvin's suggestions that were contrary to how policy setting was being done at the time have become standard operating practice in central banking. Recall that it wasn't until 1994 that the FOMC began to explicitly announce changes in its fed funds rate target. At a time when the Federal Reserve was still quite secretive, Marvin argued that more transparency would confer social benefits by helping to align markets' and policymakers' expectations.2 Well before the Fed adopted its explicit numerical inflation target in 2012, Marvin had been explaining the benefits such an explicit goal could play in anchoring inflation expectations. He argued further that the Fed's actions and its communications needed to be designed so as to make this goal a credible commitment on the part of the Fed. One way to do this is to ensure that policymakers are taking a systematic approach to setting policy, which can help align the public's policy expectations with policy decisions, thereby helping to transmit monetary policy to the broader economy. Policy rules are one way to foster systematic policymaking and Marvin suggested that the FOMC refer to a Taylor-type rule when explaining its policy decisions.3\n\nThe FOMC has been reluctant to relinquish policymaking to following a simple rule because no one rule works well enough across a variety of economic models and circumstances, and judgment will likely always need to be a part of policymaking. Nonetheless, rules provide useful benchmarks. The Board of Governors has begun to include a discussion of rules as benchmarks in the monetary policy report.4 In some of my speeches I have referred to simple rules that have been shown to yield good economic outcomes as reference points to explain my own views of appropriate policy.5 The Cleveland Fed's website regularly updates the outcomes of seven simple policy rules across several forecasts.6\n\nOf course, one of the communications challenges for the FOMC continues to be how to convey to the public a good sense of how policy is likely to respond conditional on how the economy evolves without implying that policy is pre-committed to a particular policy path regardless of how the economy evolves. My own view is that if the Committee were willing to expand what it says in its post-meeting statement, it could give a better sense of its reaction function, its medium-run outlook, the risks around the outlook, and policy rationale. The statement could provide a summary of changes in a consistent set of indicators on inflation, inflation expectations, the unemployment rate, employment growth, output growth, and financial conditions that the Committee regularly assesses to formulate its outlook and view of appropriate policy. The statement would convey whether the accumulated changes in these indicators have materially changed the Committee's outlook. That outlook and the risks around the outlook would also be summarized. The statement would then describe the Committee's policy decision, tying that policy to the achievement of its policy goals, given the outlook and risks. The statement would articulate the considerations the Committee would take into account when determining future changes in policy to help the public anticipate how policy is likely to change in response to changes in economic developments that affect the economic outlook, without having to be prescient about how those conditions will actually evolve. Since the FOMC's assessment of risks is an important part of the policy discussion, for the four meetings a year in which the FOMC releases its Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), the Committee could release the balance of risk graphs that are part of the SEP with the other charts released at the time of the press conference, rather than waiting three weeks to release them with the minutes of the meeting. I believe enhancements like this would allow the FOMC to better control the narrative about its economic and policy views and they are consistent with Marvin's desire to increase FOMC transparency in a productive way.\n\nA second thing Marvin said in his confirmation hearing statement was that his years at the Richmond Fed \"gave him a deep appreciation of the role of the regional Reserve Banks in the Federal Reserve System,\" and that the regional structure encourages diverse perspectives and innovative thinking that he would consider in formulating monetary policy.7 In 1998, Marvin was a presenter at a workshop on the structure of the newly formed European Central Bank and laid out some of the benefits of the decentralized structure of the Federal Reserve System.8 The regional structure enhances credibility by making the institution less prone to political pressure. The diffusion of power across the 12 regional Reserve Banks helps build rapport with constituencies throughout the country. The regional structure also aids communication. It helps the institution collect information on economic and financial developments across the country. Reserve Banks have boards of directors drawn from the private sector and typically have multiple advisory councils; their presidents and staffs speak regularly with a large number of contacts representing business, labor, consumers, and banking. In a dynamic economy, anecdotal information from the regional Reserve Banks can provide early indications of changing sentiment or developing trends well before they show up in the data. Because the dispersion of activity across the country is not even, the regional structure also allows for some specialization in expertise about particular industries relevant to each region, expertise that can be called on when needed.\n\nA further benefit of the regional presence is that it helps the Fed disseminate its policy messages via speeches and presentations made by Reserve Bank officials. In addition, it provides a way to collect information about the impact of its policy in the community. An example of the power of the regional structure in action was the program of Fed Listens events that the System held as part of its ongoing review of its monetary policy framework. These events were held across the country to gain the perspectives of people with diverse backgrounds and in different economic circumstances about how our dual mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices affect them.9\n\nAs has been documented, the regional Reserve Banks have also been able to provide thought leadership within the Federal Reserve System.10 Reserve Bank economists regularly interact with academic economists and have provided a way for diverse analytical methods and innovative thinking to enter into the process of monetary policymaking, helping the institution to guard against group think and leading to better policy outcomes. Ideas such as rational expectations, time consistency, the important roles of credibility and commitment, and inflation targeting first came into the System via a Reserve Bank.11 The Federal Reserve has been criticized at times for offering a cacophony of views that can be detrimental to clear communication. However, the reality is that the economy is complex and so is monetary policymaking. Different models, techniques, and measurements need to be brought to bear in order to assess appropriate monetary policy. Participants on the FOMC bring their perspectives to the table and these perspectives are inputs into the consensus-building process. While the FOMC works hard to get to a consensus, there will inevitably be times when individual policymakers hold different views. These diverse views are shared with the public and ultimately result in better policymaking as sound ideas gain traction. Indeed, the contributions that Marvin Goodfriend made while he was an economist and policy advisor at the Richmond Fed prove this point. His arguments on the value of transparency and good communication in monetary policymaking began in the 1980s and ultimately gained traction within the System. The FOMC can thank Marvin Goodfriend for starting us on our journey toward better policy communications in support of more effective monetary policy, a journey that continues to this day.\n\n*The views expressed here are those of the author and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee."

            "content": "Good evening. I thank the Society of Professional Economists for inviting me to speak at the society’s annual dinner. It is truly an honor to join you and to count myself among the list of distinguished speakers who have addressed you at previous events. This evening I will update you on the outlook for the economy and monetary policy from my side of the pond and on the Federal Reserve’s review of our monetary policy framework: the strategy, tools, and communications we use to make monetary policy. As always, the views I’ll present are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Economic Outlook for the U.S.\n\nLet me start with the topic on everyone’s mind: the coronavirus. The recent emergence of the coronavirus in Wuhan, China, and its spread to other countries in the world, including the U.K. and the U.S., is causing considerable human suffering. It is also clouding the outlook for the global economy. This is a rapidly evolving situation that we are continuing to monitor closely. For the U.S. economy, the risks and uncertainty surrounding the outlook have increased in a short period of time. In China, the reductions in travel and shutdown in activity are widely expected to cause a sharp decline in output in China in the first quarter. China is a large player in the global economy, accounting for 16 percent of global GDP. So what happens there will have effects in other countries, especially those with strong trade ties to China. Trade and supply chain disruptions, travel spending cuts, and declines in consumer and business sentiment will also weigh on U.S. growth at least in the first half of the year, as will the extreme moves we have experienced in U.S. financial markets. These moves have reflected a sharp pullback in investors’ willingness to take on risk and the flight to quality into U.S. Treasury securities.\n\nAt this point, both the magnitude and duration of the economic effects of the virus are highly uncertain. They will depend on how the disease progresses, the efficacy of the actions countries take to help contain the spread of the virus and treat the sick, public health officials’ contingency planning and implementation of those plans, and other actions policymakers take to mitigate the effects on sentiment and economic activity. Today, the FOMC reduced its target range for the federal funds rate, our policy rate, by 50 basis points to 1 to 1-1/4 percent in response to the risks to the outlook.\n\nI am currently putting together the forecast I will submit as part of the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections, which will be released after the conclusion of our March FOMC meeting in two weeks. In structuring my remarks, I thought it would be helpful to first discuss my views on the U.S. economy before the emergence of the coronavirus, and then discuss the potential ramifications of this risk.\n\nThe economic expansion in the U.S. is now in its 11th year, the longest expansion on record. The course of the expansion has seen its ups and downs, but the resiliency of the U.S. economy has been remarkable. Last year, uncertainties around trade policy and tariffs, as well as slow global growth, clouded the U.S. outlook. In prior years, the sharp drop in oil prices and strength of the dollar weighed on the U.S. economy. Yet, with support from fiscal and monetary policy, the expansion continued. The Federal Reserve has a statutory mandate to set U.S. monetary policy to achieve the longer-run goals of price stability and maximum employment. Viewed through this lens, the U.S. economy has been performing well.\n\nLast year, real GDP grew at a 2.3 percent pace, above my 2 percent estimate of its longer-run trend and better than many economists and businesses had expected. Indeed, at the start of last year, concerns developed that a sharper slowdown in the economy was a real possibility. In light of the FOMC’s reassessment of its outlook and risks, the FOMC’s anticipated path of appropriate monetary policy flattened, leading to more accommodative financial conditions that helped to support the expansion. As the year wore on, several downside risks to the outlook worsened and new ones emerged. These risks included those associated with trade policy and slower global growth, as well as geopolitical risks surrounding the possibility of a “hard” Brexit, social unrest in Hong Kong, and rising tensions in the Middle East. The FOMC responded to these risks to the outlook by lowering the federal funds rate, our policy rate, a cumulative 75 basis points. More accommodative financial conditions, coupled with some easing of trade tensions and uncertainty by the end of the year, helped to support last year’s above-trend growth.\n\nWith respect to the mix of growth across sectors it has been a tale of two cities. Business spending has been soft, while consumer spending, which accounts for nearly 70 percent of output in the U.S., has been solid. Business investment, manufacturing, and exports declined over most of last year. Slow growth abroad, especially in Europe and China, and uncertainty over trade policy and tariffs have weakened demand for U.S. exports, which has weighed on the U.S. manufacturing and agricultural sectors. Problems with the Boeing 737 MAX airplane also weighed on investment and the decision to halt production of the plane will be a drag on U.S. growth at least in the first quarter of this year and perhaps longer. On the positive side, some of the uncertainty over trade policy and its impact on business sentiment eased with the signing of the United States—Mexico—Canada Agreement (USMCA) and the Phase One trade deal with China.\n\nIn contrast to soft business spending, consumer spending has been driving the U.S. economy forward, and that has been the case for most of the expansion. Solid fundamentals have helped to support consumer spending. Household balance sheets are healthy. Low mortgage rates contributed to the turnaround in residential investment in the second half of 2019, which rose for the first time since the end of 2017. Household income has been growing, reflecting the solid performance of the labor market.\n\nLast year, firms added an average of 175,000 jobs per month to their payrolls, and in January, an even stronger 225,000 jobs were added. So the pace of job growth in the U.S. has been well above trend, which most estimates put in the range of 75,000 to 120,000 per month. A benefit of the long expansion is that more people have been drawn into the labor force. The participation rate has held up even though the large baby boom generation is aging and leaving the workforce through retirement. The prime-age participation rate of those between ages 25 and 54 has been rising and is now at its highest level of the expansion, led by women. The unemployment rate, at 3.6 percent, is near its 50-year low; it has fallen nearly half of a percentage point over the past year. Broader measures of the unemployment rate that include discouraged workers and those working part-time who would prefer full-time work are also near historic lows.\n\nStrong labor markets mean aggregate wages are rising in the U.S., especially for lower paying jobs. But wages have not accelerated as much as one might have expected based on the reports from firms about how hard it is to find workers. This could reflect labor mix: older workers exiting the labor force typically are higher paid than those entering. It could also reflect a faster pace of automation, one way some of our business contacts are addressing labor shortages. Other contacts tell us that they don’t believe raising wages will attract qualified workers and are not willing to go that route to fill positions. It remains to be seen how much longer that situation can last, especially if labor markets tighten further.\n\nIn assessing how the labor market is doing relative to what is sustainable over the longer run, we need to remain humble. Five years ago, FOMC participants’ estimates of unemployment over the longer run ranged from 5.0 to 5.8 percent; the current range is 3.5 to 4.5 percent. I’ve brought my estimate down over time and recently I’ve been estimating a range of 4 to 4-1/4 percent. But if the unemployment rate continues at these low rates and wage pressures remain muted, I’m open to lowering my estimate again.\n\nTurning to inflation, the FOMC’s longer-run inflation goal is 2 percent, as measured by the year-over-year change in the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index. This measure moved up to 2 percent in 2018, but the increase wasn’t sustained as PCE inflation moved back down in 2019; it stood at 1.7 percent in January. Core PCE inflation, which excludes food and energy prices to strip out some volatility, also moved down last year; it now stands at 1.6 percent. But other measures of inflation show firmer readings, at or above 2 percent. These alternative gauges are not a substitute for the PCE inflation measure that the FOMC has targeted, but they do reduce my concern that inflation will continue to be weak. Inflation expectations have been relatively well anchored near 2 percent.1 Conditional on that, research done by the Cleveland Fed’s Center for Inflation Research suggests that if labor markets remain strong, then we should see the components of PCE that are more responsive to labor market conditions continue to firm, helping total PCE inflation return to our 2 percent goal on a sustainable basis over time.2\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nBecause monetary policy affects the economy with a lag, policymakers need to be forward looking and determine what interest rate path will best achieve the FOMC’s longer-run goals of price stability and maximum employment, based on the economic outlook and risks around the outlook.\n\nAt our meeting at the end of January, the FOMC maintained the target range of the federal funds rate at 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent. I agreed with this decision because it seemed appropriate to take the opportunity to assess the cumulative effects of last year’s policy easing on the economy and whether the economy is evolving according to our outlook. Even before last year’s cumulative 75 basis point reduction, monetary policy had become easier as the Committee’s view of the appropriate policy path had flattened. You can see this by looking at FOMC projections. In September 2018, the median participant thought it appropriate for the fed funds rate to rise to 3.4 percent by the end of this year. By June 2019, that rate had fallen over a percentage point, to 2.1 percent. The most recent reading from last December was 1.6 percent. I viewed this flatter policy path as being consistent with taking an opportunistic approach to raising inflation to our symmetric goal &endash; refraining from taking deliberate policy action to lift inflation more quickly but also refraining from taking deliberate action against shocks that would, for a time, move inflation somewhat above 2 percent. This approach attempts to keep inflation sustainably in a reasonable range around 2 percent, consistent with our symmetric 2 percent objective, while balancing our dual mandate goals and risks to financial stability.\n\nBefore the emergence of the coronavirus, my expectation was that output growth would be about trend this year, with solid performance in the labor market, and inflation continuing to move up gradually over the next year or two to the FOMC’s goal of 2 percent. The underlying fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong, but the coronavirus will weigh on U.S. growth at least during the first half of the year, with a pullback in spending by households and businesses. It is what economists call a negative supply shock. Much is still unknown about the disease making it difficult to predict how large and persistent the economic impact will be. Heightened and persistent uncertainty can affect the economy. It raises the possibility that negative effects on consumer and business sentiment and a pullback in investor risk-taking could last after the spread of the coronavirus has stabilized. The supply shock could evolve into a demand shock.\n\nThe extreme volatility in financial markets is noteworthy. When a shock like this hits financial markets, the first task of central bankers is to ensure that there is sufficient liquidity and funding to allow markets to continue to function in an orderly way in the midst of extreme volatility, and to assure the public that they are prepared to act as necessary. Fed Chair Jay Powell issued such a statement last Friday. The Bank of England, Bank of Japan, and European Central Bank took similar steps; the International Monetary Fund and World Bank jointly stated that they stand ready to help affected countries with emergency financing, policy advice, and technical assistance; and the G7 finance ministers and central bankers released a joint statement this morning reaffirming their commitment to use all appropriate policy tools to support growth and safeguard against downside risks. Times like this underscore the value of an effective framework of financial system regulation and supervision to help ensure that the financial system is well-capitalized and resilient, enabling financial institutions to better withstand volatility so that they can continue to extend credit to households and businesses.\n\nWhile the economic fundamentals underlying the U.S. economy remain strong, in light of the risks to the outlook and guided by our statutory goals to promote price stability and maximum employment, today the FOMC lowered its target range for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to 1 to 1-1/4 percent. The virus’s near-term effects on the supply side of the economy, including the reduction in activity from closures, reduced social interactions, cuts in travel and tourism, and disruptions in supply chains, are not things that can be affected by lowering interest rates. However, the action taken by the FOMC can help support confidence and ease financial conditions of indebted households and firms, thereby helping to mitigate potential demand-side impacts of the virus. It was within this context that I supported today’s interest rate reduction, while recognizing that appropriate actions taken by other parties, including global public health officials and fiscal authorities, would likely do more to support confidence and spending by helping to contain the spread of the virus, ensure adequate healthcare services are available to the sick, speed development of a vaccine, and provide relief to workers and smaller businesses that are affected by the pullback in activity.\n\nReview of the Federal Reserve’s Monetary Policy Framework\n\nLet me now step away from current monetary policy and discuss future monetary policy. While the U.S. Congress has specified the Fed’s longer-run monetary policy goals of price stability and maximum employment, it has given the Fed considerable independence in choosing the framework used to achieve these goals.3 The FOMC currently uses a flexible inflation-targeting framework. This framework recognizes that, over the longer run, monetary policy can influence only inflation and not the underlying real structural aspects of the economy such as the natural rate of unemployment or maximum employment, but that monetary policy can be used to help offset shorter-run fluctuations in employment around maximum employment. The framework is briefly described in the FOMC’s statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy, which was originally released in January 2012.4\n\nThe flexible inflation-targeting framework has served the FOMC well and has been effective in promoting our monetary policy goals. But the economic environment of the future is likely to differ from the past environment in some important dimensions. The expected slowdown in population growth and lower labor force participation rates due to changes in demographics will weigh on long-run economic growth, the natural rate of unemployment, and the longer-term equilibrium interest rate.5 This is true not only in the U.S., but in other advanced economies as well.6 Real interest rates are expected to remain lower than in past decades. If so, this means there will be less room for monetary policymakers to cushion against a negative economic shock by lowering its policy rate and a higher likelihood that the policy rate will hit its effective lower bound more frequently. In this case, tools including forward guidance and balance-sheet policies such as longer-term asset purchases will need to be used more often. In past recessions, the FOMC has reduced the federal funds rate target by 5 to 6 percentage points. With interest rates expected to stay low, that policy space will not be available. Moreover, in some economic models, the proximity to the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates can impart a downward bias to inflation, making it harder for central banks to hit their inflation targets. And inflation now appears to be less responsive to resource slack than it once was.\n\nIn light of these structural changes in the economic environment and our experience during the Great Recession and its aftermath, the FOMC has engaged in a review of our monetary policy framework to ensure it will continue to be effective in maintaining macroeconomic stability in the future. The review covers our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communications, taking as given our statutory mandate and that an inflation rate of 2 percent is most consistent over the long run with this mandate.\n\nSince the FOMC announced its review in November 2018, it has been spending time at its regularly scheduled meetings considering various aspects of its framework.7 The Committee is evaluating different strategies such as whether to target inflation, average inflation, or the price level. These latter two strategies attempt to make up for past misses on the inflation target; in contrast, targeting inflation lets bygones be bygones. We are also analyzing the types of policy tools and best formulations of these tools that could be used to add accommodation in a future downturn, once our policy rate has been brought down to its effective lower bound. The FOMC did not use negative interest rates during the Great Recession and its aftermath, but our review is open minded and we are taking a look at the experience of other central banks that have used negative interest rates to address low inflation and low growth. A third aspect of our framework review is monetary policy communications. Policy communications are an important part of policymaking because they can increase the effectiveness of monetary policy in a number of ways. For example, communications can help to anchor inflation expectations at the target and they can better convey the rationale for policymakers’ decisions, helping to transmit monetary policy throughout the economy. Various aspects of the FOMC’s communications are being evaluated, including forward guidance used as a policy tool at the effective lower bound on interest rates.\n\nIn addition to internal discussions, the Fed engaged with academics at a research conference held last June; selected papers from the conference were published in the International Journal of Central Banking8. We also held a series of Fed Listens events across the U.S. to gain the perspectives of people with diverse backgrounds and in different economic circumstances about how our dual mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices affect them. The Cleveland Fed held our Fed Listens event at our Community Development Policy Summit in Cincinnati.9 One of the main themes that came out of this discussion was the importance of jobs. People were less concerned about inflation; in fact, some were skeptical of the Fed’s view that inflation was too low, because in their experience it is costing more, not less, to get by. This lack of concern about inflation partially reflects the success the Fed has had in achieving price stability. If inflation were to get out of hand again as it was in the 1970s and early1980s in the U.S., it would become a major concern again for everyone. From an individual’s perspective, low inflation is not a problem. But inflation running below our goal is a problem for the macroeconomy and for monetary policymakers. When inflation runs persistently below our goal, expected inflation can move lower, which can put further downward pressure on inflation and pull down interest rates, which then puts further constraints on monetary policy’s ability to stabilize the economy.\n\nOur framework review seeks to ensure that we are approaching monetary policy in the most effective way to achieve our mandated longer-run goals of maximum employment and price stability. The minutes of the FOMC meetings summarize the initial impressions of the Committee participants on the topics raised in the framework review. I’d like to conclude with some of my thoughts on the three broad areas of the review.\n\nRegarding monetary policy strategy, in my view, while make-up strategies like price-level targeting tend to work well in some models, I am skeptical that they would be as effective in the real world because their benefits depend on high levels of credibility and commitment. For example, I question whether the public will think it credible that policymakers will keep interest rates low to make up for past shortfalls even when demand is growing strongly or that the public will believe that policymakers will tighten policy when demand is weak after a supply shock has raised the price level. Instead of adopting a make-up strategy, I think some changes to communication could help to convey a better sense of the FOMC’s approach and commitment to its policy goals. For example, I think it would be useful for us to explain that it is normal for inflation to vary in a range around our target due to a number of factors, including measurement issues, idiosyncratic shocks, and economic developments. It would also be useful to explain that the lower general level of interest rates likely to prevail in the future and changes in inflation dynamics suggest that inflation would likely be lower during economic downturns. In terms of strategy, after a period when inflation has been running below our goal for a sustained period, I would be comfortable with inflation moving somewhat higher than 2 percent for a time during economic expansions in order to help anchor inflation expectations and achieve our long-run symmetric 2 percent inflation goal.\n\nRegarding tools, I believe that asset purchases and forward guidance have been and will continue to be useful tools at the effective lower bound. I am skeptical that the benefits of negative interest rates would outweigh the costs in the U.S. The experiences in Europe and Japan suggest that negative rates may have some beneficial effects on bank lending and so far have not had adverse effects on market functioning or financial stability. But the financial markets in the U.S. are considerably different and are less bank-centric than those in Europe or Japan.\n\nRegarding policy communications, I have spoken often about improvements the FOMC might make to the way we explain the rationale for our policy decisions, thereby making monetary policy more effective.10 Indeed, for forward guidance at the effective lower bound to work, people need to understand that we have entered a different mode and are using it as a policy tool. But that means they need to understand our policy setting in normal times: in particular, the goals we are trying to achieve; how we use changes in the fed funds rate to influence inflation, economic activity, and the labor market; and the key elements in our reaction function. A post-meeting policy statement that gives a fuller view of the Committee’s outlook and attendant risks to the outlook, and that ties the Committee’s policy decisions to that outlook and assessment of risks would be a worthwhile enhancement.11\n\nThese are some of my own thoughts, but our review is ongoing and Federal Reserve Chair Powell has indicated that the FOMC will publicly report the outcome of the review once it is completed.\n\nOne can view the FOMC’s review of its monetary policy framework as a form of good governance that is becoming a standard best practice of central banks around the world. The Bank of Canada reviews its framework to support the renewal of its agreement with the government on its inflation target every five years. In 2014, the Bank of England undertook an external review of its policy communications led by former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.12 And earlier this year, the European Central Bank launched a review of its monetary policy strategy, which the ECB expects to conclude by the end of this year.13 In an economic environment of low interest rates that are likely to prevail for some time to come, reviewing the monetary policy framework is not only good governance, it is a prudent step to ensuring that monetary policy continues to be effective at providing macroeconomic stability."

            "content": "Good afternoon. I thank the National Association for Business Economics for inviting me to participate in this year’s economic policy conference. I had the pleasure of speaking at this conference five years ago and I recall a very engaging question-and-answer session following my remarks. I hope we will have a similar session today because I believe that one of the responsibilities (and pleasures) of being a monetary policymaker is listening to other people’s perspectives and learning from them. Today, I will give you an update of my own take on the economy and monetary policy for the coming year. As always, the views I’ll present today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nEconomic Growth\n\nThe U.S. economic expansion is now in its 11th year, making this the longest expansion on record. It has not been a smooth ride; risks of various kinds have risen and ebbed over the journey. Last year, uncertainties around trade policy and tariffs and slow growth abroad clouded the outlook. In prior years, the sharp drop in oil prices and strength of the dollar weighed on the U.S. economy. Yet, with support from fiscal and monetary policy, the expansion continued. The length of the expansion is a true testament to the resiliency of the U.S. economy. For 2020, my outlook is for the expansion to continue, with growth around trend, solid performance in the labor market, and low and stable inflation. As is always the case, there are risks to the outlook, including the recent emergence of the coronavirus in Wuhan, China. There are also longer-run challenges for the U.S. economy, including low productivity growth, limits on access to education and training for the jobs of the future, and rising income inequality. But viewed through the lens of the Fed’s statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability, the economy has been performing well and I expect that to continue.\n\nLast year, real GDP grew at a 2.3 percent pace, down a bit from 2018’s 2.5 percent pace. My estimate of longer-run growth is 2 percent, so the economy has been growing somewhat above trend. Indeed, last year’s performance was better than many economists and businesses had expected. Before the start of last year, it was widely anticipated that output growth would be slower than in 2018 because the effects of the fiscal stimulus from the tax cuts and federal government spending were expected to wane and financial conditions were expected to be less accommodative. But as 2019 started, concerns developed that a sharper slowdown in the economy was a real possibility. In light of the FOMC’s reassessment of the outlook and risks, the FOMC’s anticipated path of appropriate monetary policy flattened, leading to more accommodative financial conditions that helped to support the expansion. As the year wore on, several downside risks to the outlook worsened and new ones emerged. These risks include those associated with trade policy and slower global growth, as well as geopolitical risks surrounding the possibility of a “hard” Brexit, social unrest in Hong Kong, and rising tensions in the Middle East. The FOMC responded to these risks to the outlook by lowering the federal funds rate a cumulative 75 basis points. More accommodative financial conditions and some easing of trade tensions and uncertainty by the end of the year helped to support last year’s above-trend growth.\n\nWith respect to the mix of growth across sectors, it is a tale of two cities. For most of the expansion, consumer spending, which accounts for nearly 70 percent of output, has been driving the economy forward; the strength in business spending has varied and it has been weak of late. Although consumer spending softened a bit in the fourth quarter, this isn’t troubling as it followed strong readings in the second and third quarters. Solid fundamentals will continue to support consumer spending this year. The strong performance of the labor market has brought more people into the labor force and has sustained wage growth, so household incomes are rising. Measures of consumer confidence are at high levels. And household balance sheets, at the aggregate level, are healthy. Equity prices have been rising and the interest rates paid by consumers are at low levels.\n\nThese same factors have led to a pickup in housing market activity over the past year. Residential investment turned around in the second half of 2019, rising for the first time since the end of 2017. On a year-over-year basis, housing starts, new single-family home sales, and existing home sales all posted double-digit rates of increase at the end of last year. Demand is outstripping supply. One indicator of this is the month’s supply of homes on the market. At the December sales pace, the current inventory of homes up for sale would last three months. This is the lowest level in the history of the series, which dates back to 1982. As a consequence, house prices are beginning to accelerate.\n\nIn contrast to the strength in consumer spending and the improvement in housing conditions, business investment, manufacturing, and exports have been weak, declining over most of last year. Slow growth abroad, especially in Europe and China, and uncertainty over trade policy and tariffs have weakened demand for U.S. exports, which has weighed on the U.S. manufacturing and agricultural sectors. The uncertainty also dampened business sentiment and caused some firms to postpone planned investment. If it continues, the low level of investment will be troubling for the economy over the longer run. The economy’s long-run growth potential is determined by the growth of its labor and capital stock and how productively it uses these inputs. Without investment in new technologies and capital, productivity will continue to be weak, dampening the economy’s growth potential and living standards.\n\nFortunately, the picture for 2020 is somewhat better on the trade front. Some of the uncertainty over trade policy eased with the signing of the United States—Mexico—Canada Agreement (USMCA) and the Phase One trade deal with China; this reduction in uncertainty should prove positive for investment. Nevertheless, some long-lasting effects arising from the trade war are likely. For example, some of our business contacts report that foreign firms have reoriented their supply chains away from U.S. firms, which means these exports may be permanently lost.\n\nThe start of the year brought some tentative signs that growth abroad in our trading partners was stabilizing. But offsetting the positive news on foreign growth and trade are the continuing problems with the Boeing 737 MAX airplane. The decision to halt production of the plane will be a drag on growth at least in the first quarter of this year and perhaps longer.\n\nIn addition, the coronavirus is exacting a heavy human toll. It is also clouding the near-term economic outlook for China, with potential spillovers to the rest of the world. Most estimates of the possible impact draw on the experience of the SARS epidemic in 2003. A Brookings study suggested that that epidemic reduced growth in China by about 1 percentage point in 2003 and growth in the U.S. by only about 0.1 percentage point.1 However, there are many differences between 2003 and 2020. China was not as big a player in the global economy back then as it is today, so there is the potential for a larger impact, through decreases in tourism and travel, reductions in consumer spending in China and by Chinese tourists elsewhere, disruptions in supply chains, and a pullback in investors’ willingness to take on risk. On the other hand, China now has more resources with which to address the epidemic than it had in 2003 and early actions have been taken to try to limit the spread and cushion the Chinese economy. This might mean a larger negative impact on growth in China in the near term but perhaps a less protracted one. At this point, it is difficult to assess the magnitude of the economic effects, but this new source of uncertainty is something I will be carefully monitoring. I’ve incorporated it as a downside risk to my modal forecast, which calls for growth to continue at trend, slightly slower than the pace of last year, with continued healthy consumption growth and some pickup in investment spending.\n\nLabor Markets\n\nSupporting this forecast is the strength we’ve seen in labor markets. I expect solid labor market conditions to continue. Last year, firms added an average of 175,000 jobs per month to their payrolls, and in January, an even stronger 225,000 jobs were added. So the pace of job growth has been well above trend, which most estimates put in the range of 75,000 to 120,000 per month. The unemployment rate, at 3.6 percent, is near its 50-year low; it has fallen nearly half of a percentage point over the past year. A broader measure of the unemployment rate, the U-6 measure, which includes workers who haven’t been actively looking for work and those working part-time who would prefer full-time work, is under 7 percent, near its lowest level since the start of this series in January 1994. In the Cleveland Fed’s District, which includes the state of Ohio, western Pennsylvania, eastern Kentucky, and the panhandle of West Virginia, the unemployment rate is about 4-1/4 percent, near the lowest levels seen in two decades. My expectation is that job growth will remain solid and the unemployment rate will remain near its current level this year.\n\nA benefit of the long expansion is that more people have been drawn into the labor force. Even though demographic forces such as the aging of the large baby boom generation mean people are leaving the workforce through retirement, the participation rate has held up. The prime-age participation rate of those between ages 25 and 54 has been rising and is now at its highest level of the expansion. Women have been leading this rise. The participation rate for prime-age women has risen over 2 percentage points over the past two years, and the rate for men has edged up as well.2 Business contacts have continually reported that they are having trouble finding qualified workers. Some tell us that they have turned away orders and would be able to take on more work if they could attract and retain the employees they need.\n\nAggregate wages have been rising in line with productivity growth and inflation, and we’ve seen stronger wage gains for lower paying jobs. But wages have not accelerated as much as one might have expected based on the reports from firms about how hard it is to find workers. It could be a question of labor mix, with those older workers exiting the labor force typically being higher paid than those entering. It could also reflect a faster pace of automation. Some of our business contacts have told us they are substituting machines for workers rather than increasing wages. Others tell us they don’t believe that raising wages will attract qualified workers and are not willing to go that route to fill positions. It remains to be seen how much longer that situation can last, especially if labor markets tighten further.\n\nAssessing how the labor market is doing relative to what is sustainable over the longer run is a key factor when setting monetary policy, as maximum employment and price stability are our mandated goals. The behavior of the labor market over this expansion has led me to believe that one needs to be humble about this assessment and let not only past experience but also current experience be a guide. In fact, the strong performance of the labor market over this expansion has made many economists reevaluate what unemployment rate is sustainable over the longer run and consistent with price stability. This is true of participants on the FOMC as well. Five years ago, their estimates of the unemployment rate over the longer run ranged from 5.0 to 5.8 percent; the current range is 3.5 to 4.5 percent.3 I’ve brought my estimate down over time and recently have been estimating a range of 4 to 4 1/4 percent. But if the unemployment rate continues at these low rates and wage pressures remain muted, I’m open to lowering my estimate again.\n\nInflation\n\nTurning to inflation, the FOMC’s longer-run inflation goal is 2 percent, as measured by the year-over-year change in the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index. This measure moved up to 2 percent in 2018, but the increase wasn’t sustained as PCE inflation moved back down in 2019 and stood at 1.6 percent in December. Core PCE inflation, which excludes food and energy prices to strip out some volatility, also moved down to 1.6 percent. Although core inflation is often used as an indicator of the underlying trend in inflation, it is important to remember that a sizable fraction of the variability of core inflation is due to idiosyncratic factors, for example, changes in Medicare reimbursement rates or cell phone prices. So to gauge the underlying trend I look at a broad set of inflation measures. These measures show firmer inflation readings. The CPI measures typically run about 1/4 percentage point above the PCE measures. In January, CPI inflation rose to 2.5 percent and core CPI inflation was 2.3 percent. The Dallas Fed’s trimmed-mean PCE inflation measure has been stable at 2 percent. The Cleveland Fed’s new Center for Inflation Research is carrying on the pioneering work done at the Bank to develop better measures of underlying inflation trends.4 In January, the Cleveland Fed’s median and trimmed-mean CPI measures were 2.9 and 2.4 percent, respectively, and our median PCE inflation measure was 2.6 percent in December. These alternative gauges are not a substitute for the PCE inflation measure that the FOMC has targeted, but they do reduce some of my concern that inflation will continue to be weak. Indeed, research done by our Center suggests that if labor markets remain strong, then we should see the components of the PCE that are more responsive to labor market conditions continue to firm, helping total PCE inflation return to our 2 percent goal on a sustainable basis over time.5\n\nThis forecast depends on inflation expectations remaining stable. If firms and households begin to expect that lower inflation will prevail over the longer run, the Fed would have a harder time hitting its inflation target, because theory suggests that these expectations influence actual price- and wage-setting decisions. Lower inflation expectations could lead to lower inflation. In my view, expectations have been relatively well anchored near 2 percent. The movements in the monthly readings of some of the measures have been within the typical variation seen in these measures. The Cleveland Fed produces a measure of inflation expectations that combines survey readings with market-based readings; the 5-year/5-year-forward reading on inflation from this measure has been fairly stable over the past 12 months, although somewhat under 2 percent.\n\nMy projection is that PCE inflation will move up to our 2 percent goal in line with the FOMC’s objective, but this will be a gradual return over the next year or two.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nBecause monetary policy affects the economy with a lag, policymakers need to be forward looking and determine what interest rate path will best achieve the FOMC’s dual mandate goals of price stability and maximum employment over the longer run, based on the economic outlook and risks around the outlook.\n\nAt our meeting at the end of January, the FOMC maintained the target range of the federal funds rate at 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent. I agreed with this decision. Keeping the fed funds rate at current levels for a time gives us an opportunity to assess the cumulative effects of last year’s policy easing on the economy and to assess whether the economy is evolving according to our outlook. Even before last year’s cumulative 75 basis point reduction, monetary policy had become easier as the Committee’s view of the appropriate policy path had flattened. You can see this by looking at FOMC projections. In September 2018, the median participant thought it appropriate for the fed funds rate to rise to 3.4 percent by the end of this year. By June 2019, that rate had fallen over a percentage point, to 2.1 percent. The most recent reading from last December is 1.6 percent. Given the risks from slower growth abroad and trade policy uncertainty, I believed a flatter policy path was appropriate, although I would have preferred to wait for clearer evidence that the downside risks were materially affecting the economy before actually cutting the funds rate last year. Still, I am comfortable with the current stance of policy. While some of the downside risks have eased, including trade tensions, the possibility of a “hard” Brexit, and continued weakening of global growth, other risks like the coronavirus have emerged. In my view, our current policy stance is appropriate given the outlook of growth near its trend pace, solid labor market conditions, and inflation rates not far from the FOMC’s symmetric 2 percent objective, and given the risks around the outlook that we continue to monitor.\n\nI am committed to achieving both of our dual mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability. As many of you know, the FOMC is in the process of assessing our monetary policy framework, including our strategy, tools, and policy communications. As part of that review, we conducted Fed Listens events around the country to hear from various groups about how our dual mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices affect them. The Cleveland Fed held our Fed Listens event at our Community Development Policy Summit in Cincinnati.6 One of the main themes that came out of this discussion was the importance of jobs. People were less concerned about inflation; in fact, some were skeptical of the Fed’s view that inflation was too low, because in their experience it is costing more, not less, to get by. This lack of concern about inflation partially reflects the success the Fed has had in achieving price stability. It’s a tribute to the late Paul Volcker, former Fed chair. If inflation were to get out of hand again as it was in the 1970s and early 1980s, it would become a major concern again for everyone. From an individual’s perspective, low inflation is not a problem. But inflation running below our goal is a problem for the macroeconomy and for monetary policymakers. When inflation runs persistently below our goal, expected inflation can move lower, putting further downward pressure on inflation and pulling down interest rates. Lower rates constrain monetary policy’s ability to stabilize the economy by giving us less room to reduce rates in the event of a future downturn. So hitting our symmetric inflation goal is an important part of ensuring a healthy economy over the longer run.\n\nWe have been undershooting our inflation goal for some time, so a natural question is whether policymakers should add even further accommodation to spur a faster return of inflation to our goal. I would not favor that at this time. In my view, doing so would raise the risk of generating imbalances that would threaten the expansion and undermine our employment goal. Even given the low level of interest rates, equity prices and commercial real estate valuations are elevated; corporate debt levels are high; and underwriting standards on leveraged loans are weak. While commercial banks are well capitalized, their capital buffers are falling, which could potentially limit their ability to lend through the cycle should a negative shock hit. I think we should be particularly attuned to financial market developments in the current environment.\n\nGiven the low level of the funds rate and the outlook for growth and the labor market, and the fact that inflation rates are already near our objective, I support taking an opportunistic approach to raising inflation to our symmetric goal. This entails leaving policy at current levels for a time to support a firming in inflation rates, refraining from taking deliberate policy action at this point to try to lift inflation more quickly, and also refraining from taking deliberate action against shocks that would, for a time, move inflation somewhat above 2 percent. This approach attempts to keep inflation sustainably in a reasonable range around 2 percent, consistent with our symmetric 2 percent objective, while balancing our dual mandate goals and risks to financial stability. I don’t view this opportunistic approach as ignoring the inflation undershoot because it works to move inflation up by keeping policy more accommodative than if the Committee were behaving as it has in the past, as illustrated by the range of monetary policy rules that the Cleveland Fed publishes on its website.7\n\nIn assessing the appropriate path of policy going forward, I will be monitoring incoming economic and financial data and reports from District contacts to assess the outlook and risks to the outlook. My current view is that monetary policy is well calibrated to support our dual mandate goals, and a patient approach to policy changes is appropriate unless there is a material change to the outlook."

            "content": "Welcome to this session entitled “Hall of Mirrors: Feedback Between Monetary Policy and Financial Markets.”1 I thank Anil Kashyap and Ric Mishkin for inviting me to moderate today’s panel discussion. I have been attending the U.S. Monetary Policy Forum for many years, and I marvel at the organizers’ prescience in anticipating the issues confronting monetary policymakers. This panel’s topic is no exception. It ties together various aspects of modern monetary policymaking, including the information content in asset prices, the role of expectations in monetary policy transmission, policy communications, and the wisdom of crowds.\n\nAs most of you know, the title of the session harkens back to a 2004 speech made by former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke. Speaking about how monetary policymakers can gain insights from asset price movements, he pointed out that if policymakers are too concerned about meeting market expectations for fear of creating excess volatility, then this undermines the information content of asset prices. As he put it: “Such a strategy quickly degenerates into a hall of mirrors” in which the policymaker is at once sending signals to the market about future policy and trying to gain insights from the market.\n\nHowever, if the market’s expectations get too far out of alignment with those of the policymaker, the policymaker finds herself in a difficult situation. If financial markets expect easier policy than what the policymaker feels is appropriate and she chooses to accommodate the markets’ belief, this suboptimal policy could lead to macroeconomic instability in the future. If, instead, the policymaker chooses to disappoint the markets, she risks increased volatility and an unwanted tightening of financial conditions. Even a policymaker who declares that surprising the markets won’t deter her from following appropriate policy might find that this declaration is not time consistent when faced with such a choice.\n\nAt the same time, as Amato, Morris, and Shin (2002) point out, the policymaker’s view of the world may not be correct. If policymakers are successful in getting agents to accept their view, then the informational content one might glean from agents’ decisions just reflects back the policymakers’ view and not the agents’ own private information. The potential is that asset prices could deviate far from fundamentals if the policymakers’ view is wrong.\n\nThe question is: how can policymakers best avoid the “expectations trap” (Chari, Christiano, Eichenbaum, 1998), and utilize the information content in asset prices?\n\nBernanke emphasizes the role of communications. In his view, policymakers should pay attention to the market’s expectations for policy because they are a check on how well the central bank is communicating. When expectations are not well aligned, either policymakers aren’t communicating the rationale for their own policy views very well, or they are communicating, but market participants aren’t buying it. Thus, market expectations speak directly to two factors that are paramount in effective monetary policymaking: transparency and credibility.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has been on a journey of increased transparency for some time now in order to better communicate the Committee participants’ current views on the economic outlook and appropriate policy.2 Nonetheless, the Committee’s views and those of the market are not always in alignment.\n\nIn these cases, policymakers shouldn’t just capitulate to the market.3 But they should be open to reassessing their view of the economy based on all incoming information, including the views of participants in the financial markets. We have to be open to the possibility that the markets’ view may be more in alignment with fundamentals than the policymakers’ view. Significant misalignment between the central bank’s views and market expectations should also prompt the chair to augment communications in intermeeting periods and to consider improvements in how the central bank explains the rationale for its outlook for the economy, the risks around the outlook, and its view of appropriate monetary policy based on the outlook and risks.\n\nI don’t want to underplay the challenges of formulating effective policy communications. Consider the FOMC’s post-meeting statement. It is pretty sparse. The chair’s press conference does give more context, but I’d like to see more of that information in the Committee’s statement, to provide more of a sense of our outlook and why we think our anticipated policy path is appropriate. Our assessment of risks is an important part of the policy discussion. We should provide more information on risks in the statement and consider releasing the balance of risk graphs that are part of the SEP with the other charts released at the time of the press conference. Currently, these charts are released with the minutes three weeks later. What I’m advocating would result in a longer statement — which may not be fashionable in the age of Twitter. But I think it would help us escape the statement’s “Hotel California” problem: words check in but they don’t check out. The market hangs on each word in the statement, so there is a legitimate reluctance to change any word from one meeting to the next because of the signal it might send to the market. If we used more words to explain things, each word would carry less weight. The language would be less boilerplate. This would free us to explain our rationale and change the statement’s language productively from meeting to meeting without fear of sending the wrong message.\n\nOne last comment before I introduce our speakers. I’ve been talking about the market’s expectations as if there is one monolithic market. But, of course, that isn’t correct. The market is made up of many individual participants. In liquid markets, asset prices aggregate these individual investors’ beliefs about the current and future state of the economy, but the diversity of views can still matter. The so-called taper tantrum in mid-2013 comes to mind. Before the FOMC communicated that tapering its asset purchases might soon be appropriate, it looked as if market expectations were in alignment. Nonetheless, financial markets reacted sharply when the communication actually came. Both Jeremy Stein (2014) and Stan Fischer (2017) have discussed the episode, pointing out that the distribution of views across market participants and how strongly they hold these views are important determinants of how asset prices might react to an announcement, even one that is aligned with the median view in the market. The point being that even the best policy communications won’t be able to prevent market swings all the time and policymakers and markets need to understand that.\n\nAs you can see, there are many things to talk about in this session. Our panelists bring broad academic, market, and central bank experience. Their bios are in your booklet, but briefly:\n\nWe’ll hear from our speakers in the order in the program and then open it up to participants for discussion and questions."

Another reason is that our monetary policy is actually more effective if people understand how it works. I am proud to be on the board of the Council for Economic Education (CEE), which is a champion of both economic and financial literacy for students from kindergarten through high school. The CEE recently released the 2020 Survey of the States, a biennial look into the state of K-12 economic and financial education in the U.S.1 The results show that progress is being made. Twenty-one states now require high school students to take a course in personal finance, four more than in 2018, and 25 states now require an economics course, three more than in 2018. The CEE is working to encourage more states to adopt such requirements because research indicates that they lead students to make more informed real-world economic decisions, such as those pertaining to college financing. I am also proud that the Cleveland Fed is an active partner with schools across the Fourth Federal Reserve District to improve the financial skills of students and members of our community. You are welcome to visit our learning centers in Cleveland or Cincinnati, but some of our materials are also available online for those of you who'd prefer to stay in the warmth of the Florida sun.2\n\nI want to spend my time with you today focusing on one particular aspect of our country's financial system, one that is less understood and is undergoing rapid change: the payments system. The Federal Reserve System plays an important role in helping to ensure that our payments system is efficient, secure, and effective. I recently became chair of the Financial Services Policy Committee (FSPC), which oversees the provision of payment services to depository institutions and the U.S. Treasury by the 12 Federal Reserve Banks. So as a follow-up to the discussion we just heard about new forms of payments, I thought it would be useful to provide you with an update on some of the Fed's ongoing work to modernize the U.S. payments system, and then offer a policymaker's perspectives on some payments innovations. Of course, the views I will present today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee\n\nFedNowSM Service3 Will Be a New Service for Making Real-Time Payments in the U.S.\n\nIt shouldn't surprise anyone when I say that a well-functioning and secure payments system is an essential ingredient for a sound economy. Like highways, bridges, and railroads, the payments system is a critical part of the infrastructure of our country; everyone has a stake in a healthy U.S. payments system. According to the 2019 Federal Reserve Payments Study, noncash payments have been growing by almost 7 percent per year since 2015; these include debit and credit card transactions, checks, and direct deposit and automatic payment transactions that go through the automated clearing house system. In 2018 there were 174 billion noncash transactions made in the U.S. — more than 500 payments for every American.4 These transactions totaled over $97 trillion. As the nation's central bank, the Federal Reserve works to promote the macroeconomic and financial stability of our $21 trillion economy and the Fed's oversight of and participation in the payments system is a vital part of this work.\n\nLast year, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System announced that the Fed would develop a new service called FedNow. This new interbank payments service will allow people all over the country to make payments securely and in real time, at all times of the day and night, including on weekends and holidays.5 Although payments made through mobile apps and the internet appear to be instantaneous, the underlying infrastructure does not move funds immediately from the payer's bank to the payee's bank. Currently, this takes several days. With FedNow, you'll be able to send and receive payments securely at any time and anywhere, and get access to funds within seconds. This speed will provide economic benefits, making it easier for individuals and businesses to manage money and make time-sensitive payments. This service, along with similar private-sector alternatives like The Clearing House's Real-Time Payments (RTP©) service, may be especially beneficial for those households and businesses that don't have as much funds in reserve, allowing them to avoid late fees when making last minute payments. Similarly, workers who aren't getting regular payroll checks will be able to get faster access to their wages.\n\nThe history of the U.S. payments system shows the need for the FedNow service. Over the decades, the evolution of the payments landscape has led to a patchwork of payment vehicles and providers, often lacking interoperability with one another or the ability to combine billing invoice information with a payment. Our payments system is concentrated in the banking system but is quite complex. Currently, there are several platforms for making payments. The automated clearing house (ACH), which was conceived of in the late 1960s, handles smaller value, regularly scheduled payments, like your paycheck or your utility bills, via batch processing of a group of transactions during a predetermined time period. Although ACH was conceived as a way to eliminate the use of paper checks, checks are still used for making some payments. There are credit and debit card systems as well. This complexity makes it harder to foster payments innovations. Indeed, not all parts of the U.S. payments system have kept up with the evolving expectations and demands of consumers and businesses. This has allowed nonbank providers, including fintech companies, to enter the payments business, offering consumers and businesses more modern payments methods that clear and settle on the bank-centric traditional payments infrastructure. The consumers and businesses enjoy a more user-friendly experience, and while it appears that the payments are moving in real time, the actual clearing and settlement of payment instructions on both sides of these transactions take place through the traditional system: transactions are settled in periodic batches, processed one or more days later, and available only during regular banking hours. Of course, this creates some risk because banks might choose to make final funds available to the customer before receiving the covering funds from the payer's bank.\n\nThis highlights the need for an updated U.S. payments system that is faster from end-to-end and meets the needs of consumers, businesses, and financial institutions in a safe and efficient way. To address this need, the Fed engaged in several years of study and consultation with a diverse group of payment system stakeholders, including financial institutions of all sizes, private-sector payment networks, businesses, consumers, fintech companies, and software vendors. Those stakeholders made clear that they wanted access to enhanced interbank settlement mechanisms 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. This was reinforced when the vast majority of respondents to a 2018 Federal Reserve request for comment advocated for the Fed to build a faster payment system.6 In response to this demand, the Federal Reserve has embarked on building a resilient real-time payments system that will enable our nation's more than 10,000 banks and credit unions of all sizes to use their existing electronic connections to the Fed and their existing Fed settlement accounts to process real-time retail payments for consumers and businesses. This payments system modernization will bring the U.S. in line with other countries that have developed faster payment networks, including Australia, the U.K., Singapore, India, Mexico, and some European countries.\n\nBefore making the decision to move forward with the FedNow service, the Fed determined that the service met its established criteria for offering a new payments service. These criteria are, first, that it is a service that other providers alone cannot be expected to provide with reasonable effectiveness, scope, and equity; second, that there is a clear public benefit; and, third, that the Fed be will able to fully recover its costs of providing the service over the long run.\n\nIt is important to know that the Fed will offer FedNow alongside payments services operated by private-sector companies, just as it does today with check, ACH, and wire transfer services. This will encourage competition among operators and provide an added layer of resiliency in the event of downtime at any one of the real-time payment systems. The Fed is working closely with financial institutions and technology firms to prepare for an anticipated launch of the FedNow service in 2023 or 2024. An official launch date has not been announced, as ongoing work to finalize business requirements and design features to meet the needs of potential users of the service will help determine the timeline for implementation. The project is complex, and we want to get it right.\n\nAchieving a Broad Reach for Faster Payments to Serve the Public\n\nThe FedNow service is being developed with the aim of having a broad nationwide reach and the ability to work across different systems. Payments industry stakeholders have emphasized the importance of establishing a real-time payment capability for the nation whereby any payer can reach any payee, regardless of which real-time retail payments system is used by their banks. Such interoperability has not always been a given in the U.S. and no doubt will be a challenge. For example, in the early 1970s, there were several regional automated clearing house associations, each providing clearing and settlement among and between only their own bank members. In most cases, the ACH associations had an agreement with the regional Federal Reserve Banks to help operate the ACH networks. In 1974, the regional ACH associations formed Nacha to facilitate the nationwide clearing of ACH transactions. And by 1978, an interoperator agreement between the Federal Reserve and Nacha was executed to link local ACHs on a nationwide basis. The message exchange protocols that allowed that to happen are still in place today. Interoperability is also a feature of debit cards and of wire transfers. For each of these services, interoperability also evolved over decades and followed different paths to arrive at different models.\n\nToday, the Fed, private sector-operators, and other stakeholders are exploring options to ensure a broad reach for faster payments. Interoperability as currently achieved in the ACH system is one possible approach. Another approach is dual participation, where some banks choose to join more than one operator network. This is the prevailing model for high-value, urgent payments processed through the wire transfer networks. Hybrid models are also possible, where service providers are designated as agents in each network and route payments to the receiving bank's network of choice. A broad reach is achieved by relying on relatively few service providers, each of which establishes connections to all of the payment operators for that payment type, thereby acting as hubs. This type of interoperability characterizes today's debit card networks.\n\nThe Fed will be exploring the various possibilities, working with private-sector stakeholders, to arrive at the best solution for ensuring that we deliver a faster payment service that is broadly accessible to consumers and businesses alike so that it best serves the public\n\nBeyond the development of FedNow, the Fed is actively monitoring and studying new technologies and approaches to payments. These approaches don't always rely on sovereign currency or a country's central bank to settle payments, or on traditional bank accounts to transact payments. I will use the remainder of my time to discuss one of these payments innovations: digital currencies.\n\nDigital Currencies\n\nBy now, everyone has heard of Bitcoin, an example of a digital currency, which was introduced in 2008, holding the promise that it could serve as a means of faster payments, as a unit of account, and as a store of value.7 Since Bitcoin's introduction, thousands of other digital currencies have been created. Such currencies present an innovative approach to processing payments in which a bank or central authority is replaced with a distributed group of anonymous people who verify the accuracy and trustworthiness of the transaction over the internet. Distributed ledger technology, open source software, and a downloadable database of account balances allow decentralized members of the network to vote with their computing power to determine whether a transaction is valid or not.8 Since transactions are cryptographically secured, many have adopted the term \"cryptocurrencies\" to describe Bitcoin and other similar products.\n\nAlthough its market capitalization has grown to over 100 billion euros, Bitcoin has not seen wide adoption as a means of payment.9 Its value is volatile, driven by speculation in the currency, making it less useful as a unit of account. Its settlement time has been too slow to make it practical for mainstream payments. In addition, the real costs of operating the system, driven by energy consumption to power a vast web of computers, are much higher than those associated with traditional sovereign currency. The distributed nature of the governance system around Bitcoin and similar digital currencies also makes it more difficult to resolve any disputes that may arise or to decide on technical changes that likely would be needed as the platform grows.10\n\nIn part to address some of these challenges, there has been a proliferation of so-called \"stablecoins.\"11 Stablecoins are digital currencies designed to minimize price volatility by pegging their value to the value of a stable asset or basket of assets, such as commodities, commercial bank deposits, government securities, or sovereign currencies. This limits the price volatility in the stablecoins, making them candidates for payments that require a stable medium of exchange.\n\nThe practice of backing a form of money by a stable asset is not new. The gold standard, in which the economic unit of account is based on a fixed quantity of gold, was widely used in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Another example is Kenya's M-PESA system, established in 2007 to enable transfers of mobile phone account balances backed by deposits held at commercial banks, which in turn hold government securities. Facebook's June 2019 announcement of Libra, a stablecoin to be made available to its more than 2.5 billion users, garnered considerable attention because of its potential to reach a global scale in a short period of time. Announcements such as this have served as a wakeup call to regulators, standards-setting bodies, and central banks around the world for the need to study the benefits and risks of stablecoins.\n\nA global stablecoin has the potential to deliver some benefits by increasing the speed of certain payments and improving competition in and lowering the cost of making cross-border payments. By enhancing the diversity of the payment system infrastructure, global stablecoins could increase resiliency. Stablecoins might also be attractive to countries that prefer an alternative to the U.S. dollar or the euro for making international transactions, and they could provide an efficient mechanism for commercial banks to settle the payment leg of a wholesale transaction involving the sale of another digital asset.\n\nBut against these potential benefits, stablecoins also pose some challenges, including a range of legal, governance, and compliance issues. It is likely that there are conflicts in the legal frameworks of different jurisdictions that a global currency may traverse, and such conflicts would need to be reconciled before adoption. For example, there would need to be clarity about when the finality of the payment is achieved and around the rights and obligations of all parties, including on whom or what the stablecoin holder has a claim. Regulators would need to understand who is responsible for operating different aspects of the system, and how international safety and soundness standards, such as the principles for financial market infrastructures, would apply to this type of payments system. In recent congressional testimony, Fed Chair Jerome Powell highlighted some of the concerns about compliance with consumer privacy and protection statutes, including the rules around know-your-customer, anti-money laundering, and consumer data privacy.12 Policymakers also need to assess potential risks to financial stability if stablecoins gain traction. While the availability of stablecoins may enhance payments system resiliency, it could also undermine stability if there is a loss of confidence in a global stablecoin that leads to runs on stablecoin redemptions. Similarly, understanding whether stablecoins would impact the effectiveness of traditional monetary policy tools must also be part of the research agenda.\n\nAnother development under study is digital currency issued by a central bank.13 This would be just like the physical currency issued by central banks today, but in a digital form and, potentially, without the anonymity of physical currency. Depending on how these currencies are designed, central banks could support them without the need for commercial bank involvement via direct issuance into the end-users' wallets combined with central-bank-facilitated transfer and redemption services. Of the 66 central bank respondents to a 2020 survey conducted by the Bank for International Settlements, 80 percent are currently or soon will be engaged in digital currency work, mostly related to researching, planning for, or piloting the technology.14 China, Europe, and Russia, among other jurisdictions, have initiatives underway. Some countries, like Sweden, cite the declining use of cash as motivating their interest in central bank digital currencies.15 To the extent that they displace cash, such currencies may help to prevent money laundering and tax evasion. Of course, for the same reason, if they are designed without anonymity, they could be used by a totalitarian regime to control its citizenry. In other jurisdictions, like Uruguay, central bank digital currency offers the promise of broadening financial inclusion by being more accessible to underserved segments of the population compared with bank accounts. In another survey, many of the responding central banks expressed interest in central bank digital currency as a way to maintain payment systems that are competitive with costly cash issuance or emerging private-sector alternatives, like Libra.16 Others have suggested that central bank digital currency could enhance the transmission of monetary policy, offering a more practical way to implement negative interest rates, which some central banks, including the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, and the Swiss National Bank, are currently imposing on reserve deposits to address low inflation and low growth.17\n\nJust as with private-sector digital currencies, a range of potential risks and policy issues surrounding central bank digital currency need to be better understood, and the costs and benefits evaluated, before a central bank would implement a central bank digital currency. In the U.S. a basic question is whether the Federal Reserve has the legal authority to issue such a currency and offer transfer and safekeeping services directly to consumers and businesses. Another is whether the central bank would need to gain access to sensitive consumer and business information in order to issue digital currency and how privacy could be protected. In addition, the design features necessary to prevent illicit activities would need to be determined. Finally, monetary policy transmission, potential disruption to short-term funding markets, and financial stability issues would need to be evaluated.\n\nThe outcome of the cost-benefit analysis may differ across countries. The status of the U.S. dollar as a global reserve currency, the stable demand for U.S. bank notes, and the mature, developed nature of the U.S. financial system are all distinguishing factors that would need to be taken into account when considering the benefits vs. the costs of central bank digital currency in the U.S. Central banks around the world, including the Federal Reserve, continue to research this potential payments innovation, and they are sharing what they learn with one another and the public.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe payment system is undergoing a period of rapid change. The emergence and widespread adoption of new technologies have shaped the public's expectations for faster, more efficient, secure, and broadly accessible payment services. In the U.S., FedNow, a new real-time payments system, will be an integral part of this modernized payment system. As work on FedNow proceeds, so does the evolution of other payment methods like digital currencies. While each payments innovation offers benefits, it also comes with some risks and policy implications that need to be evaluated. The Federal Reserve is monitoring developments, evaluating potential new payments enhancements, and engaging with private-sector stakeholders and fellow central banks, as we work to modernize the payment system on behalf of the public."

            "content": "It is a pleasure to welcome you to the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland for what I expect to be a very engaging discussion of issues surrounding the stability of the financial system. I extend a special thanks to our partner, the Office of Financial Research (OFR), and Stacey Schreft, deputy director of research and analysis at the OFR. She and Joe Haubrich of the Cleveland Fed have worked diligently to put together this two-day program, the sixth joint conference between our two institutions. A look back at those past programs shows that much work has been done to increase our understanding of the risks facing the global financial system and the effectiveness of policies intended to foster increased resilience. Advances in research, data collection, and risk-monitoring have given us all a better appreciation of the interlinkages underlying the global financial system and the ability of a disturbance in one part of the system to propagate across the system. The horizontal approach to risk-monitoring, including stress testing, has been an important advance in the supervisory tool kit. Policymakers are gaining a better sense of how macroprudential policy and monetary policy interact, the appropriate role of liquidity and capital regulations, and the importance of taking a balanced approach to supervision and regulation, which supports both financial system resilience and the ability of financial firms to offer sound credit, liquidity, and payments services throughout the business cycle. Regulatory changes and the steps bankers themselves have taken to shore up their risk-management practices have led to a stronger and safer financial system.\n\nBut as much as we have learned and accomplished, there is still more to do. The financial system is dynamic: it is constantly evolving. Technological change is happening at a rapid pace. Machine learning, artificial intelligence, distributed ledgers, and other technological advances all hold the promise of making our financial and payments systems more efficient and effective for more people and of creating better analytical tools with which to monitor and manage risks. But these advances also pose challenges and have the potential to create new risks and imbalances that may be more difficult to monitor. With the advent of new technologies, some firms offering financial services do not fit neatly into the current regulatory framework, and monitoring risks outside of the traditional banking sector presents some challenges. In a financial system that is rapidly adopting new technologies, our knowledge can rapidly become obsolete, as can the constructs we use to monitor and manage risks to financial stability. When the nature of the risks is changing, we need to ensure that our methods of assessing risks are nimble enough to adapt to the changing landscape.\n\nIn my limited time this morning, I will focus on one area of rapid change pertinent to financial stability: namely, the risks to cybersecurity and our ability to handle these risks. Of course, the views I will present today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nCybersecurity and Financial Stability\n\nAs businesses have become more reliant on technology, efforts to disrupt a financial institution's operations; to steal, corrupt, or destroy data and intellectual property; or to divert funds have become more prevalent. As the Financial Stability Board points out, several recent events show the sizeable damaging effects such cyber incidents can have on the financial system. These include the attack on the Bangladesh Bank in 2016, which resulted in the theft of $81 million; the WannaCry ransomware attack in 2017, which infected more than 250,000 computer systems in 150 countries; and the Equifax hack in 2017, which compromised the personal information of over 146 million people.1\n\nIt is difficult to come up with firm numbers about the costs of malicious cyber activity – a fact that itself indicates we need to do more to monitor these risks. The U.S. Council of Economic Advisers has estimated that malicious cyber activity cost the U.S. economy between $57 billion and $109 billion in 2016, and other estimates suggest that those costs are rising rapidly, by 23 percent between 2016 and 2017 according to one study.2 Firms are spending significant amounts on their cybersecurity, with one estimate at nearly $124 billion globally in 2019.3 While all businesses face cyber risks, the stakes are particularly high in the financial services industry, given the critical role the financial system plays in the overall health of the U.S. and global economy.\n\nOne might be tempted to view cyber risk as a form of operational risk and treat it within the frameworks we have already established for assessing such risks. Instead, I think it pays to put cyber risks into a special category,4 recognize they are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and realize that creative new solutions are needed to monitor and mitigate these risks. Cyber attacks have become more systematic, maliciously targeting financial firms and playing out over time for maximum effect. Detection can be difficult; an institution may believe it has backed up its good data, but those data may already have been compromised by malicious code that has infiltrated the institution's system. Data integrity will increasingly need to be a focus as firms develop plans for how they will recover from the inevitable attack. As financial institutions have adopted new technologies, sometimes through third-party suppliers, they are susceptible to risks that they may not have faced before. Those making the attacks are also adopting new technologies that more easily exploit gaps in financial firms' information technology, payment messaging and transaction authorization systems, and supply chains, which can widen the extent of the attack and make response or recovery more difficult. In such a landscape, weaknesses in financial firms' governance and communications structures — for example, not being clear about who has the decision rights to turn off a system, or what effect turning off one system will have on other systems — can exacerbate problems faced by a firm under attack.\n\nInstead of being idiosyncratic and affecting only a few firms, as many operational risks are, cyber threats are more likely to be correlated across institutions because of the complex interconnections and dependencies among financial firms. This means that cyber threats are more likely to have wider spread, and potentially systemic, negative impacts than a typical operational problem that might arise from a failed system or process. Trading platforms, settlement and payments systems, and central securities depositories are all critical infrastructures on which financial firms depend, and if these systems go down, there are few substitutes. In addition, the advent of new technologies and the move to cloud computing create additional concentrated risk, as only a handful of third-parties provide these services.\n\nAs much as individual firms are investing in cybersecurity — and it is a lot — as a nation and globally, we are likely underinvesting. This is because cybersecurity is a public good: the overall financial system conveys benefits to us all. Individual institutions certainly have incentives to invest in their own cybersecurity. As they have considered the tradeoff between the risk of loss to their firm from a cyber attack versus the cost of protection, financial services firms have been making major investments to monitor and protect their systems against attack. But the social benefit conveyed by a well-functioning and resilient financial system, one in which the public can continue to have a lot of confidence, requires a higher level of investment in cybersecurity than what individual firms would decide to do on their own. In addition, many individual firms rely on shared services. In considering how much to invest in their own cybersecurity, each firm should be entertaining the possibility that those shared services could come under significant stress in the event of a major attack on multiple firms at the same time5 or that the shared service itself could be the entry point for a system-wide attack. These types of externalities may not be part of any one firm's investment decision. In addition, there could be free-rider problems: an individual firm may rely on others in the shared network to make investments to increase the security of the network, but if every firm thinks this way, there will be underinvestment in security.6\n\nCybersecurity and the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\n\nGiven the changing environment, both financial services firms and their supervisors are making cybersecurity a high priority. In fact, because the stakes are so high, the banking industry is one of the most responsive industries in efforts to combat cybersecurity threats. Banks have strengthened their defenses and are detecting breaches in a more timely manner, shortening the time it takes to detect a problem once an attacker has entered a system.7 Institutions are engaging in tabletop exercises, enhancing their incident response playbooks, and testing systems to strengthen their ability to recover from attacks. Firms are testing applications within sandboxes and using artificial intelligence to help detect cyber intruders. Realizing their common interests in effectively managing these risks, financial firms have been working on some joint efforts. Sheltered Harbor is an industry initiative that provides participant financial institutions a way to store data independent of the bank's own infrastructure. This can help make recovery quicker after an attack is detected. Sheltered Harbor reports that as of March 2019, its members accounted for 71 percent of U.S. deposit accounts and 55 percent of U.S. retail brokerage client assets.8\n\nCybersecurity is a high priority for the Federal Reserve. The Fed's approach builds on techniques that we have successfully applied to other forms of financial system oversight. We are developing clear and consistent standards for assessing financial institutions' preparedness and establishing corporate governance best practices with respect to cybersecurity. We are also acquiring and deploying Fed staff with the necessary technical skills to assess risk-management practices at financial firms, and we are encouraging and creating avenues for information sharing among financial institutions and regulators. The Fed has increased coordination with the other federal banking agencies in assessing cybersecurity at the nation's largest, most complex firms. We are aligning what we expect of banks in terms of identifying, protecting, detecting, responding to, and recovering from cyber attacks with the best-practice standards in the National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) cybersecurity framework.9 The banking agencies coordinate their annual reviews of the large, complex institutions, targeting key areas of supervisory interest, including cyber governance and risk management, incident response, and the ability to restore critical services. We have raised the expectations of cyber preparedness for all of the institutions we supervise, including regional and community banks.\n\nThe Cleveland Fed is playing an important role in the Federal Reserve's cybersecurity initiatives in several ways. Since 2015, the Cleveland Fed has been co-leading the Federal Reserve System's annual national horizontal review of cybersecurity for banks with assets between $100 billion and $500 billion. Fed examiners assess a bank's cybersecurity along a number of dimensions. Effective cybersecurity requires sound cyber-risk governance, including leadership's engagement in oversight of the firm's cybersecurity programs. An institution needs to have effective programs for identifying and managing risks and vulnerabilities, including those within its own technology infrastructure, those associated with vendors and third-party technology providers, and those posed by new products. Examiners assess a bank's incident response and recovery plans, as well as basic elements of good cyber hygiene, such as adequate technology inventories; safeguards for hardware, software, and customer and transaction data; and access and patch management.\n\nThe Cleveland Fed is also playing a national role in the collection of threat information. The Federal Reserve System's Cybersecurity Analytics Support Team (CAST) was created in 2015 and is based at the Cleveland Fed.10 This team tracks the latest cybersecurity developments across the U.S. financial sector in critical payment, clearing, and settlement systems, allowing it to gain a wide perspective on potential threats to the overall financial system and to better calibrate threat severity and impact. As its name implies, Cleveland's CAST group casts a wide net in its 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year monitoring of cybersecurity risks in the financial system, working with the U.S. Department of the Treasury, other bank regulatory agencies, and the FBI. The Cleveland Fed staff is sharing its expertise on cybersecurity topics at industry and regulatory forums, and last month held its second conference on managing cyber risks, with financial industry risk and information security officers participating.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is a provider of both wholesale and retail payment services to the public and the U.S. government, and we recently launched a project called FedNow, to build a real-time gross settlement system to promote a safe and efficient faster payments system available to all. We need to maintain the public's trust and confidence in our ability to deliver those services, so we are highly engaged in work to enhance the resilience of our own systems, applications, and data against cybersecurity risks. The Cleveland Fed is one of the four Reserve Banks that provide payment services to the U.S. Treasury. Our eGov function focuses on revenue collections and eCommerce on behalf of the U.S. Treasury's Bureau of the Fiscal Service, maintaining and operating multiple systems for collecting funds for federal government agencies and providing solutions to take advantage of newer payments technologies. In addition to managing operational risks, our staff is constantly monitoring cybersecurity risks and potential fraudulent transactions on these critical payments services.\n\nFour Recommendations to Enhance Cybersecurity\n\nWhile the financial services industry and the supervisory agencies have made significant progress, the cybersecurity landscape is constantly evolving amid rapid technological change. So let me offer four recommendations to enhance the cyber resilience of the global financial system.\n\nFirst, financial system supervisory agencies need to become more agile to ensure that our supervisory frameworks are up to the task of monitoring cybersecurity. The Federal Reserve continues to work with the other federal banking agencies to harmonize our cybersecurity examination requirements, but progress has been slow. In October 2016, the three federal banking regulatory agencies published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking inviting comment on a set of potential enhanced cybersecurity risk-management and resilience standards. This draft guidance is still in process. Given the changes in technology, including the move to cloud technology, the supervisory program applied to the most critical third-party service providers needs to be updated. We need to become agile in our approach to supervision; otherwise, changes in technology will overtake our ability to monitor and manage risks.\n\nSecond, given the systemic nature of cyber risks and the potential for widespread disruption, further collaboration between the regulators, government, financial institutions, and other private-sector firms will be a crucial ingredient for improving our cybersecurity. One form of this collaboration is tabletop exercises, which can improve the readiness of the industry and the government to respond to a cyber incident. The Fed participates in the Hamilton Series of tabletop exercises, in collaboration with the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center (FS–ISAC), an important banking industry forum that promotes collaboration on critical security threats. These exercises are intended to improve public- and private-sector management of cyber risks. Participants have told us that they value these exercises because they promote consistent approaches and best practices in event response and recovery and they foster relationships with key regulatory officials.\n\nBecause cyber threats are not restricted by national borders and because the financial system is interconnected, cross-border collaboration must also advance. In November 2015, the U.S. and U.K. governments conducted a joint exercise with leading global financial firms to determine how the two governments would perform in the event of a large cyber attack on the financial systems in both countries.11 The Fed participated in the exercise, which evaluated incident-response handling and recovery, coordination, public communication, and information handling. These types of exercises should be expanded and carried out on a more frequent and regular basis. This will help those who have not been exposed to such situations learn how to handle them and allow the lessons to become second nature to all bank and supervisory staff.\n\nThird, further development and use of stress testing to assess the financial system's resilience to cyber risks are needed. Just as horizontal stress testing has proven to be a useful tool in assessing the overall resilience of the financial system to credit and liquidity risks, stress testing could be used to assess how prepared individual firms and the overall system are to respond to and recover from a systemic cyber event such as the shutdown of a major clearing or settlement bank. Such a test could help evaluate the financial system's plans for data and core systems recovery and its reliance on third parties to implement that plan. As part of the recovery plan, data integrity needs to be a focus: how can the institution ensure that the data it backed up have not already been altered?\n\nThe G7 has provided a guide to authorities for assessing resiliency through the use of simulations, such as threat-led penetration tests. To test the resiliency of an institution's systems and its ability to recover from an attack, these tests are carried out without advance knowledge using the techniques and tactics of actual malicious attackers.12 The Bank of England is applying stress-testing techniques to evaluate whether financial firms are able to resume services within the tolerance set by the Bank of England in the face of a system-wide attack or data corruption that affects multiple firms and their service providers.13 Adapting and adopting some of these practices in the U.S. would be worthwhile.\n\nFourth, information gathering, sharing, and analysis need to be promoted as critical ingredients for improving our cybersecurity. The Financial Stability Board recently published a cyber lexicon.14 A common language is crucial to ensure consistent data collection and reliable measurement. Another crucial ingredient for effective monitoring is firms' willingness to share information on cyber incidents. Without such sharing, it is much harder to develop metrics to evaluate cyber resilience, to assess whether threat levels are rising or beginning to propagate through the financial system, and to determine whether the practices firms have in place actually are working to mitigate the risks. So the Fed has been working with FS-ISAC to promote information sharing.\n\nBut collecting and sharing the data are not enough. With the constant evolution of the threats, advanced techniques for analyzing those data need to be developed so that evolving trends can be identified. Here, technological advances like machine learning and artificial intelligence can be helpful, if applied correctly. But if not applied correctly, they can result in false positives, diverting attention from actual risks and vulnerabilities. Given that the necessary skill sets are difficult to acquire, especially by regulatory agencies without deep pockets, the agencies should be willing to develop appropriate collaborations with universities and other entities with an aptitude and interest in using such techniques for the good of the public.\n\nIn summary, my four recommendations are: an agile supervisory framework for cybersecurity; global industry and agency collaboration; cybersecurity stress testing; and more robust data gathering, sharing, and analytics about cyber incidents. I see these areas as those in which the most urgent actions are needed to help promote the resilience of our financial system. Given the nature of the financial services industry, with interconnections and dependencies on third-party providers, and advances in technology, this list can be expected to evolve. I hope it evolves because we have made significant progress in these four areas and not because the list has expanded to include new vulnerabilities that could have been avoided had we made better progress."

            "content": "I thank Professor William Elliott and John Carroll University for inviting me to participate in the Mellen Executive Speakers series. It was a pleasure meeting with John Carroll students earlier this afternoon, and I am looking forward to the question and answer session moderated by Jack Kleinhenz. Jack is not only one of John Carroll's impressive alumni, but he is also chief economist for the National Retail Federation, so hearing his views on the economy is always valuable. Before we get started, I thought it might be useful to set the stage by giving you a brief update of my own take on the economy and monetary policy. It is important to point out that the views I'll present today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\n\nIn July, the U.S. economic expansion entered its 11th year, making this the longest expansion on record. Last year, we saw strong economic growth: real GDP grew at a 2.5 percent pace, well above most economists' estimates of trend growth. This growth was supported by fiscal stimulus in the form of tax cuts to households and businesses and higher federal government spending. In addition, financial conditions were accommodative for much of the year. It was widely anticipated that output growth would slow this year as this stimulus waned. But over the course of this year, several risks to the outlook emerged. These risks include those associated with trade policy, tariffs, and slower growth abroad, as well as geopolitical risks including Brexit, the events in Hong Kong, and tensions in the Middle East. The question is whether the economy will remain resilient, with growth stepping down to its trend pace, which I estimate to be about 2 percent, or whether these downside risks will lead to a more significant deceleration in growth.\n\nDespite the risks to the outlook, the data indicate that the economy continues to perform well along a number of dimensions. Over the first half of the year, the economy grew at about a 2.5 percent pace, the same as last year. Consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of GDP, continues to show strength, buoyed by solid fundamentals. Household balance sheets are healthy, consumer sentiment is at a high level, and incomes are growing thanks to the solid performance of the labor market.\n\nPayroll job growth has averaged about 160,000 jobs per month this year; the expected benchmark revisions will lower this number somewhat. This pace is a step down from last year's strong pace of over 220,000 jobs per month. But it is important to put this into context. Most economists estimate that the economy can sustain job growth in the range of 75,000 to 120,000 per month, depending on what one assumes about trend labor force participation. Demographic factors, including the aging of our population, have resulted in a downward trend in participation, which is one of the reasons trend employment growth is lower than it was a few decades ago. Rather than declining like its trend, the participation rate has actually been relatively stable over the past three years, a sign of the robust labor market.\n\nLast month, the unemployment rate fell to a 50-year low of 3.5 percent, and the broader measures of unemployment that include discouraged workers and those working part-time who would prefer to work full-time are at very low levels. In the Cleveland Fed's District, which includes the state of Ohio, western Pennsylvania, eastern Kentucky, and the panhandle of West Virginia, the unemployment rate is about 4 percent, near the lowest level seen in four decades.\n\nCongress has given the Fed two long-run monetary policy goals: maximum employment and price stability. So assessing how the labor market is doing relative to what is sustainable over the longer run is a key factor when setting monetary policy. The strong performance of the labor market over this expansion has made many economists reevaluate what unemployment rate is sustainable and consistent with price stability. This is true of participants on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) as well. Five years ago, their estimates of unemployment over the longer run ranged from 5 to 6 percent; the current range is 3.6 to 4.5 percent. I recently lowered my own estimate to a range of 4 to 4-1/4 percent, in recognition of the fact that the unemployment rate has been quite low for some time and inflation has remained subdued. But it's important to remember that there is quite a bit of uncertainty about such estimates.\n\nEven with economists reevaluating the degree of tightness in the labor market, if you speak to business owners, it is hard to conclude that labor markets aren't tight. We have heard from firms of all sizes that they cannot find workers with the skills they need; even for the relatively lower-skill positions, workers are hard to come by. Firms have been raising wages and benefits to attract and retain workers. Some firms have told us they have had to turn away business because labor is so scarce. The steady acceleration in labor compensation associated with such a vibrant labor market is a positive for consumer spending. But there is a downside to the tightness. Several members of our Cleveland Business Advisory Council have mentioned that their ability to innovate has been lessened because so much of their time is spent on recruiting, and less innovation could negatively affect future growth. Other firms tell us that because workers are so hard to find, they are speeding up their efforts to automate more of their operations. In the long run, such automation can make production more efficient and raise the potential growth rate of the economy. However, in the short to medium run, workers without the necessary skills to operate in a highly automated production process may be left behind. This makes the need for affordable training programs even more urgent so that workers can acquire the skills that are in demand now and in the future. Educational institutions like John Carroll will continue to play an important role as technological change remains a driving force in our economy.\n\nOffsetting the positives of consumer spending and labor market conditions are developments in the business sector. After increasing robustly last year, growth of business investment in equipment weakened sharply over the first half of this year, and manufacturing activity has declined. New orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft have decelerated from their year-ago levels, and orders and shipments of aircraft have decreased sharply since the start of the year, reflecting the problems with Boeing's 737 MAX airplane. Business sentiment has deteriorated.\n\nThis turn of events reflects a slowdown in growth abroad, especially in Europe and China; the imposition of an expanding menu of tariffs; and continued uncertainty about where trade policy is going. These developments have weakened demand for U.S. exports, which has weighed on the U.S. manufacturing and agricultural sectors. As trade tensions between the U.S. and China have continued to escalate, the uncertainty around trade policy has dampened business sentiment and has caused some firms to postpone investment. Rising geopolitical risks, including Brexit, events in Hong Kong, and the attack on oil production facilities in Saudi Arabia, have also weighed on sentiment. Firms in the Cleveland Fed District have been citing the uncertainty around tariffs and trade policy as a concern for some time. While many have not yet postponed planned investments, they have told us they are beginning to reassess those plans in light of the cloudy picture surrounding future tariffs and the outlook for U.S. growth.\n\nOn balance, I continue to expect that we will avoid a more serious turndown in the economy and that growth will be near its trend pace and the unemployment rate will remain below 4 percent over the next two years. As indicated by FOMC participants' economic projections, my colleagues have a similar view.1 The current period shares some similarities with the period from 2014 to 2016, when the slowdown in global demand, a decline in oil prices, and appreciation in the dollar caused a drop-off in investment and manufacturing activity. In that period, the overall economy proved to be quite resilient. Nonetheless, the nature of the downside risks this time is different, and it is not too difficult to envision a scenario in which adverse shifts in business sentiment and uncertainty over the outlook cause firms not only to reduce capital spending but also to pull back on hiring, which then causes consumer sentiment and spending to weaken and unemployment to rise, with inflation staying below our target because of weak aggregate demand. The declines in longer-term Treasury yields and other sovereign debt yields over the past two months suggest that bond investors are putting a higher likelihood on this scenario than they did earlier this year. While lower bond rates have meant lower mortgage rates and some increased activity in housing markets, the overall signal about the outlook from the bond market is a negative one.\n\nTurning to inflation, as I mentioned, despite the tightness in labor markets, inflation has remained subdued over much of the expansion. Last year, inflation, as measured by the year-over-year change in the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, moved up to 2 percent, the FOMC's target. However, this year, inflation moved back down, with total PCE inflation weighed down by declines in energy prices earlier in the year. Total PCE inflation remains low at 1.4 percent. The core measure, which excludes food and energy prices, also moved down early this year because of transitory declines in apparel prices and imputed prices of financial services. But since then, core PCE inflation has moved up to 1.8 percent. Although we use core inflation as an indicator of the underlying trend in inflation, it is important to remember that a sizable fraction of the variability of core inflation is due to idiosyncratic factors, for example, changes in Medicare reimbursement rates or cell phone prices. When we look at other measures of the underlying inflation trend, which try to control for this, we also find that inflation is firming and close to our goal. These include the Dallas Fed's trimmed-mean PCE inflation measure, which has been stable at 2 percent; the Cleveland Fed's trimmed-mean CPI measure, which was 2.2 percent in August; and an experimental measure of median PCE produced by the Cleveland Fed staff, which was 2.7 percent in August.\n\nBecause understanding inflation dynamics is essential for making effective monetary policy, the Cleveland Fed has established a Center for Inflation Research.2 The center builds on the pioneering work the bank has done over many years to measure and forecast inflation. One of the center's recent studies sheds some light on the recent behavior of inflation.3 This research disaggregates inflation into cyclical components, which vary with the degree of tightness in the labor market, and acyclical components, which are relatively unresponsive to the tightness in labor markets. The cyclical part of inflation accounts for only about 40 percent of core PCE inflation, but it has continued to rise over the expansion as the labor market has continued to tighten. The Cleveland Fed staff analysis indicates that as long as labor markets remain strong, cyclical inflation should continue to firm, helping headline inflation return gradually to our 2 percent objective over time.\n\nWhile inflation tends to fluctuate around trend due to changes in resource utilization, changes in commodity and other input prices, and idiosyncratic factors, the underlying trend in inflation is determined by businesses' and households' expectations of inflation over the long run. Forecasts of inflation gradually returning to 2 percent are dependent on long-run inflation expectations remaining stable. If firms and households begin to expect lower inflation to prevail over the longer run, this would make it even harder for the Fed to hit its inflation target, because theory suggests that these expectations influence actual price- and wage-setting behavior. Recent readings on long-run inflation expectations have been mixed. So far, the softer readings in some of the household survey measures are in line with the typical variation in these measures, but these movements bear watching.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nBecause monetary policy affects the economy with a lag, policymakers need to be forward looking. So the current uncertainty around the economic outlook poses some challenges. At each of its meetings in July and September, the FOMC reduced the target range of the federal funds rate by 25 basis points; the current target range is 1 3/4 to 2 percent. The Committee said that it views sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes, but that uncertainties about this outlook remain. In light of the implications of global developments for the outlook and muted inflation pressures, the Committee decided to take these actions.\n\nI was certainly sympathetic to the view expressed by the majority; indeed, my view of appropriate policy has become more accommodative since last year based on my assessment of economic and financial market developments. But my preference was to leave the fed funds rate unchanged at the July and September meetings. My preferred strategy was to take action only if there were evidence of a material deterioration in the outlook and not merely on heightened risks. Coming into those meetings, the overall economy was still performing well, financial conditions were accommodative, and access to credit was not the source of weakness in the business sector. Indeed, corporate debt is at a high level, and in the most recent survey from the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), small businesses indicated that credit conditions are about as accommodative as they have ever been in the survey's almost five-decade history.\n\nIn assessing the path of policy going forward, I will be monitoring incoming economic and financial data and reports from District contacts. I will be particularly attentive to signs that the weakness in investment and manufacturing is broadening, and spilling over to reductions in hiring and household spending, and to signs that long-run inflation expectations are destabilizing. Such signs would point to a material change in the outlook that could warrant policy action. Absent those signs, with labor markets strong and growth near trend, maintaining a shallow policy path for a while to support a gradual rise in inflation and not overreacting to shocks that might, for a time, move inflation somewhat above 2 percent would be appropriate, in my view. It would be consistent with keeping inflation within a reasonable range around 2 percent, and balance the risks to achieving our dual-mandate goals."

            "content": "It is a real pleasure to be participating again in the European Economics and Financial Centre's Distinguished Speakers Seminar series. It was three years ago, almost to the day, when I was last before you. Since that time, there have been several economic and policy developments in the U.S. that I will update you on today. One thing has not changed: monetary policymakers are operating in a world of economic and geopolitical uncertainties that cloud the outlook. When I was here three years ago, U.K. voters had just decided to exit the European Union, and it was too soon to determine with any precision what the ramifications of that vote would be for the U.K. and global economy. Today, the terms of Brexit remain unresolved while a new source of uncertainty has emerged, namely, international trade policy. Political tensions in the Middle East have also arisen, with implications for energy prices and financial markets. Of course, forecasting in an uncertain world is a difficult task, but it is something economists and monetary policymakers must always do.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has a statutory mandate to set U.S. monetary policy to achieve the longer-run goals of price stability and maximum employment. At its meeting two weeks ago, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the Fed's monetary policymaking body, decided to maintain the target range of the federal funds rate at 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent. In its statement, the FOMC indicated that it \"continues to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes, but uncertainties about this outlook have increased.\" The Committee said that \"in light of these uncertainties and muted inflation pressures,\" it \"will closely monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2 percent objective.\"\n\nToday, I will discuss why I agree with this assessment of the economic outlook, and its implications for monetary policy. It is important to point out that the views I'll present today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Economy\n\nLast month, the U.S. economic expansion reached its 10-year anniversary. For the past couple of years, the economy has been growing at an above-trend pace, and last year, real GDP growth was a strong 3 percent. Growth was supported by fiscal stimulus in the form of tax cuts to households and businesses and higher federal government spending, as well as financial conditions that were accommodative for much of the year. I anticipated that output growth would slow this year as this stimulus waned. The question is whether growth will slow toward a more sustainable trend pace, which I estimate to be around 2 percent, or whether we will see a more significant deceleration in output and labor market conditions. In my view, the most likely outcome continues to be that the economy will maintain its good performance in 2019 — a sustainable-growth scenario in which output growth slows to a sustainable pace, labor markets remain strong, and after some near term softness, inflation moves back to our 2 percent goal over time. But mixed recent data suggest that the downside risks to this forecast have risen and that there is some chance that an alternative, weak-growth scenario could be emerging, one in which growth slows more significantly, the unemployment rate rises, and inflation remains low because aggregate demand is weak. The declines in longer-term Treasury yields and other sovereign debt yields over the past two months suggest that bond investors are putting a higher likelihood on this scenario than they did earlier this year.\n\nThe path to sustainability is rarely smooth, and this year has been no different. Real GDP growth remained at a strong 3.1 percent in the first quarter, but about half of that growth came from inventory investment and net exports, which is not sustainable. Most estimates of second quarter growth suggest growth will slow to a range of 1.5 to 2 percent. Of course, this still means a solid showing for the first half of the year.\n\nThere is variation across sectors in terms of their contributions to overall growth. On the positive side is consumer spending. Although the monthly readings have been volatile, the overall data suggest that consumer spending picked up in the second quarter after being subdued in the first quarter. First quarter spending was weighed down in part by the partial federal government shutdown that delayed income tax refunds and by declines in equity prices at the end of last year, which reduced household wealth. These temporary factors have dissipated. The healthy labor market is adding jobs and producing wage gains in excess of inflation, which are supportive of consumer spending. Financial conditions remain relatively accommodative by a number of measures, even with the increase in volatility of late. While consumer confidence and sentiment fell in June, they remain at relatively high levels and it is too soon to determine whether June's drop is the start of a more sustained falloff in consumer attitudes that could weigh on consumer spending.\n\nOn the neutral side is the housing market, which has seen only a protracted recovery from the Great Recession. Indeed, residential investment subtracted from growth throughout 2018 and in the first quarter of this year. Until very recently, affordability was becoming an issue because the 30-year mortgage rate had been trending up since mid-2016 and house price appreciation was exceeding income growth. In addition, recent changes to the U.S. tax code reduced the deductibility of housing-related taxes for some taxpayers, affecting the incentives to own a home. Going forward, several factors should help stabilize the housing sector. These include the recent decline in mortgage rates; slower house price appreciation, which was running 6 to 7 percent in early 2018 and is now in the 3 to 4 percent range; and an increase in household formation driven by the strong labor market, which allows more people to commit to purchasing a home. On balance, I don't expect housing to contribute much to economic growth this year, nor do I expect to see a sharp pullback in the sector.\n\nOn the negative side is business investment. Business investment in equipment was strong last year, but weakened sharply in the first quarter despite favorable earnings and lower taxes. Surveys of business activity point to solid conditions in the services sector, but manufacturing activity has softened. New orders and shipments of capital goods excluding aircraft and defense have decelerated from their year-ago levels, and orders and shipments of aircraft have decreased sharply since the start of the year, reflecting the problems with Boeing's 737 Max airplane. Thanks to shale, the U.S. is now a major energy producer. Oil prices are about $12 per barrel lower than they were a year ago. Lower energy prices are weighing a bit on oil and natural gas drilling activity and investment. But this downturn is slight compared to the decline seen from mid-2014 to early 2016, when oil prices fell from over $100 per barrel to about $30 per barrel. We will need to gather further data and anecdotal reports to determine whether the slowdown in business spending will be sustained over the rest of the year or whether activity will remain consistent with trend growth.\n\nInternational economic developments are weighing on the U.S. outlook and contributing to the recent slowdown in investment. Sometimes I am asked why the Federal Reserve takes into account how other economies are doing when our monetary policy goals of price stability and maximum employment pertain to the U.S. economy. The answer is because economic and financial conditions in other parts of the world can spill over to the U.S. through trade linkages and financial markets. Global growth slowed in the second half of last year and forecasts have been revised down. Subdued global growth and the strengthening dollar have weighed on U.S. export orders and manufacturing. As I mentioned earlier, uncertainty around trade policy and tariffs is also clouding the outlook. Indeed, it was a factor cited by consumers in the recent confidence and sentiment surveys.\n\nThe direct effects of the tariffs already imposed have been relatively modest. However, some multinational firms have taken steps to reorganize their supply chains to limit the tariffs' effects on their cost of production. So the imposition of tariffs creates deadweight losses to the extent that the new suppliers are not as efficient as the old ones sans the tariff. Firms in the Cleveland Federal Reserve District have been citing the uncertainty around tariffs and trade policy as a concern for some time. That concern is growing, especially in light of the announcement of potential tariffs with Mexico, in addition to a possible expansion of tariffs to more goods imported from China. Many of our firms tell us they have not yet postponed their planned investment, but some firms say they are beginning to reassess those plans and others are holding off on acquiring financing for new projects because of the trade uncertainty. If more firms begin to take a wait-and-see attitude, the uncertainty itself could dampen business spending for some time to come. The effects could be amplified through adverse shifts in business, consumer, and financial market sentiment. On the other hand, a favorable outcome from trade talks could boost sentiment.\n\nDespite firms' concerns about trade policy, labor market conditions have remained strong and consistent with continued expansion. In May, payroll job growth slowed to about 75,000, but over the past three months, it has averaged about 150,000 jobs per month. This is a step down from last year's strong pace of over 220,000 per month, but it is still well above trend, which most estimates put in a range of 75,000 to 120,000 per month. In my baseline outlook, as output growth slows toward a more sustainable pace, I expect job growth to slow toward trend as well, but to be strong enough to absorb those entering the labor force, keeping the unemployment rate low and under 4 percent. The unemployment rate, which has been at or below 4 percent for over a year, is currently at 3.6 percent, its lowest level in nearly 50 years. The broader measures of the unemployment rate that include discouraged workers and those working part-time who would prefer to work full-time are at the lowest levels of this business cycle. In my view, the unemployment rate is below the level that is sustainable over the longer run, but in recognition of the fact that it has been very low for some time and inflation has remained subdued, I recently lowered my estimate of the longer-run unemployment rate. I had been estimating this rate to be about 4.5 percent; I now put it between 4 and 4.5 percent. Even with this revision, labor markets are tight. This is the resounding theme we have heard from all of our contacts for some time, across a variety of occupations and sectors. And according to the most recent survey of small businesses conducted by the National Federation of Independent Business, a quarter of firms reported that the quality of labor was their single most important problem, matching the highest reported share since the survey began asking this question in 1974.\n\nThe strength in the labor market has led to a steady acceleration in labor compensation. Aggregate measures of compensation are now in the 3 percent range, after being quite subdued earlier in the expansion. While this acceleration is not as strong as was seen in earlier expansions, the rise has been in line with productivity growth and inflation, and it has not added to inflationary pressures. Recent readings indicate a pickup in productivity growth; if this is sustained, it would be a positive development for wage growth going forward.\n\nBefore I turn to inflation, let me mention that the aggregate numbers on the labor market hide a lot of heterogeneity across locations and demographic groups. The Cleveland Fed recently held our biennial Policy Summit where issues facing low- and moderate-income communities were discussed at length with practitioners, researchers, and policymakers.1 While more people have been brought into the labor force, including those from underrepresented groups, it should be recognized that not everyone has enjoyed the benefits of the 10-year expansion of the U.S. economy. In certain communities there is limited access to jobs because of gaps in the transportation system, a lack of affordable housing near the available jobs, and few daycare options. Some people cannot afford the costs of training and education to advance in the job market, and are having to juggle multiple jobs to earn a living wage. These are not cyclical problems that can be solved with monetary policy. Trying to do so would create other imbalances that ultimately disproportionately harm the very people the policy was meant to help. But as our Policy Summit discussions revealed, well-designed government policies can be used to address these structural issues and help ensure that the aggregate longer-term gains from technological change and globalization are better distributed so that everyone can have the opportunity to benefit from a vibrant economy.\n\nTurning to inflation, as I mentioned, despite the tightness in labor markets, inflation pressures have been muted. The FOMC has set a goal of 2 percent inflation, as measured by the year-over-year change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, that is, PCE inflation. Over the expansion, inflation has gradually moved up, and last year, it was near our 2 percent goal. More recent readings of total PCE and core PCE inflation, which omits food and energy prices, have been soft, with year-over-year total PCE and core PCE inflation at 1.5 and 1.6 percent, respectively, in May. Total inflation was held down in part by declining energy prices, which will likely further weigh on inflation in the near term. Both total and core inflation readings also reflect some idiosyncratic, and likely transitory, declines in selected components, including apparel and imputed prices of financial services. In the 1990s, the Cleveland Fed pioneered measures of inflation that omitted components showing the most extreme price movements in any month to better gauge inflation trends.2 These indicators of underlying inflation trends have been more stable and point to inflation gradually rising back to trend. The Cleveland Fed's median and trimmed mean CPI measures, which tend to run higher than PCE inflation, were 2.7 and 2.2 percent, respectively, in May, in line with their levels for most of the year. The Dallas Fed's trimmed mean PCE inflation measure has been running between 1.9 and 2 percent over the past year and currently is at 2 percent.\n\nStable inflation expectations are an important component of inflation dynamics because they help to guide price- and wage-setting decisions. While expectations have been relatively stable, there was a softening in the latest readings of the University of Michigan and New York Fed survey measures of longer-term inflation expectations, while the Cleveland Fed's 5-year/5-year-forward measure, which combines survey readings with market-based readings, was little changed in June. We have seen mixed data on inflation and inflation expectations at other points over the expansion. But the recent declines bear watching because if inflation expectations become unanchored, it will be more difficult for inflation to be maintained near our target.\n\nIn light of the data, I have revised down my inflation forecast for this year. I continue to think that the most likely case is that inflation expectations will remain relatively well anchored and that this, coupled with continued strength in labor markets and output growth near trend, will support a gradual, although slower, rise in inflation back to 2 percent over the next couple of years. Nonetheless, it is important to acknowledge that there are structural factors holding back inflation, including technological change and product innovation. These are nonmonetary factors, and they may be more powerful than I have assumed. If so, inflation could remain lower for longer than in my baseline forecast. On the other side, there is also the possibility that tariffs could be passed along to customers, as some firms have told us they are beginning to do. While this would be a one-time change in the level of prices, to the extent that it changes inflation expectations, it could put upward pressure on inflation as well. Tightness in labor markets might also begin to put more pressure on wages and prices than we've yet seen.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nBecause monetary policy affects the economy with a lag, policymakers need to be forward looking. So the current uncertainty around the economic outlook poses some challenges for policymakers. At our recent meeting, the FOMC maintained the target range of the federal funds rate at 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent. In assessing whether monetary policy is well calibrated, I will be monitoring incoming economic and financial data and reports from District contacts to determine whether my positive baseline outlook — the sustainable-growth scenario — remains intact or whether the downside risks are coming to pass and a material change in the outlook to the weak-growth scenario is underway. At the present time, I believe it is too soon to make that determination, and I prefer to gather more information before considering a change in our monetary policy stance. If I see a few weak job reports, further declines in manufacturing activity, indicators pointing to weaker business investment and consumption, and declines in readings of longer-term inflation expectations, I would view this as evidence that the base case is shifting to the weak-growth scenario. In this scenario, the economy's short- to medium-term equilibrium interest rate would be moving down, and our policy rate could need to move down with it in order to sustain the expansion and foster achievement of our longer-run goals of maximum employment and price stability\n\nOn the other hand, throughout this expansion, the U.S. economy has proven itself resilient to a variety of economic shocks, headwinds, and uncertainties. We have seen similar episodes of soft data and sentiment that subsequently reversed. If that is the case this time, and the sustainable-growth scenario plays out, there is still a question of how the Fed should react to the lower inflation readings we've seen in recent months. Some would argue that lowering the funds rate would be appropriate in an attempt to push up inflation expectations. However, if it is the case that nonmonetary structural factors are holding back measured inflation, thereby putting downward pressure on inflation expectations, rather than an aggregate demand problem, it is not clear how effective this policy would be. Cutting rates at this juncture could reinforce negative sentiment about a deterioration in the outlook even if this is not the baseline view, and could encourage financial imbalances given the current level of interest rates, which would be counterproductive.\n\nThe current period shares some similarities with the period from 2014 to 2016, when the slowdown in global demand, the decline in oil prices, and the appreciation in the dollar caused a drop-off in investment and manufacturing activity at the same time inflation was well below target. The Fed was patient during this period, with one rate increase in December 2015 and another in December 2016, allowing inflation to gradually move up. So long as the sustainable-growth scenario of continued expansion and strong labor markets remains the baseline outlook, I would favor taking a similar opportunistic approach to the recent softness in the inflation readings instead of trying to proactively move inflation up with rate cuts.3 This would mean maintaining a shallow policy path: keeping the funds rate at current levels for a while to support a gradual rise in inflation and not overreacting to shocks that might, for a time, move inflation somewhat above 2 percent. The strategy would be consistent with keeping inflation within a reasonable range around 2 percent. Given the current level of the funds rate, which is low but appears to be near neutral, and my current baseline outlook, I view this strategy as one that appropriately balances the risks to achieving our dual-mandate goals, avoiding a buildup in risks to macroeconomic stability, distortions in labor markets, or financial imbalances driven by low costs of borrowing.\n\nGiven the uncertainties around the outlook, it should not be surprising that views vary across the individuals on the FOMC, even though we all share the same longer-run monetary policy goals of price stability and maximum employment. The economic projections released at our recent meeting show that in pursuit of our goals, some policymakers believe it will be appropriate to maintain the funds rate at current levels this year, while others believe it will be appropriate to reduce rates. But the projections also indicate that conditional on appropriate policy, the Committee sees the economy managing through the uncertainties, with growth slowing toward trend, labor markets remaining strong, and inflation gradually moving up to 2 percent over time. This would be a favorable outcome and one consistent with the resilience the U.S. economy has shown throughout this expansion."

            "content": "I thank John Taylor for inviting me to participate in this conference. It's a real pleasure to be on a panel moderated by Charles Plosser, whom I worked with at the Philly Fed. Although I learned a lot from Charles, the views I'll present are my own and are not necessarily shared by my fellow panelists, other colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee, or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe FOMC currently uses what has been called a flexible inflation-targeting framework to set monetary policy. It is briefly described in the FOMC's statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy.1 In my view, this framework has served the FOMC well in effectively promoting our policy goals. A milestone was reached in January 2012 when the U.S. adopted an explicit numerical inflation goal. I am certain that Charles remembers very well the careful analysis and discussions that helped the FOMC reach a consensus on the explicit 2 percent goal and the statement that describes the FOMC's approach to setting policy to promote its congressionally mandated goals of price stability and maximum employment.\n\nThe FOMC is currently reviewing its policy framework. I am very supportive of this initiative. As a matter of good governance, a central bank should periodically review its assumptions, methods, and models, and to inform its evaluation, it should seek a wide range of perspectives, including those from experts in academia, the private sector, and other central banks. Another motivation to undertake the review now is that the post-crisis economic environment is expected to differ in some important ways from the pre-crisis world. Based on the aging of the population and the expected slowdown in population growth, higher demand for safe assets, and other factors, many economists anticipate that the longer-term equilibrium real interest rate will remain lower than in past decades.2 In fact, empirical estimates of the equilibrium real fed funds rate, so-called r-star, while highly uncertain, are generally lower than in the past.3 This means there is a higher chance that the policy rate will be constrained by the zero lower bound, and that nontraditional monetary policy tools will need to be used more often. To the extent that these tools are less effective than the traditional interest rate tool or are otherwise constrained, the potential is for longer recessions and longer bouts of inflation well below target.4 In addition, fiscal policy's ability to buffer against macroeconomic shocks is also likely to be constrained, given projected large fiscal deficits and high government debt-to-GDP ratios.5 This raises the question of whether changes to our monetary policy framework would be helpful in maintaining macroeconomic stability in this environment.\n\nA number of suggestions have been made for alternative monetary policy frameworks that potentially offer some benefits in a low-interest-rate environment. These include setting an inflation target that is higher than 2 percent (an option not being considered by the FOMC in its framework review), using price-level targeting or nominal GDP targeting instead of inflation targeting, targeting average inflation over the business cycle or some other time frame, or using what former Chair Ben Bernanke has called temporary price-level targeting (which is essentially doing inflation targeting in normal times and price-level targeting once the policy rate is constrained by the zero lower bound). An idea that has received somewhat less attention is defining the inflation goal in terms of a range centered on 2 percent rather than a point target.6 Although these alternative frameworks have theoretical appeal, none of them is without implementation challenges. For example, many of them work well in models of perfect credibility and commitment, where the public understands the framework and believes future Committees will follow through, and the Committee actually does follow through, implying that the Committee has control of inflation expectations. Whether these assumptions would hold in practice is an open question. One needs to ask whether it is credible for policymakers to commit to keep interest rates low to make up for past shortfalls of inflation from target even when demand is growing strongly or to act to bring inflation down in the face of a supply shock by tightening policy even in the face of weak demand. It is not clear what actually would happen to inflation expectations in these scenarios despite what is assumed in the models. So the FOMC is going to have to evaluate the assumptions that drive the theoretical appeal of each framework and determine whether in practice the net benefits of any of the alternatives will outweigh those of the flexible inflation-targeting framework, and if not, what, if any, enhancements should be made to our current framework.\n\nRegardless of the framework the FOMC ultimately decides on, the public's expectations about future monetary policy are an important part of the transmission mechanism of policy to the economy. This means effective communication will be an essential component of the framework. I believe there are ways we can enhance our communications about our policy approach that would make any framework more effective. Let me touch on three.\n\n(1) Clarify how monetary policy affects the economy and which aspects of the economy can be influenced by monetary policy and which aspects cannot.\n\nMonetary policy is more effective when the public's and market participants' policy expectations are aligned with our policy decisions. Before this alignment can occur, the public needs to have a basic understanding of our monetary policy goals and what monetary policy can achieve and what it cannot. My concern is that this understanding has diminished since the Great Recession. Regardless of the framework, the FOMC's strategy document should articulate the relationship between monetary policy and our two policy goals of price stability and maximum employment. We should clarify that over the longer run, monetary policy can affect only inflation and not the underlying real structural aspects of the economy such as the long-run natural rate of unemployment or maximum employment. Although this concept is touched on in our current monetary policy strategy document, I do not think that the public fully understands. Indeed, former Chair Janet Yellen had to explain in one of her post-FOMC meeting press conferences that in an earlier speech, she did not mean to imply that she favored running a high-pressure economy as an experiment to affect longer-run growth and unemployment.7\n\nI think we could do a better job of explaining how monetary policy promotes the economy's growing at potential and operating at maximum employment. In particular, we tend to move our policy rate up when resource utilization tightens and down when resource utilization eases in order to bring our policy rate into alignment with the economy's natural rate of interest, which changes over the business cycle as the economy adjusts to shocks. There doesn't need to be an exploitable Phillips curve tradeoff between the unemployment rate and the inflation rate in order for policymakers to want to respond to changes in the unemployment rate, an indicator of resource utilization.8 The response is not an attempt to actively use monetary policy to affect the longer-run growth rate of the economy or the longer-run unemployment rate. A benefit of explaining things in this way makes it clear that the FOMC is not trying to rob the economy of jobs when it raises interest rates. Another benefit is that it should allay concerns that because the empirical Phillips curve has flattened, monetary policy has become anemic.\n\nImproving the public's understanding of how monetary policy works and what it can achieve would help not only in normal times but also in bad times. The Great Recession was an enormous negative shock, some part of which was likely permanent or very persistent rather than transitory. Monetary policy should not have been expected to make up for that permanent loss. Fiscal policy should have taken on a larger part of the burden.\n\n(2) Clarify how uncertainty is accounted for in monetary policymaking and incorporate this uncertainty into monetary policy strategy to avoid giving a false sense of precision.\n\nAccording to Voltaire, \"Uncertainty is an uncomfortable position, but certainty is an absurd one.\" In our context, this means it is important to convey that monetary policymakers have to deal with uncertainty in several forms. Monetary policy has to be forward looking because it affects the economy with a lag, but the economy is buffeted by shocks that can lead economic conditions to evolve differently than anticipated. Moreover, our view of economic conditions in real time can be cloudy because the data come in with a lag and many economic data are revised over time. In addition, there is model uncertainty.\n\nThe public needs to understand that given the lags and revisions in the data, incoming information can alter not only the policymaker's view of the expected future evolution of the economy but also his or her understanding of current and past economic conditions. New information could alter the expected future path of policy and might even result in ex post regret of a recent action. Robert Hetzel says that policymaking has a flavor of \"guess and correct.\"9 It is a normal part of monetary policymaking that policymakers will always be learning about whether their policy settings are the appropriate ones to promote their goals.\n\nThe public has to hold the FOMC accountable for its performance, but it should not hold monetary policymakers to an unrealistic standard. The FOMC took an important step in communicating uncertainty when it began showing 70 percent uncertainty bands around the median projections of FOMC participants, but these are not emphasized. I think they deserve more attention and should be released at the time of the post-FOMC press conference. They are a good illustration of the reasonable amount of deviation to expect between the projections and outcomes. Some have argued that the FOMC's projections of appropriate monetary policy, the so-called dot plot, should be dropped because actual policy can differ from the projections. I think that would be a mistake. The dots can change over time because of economic developments, but that's a design feature, not a flaw. Omitting the dot plot would not eliminate the uncertainty around the projections, the divergence in views across FOMC participants, or the fact that policymaking always entails learning and recalibration, but it would be a significant step back in transparency.\n\nWe need to recognize uncertainty in our broader monetary policy strategy as well. Consider the FOMC's inflation target. After much deliberation, the Committee chose a point target instead of a range and a total inflation measure rather than a core measure. While there were arguments on both sides, the Committee was persuaded that a point target would better anchor inflation expectations. Implicit in the choice was that the Committee would tolerate small deviations from target given the precision with which we can measure inflation, the precision with which we can guide the economy, and the typical revisions to the PCE inflation measures, which tend to be revised up over time.10 It is interesting to think through whether our policy choices or communications since 2012 might have differed had the Committee opted for a range rather than a point target, as some other central banks do, and for a core measure rather than a total measure of inflation. These data revisions and measurement issues, as well as potential difficulties in maintaining anchored inflation expectations during the periods of higher inflation meant to make up for periods of lower inflation, and vice versa, would seem to be amplified in price-level targeting and nominal GDP targeting frameworks.\n\n(3) Clarify our monetary policy strategy by taking a more systematic approach to our policy decisions and in how we communicate those decisions.\n\nHouseholds, businesses, and investors make economic and financial decisions based on their expectations of the future, including the future course of monetary policy, and the FOMC strives to avoid surprising the public with its policy decisions. The communications challenge for the FOMC is to give the public a good sense of how policy is likely to respond conditional on how the economy evolves without implying that policy is pre-committed to a particular policy path regardless of how the economy evolves. Essentially, the FOMC needs to convey the strategy it uses to determine its policy actions over time to promote achievement of its policy goals, i.e., its reaction function. And this will be true regardless of which monetary policy framework the FOMC ultimately adopts. Ironically, the FOMC's strategy document does not offer much in the way of strategy, and this can lead to a misunderstanding that our policy decisions are discretionary. The term \"data-dependent\" has been used to explain the FOMC's policymaking strategy, but this term could be potentially misinterpreted as suggesting that policy will react to every short-run change in the data rather than the accumulation of changes that affect the medium-run outlook.\n\nA more systematic approach to setting monetary policy can better align the public's policy expectations with policy decisions and help to reduce some of the uncertainty around how we conduct monetary policy. It can help insulate monetary policy from short-run political considerations, and it can also offer more policy continuity over time as Committee members change. In a time of rising public skepticism about \"experts,\" which can undermine public trust in institutions, being systematic will help the public understand how our decisions are actually made, which can enhance the Fed's credibility.\n\nThe question is how to ensure that we are setting policy systematically and how to convey this to the public. I have three suggestions. First, while judgment will likely always be a part of policymaking, simple monetary policy rules can play a more prominent role in our policy deliberations and communications.11 The FOMC has been reluctant to relinquish policymaking to following a simple rule, because no one rule works well enough across a variety of economic models and circumstances. But the Board of Governors has begun to include a discussion of rules as benchmarks in the monetary policy report,12 and frameworks that try to build in some commitments and constraints on future policy actions, such as price-level targeting, average inflation targeting, and nominal GDP targeting, are being discussed. This suggests that systematic policymaking is garnering more support. As a first step, selecting a few benchmark rules that have been shown to yield good economic outcomes and using these as reference points to aid policy discussions and communicating why our policy may or may not differ from the rules' policy descriptions could go some way in ensuring that our decisions are derived in a systematic way and could help us explain our own policy reaction function to the public.\n\nA second suggestion is to enhance our own FOMC projections by asking the participants to provide a set of economic projections conditioned on a common policy path, in addition to the current projections, which are conditioned on each individual participant's view of appropriate policy. This common path might come from a policy rule. This would be a step toward achieving a coherent consensus FOMC forecast, which has been a challenge but which could serve as the benchmark for understanding the FOMC's policy actions and post-meeting statements, a recommendation I have made in the past.3\n\nMy third suggestion to help communicate systematic policymaking is to make our post-meeting FOMC statement consistent from meeting to meeting and less focused on short-term changes in the data released between FOMC meetings and more focused on the medium-run outlook and a consistent set of indicators on inflation, inflation expectations, the unemployment rate, employment growth, output growth, and financial conditions. Each statement could provide the rationale for the policy decision in terms of how accumulated changes in this consistent set of economic and financial conditions have or have not influenced the Committee's assessment of the factors relevant for policy, i.e., the arguments in our reaction function. The statement would also consistently articulate the Committee's assessment of risks to the outlook and other considerations that the Committee is taking into account in determining current and future policy. This assessment would be informed by the analysis of alternative forecast scenarios, which are discussed at each FOMC meeting. If we provided more consistency about the conditions we systematically assess in calibrating the stance of policy, the public and market participants would get a better sense of the FOMC's reaction function over time and their policy expectations would better align with those of policymakers.\n\nI note that all of the suggestions I have made today are relevant regardless of the framework the FOMC ultimately decides to use for setting monetary policy."

            "content": "I thank the Ohio Division of Financial Institutions for inviting me to be a part of the 2019 Ohio Bankers Day. Bankers have a unique perspective from which to gather information on the health of the economy. I appreciate the insights I gain from speaking with bankers throughout the Cleveland Fed's District, including those who serve on our Board of Directors and our Community Depository Institutions Advisory Council, and I am looking forward to hearing your questions and comments after my prepared remarks.\n\nI do not need to tell this audience that banking plays an important role in supporting a strong economy. The credit, savings, and payment services banks provide help to foster economic growth. In offering these financial services, banks have to take on risk, and managing that risk is essential to ensuring that the financial system remains resilient. The financial crisis painfully demonstrated the high costs imposed on households, businesses, and banks — indeed, the entire economy — when the financial system is impaired.\n\nMuch progress has been made since those dark days. Regulatory changes and the steps bankers themselves have taken to shore up their risk management practices have led to a stronger and safer banking system. The banking system is better capitalized, institutions are in a stronger liquidity position, there is an effective regime for stress testing, and the ability to resolve the largest institutions when they falter has been improved. Regulators are now in the process of tailoring the regulatory regime so that the strictest requirements are imposed on those institutions that pose the largest risks and the regime can continue to support financial system resiliency.\n\nEven though progress has been made, we should never forget that the financial system is constantly evolving and there will always be new risks on the horizon to assess and manage. Perhaps the most dynamic risks are those related to cybersecurity, which I will focus on for the majority of my talk. But before that, I would like to spend a few minutes on the economy and monetary policy. Of course, the views I will present today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nThe Economy and Monetary Policy\n\nThe Federal Reserve's monetary policy goals, which are mandated by Congress, are price stability and maximum employment. Currently, with respect to these goals, the overall economy is doing well: labor markets are strong and underlying inflation is consistent with our 2 percent goal. But recent data have been mixed and indicate that growth softened in the first quarter compared to last year's 3 percent pace. In my view, the most likely case is that this weakness will be temporary and that growth for the year will be at or slightly above my estimate of 2 percent trend growth, that labor markets will continue to be strong, and that inflation will stay near 2 percent, aside from the transitory effects of changes in energy prices and the usual volatility in the monthly data.\n\nOn the positive side, incomes continue to grow, reflecting the strength of the labor market, and recent readings indicate that labor productivity is rising after being quite low over the past five years. In addition, the tightening in financial conditions in the fourth quarter of last year has mostly reversed, and business, consumer, and investor sentiment have improved since the start of the year. The postponement of additional tariffs that were set to be imposed on imports from China has reduced some uncertainty and has given firms more time to reorient their supply chains. A resolution of uncertainty around trade policy could encourage further investment spending. Our District contacts across a number of sectors report that business is good and has picked up after slowing at the end of last year. On the down side, continued uncertainty over trade policy could weigh on investment spending; growth abroad, including in Europe and China, is slowing; and the outcome of Brexit is unclear. In addition, corporate debt is at very high levels; underwriting standards on leveraged loans have been weakening for some time, with a larger share of these loans going to less creditworthy borrowers; and commercial real estate valuations remain lofty. These factors have the potential to amplify an economic downturn, were one to occur.\n\nAt its March meeting two weeks ago, the FOMC elected not to make any change in its policy rate, the federal funds rate, and I supported that decision. The current target range for the federal funds rate is 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent, which is at the bottom of the range of FOMC participants' estimates of its longer-run neutral rate, a level that neither stimulates nor restricts the economy and is consistent with maximum employment and price stability. Given the current level of interest rates, and little sign that inflation is poised to rise appreciably despite the strength in labor markets, I see no urgency to change our policy stance. In my view, monetary policy does not appear to be far behind or far ahead of the curve. Before determining any further adjustments in the policy rate, we can take the opportunity to continue to gather information, see how the economy is evolving, and assess our medium-run economic forecast and the risks to that forecast. Could we be done with policy rate increases this cycle? It is possible, but if the economy performs along the lines I think is the most likely case — with growth picking back up to, or slightly above, trend, labor markets remaining strong, and inflation staying near 2 percent — the fed funds rate may need to move a bit higher than current levels. As we continue to assess the outlook, I believe that the economy is going to give us a good sense of whether policy is where it needs to be or whether further action is needed.\n\nAt its March meeting, the FOMC also released further information regarding our plans for normalizing the Fed's balance sheet. Our intention is to hold no more assets than the amount necessary to implement monetary policy effectively and efficiently within an abundant reserves framework. The Fed's balance sheet grew as a result of actions we took to address the financial crisis and Great Recession. Once we had moved our policy rate down to essentially zero, to add further monetary accommodation, we began purchasing agency mortgage-backed securities, agency debt, and longer-term Treasury securities in order to put downward pressure on long-term interest rates. The assets on the Fed's balance sheet swelled, and bank reserves, one of the liabilities on our balance sheet, rose substantially. Since October 2017, the Fed has been letting these longer-term assets gradually roll off our balance sheet, and bank reserves are now down considerably from their peak level. We will be slowing the asset runoff in May and will cease the runoff at the end of September. At that point, the average level of reserves will still likely be somewhat above the level needed to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively. So we anticipate keeping the amount of assets on our balance sheet roughly constant for a time, and as currency and other non-reserves liabilities continue to gradually rise, reserves will gradually fall. Once the FOMC decides that reserves have declined to the necessary level, assets will begin to rise again to keep pace with the trend growth in demand for our non-reserves liabilities and to maintain the appropriate level of reserves in the system.1 In terms of the composition of the Fed's balance-sheet assets, the FOMC plans to return to holding mainly Treasury securities and will be making decisions on how best to make that transition at upcoming meetings.\n\nThat is a brief summary of my views on the economy and monetary policy. Now let me turn to cybersecurity.\n\nCybersecurity Is an Important Part of Financial Stability\n\nIt would be difficult to determine the level of safety and soundness of an individual bank or of the financial system overall without paying attention to the risks to cybersecurity. While much progress has been made to address more typical banking risks, including credit, liquidity, and operational risks, cyber risks are expanding. As businesses have become more reliant on technology, efforts to disrupt an institution's operations; to steal, corrupt, or destroy data and intellectual property; or to divert funds have become more prevalent. Although it is hard to come up with firm numbers, the U.S. Council of Economic Advisers has estimated that malicious cyber activity cost the U.S. economy between $57 billion and $109 billion in 2016, and other estimates suggest those costs are rising.2 Firms are spending significant amounts on their cybersecurity, with one estimate at nearly $124 billion globally in 2019.3 While all businesses face cyber risks, given the critical role the financial sector plays in the overall health of the U.S. and global economy, the stakes are particularly high in the financial services industry.\n\nCyber risks could be viewed as a form of operational risk, but given the potential for the widespread impact of cyber attacks on the financial sector, I think it pays to put cyber risks into a special category.4 One reason is that cyber risks are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Cyber attacks have become more systematic, maliciously targeting financial firms and playing out over time for maximum effect. So, increasingly creative solutions must be found to address cyber risks. One example is Sheltered Harbor, an industry initiative that provides participant financial institutions a way to store data independent of the bank's own infrastructure. This can help make recovery quicker after an attack is detected.5 But a further complication is that detection can be difficult; an institution may believe it has backed up its good data, but those data may already have been compromised by malicious code that has infiltrated the institution's system.\n\nInstead of being idiosyncratic and affecting only a few firms, as many operational risks are, cyber threats are more likely to be correlated across institutions because of the complex interconnections and dependencies among financial firms. This means cyber threats are more likely to have wider spread negative impacts than a typical operational problem that might arise from a failed system or process. Trading platforms, settlement and payments systems, and central securities depositories are all critical infrastructures on which financial firms depend, and if these systems go down, there are few substitutes. In addition, the advent of new technologies like cloud computing creates another concentrated risk, as there are only a handful of third-party providers of these services.\n\nAs much as individual firms are investing in cybersecurity – and it is a lot – as a nation and globally, we are likely underinvesting. This is because cybersecurity is a public good: the overall financial system conveys benefits to us all. Individual institutions certainly have incentives to invest in their own cybersecurity, and banks have been making major investments to monitor and protect their systems against attack. But the social benefit conveyed by a well-functioning and resilient financial system, one in which the public can continue to have a lot of confidence, likely requires a higher level of investment in cybersecurity than what individual firms would decide to do on their own, as they consider the tradeoff between the risk of loss to their firm from a cyber attack versus the cost of that investment. In addition, to the extent that individual firms are relying on shared services, in considering how much to invest in their own cybersecurity, they should be entertaining the possibility that those shared services could be heavily taxed in the event other firms are attacked at the same time they are6 or that the shared service itself could be the entry point for a system-wide attack. These types of externalities may not be part of any one firm's investment decision. Moreover, an individual firm may rely on others in the shared network to make investments that make the network more secure, but if every firm thinks this way, there will be underinvestment in security.7\n\nCybersecurity and the Fed\n\nThe public good aspect of cybersecurity and the Federal Reserve's role in ensuring the resiliency of the financial system mean that cybersecurity is a high priority for the Fed. The Fed's approach builds on techniques that we have successfully applied to other forms of financial system oversight, namely, developing clear and consistent standards for assessing financial institutions' preparedness; establishing corporate governance best practices with respect to cybersecurity; acquiring and deploying Fed staff with the necessary technical skills to assess risk-management practices; and encouraging and creating avenues for information sharing among financial institutions and regulators.\n\nWhile much of the Fed's cybersecurity effort focuses on the nation's largest, most complex banking organizations, we have raised the expectations of cyber preparedness for all of the institutions we supervise, including regional and community banks. In fact, since 2015, the Cleveland Fed has been co-leading the Federal Reserve System's annual national horizontal review of cybersecurity for banks with assets between $100 billion and $500 billion. Fed examiners assess a bank's cybersecurity along a number of dimensions. Effective cybersecurity requires effective cyber-risk governance, including leadership's engagement in oversight of the firm's cybersecurity programs. The bank needs to have effective programs for identifying risks and vulnerabilities, including those within its own technology infrastructure, those associated with vendors and third-party technology providers, and those posed by new products. The bank is also assessed on its ability to monitor and manage those risks. This includes basics such as adequate technology inventories and timely software patching to more complex processes for incident response and plans for timely recovery and restoration of critical functions.\n\nThe Fed continues to work with other U.S. financial regulatory agencies and international authorities to harmonize cyber risk-management standards and regulatory expectations. We are looking for ways to coordinate cyber-risk supervisory activities for institutions subject to oversight from multiple regulators. The Fed is also aligning what it expects of banks in terms of identifying, protecting, detecting, responding to, and recovering from cyber attacks with the best-practice standards in the National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) cybersecurity framework.8\n\nGiven the systemic nature of cyber risks and the potential for widespread disruption, collaboration between the regulators, government, financial institutions, and other private-sector firms is a crucial ingredient for improving our cybersecurity. One form of this collaboration is tabletop exercises, which can improve the readiness of the industry and government to respond to a cyber incident. The Fed participates in the Hamilton Series of tabletop exercises, in collaboration with the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center (FS–ISAC), an important banking industry forum that promotes collaboration on critical security threats. These exercises are intended to improve public- and private-sector management of cyber risks. Participants have told us that they value these exercises because they promote consistent approaches and best practices in event response and recovery, and foster relationships with key regulatory officials.\n\nFurther development and use of stress testing to assess the financial system's resilience to cyber risks would be helpful. Just as horizontal stress testing has proven to be a useful tool in assessing the overall resilience of the financial system to credit and liquidity risks, stress testing could be used to assess how prepared individual firms and the overall system are to respond to and recover from a systemic cyber event such as the shutdown of a major clearing or settlement bank. Such a test could help evaluate firms' plans for data and core systems recovery and their reliance on third parties to implement that plan. The Bank of England is applying these stress-testing techniques to evaluate whether financial firms are able to resume services within the tolerance set by the Bank of England in the face of a system-wide attack or data corruption that affects multiple firms and their service providers.9\n\nBecause cyber threats are not restricted by national borders, cross-border collaboration is also being pursued. For example, in November 2015, the U.S. and U.K. governments conducted a joint exercise with leading global financial firms to determine how the two governments would perform in the event of a large cyber attack on the financial systems in both countries.10 The Fed participated in the exercise, which evaluated incident-response handling and recovery, coordination, public communication, and information handling.\n\nIndeed, information sharing is another critical ingredient for improving our cybersecurity. Without firms' willingness to share information on cyber incidents, it is much harder to develop metrics to evaluate cyber resilience, to assess whether threat levels are rising or beginning to propagate through the financial system, and to determine whether the practices firms have in place actually are working to mitigate the risks. The Fed has been working with FS-ISAC to promote information sharing, and the Cleveland Fed is playing a national role in the collection of threat information. The Fed's Cybersecurity Analytic Support Team (CAST) was created in 2015 and is based at the Cleveland Fed. This team tracks the latest cybersecurity developments across the financial sector in critical payment, clearing, and settlement systems, allowing it to gain a wide perspective on potential threats to the overall financial system and to better calibrate threat severity and impact. As its name implies, CAST casts a wide net in collecting this information and collaborates with the U.S. Department of the Treasury, other bank regulatory agencies, and the FBI. In addition to Federal Reserve System-level activities, the Cleveland Fed staff is also sharing its expertise on cybersecurity topics at industry and regulatory forums, and last year, the staff organized a regional conference on managing cyber risks from the C-suite, which some of you attended.11\n\nFinally, the Federal Reserve is a provider of both wholesale and retail payment services to the public and the U.S. government. We need to maintain the public's trust and confidence in our ability to deliver those services, so we are highly engaged in work to enhance the resiliency of our own systems, applications, and data against cybersecurity risks. We continue to be pro-active in looking for emerging threats and testing our systems and processes for vulnerabilities.\n\nThis is only a brief summary of the work that is being done at the Federal Reserve, in partnership with other financial regulators, government agencies, and financial institutions, to help address the cyber risks to our financial system. The work includes enhancing systems for detecting and monitoring cyber risks, as well as improving our collective ability to respond to and recover from an attack. The landscape is very dynamic. New cyber risks are emerging; they are becoming more sophisticated and complex. Given the importance of the financial system to our economic health, it is incumbent on us all to continue to work together with some urgency so that we are better prepared for cyber threats to our financial stability."

            "content": "I thank the organizers and the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis for inviting me to speak at the second annual symposium on women in economics. The St. Louis Fed has been a leader within the Federal Reserve System in focusing attention on attracting and retaining the talents of women in the economics profession. The Bank's series of podcasts with women in the field and this symposium have highlighted the challenges women face but also their successes. I believe that increasing awareness of what can be accomplished if one pursues an economics degree — that is, explaining \"the value proposition\" as they say in business — can play an important role in attracting people to the field of economics. I also believe we should not assume that people, even those in the profession, realize how significant the differences in outcomes for males and females in the profession are. So it is important to document and publicize the evidence that women and minorities are under-represented in economics, and to provide information on interventions that have been shown to help level the playing field. Today's symposium does an excellent job on these scores. Thanks to the work of the St. Louis Fed and others, the Federal Reserve System is aware of where it stands in terms of diversity, it has a better understanding of the value of promoting a diverse culture, and the System is taking concrete steps to increase diversity, inclusion, and opportunity across the institution. Of course, the views I'll present today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nI am sure that many of you are expecting me to start my remarks with a brief anecdote of how, at some point in my career, I was mistreated in some way because I am a woman. It is clear that this has happened to others and it is wrong, but I've been very lucky. In fact, I came into economics quite by accident. I didn't start out to be an economist. I majored in mathematics at Barnard College but also pursued a second major in economics because it seemed interesting and didn't require much additional course work. I applied to graduate school in math but ended up in the economics Ph.D. program at Princeton because two professors there — male professors, I might add — wrote to me explaining that Princeton's economics program was very mathematical and encouraging me to come to Princeton and study economics. I've always thought that I lucked into economics. It has provided me with a fascinating career, one that presents new questions to answer each day, and I hope that at least in a small way I've been able to provide some good in return through economic research and policymaking. Yet, economics as a field is not diverse.\n\nWhat Is the State of Diversity in Economics?\n\nEconomics is a popular major in U.S. colleges and universities, but the field has had less success in attracting women or historically under-represented racial and ethnic minorities. While there has been some improvement compared to the 1970s, this under-representation has been going on for many years. Women earn between 30 and 35 percent of the bachelor's degrees in economics, and this share has been relatively stable over the past two decades.1 It is higher than the female share of bachelor's degrees in some of the STEM fields, including computer sciences, and engineering and engineering technology, but lower than the female share of bachelor's degrees conferred in the physical sciences and in mathematics and statistics.2 Across all fields, women earn more than half of all bachelor's degrees awarded.3 This means women are choosing to major in economics at only a third of the rate of men.4 The numbers are lower for under-represented minorities, who earn slightly more than 20 percent of bachelor's degrees and slightly less than 12 percent of economics degrees awarded, meaning that minorities are choosing economics over other majors at only about half the rate of white students.5\n\nIn the professorial ranks, there were large gains in female representation in economics in the 1970s and 1980s, but since then, progress has slowed. Lundberg and Stearns (2019) examined the data available back to the 1970s on the Chairman's Group of 43 economics departments, which are the highly ranked departments and which granted about two-thirds of U.S. economics Ph.D.s in the 1970s. Gender diversity declines as one moves up the academic ranks, but at these institutions, the female shares rose significantly across the three ranks: the female share of full professors rose from 2 percent in 1972 to 6 percent in 1993. Similarly, over the same period, the female share of associate professors in the Chairman's Group of institutions rose from 4 percent to 11 percent, and the female share of assistant professors rose from 9 percent to 21 percent. By 2017, the female share of full professors and associate professors had more than doubled, up to more than 13 percent for full professors and 23 percent for associate professors. But at this group of schools, the female share of assistant professors peaked at 29 percent in 2009, and has fallen to 24 percent since then, meaning little net growth for more than two decades.\n\nThe American Economic Association's Committee on the Status of Women in the Economics Profession (CSWEP) does an annual survey of a broad group of economics departments, with data going back to the 1990s. In 2017, CSWEP surveyed 126 doctoral departments and 125 nondoctoral departments, and received responses back from all the doctoral programs and 113 of the nondoctoral programs.6 At the departments offering Ph.D.s in economics, the assistant professor share has not regressed since 2009 as it did in the Chairman's group of schools, but it has not grown either.7 And in the CSWEP sample, in 2017 about 32 percent of first-year Ph.D. students in economics were women and women accounted for about the same share of those who earned Ph.D.s in economics in 2017. These shares have basically stayed between 30 and 35 percent over the past two decades.8\n\nOur focus today is on women in the profession, but minorities are also under-represented in economics. Analysis of minority representation in graduate economics is complicated a bit by the fact that almost 60 percent of doctorates awarded in economics are awarded to nonpermanent resident students. Some of these graduates return to their own countries, while others stay in the U.S. Restricting attention to U.S. citizens and permanent residents, of the 468 economics doctorates awarded in 2017, only 34, that is, 7 percent, were awarded to under-represented minorities: 15 were earned by African Americans, 18 by Hispanics or Latinos, and 1 by an American Indian or Native Alaskan.9 This is a lower percentage than earned Ph.D.s across the STEM fields, where under-represented minorities earned 11 percent of the Ph.Ds. in 2017.10 In the academic professorial ranks in economics, under-represented minorities make up a little over 10 percent of assistant professors and about 7 percent of full professors.\n\nWe can certainly applaud the progress that has been made since the 1970s, but it is clear that there is more work to be done. While you don't need to have majored in economics to enter a Ph.D. program in economics, it is a natural path. So the under-representation of women and minorities in economics at the undergraduate level factors into the under-representation of these groups at the graduate level and throughout the ranks of academia. Unless the entry of women and minorities into graduate school picks up, it is hard to see how the numbers of Ph.D.s in the ranks of academia and in nonacademic positions that require a Ph.D. in economics can increase.\n\nA natural question to ask is: what fields are women choosing to go into, if not economics? The humanities, including English, foreign languages, and visual arts, and nursing continue to attract women, as they have traditionally done. But women have been selecting other social sciences as well. Data from the National Center for Education Statistics indicate that psychology is a relatively large major, accounting for about 6 percent of all bachelor's degrees conferred in the 2016-2017 academic year, with about 78 percent earned by women.11 Business is a large major: almost 20 percent of bachelor's degrees conferred were in business, with 47 percent of those earned by women. Women have also been selecting the sciences. Biology accounts for about 6 percent of degrees conferred, with about 61 percent earned by women. At the Ph.D. level, the female shares in these fields are also relatively high.12\n\nThe fact that women are attracted to other social sciences, some of the natural sciences, and business suggests more progress can and should be made to attract women to economics.\n\nWhy Does It Matter?\n\nYou might ask: why should we care? Shouldn't students be able to choose their field of study and career path? Something that interests them and in which they have a comparative advantage in succeeding? The low level of diversity in economics may just reflect people's preferences. That's a possibility, but the fact that the business major is attractive to women may suggest something else. And even if that's the case, then it is incumbent upon those of us in the field and upon educators to ensure that students can make informed choices and that they understand the value of an economics degree to the individual and to society. And it is imperative that we offer them the opportunity to perform on a level playing field and eliminate barriers that women and minorities face when pursuing a career in economics.\n\nBut there is a bigger reason as well. Economics is a field that influences public policy, policy that affects all types of people. So it is important that we have diverse views informing that policy. I believe Fed policymakers like me need to consider the effects of our monetary, regulatory, and payments policies on all our constituents. We are, after all, working on their behalf. That becomes easier to do when we have a diverse staff. The Federal Reserve System employs about 700 Ph.D. economists and many others with bachelor's and master's degrees in economics. In order to maintain a diverse staff, it is important that more women and minorities be attracted to the field.\n\nMoreover, I have seen firsthand how having a diversity of views expressed and discussed around the table can actually lead to better policy decisions. Sometimes what seems to be a nonmainstream idea when first offered, in time, becomes the leading idea. There is research to back this up. Group dynamics are different when teams are diverse. Participants don't necessarily find it as comfortable to serve on a diverse team, but the diversity helps to avoid everyone thinking in the same way. Diverse teams tend to be more objective and to focus on the facts when making decisions; they may process information more carefully because they are forced to confront a different way of thinking and convince those with alternative views; and firms with more diversity tend to be more innovative.13 Research also shows that firms with diverse management tend to have above-average earnings.14 Perhaps the better decision-making and innovation associated with diversity is showing up on the bottom line.\n\nBeyond current policy and business outcomes, another reason I would like to see more diversity in the field of economics is so the field itself doesn't get stymied by group-think. To expand our knowledge, economics needs to continually take on new research questions and develop innovative techniques and ways of analysis to arrive at answers to these questions. Broader representation in economics means a broader set of issues will be tackled and a broader set of research results disseminated. The field will continue to evolve, resulting in better policy outcomes that will improve the economic well being of a greater share of the population.\n\nWhat Can Be Done to Increase Diversity in Economics?\n\nThe natural next question to ask is: what can we do to increase diversity in the field of economics? This is a complex problem, with no easy answers. The good news is that there is an increasing awareness of the diversity problem, some programs have been developed to try to address the issue, and solid research design methods are being applied to evaluate potential interventions.15 This research can help guide us, but at this stage of the journey toward increased diversity, the approach likely has to be of the \"let a thousand flowers bloom\" variety: trying many things on several fronts, and then evaluating their effects. So let me conclude my remarks with a few suggestions.\n\nI start with the mindset described by the adage: don't attribute to malice what is best explained by ignorance. We need to convince more of those in charge that there is a problem. I applaud the work that has been done in documenting the trends in diversity in the field of economics. Economics is a data-intensive field. Coupling the data with the research indicating diversity has positive returns should be persuasive to other economists. We cannot just convince the women in the field there's an issue; we also need to convince the men, who, as the numbers show, are in the majority and therefore have decision rights. This has to be done not only in universities but also at major employers, like the Fed, and at important institutions like the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER).\n\nThe good news is that this is already happening. The American Economic Association is taking a close look at diversity in the economics profession and is offering programs and resources aimed at increasing diversity at all levels. The Undergraduate Women in Economics (UWE) Challenge, funded by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, and run by Tatyana Avilova and Claudia Goldin, is a randomized controlled trial that is offering grants to economics departments for efforts to increase the number of female majors. The fact that the researchers received such positive interest suggests that many departments see increasing diversity in economics as a worthy goal.16 Diversity and inclusion have become a focus at the Fed, and also at other major employers of economists like the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Bank of England, and the European Central Bank (ECB). This symposium established by the St. Louis Fed is an example of some of the work being undertaken at the Federal Reserve System. I am happy that the Cleveland Fed will host this symposium next year.\n\nAnother reason we need to convince more men that this is an issue is that, for the time being, they make up the majority of the role models available for women economics students and for women in the profession. The empirical evidence on role models is somewhat mixed.17 One study of a selective liberal arts college that essentially involved random assignment of students to instructors found that having an instructor of the same gender didn't increase the probability of a student taking more classes or majoring in the field, regardless of the gender distribution in the department, although it did have some effect on grading.18 But these results do not suggest that mentoring itself is not helpful. The AEA's mentoring workshop, CeMENT, held after the annual winter meetings, in which participants present and receive feedback on their research, does seem to have resulted in an increase in overall and top-tier publication rates and grant receipts.19\n\nIn addition, we should not be requiring women to do all the mentoring of other women. This places an undue burden of service on them, which may disadvantage female professors as they seek advancement up the professorial ranks. We need to let female students know that the lack of available women does not mean a lack of role models.\n\nA second step is to increase the demand for an economics degree among women and minorities. The financial crisis and Great Recession led many, no doubt, to question the usefulness of the profession, despite the fact that economists created many of the remedies. I believe those in the profession — both male and female — need to do more to explain what economics is and the many ways it can be used to help society. Merriam-Webster defines economics as \"a social science concerned chiefly with description and analysis of the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services.\" Who wants to study that? I'd rather be working on robotics and autonomous vehicles, too. Others view economics as a path to working in finance or running a business, but that limited view may put off people who are more motivated to help society. We need to embrace the fact that economics is a social science, one that helps us think about how people use scarce resources, interact in markets or in other economic settings, respond to incentives, and make trade-offs. The fact that economics involves people and their choices makes economics complicated but also impactful to society and an interesting intellectual pursuit. Given the popularity of the psychology major among women, emphasizing the behavioral aspects of economics and its wide application could help to attract women to the field.\n\nIndeed, some of the interventions being examined in the UWE Challenge are intended to provide more accurate information on the breadth of application of economics and the career paths available to economics majors. Preliminary results from a field experiment undertaken by Southern Methodist University, a participant in the Challenge, suggest these types of informational interventions can effectively raise the number of women choosing to major in economics.20 Another study found that first-year college students at a Swiss university who were assigned to write a paper on economics were more likely to major in economics, evidence that learning more about the field can attract students to it. However, the effect on choice of major was driven by male students; for females, the effect was not statistically significant.\n\nWe likely need to start much earlier than college if we hope to attract more women and minorities to the field. I serve on the board of the Council for Economic Education. This nonprofit organization's mission is to educate students in kindergarten through high school about economics and personal finance so they can make better decisions for themselves, their families, and their communities. In addition to providing materials to teachers, the council runs the National Economics Challenge, a quiz bowl competition that reaches a wide population of students in terms of gender, race, and income. A recent survey found that challenge participants' performance on advanced placement exams exceeds the national average, with especially strong gains shown by female and minority students, and that participants are more likely than nonparticipants to choose to major in economics.21 This suggests that exposure to economics at a younger age can help spur knowledge of and interest in the field.\n\nEconomics is a quantitative field. The answer to getting more women to choose economics is not to make it less mathematical. Indeed, the argument that women may be turned off by the quantitative nature of the field is not supported by the evidence. Recall that women earn over 40 percent of bachelor's degrees in math and statistics, a higher share than in economics.22 In addition, women do well in math at the high school level; women are selecting other fields that are very quantitative, like psychology; and studies indicate that math aptitude doesn't explain gender differences in participation in upper-level economics courses.23 Instead, it is important that students know early on that mathematics, statistics, and econometrics are necessary if they are to pursue an advanced degree. I was always struck by the fact that the undergraduate economics curriculum seems very different from graduate-level economics. That's likely because economics is taken by many who do not plan to do graduate work in the field. In order to ensure that students don't learn too late what skills they need to enter graduate school, several universities have interdisciplinary programs combining economics and mathematics so that students have the proper foundation for advancing in the field.\n\nThe American Economic Association offers a summer training and scholarship program to help prepare students for graduate school and, with the National Science Foundation, a Summer Economics Fellows Program, which is designed to increase the participation and advancement of women and under-represented minorities in economics. The Cleveland Fed held the first workshop for research assistants across the Federal Reserve System to give them a sense of what is required to get into and succeed in graduate school. We will be holding our second workshop this summer.\n\nIn thinking about ways to spur more diverse participation, it is always good to remember a lesson from economics: with any intervention there can be unintended consequences. For example, many universities have enacted policies that allow assistant professors to extend their tenure clocks when they have children. In the interest of fairness, they have made these policies gender neutral. But at least one study finds that the policies increase the probability that men get tenure in their first job but reduce the probability that women get tenure, even when controlling for number of publications.24 This leads me to my last suggestion: the use of \"nudges.\"\n\nBehavioral economists use the term \"nudge\" for something that isn't mandated but points people in the right direction and can change behavior.25 We are all born with unconscious biases — we tend to relate better to people who are more like us. This presents a challenge to women and under-represented minorities trying to get ahead in the field, affecting recommendation letters, the probably of getting published, and tenure decisions.26 Making decision-makers aware of these biases has been shown to affect behavior in a positive way; so disseminating the research that shows that women are treated differently in the profession to those in the profession is useful.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the junior people in the economics profession to do the best work they can, which means learning all they can, seeking out opportunities to present their own research, and asking for advice. It is the responsibility of the senior people in the profession to cultivate an inclusive environment so that all have the opportunity to reach their potential. Some people feel that the atmosphere in economic seminars is too aggressive; others feel it helps generate better research. Rather than change the seminar culture, we should do what we can to make women feel comfortable in that setting. After all, critique is part of research, and to be successful at publishing your work, one has to get used to it and persevere. As I learned in my German course, \"Übung macht den Meister,\" that is, \"Practice makes perfect.\" Practice seminars and study groups can help people become more comfortable sharing ideas and questioning others. Senior members of the profession can help ensure that their study groups are more inclusive and they can draw out those reluctant to speak up. And in a meeting, when Sheila offers an idea that is totally ignored until Bruce repeats it and is declared a genius, point out to the group that Sheila made the same point earlier and ask her to elaborate. If you find yourself putting together a program committee to select papers for a conference, or organizing the conference or a seminar series, work hard to ensure there is diversity on the committee, on the program, and in the seminar series. This does take some effort, but it can be done. If you are sponsoring a conference or seminar series, make diversity a top priority.\n\nFinally, you may have noticed the title of my talk and thought: \"Perspectives of a brown-eyed economist? That's silly!\" You're right. But how many would have thought that if I had titled this \"Perspectives of a woman economist?\" That seems more natural — but it shouldn't. No one really wants to be known as a woman economist, or a woman chef, or a woman banker. We don't want to be qualified by our gender. We are economists, chefs, and bankers who just happen to be women.\n\nIt is difficult to change institutions and cultures. But I am confident that with concerted efforts from both men and women, economics will become more diversified and inclusive, which will strengthen economic research and policymaking and, in turn, help promote a healthier economy for a wider group of people. I look forward to the time when the top women in the field are not considered top women economists, but instead are viewed as unqualified successes."

            "content": "I thank the University of Delaware and Lyons Companies for inviting me to speak today at your annual forum on the economic outlook. I spent a large part of my career in Philadelphia and had the pleasure of interacting with faculty and students from the University of Delaware on a number of occasions. So it is nice to be back.\n\nIf I had to choose a banner headline, I would characterize 2019 as a year of transitions, for the economy, for monetary policy, and for how we communicate about policy. I would like to spend my time this morning on some of the factors affecting these transitions. The views I'll present today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Economy\n\nLast year was another strong one for the U.S. economy. The economy has been growing at an above-trend pace for the past couple of years, with estimates suggesting that growth was a strong 3 percent in 2018. Growth has been supported by fiscal stimulus in the form of tax cuts and higher federal government spending, as well as accommodative financial conditions. Labor market conditions continue to be very strong. Last year, the economy added more than 2.6 million jobs; that's over 220,000 jobs per month. In January, payrolls rose by more than 300,000 jobs. The unemployment rate has been at or below 4.0 percent for almost a year, which is near the historical lows seen over the past 50 years and well below estimates of its sustainable level over the longer run. Along with this strong employment growth, wages have accelerated, and because the pickup has been in line with productivity growth and inflation, it has not added to inflationary pressures. After several years of being below-target, inflation moved up and has been relatively stable around the FOMC's 2 percent objective. So from the perspective of the Fed's congressionally mandated goals of maximum employment and price stability, the U.S. economy has performed very well.\n\nTo achieve this performance, since December 2015, when the expansion was well underway, the FOMC has been gradually moving our policy rate, the federal funds rate, up from the extraordinarily low level that was needed to address the Great Recession. The current target range for the federal funds rate is 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent, which is at the bottom of the range of FOMC participants' estimates of its longer-run neutral rate, a level that neither stimulates nor restricts the economy and is consistent with maximum employment and price stability. In addition to bringing interest rates up to more normal levels, since October 2017, the FOMC has also been letting the longer-term assets that we purchased to add accommodation to address the financial crisis and Great Recession gradually roll off the Fed's balance sheet.\n\nThe question is: where do the economy and monetary policy go from here? As I mentioned, I believe 2019 will be a year of transitions. Let me address the economy first, and then turn to policy and communications.\n\nMy expectation is that the economy will maintain its good performance in 2019. Underlying economic fundamentals remain sound. Household incomes have been rising, reflecting the strength of the job market and lower taxes. In the aggregate, households have been able to increase savings and their debt levels are manageable, making for sound balance sheets. Overall, the business sector also remains sound, with favorable profits and lower taxes supporting investment spending and hiring. In my view, the most likely case is that this year, the economy will transition from above-trend growth to a somewhat slower pace, in the 2 to 2-1/2 percent range, reflecting less of a boost from fiscal stimulus and less accommodative financial conditions. Employment growth will also slow a bit, but it will remain strong enough to absorb those entering the workforce, and I expect the unemployment rate to remain at or below 4 percent. As this transition toward a sustainable pace occurs, I expect inflation to remain near 2 percent, with the usual transitory ups and downs.\n\nBut with all economic forecasts, there are risks. While the economy begins the year with sound fundamentals, it faces some cross-currents and headwinds. Surveys indicate that households and businesses are less confident about the economy than they were, and in the fourth quarter of last year, investor sentiment shifted and investors began putting significant weight on downside risks to the forecast. The increase in volatility, the decline in equity prices, and the increase in credit spreads of corporate bond yields relative to Treasury yields that occurred in the fourth quarter have partially reversed since the start of this year. But risks to the outlook remain. Growth abroad, including China and Europe, is expected to slow this year, but there is some uncertainty around how much of a slowdown there will be. The path and outcome of Brexit add further uncertainty, as does the outcome of U.S. trade and tariff negotiations.\n\nThe Cleveland Federal Reserve District has greater exposure to trade, manufacturing, and motor vehicle production than other parts of the country. The majority of our business contacts report that while their concerns about trade policy and global growth are rising, they have not yet deferred or canceled planned investment because of the uncertainty. However, some firms, including larger multinational firms, have become more hesitant. Should the slowdown in the economies of our major trading partners, including China and Germany, be sharper than expected or should the continued uncertainty persuade more firms to take a wait-and-see attitude, U.S. growth may slow more than anticipated. Of course, a favorable resolution to some of the uncertainty could buoy sentiment and lead to a pickup in investment and stronger than expected growth in the U.S.\n\nOverall, in my view the most likely outcome is that the economic expansion will continue this year, with growth transitioning to a more sustainable pace, at or slightly above trend, but the risks around the forecast, including slowing global growth, uncertainty over trade policy, tighter financial conditions, and the changes in business and consumer sentiment, bear watching.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nWhat does this mean for monetary policy? Similar to the economy's transition toward a more sustainable pace, monetary policy is also transitioning.\n\nAt its January meeting, the FOMC decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent, and we have adopted a wait-and-see approach regarding future rate adjustments. I fully supported this decision because I believe that policy, for the time being, is well-calibrated to the economic outlook and the risks around that outlook.\n\nWhen the economy was growing well above trend, labor market conditions were continuing to tighten, inflation was moving to target, and the funds rate was very low, policy decisions were fairly straightforward. The FOMC's strategy was to continue to gradually reduce the extraordinary accommodation that had been put in place to address the Great Recession.\n\nNow we have entered a new phase — our policy decisions are less straightforward and we are transitioning back to normal monetary policymaking. The reduction in accommodation has brought our policy rate to the lower end of the range of FOMC participants' estimates of its longer-run neutral rate, although there is uncertainty around the exact level of the policy rate that is consistent with a neutral stance. In addition, our most recent policy rate increases are still working themselves through the economy, and we are gradually reducing the longer-term assets on our balance sheet, which likely is putting some upward pressure on term premia and, therefore, on longer-term interest rates.\n\nWith respect to our monetary policy goals of price stability and maximum employment, the economy is in a very good spot. Growth is slowing from an above-trend pace toward a more sustainable pace, and labor markets are strong. While the unemployment rate is lower than the level that is sustainable in the longer run, inflation is near 2 percent and does not show signs of appreciably rising.\n\nIn my view, monetary policy does not appear to be far behind or far ahead of the curve. This environment gives us the opportunity to continue to gather information on the economy and assess our medium-run forecast and the risks around that forecast, before making any further adjustments in the policy rate. This information includes the official statistics, financial market indicators, the survey evidence on economic activity and sentiment, and reports from our regional contacts. The anecdotal information we gather from our contacts will be particularly useful in helping us understand household and business sentiment and how both sectors are dealing with some of the uncertainties clouding the outlook.\n\nIf the economy performs along the lines that I've outlined as most likely, the fed funds rate may need to move a bit higher than current levels. But if some of the downside risks to the forecast manifest themselves, and the economy turns out to be weaker than expected and jeopardizes our dual mandate goals, I will need to adjust my outlook and policy views. So the economy is going to give us a good sense of whether policy is where it needs to be or whether further action is needed.\n\nIn addition to normalizing interest rates, the FOMC has also been letting the longer-term assets on our balance sheet roll off, and bank reserves are down considerably from their peak level. As the FOMC announced in January, we plan to continue to use our current operating framework for implementing monetary policy. At coming meetings, we will be finalizing our plans for ending the balance-sheet runoff and completing balance-sheet normalization.1\n\nSo with respect to both our policy rate setting and our balance sheet, we are transitioning back to normal monetary policymaking.\n\nMonetary Policy Communications\n\nAnd with this transition, our policy communications will be transitioning as well. The FOMC's communications about monetary policy decisions are important for a couple of reasons. First, while Congress has set the Fed's goals, it has also wisely given the Fed independence in making monetary policy decisions in pursuit of those goals. Insulating monetary policy decisions from short-run political interference but holding policymakers accountable for those decisions yields better economic outcomes. In order to be held accountable, policymakers need to explain their decisions, their assessment of economic conditions, and their outlook for the economy and the risks to the outlook.\n\nClear communications also make monetary policy more effective. When households, businesses, and investors have a better sense of how monetary policy is likely to change conditional on the outlook, they can make better economic and financial decisions.\n\nIn response to the Great Recession, the FOMC gave fairly explicit guidance about the future path of interest rates. With no further room to reduce interest rates, this forward guidance worked not only as a communication device but also as a policy tool. Reassuring the public that the fed funds rate would be kept very low until the economy improved put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and made monetary policy more accommodative.2\n\nAs the economic expansion took hold, the FOMC no longer needed to use forward guidance as a policy tool to add monetary accommodation. Economic conditions and the outlook indicated that our policy rate would likely need to be on an upward path to promote our monetary policy goals. So in the interest of transparency, our policy statements still offered some guidance about this expected path of the federal funds rate.\n\nNow, as we approach normal policymaking, our communication needs to transition because there is less certainty about the future path of policy. The economy is dynamic, and the future path of policy will depend on how economic and financial conditions actually change over time. Those changes cannot be fully known in advance, so policy cannot be pre-set. Some have used the term \"data-dependent\" policymaking, but it is important to know what this term means and what it doesn't mean. It doesn't mean that policy will react to every short-run change in the data. Some shocks that hit the economy will result in an accumulation of information that changes the medium-run outlook for the economy and the risks around the outlook in such a way that monetary policy will want to respond. But some shocks will not materially change the outlook or policymakers' views of appropriate policy.\n\n\"Data-dependent\" also doesn't mean that policymakers will be unsystematic in their approach to policymaking. Policy needs to be flexible to respond to changes in economic and financial developments that inform the outlook, but the response should be fairly predictable and not a surprise if those developments occur.\n\nThe communication challenge, then, is to give the public a good sense of how policy is likely to respond conditional on how the economy evolves without implying that policy is pre-committed to a particular path regardless of how the economy evolves. Our policy statement can help to do this if it does three things: (1) discusses a consistent set of factors that inform our outlook, risks, and progress toward our monetary policy goals; (2) describes how accumulated changes in those economic and financial conditions have or have not affected our outlook and risk assessment since our last meeting; and (3) points to this relationship between accumulated information and our outlook and risk assessment as the rationale for our policy decision\n\nThe FOMC's Summary of Economic Projections can also help inform the public about the FOMC's outlook for the economy and policy, but it is very important to know what these projections are and what they are not. Four times a year, each FOMC participant submits projections of the most likely outcomes for real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and core inflation, conditional on the path of policy that each participant sees as likely to be appropriate for promoting our policy goals. The FOMC provides summary information, including the median, central tendency, and range of projections for each variable across participants, as well as a dot plot of information on the policy paths that individual FOMC participants view as appropriate. The median path provides a reasonable view across participants of the Committee's current assessment of appropriate policy given the state of the economy and expected developments. But this path is not a commitment. When economic and financial conditions evolve differently than expected, policy may need to be set differently than previously anticipated. This happened in both 2015 and 2016, when the FOMC ended up raising the funds rate fewer times than anticipated in the median projection made in March of those years. The fact that the dots can change over time because of economic developments is a design feature, not a flaw\n\nIncluded with the projections are charts illustrating the uncertainty bands around the median projections of each variable, including the median policy path.3 These uncertainty bands deserve more attention. They are a good illustration of the reasonable amount of variation to expect in the projections. The bands get wider as the projection horizon extends because the future is uncertain and the economy can evolve in unexpected ways. The uncertainty band around the median policy path is a good reminder that policy is not pre-set. If the economy does evolve in an unanticipated way, policy will need to respond in an appropriate and systematic way. So our anticipated policy path may change over time as the economy evolves. But this is normal monetary policymaking.\n\nSummary\n\nIn summary, 2019 will be a year of transitions for the economy, for monetary policy, and for monetary policy communications. In my view, the most likely case this year is that the economy will transition toward a more sustainable pace of growth, with continued strength in labor markets and inflation near 2 percent. But we must remain attentive to several risks to the outlook, including the slowdown in global growth, uncertainty over trade policy, tighter financial conditions, and the changes in business and consumer sentiment. We are transitioning toward normal monetary policymaking where the future path of policy is determined by how changes in economic and financial conditions affect the medium-run outlook and risks around that outlook. With the federal funds rate now at the lower end of the range of FOMC participants' estimates of its longer-run neutral level and with monetary policy neither ahead of nor behind the curve, we can take the time to make that assessment. Our monetary policy communications are also transitioning with less emphasis on forward guidance about future interest rate moves and more focus on the economic and financial information that affects our medium-run outlook and on how policy is likely to respond to changes in the outlook and risks."

            "content": "The remarks on the national economy and monetary policy are the same as those delivered February 12, 2019.\n\nI thank the University of Kentucky's Gatton College of Business and Economics for inviting me to participate in the 2019 Economic Outlook Conference. The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland is pleased to have a productive, ongoing relationship with the Gatton College, including co-sponsorship of annual workshops and seminars presented by Gatton faculty and Cleveland Fed researchers. I am especially looking forward to hearing the other speakers' take on the economy and the question and answer portion of the program because as we navigate through the year, we will need to be particularly attuned to what is happening on the ground.\n\nAs many of you probably know, Lexington falls within the Cleveland Fed's District, which includes the state of Ohio and parts of Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and West Virginia. The Cleveland Fed is one of 12 regional Reserve Banks distributed across the country that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., comprise the Federal Reserve System. This regional structure helps us to collect information from around the country so that our monetary policy decisions can take into account the diversity of the American economy and its people. I am very grateful for the many contacts throughout our District who generously share with us their insights into business activity, labor markets, and financial conditions. This timely information is collected through our surveys and in meetings of our advisory councils and boards of directors. We have a business advisory council here in Lexington, and I would like to thank Dr. Ken Troske for serving on the group. The information he and his colleagues provide is very helpful to me as I formulate my economic outlook and monetary policy views, which I'll speak about today. My remarks will reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee, the monetary policymaking body within the Fed.\n\nThe National Economic Outlook\n\nCongress has given the Fed its monetary policy goals of price stability and maximum employment. From the standpoint of those goals, the U.S. economy is doing very well. The economy has been growing at an above-trend pace for the past couple of years, with estimates suggesting that growth was a strong 3 percent last year. Labor market conditions continue to be very strong, with above-trend job growth and very low unemployment. And after several years of being below-target, inflation has moved up and has been relatively stable around the FOMC's 2 percent objective.\n\nMy expectation is that the economy will maintain its good performance in 2019. In my view, the most likely case is that we will see somewhat slower growth than we did last year, reflecting less of a boost from fiscal stimulus and less accommodative financial conditions. I expect growth to be at or slightly above trend, in the 2 to 2-1/2 percent range. Employment growth will also slow a bit, but it will remain strong enough to absorb those entering the workforce, and I expect the unemployment rate to remain at or below 4 percent. As this transition toward a sustainable pace occurs, I expect inflation to remain near 2 percent, with the usual transitory ups and downs.\n\nIf this outlook comes to pass, we will chalk up 2019 as another very good year for the economy. But the path to sustainability is rarely smooth, and uncertainty is clouding the outlook. The partial shutdown of the federal government is a case in point. It caused significant hardships for the workers who weren't getting paid and for businesses that rely on the parts of the government that weren't operating. In terms of the overall economy, we will see somewhat slower growth in the first quarter than we otherwise would, but I expect that to be made up in the second quarter, as long as we avoid another shutdown. The shutdown came at a time when people were already feeling a bit uneasy. In the fourth quarter of last year, investor sentiment shifted and investors began putting significant weight on downside risks to the forecast. As a result, there was a sharp increase in volatility, a decline in equity prices, and an increase in the credit spread of corporate bond yields relative to Treasury yields. It was a good reminder that the economy is dynamic and can take unexpected turns. While we all have to look forward and make our best assessment of how the economy is doing, we also have to be ready to change those views should the incoming information warrant it.\n\nSince the start of the year, conditions in financial markets have eased, although they remain tighter than they were last fall. Surveys indicate that households and businesses are less confident about the economy than they were, but so far, much of the incoming data are consistent with slower but still solid growth. Household incomes have been rising, reflecting the strength of the job market and lower taxes. In the aggregate, households have been able to increase savings and their debt levels are manageable, making for sound balance sheets. These factors have been supporting solid consumer spending, which is over two-thirds of output. Going forward, we will need to keep a close eye on whether household sentiment weakens so much that people postpone spending or whether they remain cautiously optimistic and continue to spend.\n\nThe housing market has slowed over the past year. Affordability is becoming an issue because the 30-year mortgage rate has been trending up since mid-2016 and house price appreciation continues to exceed income growth. Looking forward, the tax changes contain several provisions that affect homeownership, including the limits on deductions for mortgage interest and for state and local taxes, which includes property taxes. On the other hand, strong labor markets mean more people are now in the position to make the commitment to purchase a home. On balance, I don't expect housing to contribute much to economic growth this year, but I don't expect to see a sharp pullback in the sector either.\n\nBusiness spending was quite strong in the first half of last year, supported by strong earnings growth and changes in tax policy that included lower corporate tax rates and full expensing of investment in equipment and intangibles. But business spending moderated in the second half of the year, as financial conditions tightened and uncertainty over tariffs, trade policy, and growth abroad began to weigh on manufacturers and other firms dependent on exports.\n\nSometimes I am asked why the Fed takes into account how other economies are doing when our monetary policy goals pertain to the U.S. economy. The answer is because how economies in the rest of the world fare can spill over to the U.S. through trade and financial markets. Growth abroad, including China and Europe, is expected to slow this year, but there is some uncertainty around how much of a slowdown there will be. The path and outcome of Brexit add further uncertainty, as does the outcome of trade and tariff negotiations. Indeed, some of the slowdown abroad is likely related to changes in and uncertainty over trade policy. So far, the majority of our business contacts continue to report that while their concerns about trade policy and global growth are rising, their investment plans remain intact. But some larger multinational firms have become more hesitant, and several manufacturing contacts have said that the tariffs have been disruptive to their supply chains, forcing them to find alternative suppliers or face increasing costs of production. Should the slowdown in the economies of our major trading partners, including China and Germany, be sharper than expected or should the continued uncertainty persuade more firms to take a wait-and-see attitude, U.S. growth may slow more than anticipated. Of course, a favorable resolution to some of the uncertainty could buoy sentiment and lead to a pickup in investment and stronger than expected growth in the U.S.\n\nOverall, in my view the most likely outcome is that the economic expansion will continue this year, with growth moving down to a more sustainable pace, at or slightly above trend, but the risks around the forecast, including slowing global growth, uncertainty over trade policy, tighter financial conditions, and the changes in business and consumer sentiment, bear watching.\n\nThe strong economic growth we have experienced over the past few years has been accompanied by strong labor market conditions. Last year, the economy added more than 2.6 million jobs; that's over 220,000 jobs per month. In January, payrolls rose by more than 300,000 jobs. This is much stronger than trend job growth, which most estimates put in the range of 75,000 to 120,000 per month. The unemployment rate has been at or below 4.0 percent for almost a year, which is near the historical lows seen over the past 50 years. It seems unlikely that this low level can be maintained over the longer run. Our business and labor contacts, across a variety of industries, have been reporting to us for quite some time that it is very difficult to find workers across all skill levels. Some firms have shifted from looking for new hires to doing all they can to retain their current workers, including offering more flexible work schedules and raising wages. These anecdotal reports have shown through to the national statistics. Aggregate measures of compensation are now in the 3 percent range, after being quite subdued earlier in the expansion. This is a welcome increase. It gives workers more purchasing power, but because the pickup has been in line with productivity growth and inflation, it has not added to inflationary pressures.\n\nThe FOMC has set a symmetric goal of 2 percent inflation, as measured by the year-over-year change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, that is, PCE inflation. Our goal is symmetric, meaning that we don't want to see inflation run either persistently above or persistently below this goal. When assessing where the economy is relative to our goal, monetary policymakers look through short-term variations in the inflation measures and focus on the underlying medium- to long-term trends in inflation.\n\nAfter running below 2 percent for much of the expansion, inflation rates have firmed over the last several years. Last year, higher energy prices boosted headline PCE inflation above 2 percent, and the recent decline in energy prices will likely mean that inflation will move below 2 percent in the first part of the year. But the core inflation measures, which exclude food and energy prices, show that underlying trend inflation is essentially at the Fed's goal of 2 percent. The key to this good performance is that expectations about inflation over the medium to longer term have been stable. This has kept inflation pressures at bay despite the tightness in labor markets, the strength of the economy, and reports from business contacts that they have more pricing power now than they have had in many years. Going forward, with appropriate adjustments in monetary policy that maintain stable inflation expectations, my outlook is that inflation will remain near our symmetric 2 percent goal.\n\nBefore turning to monetary policy, let me say something about the regional economy.\n\nThe Regional Economy\n\nThe Lexington metropolitan area has shown some of the strongest economic performance in the Cleveland Fed's District, and this performance has been aided by strong longer-term fundamentals. For example, from 1996 to 2008, the Lexington metro area saw a strong 20 percent increase in population, about double that of the state of Kentucky, and stronger than the 16 percent pace seen for the U.S. as a whole. This strong population growth was accompanied by solid job growth of 11 percent, somewhat higher than what the state saw, though not quite as high as the national pace.1 Lexington's performance compares very favorably to that of the Cleveland metro area, which lost about 3 percent of its population and more than 3 percent of its jobs over the same time period.\n\nSince the expansion began in June 2009, the relative economic performance of Lexington has remained solid. Both population growth and job growth in the Lexington metro area have significantly outpaced the nation's. On net, payroll jobs are about 18 percent higher than they were when the expansion started. The metro area's unemployment rate peaked at 8.8 percent in the aftermath of the recession, well below the 10 percent peak seen for the nation as a whole. Lexington's unemployment rate is now down to 3.3 percent, well below the nation's 4 percent rate. The one place where Lexington has not kept pace with the nation is in real per capita income growth. It has been rising over the expansion, but only between a half and two-thirds of the national pace.\n\nResearch shows that regions that are resilient, that is, regions that have been able to avoid persistent declines in population over the long run, tend to have a more diverse industry mix and a more educated population.2 Lexington scores well on both counts. Like many parts of the Cleveland Fed's District, historically manufacturing has accounted for a relatively larger share of the Lexington metro area's jobs compared to the nation. That is still true, but over time, Lexington's industry mix has become more diversified. In the 1990s, manufacturing represented 16 percent of Lexington's jobs; that share has now fallen to about 11 percent.3 In addition to manufacturing, the mining and government sectors also represent a larger share of jobs in Lexington than they do at the national level. But over the expansion, the region has been adding jobs in education, healthcare, and professional and business services.\n\nEducation is the key to helping ensure that a region's population acquires the necessary skills for the jobs available now and in the future.4 In terms of education, the Lexington metro area compares quite favorably with the nation, with a higher percentage of the population having earned a bachelor's degree or further education.5 Lexington benefits from having the University of Kentucky right here, as well as other strong colleges in the region. Not all jobs will require a college degree. Cleveland Fed research indicates that compared to other parts of the country, Lexington has a somewhat higher share of so-called \"opportunity occupations.\" These are jobs that pay above-median wages but don't require a bachelor's degree.6 These types of jobs still require training, but it often takes less time and money to transition into them. In addition to a skilled workforce, effective leadership and collaboration among businesses, government, nonprofits, and individuals have helped areas navigate economic transitions driven by technological change and globalization.7 Workforce development will need to remain an important focus of civic and business leaders in the region to ensure that Lexington will be able to extend its solid economic performance into the future.\n\nNow that I have given you a sense of my outlook for the economy, let me conclude with some remarks on monetary policy.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nSince December 2015, when the expansion was well underway, the FOMC has been gradually moving the policy rate up from the extraordinarily low level that was needed to address the Great Recession. At its January meeting, the FOMC decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate, our policy rate, at 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent, and we have adopted a wait-and-see approach regarding future rate adjustments. I fully supported this decision because I believe that policy, for the time being, is well-calibrated to the economic outlook and the risks around that outlook.\n\nOur policy rate is now at the lower end of the range of FOMC participants' estimates of its longer-run neutral rate, a level that neither stimulates nor restricts the economy and is consistent with maximum employment and price stability, and our most recent policy rate increases are still working themselves through the economy.\n\nWith respect to our monetary policy goals of price stability and maximum employment, the economy is in a very good spot. Growth is slowing from an above-trend pace, and labor markets are strong. While the unemployment rate is lower than the level that is sustainable in the longer run, inflation is near 2 percent and does not show signs of appreciably rising. In my view, monetary policy does not appear to be far behind or far ahead of the curve. This environment gives us the opportunity to continue to gather information on the economy and assess our forecast and the risks, before making any further adjustments in the policy rate. If the economy performs along the lines that I've outlined as most likely, the fed funds rate may need to move a bit higher than current levels. But if some of the downside risks to the forecast manifest themselves, and the economy turns out to be weaker than expected and jeopardizes our dual mandate goals, I will need to adjust my outlook and policy views.\n\nIn addition to bringing interest rates up to more normal levels, since October 2017, the FOMC has also been letting the longer-term assets that we purchased to add accommodation during the financial crisis and Great Recession gradually roll off the Fed's balance sheet, and we have made considerable progress in bringing bank reserves down to more normal levels. As the FOMC announced in January, we plan to continue to use our current operating framework for implementing monetary policy.\n\nOur current operating framework, sometimes called a floor system or an abundant reserves system, differs from the framework we used prior to the financial crisis and Great Recession. In July 2007, the Fed was holding less than $900 billion on the asset side of its balance sheet. On the liability side, banks were holding about $10 billion in reserve accounts at the Fed. With reserves this scarce, the FOMC could make small changes in the supply of reserves by buying or selling short-term Treasuries. This, coupled with estimates of the demand for reserves, allowed the FOMC to ensure that the market-clearing interest rate at which banks lend reserves to each other overnight, the fed funds rate, was maintained at the FOMC's target.\n\nBut during the financial crisis and Great Recession, once our policy rate was brought down to essentially zero, to add further monetary accommodation, the FOMC began purchasing longer-term assets in order to put downward pressure on long-term interest rates.8 As a result of these purchases, the assets on the Fed's balance sheet swelled, to over $4.5 trillion at the peak in January 2015, a five-fold increase. Reserves and currency are the main liabilities on the Fed's balance sheet. As assets rose, so did reserves, peaking at $2.8 trillion in October 2014, with most of this in excess of that required to meet regulatory reserve requirements.\n\nAt such ample reserve levels, small changes in the supply of reserves have little effect on the fed funds rate, and the FOMC began implementing monetary policy in a new way. In particular, in October 2008 Congress gave the Fed the authority to pay interest on the reserve balances that banks and other depository institutions hold at the Fed. So the FOMC began bringing the fed funds rate into its target range using the rate the Fed pays on excess reserves and using overnight reverse repurchase agreements, which help put a floor on the fed funds rate. Raising the interest rate on excess reserves puts upward pressure on the fed funds rate because banks are unlikely to accept a rate in the market lower than the one they can get by depositing their funds at the Fed. Overnight reverse repos, or ON RRPs, involve the Fed selling securities from its large portfolio of assets with an agreement to buy them back the next day at a pre-determined price from eligible counterparties, including banks, primary dealers, money market funds, and government-sponsored enterprises. By offering a safe overnight asset to a broader array of money market participants, some of whom are not eligible to receive interest on reserves, overnight reverse repos help put a firmer floor on the fed funds rate because these counterparties should be reluctant to lend their liquidity in the market at rates lower than what they could get at the Fed.\n\nThis abundant reserves, or floor, system does not require the FOMC to actively manage the supply of reserves, so it is easier to implement, and it has given the FOMC effective control of interest rates. The FOMC plans to continue to use this system to implement policy. The Fed's balance sheet will be larger than it was before the financial crisis. This is so not only because of this implementation framework, but also because the public's demand for currency is rising over time and because banks' demand for reserves has increased because of their own risk-management needs and in response to regulatory changes put in place since the crisis. Even so, the balance sheet will be considerably smaller than it was at its post-crisis peak, and we have made considerable progress in normalizing it. Assets held by the Fed are now about $4 trillion, down about $0.5 trillion, or over 10 percent, since their peak, and reserves are now about $1.6 trillion, down about $1.2 trillion, or over 40 percent, since their peak.\n\nAt coming meetings, we will be finalizing our plans for ending the balance-sheet runoff and completing balance-sheet normalization. As we have done throughout the process of normalization, we will make these plans and the rationale for them known to the public in a timely way because transparency and accountability are basic tenets of appropriate monetary policymaking."

This fall marks a milestone for Xavier University: the 50th anniversary of the opening of the undergraduate day program to women. My understanding is that the university has many activities planned to recognize the significant contributions women have made to Xavier and to the world at large. So this is an exciting time for me to be at Xavier University.\n\nIn addition to being the home of Xavier, Cincinnati is also home to one of the branches of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. Our other branch is in Pittsburgh, and our District includes the state of Ohio and parts of Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and West Virginia. Many of you probably know that the Federal Reserve System comprises 12 regional Reserve Banks, distributed across the country, and the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C. But we also have 24 branch offices. This regional structure helps us to collect information from around the country so that our monetary policy decisions can take into account the diversity of the American economy and its people. I am very grateful for the many contacts throughout the Cleveland Fed's District who generously share with us their insights into business activity, labor markets, and financial conditions. This timely information, collected through our surveys and in meetings of our advisory councils and boards of directors, is very helpful to me as I formulate my economic outlook and monetary policy views, which I'll speak about tonight. My remarks will reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee, the monetary policymaking body within the Fed.\n\nThe National Economic Outlook\n\nCongress has given the Fed its monetary policy goals of price stability and maximum employment. From the standpoint of those goals, the U.S. economy is doing very well. The economy has been growing at an above-trend pace for the past couple of years, with estimates suggesting that growth was a strong 3 percent last year. Labor market conditions continue to be very strong, with above-trend job growth and very low unemployment. And after several years of being below-target, inflation has moved up and has been relatively stable around the FOMC's 2 percent objective.\n\nMy expectation is that the economy will maintain its good performance in 2019. In my view, the most likely case is that we will see somewhat slower growth than we did last year, reflecting less of a boost from fiscal stimulus and less accommodative financial conditions. I expect growth to be at or slightly above trend, in the 2 to 2-1/2 percent range. Employment growth will also slow a bit, but it will remain strong enough to absorb those entering the workforce, and I expect the unemployment rate to remain at or below 4 percent. As this transition toward a sustainable pace occurs, I expect inflation to remain near 2 percent, with the usual transitory ups and downs.\n\nIf this outlook comes to pass, we will chalk up 2019 as another very good year for the economy.

Looking forward, the tax changes contain several provisions that affect homeownership, including the limits on deductions for mortgage interest and for state and local taxes, which includes property taxes. On the other hand, strong labor markets mean more people are now in the position to make the commitment to purchase a home. On balance, I don't expect housing to contribute much to economic growth this year, but I don't expect to see a sharp pullback in the sector either.\n\nBusiness spending was quite strong in the first half of last year, supported by strong earnings growth and changes in tax policy that included lower corporate tax rates and full expensing of investment in equipment and intangibles. But business spending moderated in the second half of the year, as financial conditions tightened and uncertainty over tariffs, trade policy, and growth abroad began to weigh on manufacturers and other firms dependent on exports.\n\nSometimes I am asked why the Fed takes into account how other economies are doing when our monetary policy goals pertain to the U.S. economy. The answer is because how economies in the rest of the world fare can spill over to the U.S. through trade and financial markets. Growth abroad, including China and Europe, is expected to slow this year, but there is some uncertainty around how much of a slowdown there will be. The path and outcome of Brexit add further uncertainty, as does the outcome of trade and tariff negotiations. Indeed, some of the slowdown abroad is likely related to changes in and uncertainty over trade policy. So far, the majority of our business contacts continue to report that while their concerns about trade policy and global growth are rising, their investment plans remain intact. But some larger multinational firms have become more hesitant, and several manufacturing contacts have said that the tariffs have been disruptive to their supply chains, forcing them to find alternative suppliers or face increasing costs of production. Should the slowdown in the economies of our major trading partners, including China and Germany, be sharper than expected or should the continued uncertainty persuade more firms to take a wait-and-see attitude, U.S. growth may slow more than anticipated. Of course, a favorable resolution to some of the uncertainty could buoy sentiment and lead to a pickup in investment and stronger than expected growth in the U.S.\n\nOverall, in my view the most likely outcome is that the economic expansion will continue this year, with growth moving down to a more sustainable pace, at or slightly above trend, but the risks around the forecast, including slowing global growth, uncertainty over trade policy, tighter financial conditions, and the changes in business and consumer sentiment, bear watching.\n\nThe strong economic growth we have experienced over the past few years has been accompanied by strong labor market conditions. Last year, the economy added more than 2.6 million jobs; that's over 220,000 jobs per month. In January, payrolls rose by more than 300,000 jobs. This is much stronger than trend job growth, which most estimates put in the range of 75,000 to 120,000 per month. The unemployment rate has been at or below 4.0 percent for almost a year, which is near the historical lows seen over the past 50 years. It seems unlikely that this low level can be maintained over the longer run. Our business and labor contacts, across a variety of industries, have been reporting to us for quite some time that it is very difficult to find workers across all skill levels. Some firms have shifted from looking for new hires to doing all they can to retain their current workers, including offering more flexible work schedules and raising wages. These anecdotal reports have shown through to the national statistics. Aggregate measures of compensation are now in the 3 percent range, after being quite subdued earlier in the expansion. This is a welcome increase. It gives workers more purchasing power, but because the pickup has been in line with productivity growth and inflation, it has not added to inflationary pressures.\n\nThe FOMC has set a symmetric goal of 2 percent inflation, as measured by the year-over-year change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, that is, PCE inflation. Our goal is symmetric, meaning that we don't want to see inflation run either persistently above or persistently below this goal. When assessing where the economy is relative to our goal, monetary policymakers look through short-term variations in the inflation measures and focus on the underlying medium- to long-term trends in inflation.\n\nAfter running below 2 percent for much of the expansion, inflation rates have firmed over the last several years. Last year, higher energy prices boosted headline PCE inflation above 2 percent, and the recent decline in energy prices will likely mean that inflation will move below 2 percent in the first part of the year. But the core inflation measures, which exclude food and energy prices, show that underlying trend inflation is essentially at the Fed's goal of 2 percent. The key to this good performance is that expectations about inflation over the medium to longer term have been stable. This has kept inflation pressures at bay despite the tightness in labor markets, the strength of the economy, and reports from business contacts that they have more pricing power now than they have had in many years. Going forward, with appropriate adjustments in monetary policy that maintain stable inflation expectations, my outlook is that inflation will remain near our symmetric 2 percent goal.\n\nBefore turning to monetary policy, let me say something about the regional economy.\n\nThe Regional Economy\n\nThe Cincinnati metropolitan area continues to experience some of the best economic performance in the Cleveland Fed District, and this performance has been aided by solid longer-term fundamentals. For example, from 1996 to 2008, in the Cincinnati metro area, population and jobs each grew by about 11 percent. This was about two-thirds of the growth rate of population and about three-quarters of the growth rate of jobs for the U.S. as a whole.1 But Cincinnati's performance compares very favorably to that of the Cleveland metro area, which lost about 3 percent of its population and more than 3 percent of its jobs over the same time period, and with the state of Ohio, which gained 3 percent in population, but showed no job gains, on net. This better job growth meant that per capita income growth, adjusted for inflation, was stronger in Cincinnati than in either Cleveland or Ohio.\n\nSince the expansion began in June 2009, the relative economic performance of Cincinnati has remained solid. While Cincinnati's population growth has not been as strong as the nation's, its job growth and real personal income growth have been. On net, payroll jobs are 13 percent higher than they were when the expansion started, and the metro area's unemployment rate, which peaked at 10.5 in the aftermath of the recession, has fallen to 4.2 percent, just slightly higher than the nation's. This is strong labor market performance.\n\nResearch shows that regions that are resilient, that is, regions that have been able to avoid persistent declines in population over the long run, tend to have a more diverse industry mix and a more educated population.2 Cincinnati scores well on both counts. Cincinnati has become less reliant on manufacturing jobs than it was in the past. In the 1990s, manufacturing represented 16 percent of Cincinnati's jobs; that share has now fallen to about 11 percent.3 The region has been adding jobs in finance and banking, as well as healthcare. Hospitals are expanding, and there have been substantial venture capital investments in health information technology and pharmaceuticals.\n\nEducation is the key to helping ensure that a region's population acquires the necessary skills for the jobs available now and in the future.4 In terms of education, the Cincinnati metro area compares quite favorably with the nation, with higher percentages of high school graduates and of those with a bachelor's degree or further education.5 In addition, it is home to Xavier and other strong colleges and universities. Not all jobs will require a college degree. Cleveland Fed research indicates that compared to many parts of the country, Cincinnati has a higher share of so-called \"opportunity occupations.\" These are jobs that pay above-median wages but don't require a bachelor's degree.6 These types of jobs still require training, but it often takes less time and money to transition into them. In addition to a skilled workforce, effective leadership and collaboration among businesses, government, nonprofits, and individuals have helped areas navigate economic transitions driven by technological change and globalization.7 Workforce development will have to remain an important focus of civic and business leaders in the region to ensure that Cincinnati will be able to extend its solid economic performance into the future.\n\nNow that I have given you a sense of my outlook for the economy, let me conclude with some remarks on monetary policy.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nSince December 2015, when the expansion was well underway, the FOMC has been gradually moving the policy rate up from the extraordinarily low level that was needed to address the Great Recession. At its January meeting, the FOMC decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate, our policy rate, at 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent, and we have adopted a wait-and-see approach regarding future rate adjustments. I fully supported this decision because I believe that policy, for the time being, is well-calibrated to the economic outlook and the risks around that outlook.\n\nOur policy rate is now at the lower end of the range of FOMC participants' estimates of its longer-run neutral rate, a level that neither stimulates nor restricts the economy and is consistent with maximum employment and price stability, and our most recent policy rate increases are still working themselves through the economy.\n\nWith respect to our monetary policy goals of price stability and maximum employment, the economy is in a very good spot. Growth is slowing from an above-trend pace, and labor markets are strong. While the unemployment rate is lower than the level that is sustainable in the longer run, inflation is near 2 percent and does not show signs of appreciably rising. In my view, monetary policy does not appear to be far behind or far ahead of the curve. This environment gives us the opportunity to continue to gather information on the economy and assess our forecast and the risks, before making any further adjustments in the policy rate. If the economy performs along the lines that I've outlined as most likely, the fed funds rate may need to move a bit higher than current levels. But if some of the downside risks to the forecast manifest themselves, and the economy turns out to be weaker than expected and jeopardizes our dual mandate goals, I will need to adjust my outlook and policy views.\n\nIn addition to bringing interest rates up to more normal levels, since October 2017, the FOMC has also been letting the longer-term assets that we purchased to add accommodation during the financial crisis and Great Recession gradually roll off the Fed's balance sheet, and we have made considerable progress in bringing bank reserves down to more normal levels. As the FOMC announced in January, we plan to continue to use our current operating framework for implementing monetary policy.\n\nOur current operating framework, sometimes called a floor system or an abundant reserves system, differs from the framework we used prior to the financial crisis and Great Recession. In July 2007, the Fed was holding less than $900 billion on the asset side of its balance sheet. On the liability side, banks were holding about $10 billion in reserve accounts at the Fed. With reserves this scarce, the FOMC could make small changes in the supply of reserves by buying or selling short-term Treasuries. This, coupled with estimates of the demand for reserves, allowed the FOMC to ensure that the market-clearing interest rate at which banks lend reserves to each other overnight, the fed funds rate, was maintained at the FOMC's target.\n\nBut during the financial crisis and Great Recession, once our policy rate was brought down to essentially zero, to add further monetary accommodation, the FOMC began purchasing longer-term assets in order to put downward pressure on long-term interest rates.8 As a result of these purchases, the assets on the Fed's balance sheet swelled, to over $4.5 trillion at the peak in January 2015, a five-fold increase. Reserves and currency are the main liabilities on the Fed's balance sheet. As assets rose, so did reserves, peaking at $2.8 trillion in October 2014, with most of this in excess of that required to meet regulatory reserve requirements.\n\nAt such ample reserve levels, small changes in the supply of reserves have little effect on the fed funds rate, and the FOMC began implementing monetary policy in a new way. In particular, in October 2008 Congress gave the Fed the authority to pay interest on the reserve balances that banks and other depository institutions hold at the Fed. So the FOMC began bringing the fed funds rate into its target range using the rate the Fed pays on excess reserves and using overnight reverse repurchase agreements, which help put a floor on the fed funds rate. Raising the interest rate on excess reserves puts upward pressure on the fed funds rate because banks are unlikely to accept a rate in the market lower than the one they can get by depositing their funds at the Fed. Overnight reverse repos, or ON RRPs, involve the Fed selling securities from its large portfolio of assets with an agreement to buy them back the next day at a pre-determined price from eligible counterparties, including banks, primary dealers, money market funds, and government-sponsored enterprises. By offering a safe overnight asset to a broader array of money market participants, some of whom are not eligible to receive interest on reserves, overnight reverse repos help put a firmer floor on the fed funds rate because these counterparties should be reluctant to lend their liquidity in the market at rates lower than what they could get at the Fed.\n\nThis abundant reserves, or floor, system does not require the FOMC to actively manage the supply of reserves, so it is easier to implement, and it has given the FOMC effective control of interest rates. The FOMC plans to continue to use this system to implement policy. The Fed's balance sheet will be larger than it was before the financial crisis. This is so not only because of this implementation framework, but also because the public's demand for currency is rising over time and because banks' demand for reserves has increased because of their own risk-management needs and in response to regulatory changes put in place since the crisis. Even so, the balance sheet will be considerably smaller than it was at its post-crisis peak, and we have made considerable progress in normalizing it. Assets held by the Fed are now about $4 trillion, down about $0.5 trillion, or over 10 percent, since their peak, and reserves are now about $1.6 trillion, down about $1.2 trillion, or over 40 percent, since their peak.\n\nAt coming meetings, we will be finalizing our plans for ending the balance-sheet runoff and completing balance-sheet normalization. As we have done throughout the process of normalization, we will make these plans and the rationale for them known to the public in a timely way because transparency and accountability are basic tenets of appropriate monetary policymaking."

            "content": "I thank Barbara Snyder and The 50 Club for inviting me to speak tonight about the economy and monetary policy. I am especially looking forward to the question and answer portion of the program because as we navigate through the year, we will need to be particularly attuned to what is happening on the ground. The Federal Reserve System is actually well structured to do that. The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, right up the street, is one of 12 regional Reserve Banks distributed across the country that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., comprise the Federal Reserve System.\n\nCongress designed the Fed more than 100 years ago as a decentralized central bank, independent within the government but not independent from the government. The Fed was designed to balance public-sector and private-sector interests, and Wall Street and Main Street concerns. This design has served the country well by allowing monetary policy decisions to take into account the diversity of the American economy and its people. The regional structure also allows us to carry out our other responsibilities, including supervising and regulating banks, offering financial services to the U.S. government, overseeing the payments system, and identifying policies that can help promote economic progress and access to credit in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.\n\nThe Cleveland Fed is proud to be part of the civic landscape in Cleveland and the rest of our District, which includes the state of Ohio and parts of Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and West Virginia. Many of you provide us with your insights into business activity, labor markets, and financial conditions, collected through our surveys and advisory councils, and I thank you for that public service. This timely information is very helpful to me as I formulate my economic outlook and monetary policy views, which I'll speak about tonight. My remarks will reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee, the monetary policymaking body within the Fed.\n\nThe National Economic Outlook\n\nRather than \"bury the lede,\" let me start with last week's FOMC decision. The FOMC decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate, our policy rate, at 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent, and we have adopted a wait-and-see approach regarding future rate adjustments. I fully supported this decision because I believe that policy, for the time being, is well-calibrated to the economic outlook and the risks around that outlook.\n\nCongress has given the Fed its monetary policy goals of price stability and maximum employment, and from the standpoint of those goals, the U.S. economy has been doing very well. We have enjoyed above-trend output growth for the past couple of years, with estimates suggesting that growth was around 3 percent last year. After several years of being below-target, inflation has moved up and has been relatively stable around the FOMC's 2 percent objective, and labor markets are very strong, with above-trend job growth and very low unemployment.\n\nThe question is whether the economy can maintain its good performance in 2019. My expectation is that it will. In my view, the most likely case is that we will see somewhat slower growth than we did last year, in the 2 to 2-1/2 percent range, reflecting less of a boost from fiscal stimulus and less accommodative financial conditions. But this pace is still at or slightly above trend. Employment growth will also slow a bit, but it will remain strong enough to absorb those entering the workforce, and I expect the unemployment rate to remain at or below 4 percent. As this transition toward a sustainable pace occurs, I expect inflation to remain near 2 percent, with the usual transitory ups and downs.\n\nIf this outlook comes to pass, we will chalk up 2019 as another very good year for the economy. But the path to sustainability is rarely smooth, and uncertainty is clouding the outlook. The partial shutdown of the federal government is a case in point. It caused significant hardships for the workers who weren't getting paid and for businesses that rely on the parts of the government that weren't operating. In terms of the overall economy, we will see somewhat slower growth in the first quarter than we otherwise would, but I expect that to be made up in the second quarter, as long as we avoid another shutdown. The shutdown came at a time when people were already feeling a bit uneasy. In the fourth quarter of last year, investor sentiment shifted and investors began putting significant weight on downside risks to the forecast. As a result, there was a sharp increase in volatility, a decline in equity prices, and an increase in the credit spread of corporate bond yields relative to Treasury yields. It reminded me of Bette Davis's line in All About Eve: \"Fasten your seatbelts; it's going to be a bumpy night.\"\n\nSince the start of the year, conditions in financial markets have eased, although they remain tighter than they were last fall. The shift in sentiment is a good reminder that the economy is dynamic and can take unexpected turns. While we all have to look forward and make our best assessment of how the economy is doing, we also have to be ready to change those views should the incoming information warrant it.\n\nAlthough surveys of households and businesses indicate they are less confident about the economy than they were, much of the incoming data are consistent with slower but still solid growth. Household incomes have been rising, reflecting the strength of the job market and lower taxes. In the aggregate, households have been able to increase savings and their debt levels are manageable, making for sound balance sheets. These factors have been supporting solid consumer spending. Lower equity prices and higher volatility no doubt add an air of caution, but many households benefit from lower oil and gasoline prices. Consumer spending is over two-thirds of output, so we will need to keep a close eye on whether household sentiment weakens so much that people postpone spending or whether they remain cautiously optimistic and continue to spend.\n\nThe housing market has slowed over the past year. The 30-year mortgage rate moved up nearly 1 percentage point from late 2017 to late 2018, and house price appreciation continues to exceed income growth, making affordability an issue for many households. Looking forward, the tax changes contain several provisions that affect homeownership. There is a limit on the deduction for state and local taxes, which includes property taxes, and a limit on the deduction for mortgage interest, both of which will affect those taxpayers who continue to itemize deductions. On the other hand, strong labor markets mean more people are now in the position to make the commitment to purchase a home. On balance, I don't expect housing to contribute much to economic growth this year, but I don't expect to see a sharp pullback in the sector either.\n\nBusiness spending was quite strong in the first half of last year, supported by strong earnings growth and changes in tax policy that included lower corporate tax rates and full expensing of investment in equipment and intangibles. But business spending moderated in the second half of the year, as financial conditions tightened and uncertainty over tariffs, trade policy, and growth abroad began to weigh on manufacturers and other firms dependent on exports. Lower energy prices benefit consumers, but they tend to dampen mining and drilling investment. I don't expect the drag on investment in this sector to be nearly as large as in 2015-2016, unless energy prices fall considerably more.\n\nWhile the Fed's monetary policy goals pertain to the U.S. economy, how economies in the rest of the world fare can spill over to the U.S. through trade and financial markets. Growth abroad, including China and Europe, is expected to slow this year, but there is some uncertainty around how much of a slowdown there will be. The path and outcome of Brexit add further uncertainty, as does the outcome of trade and tariff negotiations. Indeed, some of the slowdown abroad is likely related to changes in and uncertainty over trade policy. China is Ohio's third largest export destination, after Canada and Mexico, and Ohio's largest import source. The majority of our business contacts continue to report that while their concerns about trade policy and global growth are rising, their investment plans remain intact. But some larger multinational firms have become more hesitant, and several manufacturing contacts have said that the tariffs have been disruptive to their supply chains, forcing them to find alternative suppliers or face increasing costs of production. You can think of the tariffs as a tax on inputs to U.S. production; they reduce profitability or are passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices. To the extent that the tariffs disrupt the most efficient use of resources, they are a headwind to longer-term productivity growth, which has already been low during the expansion. Should the slowdown in the economies of our major trading partners, including China and Germany, be sharper than expected or should the continued uncertainty persuade more firms to take a wait-and-see attitude, U.S. growth may slow more than anticipated. Of course, a favorable resolution to some of the uncertainty could buoy sentiment and foster a pickup in investment, leading to stronger than expected growth in the U.S.\n\nOverall, in my view the most likely outcome is that the economic expansion will continue this year, with growth moving down to a more sustainable pace, at or slightly above trend. But the move may not be a smooth one and there is uncertainty around the forecast. Slowing global growth, uncertainty over trade policy, tighter financial conditions, and the downturn in sentiment pose risks to this forecast and bear watching.\n\nStrong economic growth like we have seen over the past few years is usually accompanied by strong labor market conditions, and 2018 was no exception. Last year, the economy added more than 2.6 million jobs, over 220,000 jobs per month, and more than 300,000 jobs were added in January. This is much stronger than the estimates of trend job growth, which range from 75,000 to 120,000 per month. The unemployment rate has been at or below 4.0 percent for almost a year, near the historical lows seen over the past 50 years. It seems unlikely that this low level can be maintained over the longer run. Business and labor contacts throughout the Cleveland Federal Reserve District, across a variety of industries, have been reporting to us for quite some time that it is very difficult to find workers across all skill levels. Some firms have shifted from looking for new hires to doing all they can to retain their current workers, including offering more flexible work schedules and raising wages. These anecdotal reports have shown through to the national statistics. Aggregate measures of compensation are now in the 3 percent range, after being quite subdued earlier in the expansion. This is a welcome increase. It gives workers more purchasing power, but because the pickup has been in line with productivity growth and inflation, it has not added to inflationary pressures.\n\nThe FOMC has set a symmetric goal of 2 percent inflation, as measured by the year-over-year change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, that is, PCE inflation. Our goal is symmetric, meaning that we don't want to see inflation run either persistently above or persistently below this goal. There is always some short-term variation in the inflation measures, but monetary policymakers focus on the underlying medium- to long-term trends in inflation.\n\nAfter running below 2 percent for much of the expansion, inflation rates have firmed over the last several years. Last year, higher energy prices boosted headline PCE inflation above 2 percent, and the recent decline in energy prices will likely mean that inflation will move below 2 percent in the first part of the year. But the core inflation measures, which exclude food and energy prices, show that underlying trend inflation is essentially at the Fed's goal of 2 percent. The key to this good performance is that expectations about inflation over the medium to longer term have been stable. This has kept inflation pressures at bay despite the tightness in labor markets, the strength of the economy, and reports from business contacts that they have more pricing power now than they have had in many years. Going forward, with appropriate adjustments in monetary policy that maintain stable inflation expectations, my outlook is that inflation will remain near our symmetric 2 percent goal.\n\nBefore turning to monetary policy, let me say something about the regional economy.\n\nThe Regional Economy\n\nHow the Cleveland region has fared over the economic expansion reflects not only trends in the national economy but also the region's own transformation over the past couple of decades. From 1996 to 2008, the metro area lost about 3 percent of its population and more than 3 percent of its jobs. In contrast, Ohio's population grew by 3 percent, and while the state didn't add jobs, on net, it didn't lose them either. The U.S., overall, did much better than either Cleveland or Ohio: population grew by 16 percent, and jobs grew by 14 percent, or a compounded rate of 1 percent per year. This better job growth meant that per capita income growth, adjusted for inflation, was stronger for the nation than for either Cleveland or Ohio.\n\nBut recent trends have been more positive. Over the past five years, the regional economy has grown slowly but steadily, the population decline has slowed considerably, the metro area has been adding jobs, and real per capita income growth has been similar to that of the U.S. Demographics suggest that the region's trend job growth will remain below that of the nation and our unemployment rate will be higher. But the metro area has benefited by becoming more diversified. In the 1990s, manufacturing represented almost 20 percent of Cleveland's and Ohio's jobs; that share has fallen to about 12 percent. Manufacturing is still a relatively more important sector here than in other parts of the country, so the region has been particularly affected by the downward trend in manufacturing employment.1 But the region now has specializations in healthcare, insurance, and business management, which should make it more resilient.\n\nOf course, this shift in sectoral mix presents a challenge: As the regional economy becomes less reliant on lower-skilled manufacturing, and more reliant on higher-skilled manufacturing and service-sector jobs, how can it ensure that its population acquires the necessary skills for jobs available now and in the future?\n\nInvestments in education and training will be key.2 Cleveland is off to a good start. The metro area compares favorably with the nation, with a slightly higher percentage of high school graduates and a similar share of those with a bachelor's degree or higher,3 and we are home to strong universities. Not all jobs will require a college degree. Cleveland Fed research indicates that compared to many parts of the country, Cleveland has a higher share of so-called \"opportunity occupations.\" These are jobs that pay above-median wages but don't require a bachelor's degree.4 These types of jobs still require training, but it often takes less time and money to transition into them. The area has a number of innovative training programs, including those offered at Cuyahoga Community College's Manufacturing Technology Center, which I had the pleasure of touring.\n\nIn addition to a skilled workforce, effective leadership and collaboration among businesses, government, nonprofits, and individuals have helped areas navigate economic transitions driven by technological change and globalization.5 So our region will benefit from the work of many of the people in this room, who are already dedicated to addressing workforce development issues so that Cleveland remains economically competitive in the future.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nLet me conclude with a few more remarks on where monetary policy goes from here. Since December 2015, when the expansion was well underway, the FOMC has been gradually moving the policy rate up from the extraordinarily low level that was needed to address the Great Recession. Our policy rate is now at the lower end of the range of FOMC participants' estimates of its longer-run neutral rate, a level that neither stimulates nor restricts the economy and is consistent with maximum employment and price stability, and our most recent policy rate increases are still working themselves through the economy. In addition, we have also been letting the longer-term assets that we purchased to add accommodation during the recession gradually roll off the Fed's balance sheet, and we have made considerable progress in bringing bank reserves down to more normal levels. As the FOMC announced last week, we plan to continue to use our current operating framework for implementing monetary policy, and at coming meetings, we will be finalizing our plans for ending the balance-sheet runoff and completing balance-sheet normalization.\n\nWith respect to our monetary policy goals of price stability and maximum employment, the economy is in a very good spot. Growth is slowing from an above-trend pace, and labor markets are strong. While the unemployment rate is lower than the level that is sustainable in the longer run, inflation is near 2 percent and does not show signs of appreciably rising. In my view, monetary policy does not appear to be far behind or far ahead of the curve. This environment gives us the opportunity to continue to gather information on the economy and assess our forecast and the risks, before making any further adjustments in the policy rate. If the economy performs along the lines that I've outlined as most likely, the fed funds rate may need to move a bit higher than current levels. But if some of the downside risks to the forecast manifest themselves, and the economy turns out to be weaker than expected and jeopardizes our dual mandate goals, I will need to adjust my outlook and policy views. While I cannot predict what the future will bring, there is one thing I can say with certainty: My colleagues and I on the FOMC will strive to bring the best analysis and judgment to our monetary policy decisions, doing our part to support a healthy economy on behalf of the public."

Based on every event I have attended at the Boston Fed over many years, I know that I will come away with new insights and I look forward to our conversation.\n\nFed governance is arcane and I’m not planning to talk about it today except to say that I chair the committee across the Reserve Banks that focuses on the Fed’s community development work. I have been asked to present some opening remarks on these efforts, why they are important to our mission of fostering a healthy economy, and what the Fed is doing to encourage more inclusive growth. My remarks will reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Fed in the Community\n\nThe origin of the Fed’s community development work lies with the passage of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) in 1977. The CRA was intended to help ensure equitable access to credit for all individuals and neighborhoods by reaffirming that insured depository institutions must serve the communities in which they are chartered to do business. To help these institutions comply with the CRA, the Fed built a function to provide technical training and other support.\n\nOver time, the Fed’s interest and activities in community development have grown: today, community development is one of the Fed’s core business functions. The financial health and access to economic opportunity of consumers and communities is a key component of the country’s overall economic health and resiliency. The Fed recognizes that in order to perform our various duties, we need to have a good understanding of all of the interrelated challenges facing lower-income communities as well as more affluent areas. This understanding helps ensure that we are taking a consistent approach to advancing the CRA and promoting access to credit, investment, and financial services across low- and moderate-income households, small businesses, and communities. Our relationships with community development organizations and philanthropies at the local level provide us with valuable sources of information about the economic health of people across various segments of the population and across the communities in our Districts, and this helps us gauge the effectiveness of our monetary policy. Our community development work also helps us gather information on developing trends in financial services and markets that could raise risks to bank safety and soundness or to financial stability more broadly.\n\nMany factors determine the economic vitality of households and neighborhoods, including access to credit, capital, and financial services; affordable housing; workforce development; job training and education; health and wellness services; and infrastructure, including transportation and broadband services. Over the next several years, our Community Development staffs across the Federal Reserve System will be focusing their efforts on advancing the economic resiliency and mobility of low- and moderate-income and underserved households and communities. What factors make certain individuals and communities better able to recover from economic setbacks, and how can those factors be promoted broadly? Why are some places and households mired in persistent poverty, and what can be done to turn around those bad outcomes? What factors allow people to move up the economic ladder regardless of where they live or their racial or gender makeup? What policies can ensure broad access to economic opportunity for all people and places?\n\nThese are hard questions. The Fed is committed not only to increasing knowledge about the economic challenges facing low- and moderate-income households and communities, but also to helping to identify effective policies and best practices to address these challenges. We aim to do that by gathering and disseminating data; conducting applied, action-focused research; and holding forums such as this one. We strive to conduct our data gathering and research with the utmost rigor and the highest standards of quality, looking objectively at all sides of an issue and potential solutions. Our engagement with committed stakeholders like you is critical to ensuring that our research hits the mark, that it contributes to the public discourse, and that it informs public policy and yields concrete and positive outcomes. The people in this room know very well that the issues facing lower-income households and communities in a dynamic economy such as ours are complex ones. Many of the solutions will be complex as well and will take committed and collaborative actions from all of us.\n\nThe Fed’s Community Development Work in Action\n\nI’d like to conclude my opening remarks by highlighting just a few examples of the Federal Reserve’s efforts in community development.\n\nOn the access-to-credit front, the Kansas City Fed’s Investment Connection program allows community and economic development organizations in the District to have project proposals pre-screened by Kansas City Fed staffers to determine whether the project is CRA-eligible. The organizations then get a chance to pitch their proposals to potential funders, including financial institutions and community foundations. Since 2011, Investment Connection has facilitated more than $30 million in loans, investments, grants, and services to community economic development organizations. And because the program has been such a success, other Federal Reserve Districts, including Minneapolis, St. Louis, New York, and Cleveland, have either started or are considering piloting programs of their own.\n\nAn example of the Fed’s data gathering, dissemination, and analysis, our annual Small Business Credit Survey, has become a trusted source of information on the conditions of firms with fewer than 500 employees. This survey and the associated analysis, which is a collaboration among all 12 Reserve Banks, are used by a wide range of stakeholders seeking to understand the financing needs of the small business sector, an important driver of the economy.\n\nIn terms of our collaborative efforts, workforce development is a key issue that affects economic vitality across all regions. So, considerable efforts are underway across the Federal Reserve System and with our community partners to find solutions to ensure that people have access to the education and skill-development programs needed to ensure that they can be productive members of the modern workforce. The Federal Reserve System is engaged with the Heldrich Center at Rutgers University, the Ray Marshall Center at the University of Texas at Austin, and the Upjohn Institute in an effort called Investing in America’s Workforce. This initiative seeks to align the skills of the workforce with employers’ needs by reframing the discussion of workforce development efforts as investments rather than costly social services. Earlier this month, the initiative released a three-volume set presenting workforce development programs and policies that are considered to be best-practice in terms of delivering positive returns to society, employers, workers, and job seekers. The volumes were a culmination of many listening sessions and engagement with a vast number of practitioners and academics from across the country.\n\nIn addition to these collaborative efforts across the Federal Reserve System, each Reserve Bank also does work on the issues and needs of low- and moderate-income households and communities that are especially relevant to their individual Districts. An excellent example of this is the Boston Fed’s Working Cities Challenge, which began in 2013. Informed by the Boston Fed’s research and designed in partnership with its network of community development stakeholders, the Working Cities Challenge is a grant competition aimed at strengthening civic collaboration and partnerships to help low-income areas and households in the Northeast in an enduring way.\n\nAnother example is the Cleveland Fed’s work on the opioid crisis, an issue that disproportionately affects the people in our District and their ability to productively engage in the economy. Cleveland Fed research has documented the effects of opioids on different segments of the population, in terms of race and gender, and across geographic areas. In addition to research, the Cleveland staff has engaged our community contacts and advisory councils to provide insights into this public-health problem, which is having significant economic consequences in terms of workforce attachment.\n\nAs I said, this is just a taste of the type of work being undertaken by the Federal Reserve to better understand and help to provide workable solutions to these complex community development challenges. These problems are not going to solve themselves. Determining viable solutions will take collaboration among all stakeholders, as underscored by the title of today’s program, Collaboration for Inclusive Economic Development. As I am certain you are too, I am looking forward to today’s panel sessions featuring leaders from philanthropic foundations and some of my Fed colleagues. They will discuss the barriers to inclusive economic progress, what responses are being brought to bear, and where the Federal Reserve System, philanthropies, and others can collaborate to foster further innovative approaches and solutions. Thank you all for being here today to participate in this important dialog."

            "content": "I thank the Money Marketeers of New York University for inviting me back to speak tonight. When I was here four years ago, I discussed the important role that Federal Reserve communications play in making effective monetary policy and the need for these communications to evolve as we moved from a period of extraordinary monetary policymaking to more normal policymaking. At this point, that transition to more normal policymaking has been underway for some time, reflecting the health of the U.S. economy and the progress that's been made on the FOMC's monetary policy goals. Tonight, I'll talk about the economic outlook and monetary policy, FOMC communications, and upcoming considerations that will help determine what normal policymaking will look like in the future. My remarks will reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nEconomic Growth\n\nFrom the perspectives of the Fed's goals of maximum employment and price stability, the U.S. economy is doing very well. Growth has been running above trend for the past couple of years, inflation has moved up to the FOMC's 2 percent target, and labor markets are very strong. The unemployment rate is at its lowest level since the late 1960s and job growth is well above trend.\n\nLast year, economic growth picked up to 2-1/2 percent, and it has been running around 3 percent over the first three quarters of this year. Early this month, longer-term interest rates moved up, and over the past couple of weeks, volatility in equity markets has increased. While a deeper and more persistent drop in equity markets could dash confidence and lead to a significant pullback in risk-taking and spending, we are far from this scenario. The S&P 500 index remains higher than it was a year ago. Similar to the swings in the market we saw earlier this year, the movements of late do not seem to be signaling that investors are becoming overly pessimistic. While the market volatility poses a risk to the forecast and bears monitoring, it has not led me to change my modal medium-run outlook. I expect growth to come in a tad above 3 percent this year and to be in the 2-3/4 to 3 percent range next year, well above my 2 percent estimate of the economy's trend growth rate.\n\nBoth consumer and business spending are making solid contributions to growth and I expect that to continue. Household incomes have been rising, reflecting the strength of the job market. In the aggregate, households have been able to increase savings and their debt levels are manageable, making for sound balance sheets. The changes in tax policy that became effective earlier this year added a positive element to an already healthy outlook for consumer spending.\n\nBusiness activity and spending have also been healthy. Investment in equipment and intellectual property has strengthened this year and strong order flows suggest that strength will continue. The changes in tax policy, including lower corporate tax rates and full expensing for investment in equipment and intangibles, support further business spending. Increased federal government spending is also a positive for growth over the next couple of years. Despite the uncertainty around trade and tariff policies, business sentiment is high. Earlier, when the expansion was getting underway, businesses' main concern was weak demand; now it is the difficulty in finding workers to keep up with strong demand.\n\nThe housing market has slowed somewhat over the past year. Some softening is to be expected as interest rates have moved up; the 30-year fixed mortgage rate is about a percentage point higher than a year ago. In some areas, a lack of housing supply may also be negatively weighing on housing activity. In addition, the tax changes contain several provisions that affect homeownership, including the limit on the deduction for state and local taxes, which includes property taxes, and the limit on the mortgage interest deduction, both of which will affect those taxpayers who continue to itemize deductions. I am not anticipating a strong pullback in housing over the next year, but I also do not expect it to be a strong engine of growth for the overall economy.\n\nGrowth abroad has improved in recent years, but forecasts have recently been revised down. The divergence between economic growth prospects abroad and in the U.S. puts upward pressure on the dollar and suggests that net exports — the difference between exports and imports — will likely be a small drag on U.S. growth over the next couple of years. However, this assessment is complicated by the uncertainty around trade and tariff policies. The recent U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement to replace NAFTA reduced some of this uncertainty, but rules under which the firms operate — for example, what constitutes off-shore content — still need to be worked out and the agreement needs Senate approval. The impact of trade developments between the U.S. and China will depend on the actions ultimately taken and on whether the uncertainty itself leads to a pullback in spending. The majority of business contacts from my District report that they have not changed their plans or revenue outlook in response to concerns about escalating trade tensions. However, some manufacturing contacts have reported that the tariffs have been quite disruptive to their supply chains, forcing them to find alternative suppliers or face increasing costs of production. These effects could last for some time because reorganizing supply chains cannot be done quickly. Thus, the tariffs will act as a tax on inputs to U.S. production and are a headwind to productivity growth, which has been low during the expansion.\n\nLabor Markets\n\nAbove-trend growth has led to continued strong job growth and declines in the unemployment rate. Payroll job gains have averaged over 200,000 jobs per month this year, up from about 180,000 per month last year, and are well above most estimates of trend, which lie in the range of 75,000 to 120,000. Another sign of a strong labor market is the stability of the labor force participation rate, which demographics suggest will be trending down over time. The unemployment rate has been at or below 4 percent for the past six months. It fell to 3.7 percent in September, which is lower than the levels reached during the past two expansions, and is well below my 4.5 percent estimate of the unemployment rate that is sustainable over the longer run. I expect that strong growth will support further tightening of the labor market, with the unemployment rate falling to slightly under 3-1/2 percent by the end of next year.\n\nAs I mentioned, firms continue to report that it is very difficult to find workers. These reports are coming from a variety of industries, across skill levels and geographic regions. Firms are responding to labor shortages by offering higher wages and more flexible work schedules. In fact, some of my contacts tell me they are offering incentive payments to workers based solely on their attendance. Other firms tell me they are automating faster, although they recognize that finding even the reduced number of workers needed for automated plants is going to be a problem in the short run. Some manufacturers have told me they would be investing more in plant and equipment if they thought they could find workers. So the tightness in labor markets may develop into a headwind on growth.\n\nThe official statistics on wages and compensation have been lagging the anecdotal reports, but recently, the readings have caught up. Various year-over-year measures of wage growth are nearing 3 percent, up from 2 percent early in the expansion. Some people ask: if labor markets are so tight, why aren't we seeing wage growth in the 3 to 4 percent range like we saw in the prior two expansions? This is a legitimate question.\n\nFirst, it has to be acknowledged that it is difficult to know with any precision how tight labor markets are; maybe they aren't as tight as we once thought. In fact, the behavior of labor force participation and the fact that wage growth has remained moderate even as labor markets have strengthened have led many policymakers to reassess the level of the unemployment rate they view as sustainable in the long run. Five years ago, the central tendency of projections of the longer-run unemployment rate among FOMC policymakers ranged from 5.2 to 5.8 percent.1 In projections this September, the central tendency was about a percentage point lower, at 4.3 to 4.6 percent, with a median projection of 4.5 percent. Over time, I have also moved down my own estimate of the longer-run unemployment rate to my current estimate of 4.5 percent.2\n\nBut even relative to these lower longer-run estimates, labor markets are tight, and based on a broad set of labor market indicators, my assessment is that we are beyond maximum employment, one part of the Fed's monetary policy mandate. So there is still some explaining to do regarding the relatively moderate wage growth we've seen so far. Much of the explanation lies with the low levels of inflation and productivity growth over this expansion.3 The recent increase in nominal wage growth reflects the recent firming in both factors, but I wouldn't expect to see a strong acceleration in wages unless we see a strong pickup in productivity growth. Such a scenario would be welcome, since wage growth reflecting higher productivity growth does not contribute to inflationary pressures in a competitive economy.\n\nInflation\n\nThe FOMC has set a symmetric goal of 2 percent inflation, as measured by the year-over-year change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, that is, PCE inflation. The goal is symmetric, meaning that the FOMC would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or persistently below this goal and such persistent deviations would warrant a policy response.4 But month-to-month variations in the inflation measures, due to idiosyncratic factors or in response to temporary economic and financial disturbances, are to be expected. Policymakers look through temporary undershoots or overshoots of our inflation goal and focus on where inflation is going on a sustained basis.\n\nAs the expansion has continued, inflation has gradually firmed, consistent with reports from business contacts that they now have a greater ability to raise their own prices in response to higher input costs and strong demand. PCE inflation and core PCE inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, have been running near 2 percent for several months. Inflation expectations have been stable, and this has helped anchor inflation despite the tightness in labor markets and the strength of the economy. In this environment, maintaining stable inflation expectations will be the key to maintaining inflation at target. With appropriate adjustments in monetary policy, my outlook is that inflation will remain near 2 percent, subject to the usual monthly variations in the measures.\n\nMonetary Policy and Communications\n\nAt its meeting in September, the FOMC raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, to 2 to 2-1/4 percent, and continued on its pre-announced plan for gradually reducing the amount of assets held on its balance sheet.\n\nAs the economy has improved, the FOMC has been engaged in a strategy to gradually reduce the extraordinary accommodation that was put in place to address the Great Recession. This approach is one that balances the upside and downside risks to achieving and maintaining our dual mandate goals so that the expansion is sustained. We want to avoid a buildup in risks to macroeconomic stability that could arise if the economy were allowed to overheat, but we also want to avoid choking off the expansion. In addition, gradually reducing accommodation helps mitigate the risks of financial imbalances that can arise in a low interest rate environment. Currently, I would characterize these risks as moderate. But growth in leveraged lending is strong, commercial real estate valuations are lofty, and I believe we are at a point in the business cycle where increased attention to financial stability risk is warranted because the economy continues to grow above trend and financial conditions remain accommodative, even taking into account the recent increase in long-term interest rates.\n\nAs the funds rate target gets closer to the range of estimates of the neutral rate — the level of interest rates consistent with stable prices and maximum employment in the long run — we are nearing the completion of the exit from the period of extraordinary monetary policymaking and moving close to a period of normal policymaking. Our communications are appropriately changing. You may have noticed that in September, we removed language indicating that the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative. This wasn't meant to signal any change in policy strategy or the likely path of policy. Indeed, we said that given the economic outlook we expect further gradual increases in the funds rate will likely be warranted. Instead, I view the change in language as an indication that we are getting back to a period of normal policymaking.\n\nIn the period of extraordinary monetary policymaking, when the policy rate was at its effective lower bound, the FOMC used forward guidance about the expected future path of interest rates as a policy tool. We conveyed that our future path was going to be very accommodative for a long time. But in normal times, there is no need to use guidance as a policy tool and there is less certainty around the future policy path. That path will depend on the evolution of economic conditions and their effect on the medium-run outlook and risks around the outlook. So instead of giving explicit guidance, normal policy communications should convey the rationale for policy decisions and the FOMC's reaction function, that is, how policy is likely to systematically respond to changes in economic conditions — whether those changes are anticipated or unanticipated.\n\nLet me underscore that just because the future policy path isn't known with certainty and will depend on economic developments doesn't mean that policymakers will be nonsystematic in their approach to policymaking. It just means that in normal times, it would be inappropriate to commit to a future path because the path taken will depend on how economic conditions evolve. Let me also note that in addition to contributing to transparency and accountability, being systematic and communicating so that the public understands normal policymaking will make the forward guidance we use in extraordinary times more effective. They will understand that keeping interest rates lower for longer is not business as usual, and this awareness can help put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates.\n\nMight the return to normal policymaking be an argument for the FOMC's dropping the so-called dot plot from the Summary of Economic Projections, as some have suggested we do? I think it would be a mistake to discontinue the dot plot. The dot plot provides information on the policy paths that individual FOMC participants view as appropriate to promoting the FOM's monetary policy goals. The dots can change over time because of economic developments, but that's a design feature, not a flaw. The FOMC also provides a chart illustrating the uncertainty band around the median policy path across participants.5 It clearly shows that the farther out in the projection horizon one goes, the wider the degree of uncertainty — this is a characteristic of normal policymaking. Omitting this information would not make the divergence in views across FOMC participants or the uncertainty around their projections disappear, but it would be a significant step back in transparency.\n\nLet me conclude by touching on two considerations that will help determine what normal policymaking looks like in the future. The first is the operating framework the Fed uses to ensure that its policy rate is being maintained at the appropriate level, and the second is the monetary policy strategic framework that the FOMC uses to determine what that appropriate level of the policy rate is.6\n\nMonetary Policy Frameworks: Operations and Strategy\n\nSince last October, the FOMC has been in the process of gradually and predictably reducing the holdings of Treasury and agency securities that were purchased to address the financial crisis and Great Recession.7 We plan to shrink the balance sheet until the Fed is holding no more securities than necessary to implement policy efficiently and effectively, and as noted in the minutes of the July FOMC meeting, the FOMC will likely soon be resuming a discussion of what that implementation framework will be.8\n\nOne option is to try to return to operating like we did before the financial crisis, when the FOMC kept the supply of bank reserves scarce. In June 2007, banks were holding about $10 billion in reserve accounts at the Fed. The FOMC could make small changes in that supply by buying or selling short-term Treasuries, and this allowed the FOMC to ensure that the fed funds rate was maintained at the FOMC's target. But now, as a result of the Fed's large-scale asset purchases, reserves are very abundant. While reserve levels are down from their peaks, banks are still holding about $1.8 trillion in reserve accounts at the Fed, and almost all of this is in excess of what is required by regulation. At these levels, small changes in the supply of reserves have little effect on the fed funds rate. Instead, the Fed brings the fed funds rate into its target range by adjusting the rate it pays on excess reserves, and by using overnight reverse repurchase agreements, which help put a floor on the fed funds rate. Reserves and currency are the main liabilities on the Fed's balance sheet, so the choice between these two frameworks will determine the volume of assets the Fed will hold on its balance sheet.\n\nBoth operating frameworks have proven to be effective during the periods in which they have been used. There are several things to consider in determining which implementation framework will be most effective going forward. The fed funds market has changed considerably since the financial crisis,9 and the regulatory changes put in place since the crisis have likely affected the banking system's demand for reserve balances. This may limit the feasibility of returning to a framework with scarce reserves, and it also raises the question of whether the fed funds rate will remain the best indicator of the general level of short-term interest rates, regardless of the operating framework. On the other hand, a relatively large balance sheet, which would accompany an abundant reserves framework, might be viewed with some skepticism or generate requests for the Fed to aid other industries or use the balance sheet to fund government initiatives, as occurred during and since the crisis.10, 11 I believe this type of risk can be effectively handled by clear and timely communication by the FOMC on the rationale for its decision about the implementation framework, as well as its other policy decisions in pursuit of our goals of maximum employment and price stability.\n\nWhich brings me to the other important issue that will determine what normal monetary policymaking is in the future, namely, the strategic framework used to determine appropriate monetary policy. Currently, we use a flexible inflation-targeting framework, which has served the FOMC well in effectively promoting our policy goals. But based on demographics, higher demand for safe assets, and other factors, many economists anticipate that the longer-term equilibrium real interest rate will remain lower than in past decades. This would mean there would be less room for monetary policymakers to cushion against a negative economic shock, the probability of the policy rate hitting the effective lower bound would be higher, and nontraditional monetary policy tools would need to be used more often. To the extent that these tools are less effective than the traditional interest rate tool or are constrained from being used, the potential would be for longer recessions and longer bouts of inflation well below target.12\n\nSo we need to ask whether there are alternative policy strategies that could lower the probability of getting into this situation, and at the July FOMC meeting, participants agreed to discuss this topic at future meetings.13 Researchers have suggested several alternative frameworks, such as targeting an inflation rate higher than 2 percent, moving to an inflation-targeting range instead of a point goal, or targeting a path for the price level or for nominal GDP rather than for inflation. None of these alternative frameworks are without challenges but all are worth thorough review. It might be useful to do something akin to simulated stress testing to see how each framework might fare when confronted with things like data revisions; uncertainty about the levels of the equilibrium interest rate, potential growth, and longer-run unemployment rate; and the challenges of effective policy communications. My colleague Eric Rosengren, president of the Boston Fed, recently put out a proposal for regular review of the Fed's strategic framework.14 I support this idea; it makes sense to me that, as a matter of good governance, a central bank should periodically review its assumptions, methods, and models. I also believe that to inform our evaluation of the framework, we should seek a wide range of perspectives, including those from experts in academia, the private sector, and other central banks. I am confident in predicting that there won't be a consensus among this wide-ranging group, but I am equally confident in predicting that we will ultimately get to a better decision — whether it be to stay with our current framework or adopt an alternative — if we listen to a diverse set of views on the subject."

            "content": "I thank President Jim Bullard and the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis for inviting me to present the opening keynote address at the 2018 Conference on Community Banking in the 21st Century. This is the sixth conference in this important series sponsored by the Fed, the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). As you look at the agenda, you'll see that it is quite distinct from other conferences in mixing together researchers, practitioners, regulators, and policymakers. I am a big proponent of the thesis that examining issues from diverse perspectives and discussing those perspectives yields better policy and regulatory decisions. So I am very much looking forward to the conversations we will have over the next two days about the future of community banking. Today, I will focus the bulk of my remarks on the efforts being undertaken to modernize the Community Reinvestment Act. The views I'll present are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nBanking is on a lot of people's minds these days. Last month marked the 10-year anniversary of the failure of Lehman Brothers, a watershed moment at the start of the global financial crisis. It's hard to have lived through the crisis and not been changed by it. Researchers had to rethink their well-established theories of how financial markets and institutions actually operate; they had to identify the deficiencies in their models and poor inferences from empirical analyses. Policymakers and regulators had to rethink the effectiveness of banking regulation and supervision in ensuring the stability of the financial system as a whole; their eyes were opened to the inter-connectedness and complexity of the global financial system and its regulations. Bankers had to take stock of how they monitored the risks they were taking and whether they had sufficient capital and liquidity to weather what could be unexpectedly deep shocks.\n\nMuch has changed over the past 10 years. Credit is generally available to financially healthy borrowers; the financial system is now holding higher levels of capital and liquidity; credit quality is higher; institutions and supervisors have improved their monitoring of risk within institutions; and policymakers are now working to identify emerging risks across the financial sector as a whole. Some of these improvements were mandated by regulation, but others were undertaken by bankers themselves, having seen the damage that can be caused by not fully understanding the risks being taken. I think it would be a mistake to turn back the clock and unwind many of the important steps taken since the financial crisis to improve financial system resiliency. At the same time, I support the efforts that are now underway to better align regulation and supervisory oversight with where the potential systemic risks lie, including proposals to make regulation less burdensome on community banks in the U.S. Better aligning our regulation and supervision with the risks imposed should allow for simplifications without sacrificing safety, soundness, and stability. As we strive to make our regulations and supervision more effective and efficient, we must not forget the important lesson that maintaining a resilient financial system is necessary for a healthy economy.\n\nCommunity Banks Are Trusted\n\nSaying that a healthy economy depends on a resilient financial system may seem like an obvious statement for those in this room. But during the financial crisis, many people lost faith that the U.S. banking system could deliver any benefits. The reputation of the financial industry and its regulators was decidedly tarnished, some say deservedly so. But remarkably, the public did not lose faith in their local banks. According to a survey published by the business schools at the University of Chicago and Northwestern University, the public has put and continues to put more trust in their local banks than in nationwide banks, the stock market, or mutual funds.1 I believe this is because the public understands that community banks are important to the economic vitality of households, small businesses, and neighborhoods.2 Before turning to the Community Reinvestment Act, let me say a few words about the benefits conveyed by community banks.\n\nCommunity Banks Play an Important Role in the Economy but Face Challenges\n\nBanks provide funding to creditworthy businesses and households. They offer customers methods for saving and making payments. They help people and firms manage their financial affairs. Community banks, in particular, play a crucial role in their local economies. In many small towns and rural areas, financial service providers are very limited except for community banks.3 By investing in households and neighborhoods, they help promote economic prosperity in local communities. Community banks have been and continue to be an important source of credit to small businesses, which play an important role in the U.S. economy. In fact, three-quarters of U.S. businesses have fewer than 10 employees, and while larger businesses employ the most people, over a quarter of U.S. private-sector jobs are at firms with fewer than 50 employees.4 Because small businesses tend to have less available hard quantitative information, like audited financial statements, on which to make credit decisions, they have more limited access to credit from large banks or capital markets. Community banks fill that void.\n\nResearch has documented that community banks have had some advantages over larger banks in extending loans to smaller firms for which public information is less available. Being local, community banks can forge relationships with their customers. These relationships help community banks assess the creditworthiness of smaller borrowers. According to the Federal Reserve Banks' Small Business Credit Survey, banks remain the most common source of financing for small businesses.5 Community banks account for about half of small-business bank lending in the U.S., and the Fed's survey indicates that small businesses are more satisfied with their credit experience at small banks than at large banks or online lenders.6 And because they tend to finance themselves with core deposits and are less reliant on volatile short-term funding sources, community banks are better able to continue to lend to their customers through times of adverse financial conditions.7 So small banks offer a service that allows borrowers to weather turbulent times.\n\nDespite the benefits provided by community banks, they are facing some challenges. First, the banking industry has been consolidating. Over the past two decades, the number of banking organizations has fallen from nearly 9,000 institutions to about 5,000, and the number of community banks, especially small community banks, has fallen as well.8 There are now about 1,200 banking organizations with assets of $100 million or less, down from about 4,000 two decades ago. At the same time, banks are getting larger. There are nearly 30 banking organizations with $100 billion or more in assets, compared with fewer than 20 two decades ago, and the share of total industry assets held by these large institutions has risen from 43 percent to nearly 70 percent.\n\nThe community bankers I speak with regularly report that they are facing higher costs of technology and increased regulatory compliance burdens. These reports accord with the data in the national survey conducted in association with this conference.9 In addition, large banks, fintech companies, and other nonbank providers of bank services have entered local markets. Developments suggest that the advantages community banks have had in offering relationship lending may be shrinking over time.10 Automated lending technologies, such as small-business credit scoring and data-modeling techniques, have allowed larger banks to increase their share of small-business lending, and in recent years, small businesses have increasingly been turning to larger banks for funding. New technologies, including online lending platforms, have also allowed nonbank alternative lenders to increase their share of small-business lending.11 The Federal Reserve Banks' survey indicates that the smaller small businesses (those with revenues of $1 million or less) frequently turn to online lenders or other nonbank sources for credit, even though they report less satisfaction with these lenders.\n\nSome of my own co-authored research has documented that cost considerations may be driving community banks to increase their size.12 First, the average cost per dollar of assets associated with regulatory compliance and technological change decreases with institutions' asset size; in other words, there are scale economies. Second, larger community banks, those with assets between $1 billion and $10 billion, appear to do a better job capitalizing on their investment opportunities than smaller community banks, and they achieve better financial performance as a result. Given their current portfolios, these larger community banks also appear to have financial incentives to expand further into small-business lending. So we might expect the trend of larger banks providing a larger portion of small-business lending to continue.\n\nFrom the borrowers' and savers' viewpoint, entry of new players, new technologies, and increased competition can be beneficial. But from community bankers' perspective, these factors present challenges and may spur banks to move into products and services with which they have less experience. They also presents challenges to regulators who typically have less insight into nonbank financial providers, making it more difficult to ensure that the institutions providing these services do so in a safe and sound manner.\n\nIn this challenging environment, the Federal Reserve has been working to ensure that our supervisory oversight aligns with potential risks and that we are bringing a cost-benefit perspective to the rules we use to implement regulations. Recently, attention has turned to the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) and ways we might make its implementation more effective and efficient given the technological and competitive changes affecting the banking environment.\n\nThe Community Reinvestment Act Has Had a Positive Effect on Lending in Underserved Areas\n\nIn 1977, Congress passed the Community Reinvestment Act to help address concerns about the deterioration in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods throughout the U.S. At the time, many people blamed urban decline on limited credit availability and illegal practices such as redlining. The CRA reaffirmed that insured depository institutions must serve the communities in which they are chartered to do business, helping to ensure equitable access to credit for all individuals and neighborhoods.13\n\nThe Federal Reserve and the other federal bank supervisors — the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) — are charged with implementing the act. Regulators periodically review how well a bank is serving the needs in its geographic service area, identified by the bank based on the location of its branches and ATMs and where a substantial portion of its loans are. The CRA requires regulators to make public the ratings and written evaluation of the banks' performance on the CRA.\n\nThe Fed is deeply committed to ensuring that the goal of the CRA is met: that banks serve their entire community and, in particular, the credit needs in low- and moderate-income areas. The Fed's community development function, which grew out of our responsibilities with respect to the CRA, has been helping to build relationships between financial institutions and community development professionals. One example is the Investment Connection program, developed by the Kansas City Fed, which links community and economic development organizations with CRA-eligible projects with banks seeking such investments.14 Work is currently underway to expand the program to other regions.\n\nThe word \"community\" is central to the CRA. A body of research has shown that economic opportunity is tied not only to individual circumstances but also to place. Upward mobility — the probability that a child will be better off economically than his or her parents — is dependent not only on the family's characteristics but also on neighborhood characteristics such as neighborhood income, racial integration, the quality of schools, and access to social services. Lack of access to credit has been found to have long-lasting negative effects on a neighborhood's economic health,15 and a body of evidence indicates that the CRA has provided some tangible benefits to low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, although the magnitude of the effects varies by study.16\n\nBecause of the CRA, investment in low- and moderate-income areas is a fundamental part of bank portfolios. Evidence suggests that, on the margin, bank lending in these areas is higher than it otherwise would be without the CRA, and that this lending does not appear to be crowding out lending from nonbank lenders, which are not subject to the CRA. There is evidence that CRA assessment areas tend to attract more investment than other comparable areas in a bank's market,17 although there is some variation across metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs). For example, one study found a positive effect on lending in large MSAs but not in smaller ones. In particular, the study found that the CRA promotes mortgage credit supply to low- and moderate-income borrowers and neighborhoods in large metropolitan areas, particularly at times when merger activity is strong. This suggests that banks pay attention to the CRA's incentives for compliance.18\n\nIndeed, one way the CRA has encouraged investment in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods is through the formation of so-called public or community benefit agreements.19 These have primarily been used by larger banks during a merger application process and involve the banks committing to a significant increase in lending over a period of years after a merger is completed. Such agreements can qualify for CRA credit, and in the view of some advocacy groups, these agreements can meaningfully increase bank branches and lending in the communities.\n\nAnother, less direct, way the CRA might increase lending is by creating a positive information externality for other lenders. For example, the study I mentioned which found an increase in mortgage lending also found that in markets with a low volume of home sales, higher levels of CRA lending by banks is associated with higher, not lower, lending by nonbanks, the opposite of crowding-out. It is possible that the higher volume of CRA lending allows other lenders to better judge the credit risk of neighborhoods in which the overall volume of home sales is low. Similarly, CRA lending may pay a future dividend to all lenders to the extent that CRA lending in low- and moderate-income communities allows people and businesses to develop their credit histories, which can then be used by all lenders to make more informed underwriting decisions on loans to these borrowers in the future.20\n\nFinally, one might ask whether the increased investment under the CRA is spurring banks to take on riskier loans, which, depending on the degree of risk, might not be a positive. One study did find higher approval rates on mortgage applications in the 1 1/2 year window around banks' CRA exams and elevated delinquency rates on these mortgages, but the estimated effects were moderate.22 Another study found that while the CRA causes a substantial increase in mortgage lending to low-income borrowers, it does not appear to increase the risk of default on those loans.21\n\nSo, in my view, the body of evidence suggests that the CRA has had a positive effect on credit availability in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, thereby supporting economic development in these areas.23 However, just as technological change, the entry of new types of lenders, industry consolidation, and new techniques for delivering credit and other financial services are all affecting banking, they are also affecting the regulations and how the regulators should go about assessing compliance with the CRA.\n\nThe CRA Will Be Modernized to Enhance Its Effectiveness\n\nTo ensure that regulations continue to promote the goals for which they were intended, the federal regulatory agencies undertake periodic reviews and offer guidance to bankers in how they assess compliance.24 While regulators have offered moderate updates and guidance on the CRA over time, the last time there were substantial revisions to the framework for assessing CRA compliance was in 1995, over 20 years ago.\n\nEarlier this year, the U.S. Department of the Treasury completed a review of the CRA, engaging with a wide variety of stakeholders. The Treasury made some recommendations about how the CRA is administered in order to help ensure that a bank's CRA activities meet the needs of the communities it serves in a safe and sound manner.25 The OCC, a part of Treasury, has put out an advance notice of proposed rule-making (ANPR) seeking comment on ways to modernize the CRA regulations.26 The Federal Reserve is also undertaking efforts aimed at ensuring that the CRA regulations continue to meet the goals of the legislation amid the evolving financial services environment.27 The legislation is and will remain an important piece of the toolkit for ensuring that all communities have fair access to credit.\n\nAn important area of focus is the area over which a bank's CRA compliance is assessed by the banking agencies. I say \"important\" because, as I've just discussed, CRA activity is higher in areas covered by CRA examinations. So getting the assessment area right will influence the CRA's effectiveness in getting banking services to low- and moderate-income areas.\n\nCurrently, the regulations largely use the location of branches and deposit-taking ATMs to determine assessment areas. This made sense when the CRA originally became law because these were the main ways that banks delivered services to the markets in which they operated. Now, with interstate banking permitted and technological innovations like the internet, banks can serve communities in which they don't necessarily have a branch or ATM, and lending and investment officers can forge relationships at a longer distance than they could before. Indeed, online banks offer services nationwide from one location. Assessing their CRA compliance based on this single location, as is currently done, seems inappropriate.\n\nBut for those banks using the traditional model, data and research suggest that branches remain very relevant and the presence of a branch helps ensure that communities receive better banking services. Despite a drop in the number of bank branches during the Great Recession, the number of branches per capita is higher now than it was two decades ago, even in the wake of significant technological advances over that time period.28 This suggests that bankers themselves see value in their branch networks.\n\nWhile the recent branch closures have not occurred disproportionately in low- and moderate-income areas,29 these and rural areas are particularly susceptible to becoming so-called \"banking deserts,\" defined as no banks within 10 miles of populated areas.30, 31 People in low-income tracts are more than twice as likely to live in a banking desert than those in higher-income tracts.32 And census tracts in which a majority of the population comprises minorities appear to be the most affected.33 Branch closures do appear to have a serious impact on service in low-income areas. One study found that bank branch closings in the 2000s led to a persistent decline of about 10 percent in local small-business lending, that is, lending within 6 miles of the closed branch.34 And this negative effect on lending was found to last up to 6 years. The author estimates that the decline in lending led to a sizable 2 percentage point reduction in local employment growth rates. Another study found that when the proportion of local bank branches belonging to small banks versus large banks increases, there is an economically and statistically significant decline in the proportion of small businesses that feel financially constrained.35 Results like these point to the importance of continuing to focus on the community aspect of the CRA, even as the definition of assessment area is updated.\n\nThis discussion of assessment areas points to another way the CRA can be modernized: namely, recognizing that banks come in different sizes, serve areas with different needs, and use different business models. The focus should remain on making the CRA effective. This means tailoring the assessment approach for different kinds of banks and allowing them to meet their CRA obligations in a way that plays to their strengths while best servicing their communities, which can differ in terms of credit needs and opportunities. Clarifying and perhaps expanding the types of lending and services that qualify for CRA credit should also be considered. Incorporating incentives to lend, invest, and provide financial services in areas with the greatest need should be a consideration in modernizing the CRA because, as I previously mentioned, banks appear to respond to incentives in the CRA.\n\nAt the same time that they are allowing more flexibility, the rules and the federal banking agencies also need to take a consistent approach, making sure that they set the same expectations and the same examination and rating criteria. Focusing on outcomes rather than process will allow for flexibility and consistency, and can increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the CRA regulatory framework. Providing better clarity and consistency can yield better CRA outcomes.\n\nSummary\n\nIn summary, community banks have earned a high degree of public trust even as faith in other institutions has fallen. But the banking environment is rapidly evolving. Changes in technology and business delivery models, new entrants, and increased competition all present challenges for both community banks and their regulators. But they also provide opportunities. Community banks are a vital source of financial services in local communities and will remain so as they adapt to the changing environment. The Community Reinvestment Act has been an important piece of legislation, helping to ensure that all communities have access to credit, investment, and other banking services, which are so vital to economic development. The Federal Reserve and the other federal banking regulators are seizing the opportunity to update the CRA's regulatory framework so that it remains effective in a changing banking environment. In this effort, the Fed plans to continue its engagement with bankers and other external stakeholders to collect their views. Modernization efforts will also need to be informed by research and practice. I am looking forward to the discussions we'll be having over the next two days as we discuss the future of community banking and its regulation."

            "content": "I thank the European Central Bank for inviting me to participate in this conference on macroprudential policy and research. The work being undertaken at the ECB, other central banks, and universities has increased our knowledge and understanding about the interlinkages between the macroeconomy and financial systems. It has been nine years since the financial crisis, and the global economy has improved substantially over that time. In the U.S., the economy is near both of our monetary policy goals of maximum employment and price stability, and the outlook is one of the most favorable we have seen in a long time. As we move further from the crisis, one lesson can never be lost: the importance of maintaining a resilient financial system for a healthy economy. Today, I'll spend my time discussing monetary policy and macroprudential policy from the practical perspective of a U.S. monetary policymaker. Research informs our policy decisions, but at the end of the day, decisions have to be made in a world that doesn't match our models and without full information. Research can be elegant, practice rarely is, but when we are setting policy, effectiveness is what we strive for. Before I continue, I should note that the views I'll present are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nU.S. Financial System Regulation and Macroprudential Tools\n\nIt is an understatement to say that the U.S. financial system's regulatory structure is complex. A wide variety of institutions offer financial services in the U.S. Banks, a category that includes commercial banks, savings and loans, and credit unions, provide only about a third of the credit in the nation. Other providers include insurance companies; mutual funds; pension funds; government-sponsored enterprises, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which issue mortgage-backed securities; and other nonbanks, including broker-dealers, finance companies, and mortgage real estate investment trusts.1\n\nAt the federal level, there are multiple financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the National Credit Union Association, the U.S. Treasury, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency. There are financial system regulators at the state level as well. In many cases, the regulatory authority of these agencies is defined by type of institution rather than by financial instrument.\n\nThe 2008 financial crisis exposed gaps in the regulatory and supervisory architecture in the U.S., which contributed to a build-up in financial imbalances and systemic risk. The Dodd-Frank Act, signed into law in 2010, established provisions aimed at reducing the probability of another financial crisis and reducing the costs on the rest of the economy when a shock hits the financial system. It directed the regulatory agencies to augment their traditional microprudential approach, which focused on the safety and soundness of individual institutions, with a macroprudential approach, which encouraged assessing the risk across institutions. Dodd-Frank also created a new body, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), to promote coordination and information sharing across the financial system regulators. An important power of the FSOC is its ability to designate nonbanks as systemically important, bringing them under more banking-type supervision and regulation. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has the responsibility for supervising systemically important financial institutions, including these FSOC-designated nonbank financial companies, large bank holding companies, and the U.S. operations of certain foreign banking organizations.\n\nThis complex system of institutions and regulators complicates risk monitoring and the ability to tailor regulations and supervisory oversight to potential risks to the financial system. But there are ongoing efforts in the U.S. to do so, and the Federal Reserve has developed a framework for systematically tracking financial stability risks. Before I describe the framework, let me spend a few minutes on why the FOMC regularly reviews financial stability, even though financial stability is not an explicit part of the FOMC's monetary policy mandate.\n\nFinancial Stability and Monetary Policy\n\nFinancial stability matters to the FOMC for several reasons. First, monetary policy affects the real economy by affecting financial conditions. When financial markets are disrupted, as they were during the financial crisis, the transmission of monetary policy to the economy can also be disrupted. Second, the goals of monetary policy and financial stability are interconnected. Indeed, the FOMC's statement on its monetary policy strategy says that the FOMC's monetary policy decisions \"reflect its longer-run goals, its medium-term outlook, and its assessments of the balance of risks, including risks to the financial system that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals.\"2 Financial stability is a necessary but not sufficient condition for macroeconomic stability. On the other side of the coin, macroeconomic stability is an important contributor to financial stability, and well-formulated and well-communicated monetary policy supports financial stability.\n\nA third reason monetary policymakers need to consider financial stability is that the financial crisis changed how monetary policy is implemented. From a practical standpoint, monetary policymakers have to be more attuned to developments in financial markets and institutions than they once were. The actions taken to address the financial crisis and Great Recession increased the size and changed the composition of the Fed's balance sheet. The Fed is now transacting with a broader set of financial institutions, so policymakers have to have a more complete understanding of the plumbing in financial markets.\n\nThe Fed's Framework for Monitoring Financial Stability\n\nThe basic framework used by Federal Reserve staff to monitor financial stability risks recognizes the complex nature of the financial system in the U.S., with its mix of bank-based and market-based finance and its multiplicity of regulatory and supervisory bodies.3 The framework tracks a standard set of financial system vulnerabilities that could amplify and propagate shocks. It monitors these vulnerabilities using a set of indicators on various financial activities in four categories: asset valuation pressures (reflecting the price of risk and risk appetites among investors), leverage, maturity and liquidity transformation, and interconnectedness and complexity.4 Some of these vulnerabilities, like leverage, vary over the business and financial cycles; others, like complexity, are more structural in nature, reflecting the design of markets and intermediaries. The vulnerabilities are assessed across four sectors of the economy: the banking sector; the nonbank financial sector, including capital markets, nonbanks, and shadow banks; the nonfinancial business sector; and the household sector. Tools like heat maps and data-visualization techniques aid in tracking changes in vulnerabilities over time.5 Assessments of individual vulnerabilities are then combined to get an assessment of the overall vulnerability of the U.S. financial system. Recognizing the global interconnectedness of financial systems, the Fed staff has also developed tools to assess foreign financial stability.6\n\nFour times a year, the staff uses this framework to brief the FOMC, and an evaluation of developments related to financial stability is now a regular section in the Board of Governors' monetary policy report to Congress.7\n\nMacroprudential Policy and Monetary Policy\n\nAlthough the FOMC regularly discusses financial system stability, the financial system regulators, including the Federal Reserve Board of Governors (a group that is distinct from the FOMC), have responsibility for maintaining and enhancing the structural resilience of the financial system. In the U.S., structural resilience is promoted by requiring higher levels and quality of capital (including a minimum non-risk-based leverage ratio, as well as risk-based capital standards); conducting stress tests; imposing liquidity standards; developing effective resolution methods for systemically important banks and nonbank financial institutions; requiring large banks to submit living will resolution plans; and implementing reforms to improve the stability of certain nonbank markets.8 Financial regulators are also focused on working with the industry to enhance strategies to improve the cyber resiliency of the financial sector, as cybersecurity risk is a continuing threat to financial stability.\n\nIn contrast to the structural tools, compared to other countries, the U.S. has fewer countercyclical tools that can be varied with the perceived level of vulnerabilities in the financial system. However, the stress tests can be used as a countercyclical tool to the extent that the vulnerabilities of concern can be built into the stress scenarios. For example, this year's adverse stress scenario includes deep declines in corporate bond and real estate prices.9 Another cyclical tool available in the U.S. is the countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB), which can be imposed on internationally active banks. The Federal Reserve Board has indicated that it will use this tool only when systemic vulnerabilities are \"meaningfully above normal\" and that, when using the tool, it intends to increase the buffer gradually.10 The Board anticipates giving banking organizations 12 months before an increase would become effective.11 The U.S. has not had much experience with this tool. It has yet to set a positive countercyclical capital buffer, even though countercyclical policy calls for building up buffers during good times so that they are available during bad times. And the lead times needed to use this tool likely make it less effective at addressing vulnerabilities that may rapidly develop or may be detected only after they have had time to develop. So focusing on increasing the resiliency of the financial system's structure across the business and financial cycles seems well-founded. And from a practical viewpoint, even if, in theory, using countercyclical tools might be preferred, their limits suggest we need to at least contemplate using monetary policy to address financial stability in some cases.\n\nIndeed, the limits to the macroprudential tools were illuminated in a tabletop exercise in which I participated with some other Federal Reserve Bank presidents.12 The exercise involved a hypothetical scenario in which commercial real estate prices were rising sharply but the economy was at full employment and inflation was somewhat below goal. The objective of the exercise was for policymakers to use available macroprudential tools and possibly monetary policy to reduce the risk posed to financial stability by the commercial real estate boom while fostering the Fed's monetary policy goals. Implementation challenges included having to coordinate across multiple regulators or, in some cases, to follow legally required administrative procedures like public comment periods, which delay application of the tools. Such delays could make the tools ineffective or even cause them to exacerbate the situation rather than shore up the financial system. Another limitation was that some tools applied only to regulated banking firms, which could result in risks shifting to other parts of the financial system. I came away from the exercise more convinced of the need to focus on the structural resilience of the financial system across the business and financial cycles.\n\nWhether monetary policy should be used to address financial stability risks, such as sharply rising credit growth, is still an open question.13 The benefits depend on the extent to which monetary policy would be effective at stemming financial imbalances, thereby lowering the probability of a financial crisis or limiting the effects of the crisis, and whether or not there are macroprudential tools that could be used instead. Any benefits of attempting to use monetary policy to stem financial imbalances would need to be weighed against the cost of slowing the economy and increasing the volatility of output and of inflation.14\n\nLet me now turn to the practical question of how the decisions about financial stability policy and monetary policy might effectively be organized, and then end with some conclusions.\n\nThe Governance of Financial Stability Policy\n\nI argued earlier that the goals of monetary policy and financial stability policy are complementary over the longer run. But the policies do interact, and at times, there can be short-run trade-offs between monetary policy actions taken to support macroeconomic stability and financial stability. For example, an extended period of very low interest rates aimed at returning the macroeconomy to health might also generate financial imbalances and pose potential risks to financial stability by spurring investors to search for yield. Or a tightening of macroprudential policy to address financial stability risks could result in tighter financial conditions more generally, thereby increasing the likelihood that a monetary policy response would be needed to promote macroeconomic stability.\n\nIn many countries, responsibility for monetary policy and responsibility for financial stability policy are handled by two different committees, which, in some cases, have some members in common.15 Canada's financial sector regulator is not part of the central bank, but the Bank of Canada assesses financial system vulnerabilities and risks and publishes this assessment twice a year.16 In Sweden, the financial stability authority is not part of the central bank, but the central bank publishes a financial stability report and its governor sits on the financial stability council, an advisory board. The ECB is somewhat different, with responsibility for both monetary policy and macroprudential policy ultimately resting with the ECB Governing Council.\n\nThe U.K. has a two-committee structure housed within the Bank of England. The monetary policy and financial policy committees are independent, but they also share members, which allows for good communication and information sharing between the two committees. One example of coordination came in August 2013 when the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee initiated forward guidance that it would hold interest rates low and consider additional asset purchases at least until the unemployment rate had fallen to 7 percent.17 But it also said that a condition that would vacate this guidance would be if the Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee found that the stance of monetary policy was threatening financial stability in a way that couldn't be contained by the available macroprudential tools.\n\nIn the U.S., financial system complexity means that we don't have a single authority that oversees financial stability. While the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) has the ability to designate firms as systemically important financial institutions and, therefore, subject to enhanced regulation by the Fed, the FSOC does not have the authority to take actions to mitigate emerging risks. Instead, it can make recommendations to the regulatory agencies and to Congress, which can then decide to act or not.18\n\nBut all is not lost. With its oversight of systemically important financial institutions, the Board of Governors plays an important role in setting macroprudential policy in the U.S. The Board also constitutes part of the FOMC, so that there is a potential for some coordination between macroprudential policy and monetary policy or, at the very least, good communication and information sharing. In some sense, the U.S. has a two-committee set-up and one could imagine a relationship between the FOMC and the Board of Governors similar to that between the two policy committees in the U.K.\n\nIn the U.S., housing both committees within the central bank has an important governance benefit. By design, the FOMC's monetary policy decisions are independent from short-run political considerations, with appropriate accountability to elected officials and the public. Similarly, it is also important that policymakers have some independence in setting macroprudential policy.19 There will be times when tools have to be used well before there are clear signs of instability. This might be difficult to explain, and there may be various interests that would prefer the tools not be invoked in seemingly good times. This means that macroprudential policymakers should be communicating with the public to improve the public's understanding of how financial stability risks are being monitored, what tools are available to promote financial resilience, and the rationale for macroprudential policy decisions. Systematic and transparent application of financial stability policy would seem to be as important as it is in the conduct of monetary policy. Still, we are a distance away from being able to articulate a clear strategy and a set of principles to guide decisions about the circumstances under which monetary policy should be used as a tool for financial stability and when we should rely upon macroprudential tools.\n\nConclusions\n\nLet me conclude with three points I take away from this practical viewpoint on financial resilience and monetary policy in the U.S.\n\nFirst, given some of the limitations on macroprudential tools and the complexity of financial system regulation, ensuring the structural resilience of the financial system throughout the cycle is the first line of defense in promoting financial stability. Higher levels and quality of capital, liquidity standards, stress tests, living wills, and effective resolution methods for systemically important bank and nonbank financial institutions are all important tools for improving resilience. In my view, we should set standards for the structural resilience tools somewhat higher than they would be if we had more experience with and confidence in the countercyclical tools. I support efforts to better align regulation and supervisory oversight with where the potential system risks lie, including proposals to make regulation less burdensome on community banks in the U.S. However, I think it would be a mistake to unwind the steps taken since the financial crisis that have led to a more resilient financial system. I would like to see how the new settings perform throughout the cycle before making major changes.\n\nSecond, monetary policymakers need to monitor the resiliency of the financial system and be cognizant of the interlinkages between monetary policy, financial imbalances, and financial stability risks. In a situation of rising financial stability risks, while using macroprudential tools might be preferred, we have had little experience with these tools. If they proved to be inadequate and financial stability risks continued to grow, monetary policy should be on the table as a possible defense. Note that, in this case, the blurring between financial stability goals and monetary policy goals would be high: if we assessed the risks to financial stability to be sufficiently great, achieving our dual mandate monetary policy goals would also be in jeopardy over the medium run.\n\nThird, it will be important for the FOMC and Board of Governors to make progress toward a systematic strategy for handling the interactions between monetary policy and financial stability, including the appropriate use of monetary policy to counteract financial imbalances, and to communicate this strategy to the public. There are two concrete steps the Federal Reserve can take now. The Fed can continue to hold tabletop exercises designed to illuminate the interactions between macroprudential policy and monetary policy. These scenario exercises can help clarify policymakers' views on the appropriate use of each type of policy and help the Federal Reserve develop a systematic strategy for dealing with the interactions between the policies. In addition, similar to other central banks, the Fed can develop and publish a financial stability report, which discusses the Fed's assessment of financial system vulnerabilities. This report could also provide more context for the Board's decisions about the countercyclical capital buffer and any regulatory guidance aimed at mitigating emerging risks.\n\nIn summary, I believe the steps taken since the financial crisis have made the financial system more resilient. Today, systemically important financial institutions have higher capital and liquidity buffers and better risk-management systems. However, we cannot take greater resiliency for granted. If, as many economists predict, the new normal is a world with lower equilibrium interest rates, then the interactions between monetary policy and financial stability are likely to remain center stage. It's important that we come to some clarity about how we will use all of our policy tools to promote a healthy macroeconomy and resilient financial system."

            "content": "Let me begin by thanking the Global Interdependence Center and the Banque de France for inviting me back to this important conference series. I always learn a lot from the GIC’s Central Banking Series conferences, and I am proud of the association I have had with the GIC for many years.\n\nThree years ago when I spoke here, I reviewed the tools that monetary policymakers had put in place to address the financial crisis and Great Recession. I discussed the Federal Reserve’s plans for normalizing policy and some of the challenges we would face as we transitioned from extraordinary economic and policy times back to ordinary times. Today, the environment has changed, but policymakers, as always, continue to face challenges in determining the most effective policies within the environment. So today, I’d like to carry on the theme and talk about current and future issues that Fed policymakers will face as we set appropriate monetary policy. My remarks will reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee, the monetary policymaking body within the Fed.\n\nThe U.S. Economy\n\nThe U.S. economy is performing very well and I expect that to continue. Over this year and next, I expect above-trend output growth, continued strength in labor markets, and firming inflation. I believe the U.S. economy is slightly beyond maximum employment, from the standpoint of the cyclical conditions monetary policy can address, and that inflation will reach our symmetric 2 percent goal on a sustainable basis over the next one to two years. This outlook is based on favorable underlying fundamentals, including accommodative monetary and fiscal policies, healthy household balance sheets, rising personal income, a global economy that is improving overall, and stable inflation expectations.\n\nOf course, as with any forecast, there are risks around the outlook. Financial market volatility has risen from the very low levels of recent years. But, so far, investors seem to be taking it in stride and firms tell us the volatility has not thwarted their spending plans. The rise in oil prices and increase in the value of the dollar are worth watching. Geopolitical risks have risen and there is uncertainty around trade, which may not be resolved soon. Assessing the impact of trade developments on the U.S. macroeconomy will ultimately depend on the actions actually taken by the U.S. and its trading partners. But in the meantime, continued uncertainty may also cause businesses and investors to reevaluate their outlook for the U.S. economy and alter their spending in the near term. We will need to continue to monitor the trade situation. On the upside, the tax package and increased federal spending in the U.S. are expected to add to an already healthy level of spending in the second half of this year and next year, but the magnitudes and exact timing are still somewhat uncertain.\n\nDespite the risks, this is one of the most favorable outlooks we have had in a long time, so one might ask: What are the challenges? The task before monetary policymakers is to calibrate policy to this healthy outlook to meet and maintain our dual mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability. At its meeting earlier this month, the FOMC decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent. This was consistent with the strategy the FOMC has followed as progress has been made on our monetary policy goals, namely, to gradually remove the high level of accommodation that was needed to address the Great Recession. Also, at the May meeting, the FOMC continued to implement its plan, initiated last October, to normalize the Fed’s balance sheet in terms of the size and composition of assets.1 The balance sheet grew in size and lengthened in maturity during the Great Recession when the Fed undertook several programs to purchase longer-term assets in order to put further downward pressure on longer-term interest rates.2 We are now allowing maturing longer-term assets to roll off the balance sheet in a gradual and predictable way; this process will take several years to complete.\n\nThe economy is dynamic, so calibrating monetary policy to the medium-run outlook involves several moving parts. Essentially, the challenge for policymakers is to assess current and future performance on our policy goals of maximum employment and price stability, and to assess the current and appropriate future stance of monetary policy. So let me discuss each of these.\n\nMaximum Employment\n\nThe U.S. labor market is strong. The unemployment rate, at 3.9 percent, is below its lowest point during the last expansion and near its lowest point in the past 40 years. I expect the unemployment rate to fall further this year and to remain below 4 percent next year. This year, payroll job growth has strengthened to an average of 200,000 jobs per month. This is well above most economists’ estimates of trend job growth, which lie in the range of 75,000 to 120,000 jobs per month. The trend estimate depends on what one assumes about labor force participation, and this is a key factor in determining whether the economy is at or beyond the level of employment that is sustainable over the longer run.\n\nBased on demographic factors, including the aging of the U.S. population, the longer-run trend in participation is downward sloping. But the labor force participation rate has been fairly stable over the past two years, a sign of strength in the labor market. We are increasingly hearing from a wide variety of businesses and job placement firms that it is hard to find workers, for both higher-skill and lower-skill occupations, and firms are responding to labor shortages by raising wages. The acceleration in the employment cost index over the past two years suggests that the anecdotal reports of firms raising wages to attract and retain workers are now filtering through to the official statistics.\n\nAn issue for policymakers is that it is difficult to know with precision how tight labor markets are. The acceleration in compensation growth, from under 2 percent earlier in the expansion to about 2-3/4 percent more recently, is not as strong as one might normally expect from tight labor markets. In my view, part of the reason for this is the low level of productivity growth over the expansion. Over the longer run, wages, adjusted for inflation, tend to reflect the marginal product of workers. During this expansion, labor productivity growth has been on the order of only 1 percent.3 This is less than half the pace over the prior two expansions. Research from the Cleveland Fed staff suggests that nominal wage growth over the expansion is not a puzzle if you account for productivity growth, labor market conditions, and inflation.4\n\nNonetheless, economists and policymakers have to take on board all the data when assessing where the economy is relative to goal. The movements in labor force participation, combined with the fact that wage and price inflation have remained moderate even as labor markets have strengthened, suggest that labor market conditions may not be as tight as we originally assumed. As the expansion has played out, FOMC policymakers have lowered their estimates of the longer-run level of unemployment; these estimates come with a considerable amount of uncertainty. Five years ago, in the March 2013 Summary of Economic Projections, the central tendency of projections of the longer-run unemployment rate ranged from 5.2 to 6.0 percent.5 In projections this March, the central tendency was 4.3 to 4.7 percent, down a percentage point or more, with a median projection of 4.5 percent.6 I have also moved down my own estimate of the longer-run unemployment rate over time, to 4.5 percent.\n\nDespite lower estimates of the longer-run unemployment rate, in my view, if one combines all the indicators, labor markets do appear to be slightly beyond maximum employment, and the outlook suggests that labor markets will continue to be tight over the next couple of years. In the past, when labor markets have moved too far beyond maximum employment, with the unemployment rate moving substantially below estimates of its longer-run level for some time, the economy overheated, inflation rose, and the economy ended up in a recession. Achieving a soft landing is difficult and recent research by Cleveland Fed staff suggests that a strategy to overheat the economy in an attempt to pull more people back into the workforce is unlikely to have a lasting effect on labor force participation.7 An interesting paper by economists at Stanford University and the University of Chicago suggests that overly tight labor markets can result in firms having to meet rising demand by hiring workers into jobs that are not the best match to their skill sets.8 The longer this need to hire lower-productivity workers continues, the larger the decline in employment when the inevitable bad shock and downturn comes. All this suggests that policymakers have to continue to assess labor market conditions, and to balance progress on this goal with progress on our other objective, price stability.\n\nPrice Stability\n\nThe FOMC has set a symmetric longer-run goal of 2 percent inflation, as measured by the year-over-year change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, that is, PCE inflation. The FOMC aims for inflation to be 2 percent because it believes that this rate is most consistent over the longer run with our statutory mandate. The goal is symmetric, meaning that the FOMC would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or persistently below this goal and such persistent deviations would warrant a policy response.9\n\nInflation measures can vary from month to month due to idiosyncratic factors and in response to temporary economic and financial disturbances. So when we assess where inflation is relative to our goal, it is important to look through transitory movements and focus on where inflation is going on a sustained basis. Our goal is expressed in terms of total PCE inflation, but policymakers also look at a variety of other measures of inflation to get a sense of the underlying inflation trend. These include CPI measures; core measures of PCE and CPI, which exclude food and energy prices because they tend to be volatile; and the trimmed-mean and median measures, which drop those components with the largest and smallest changes. We also use various models to forecast inflation. The models include components to account for current and past inflation, utilization rates of labor and capital, and inflation expectations. As good as our various models are, it’s important to remember that a significant portion of the variation in inflation rates comes from idiosyncratic factors that can’t be forecasted.10 So forecasts of inflation, like those of longer-run unemployment, have wide error bands. For example, based on historical forecast errors over the past 20 years, the 70 percent confidence range for forecasts of PCE inflation one to two years ahead is around ±1.0 percentage point.11\n\nInflation has been running under the 2 percent goal for much of the expansion, but it has been firming and is now near our goal. Measured year-over-year, in March, total PCE inflation rose to 2.0 percent and core PCE inflation rose to 1.9 percent. These are welcome developments, but it is too soon to say that we have met our inflation goal on a sustained basis. Near-term monthly readings of inflation have risen, but some of the pickup reflects higher commodity prices and some of the strength is likely to be temporary, as low readings from last March drop out of the calculations.\n\nI expect to see month-to-month variation in the numbers around an underlying upward trend in inflation, as inflation moves to our goal on a sustainable basis over the next year or so. One of the challenges for monetary policymakers will be to keep the public and market participants focused on the medium-run outlook for inflation, even as higher monthly readings in the near term are followed by some softer readings. We don’t want inflation expectations to react to these temporary movements, and policymakers can best avoid that by continuing to convey through policy decisions and communications that we are committed to achieving our dual mandate goals. Consistent with the FOMC’s longer-run monetary policy strategy, I am comfortable looking through transitory movements in inflation – those to the low side and those to the high side – as we aim for inflation over the longer run to be at our symmetric 2 percent objective, allowing for the normal variation in measured inflation.\n\nThe Stance of Monetary Policy\n\nAs the FOMC said in its May statement, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative. Currently, one indicator that policy is accommodative is that the fed funds rate, adjusted for inflation, is negative even though the economic outlook is strong. Another indicator is that many monetary policy rules are pointing to higher interest rates given the outlook. For example, the simple monetary policy rules across several forecasts that are available on the Cleveland Fed’s external website indicate that policy rates should be rising given the forecasts, with the median path somewhat steeper in the near term than the median funds rate path in the March Summary of Economic Projections.12\n\nIn its May statement, the FOMC also said it expects economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant further gradual increases in the fed funds rate. In my view, the medium-run outlook supports the continued gradual removal of policy accommodation; it seems the best strategy for balancing the risks to both of our policy goals and avoiding a build-up of financial stability risks. We want to give inflation time to move back to goal, and I don’t expect inflation to pick up sharply; this argues against a steep path. At the same time, the economy is slightly beyond maximum employment, and financial conditions are accommodative. In my view, it is appropriate to continue to remove some of the monetary policy accommodation to ensure that we avoid a build-up in risks to macroeconomic stability that could arise if the economy were allowed to overheat or a build-up of financial imbalances or risks to financial stability that could arise from the extended period of very low interest rates. Of course, the path policy actually takes will depend on how the economy actually evolves. If the upside risks to growth come to pass, we may need to steepen the path a bit; if inflation surprises on the downside, we may need to go a bit slower, but the gradual upward path is consistent with the modal economic outlook at this time.\n\nAs we continue to move rates up, we will have to continue to assess whether monetary policy is accommodative, neutral, or restrictive. Essentially, it requires assessing where the policy rate is relative to the level of the short-term interest rate that represents neutral monetary policy, that is, the equilibrium interest rate. This equilibrium interest rate will vary with economic conditions that affect the demand for investment and the supply of savings; there are wide error bands around estimates of this rate; and the rate over a short-run horizon can differ from that over a longer horizon. For example, as the economy deteriorated during the financial crisis and Great Recession, the short-run equilibrium interest rate fell to a level below what would be expected to prevail over the longer run. Now, with fiscal policy turning from restrictive to stimulative, the economy growing above trend, and investment rising, the short-term equilibrium interest rate is rising, too.\n\nAs the expansion continues, it could be that in order to maintain our policy goals, we may need to move the fed funds rate, for a time, a bit above the level of the funds rate that is expected to prevail over the longer run. Indeed, the March Summary of Economic Projections indicates that the median appropriate policy path has the fed funds rate in 2020 moving a bit above the estimate of its longer-run level, which is about 3 percent. Of course, 2020 is a long time away and the policy path actually followed will be responsive to changes in the outlook.\n\nIn terms of that estimate of the longer-run fed funds rate, one needs to consider what policy rate is consistent with maximum employment and stable inflation over the longer run. There is reason to believe that this equilibrium rate is lower now than it used to be. In fact, FOMC participants have been lowering their estimates of the longer-run fed funds rate over time. For example, in March 2014, the median estimate was 4 percent. Now it is about 3 percent. The equilibrium rate is related to the longer-run potential growth rate of the economy, which itself depends on the growth of the labor force and the growth of productivity, a measure of how effectively the economy combines labor and capital to create output.\n\nBased on demographics, U.S. labor force growth is projected to be considerably slower than it has been in recent decades.13 While some of the slow growth in labor productivity during this expansion has been cyclical, more persistent structural factors may also be at play.14 The combination of slow labor force growth and slow productivity growth suggests that the potential growth rate of the economy will be lower than it was in the past. My own estimate of output growth over the longer run is 2 percent, which is a lot slower than the 3 to 3-1/2 percent rate seen over the 1980s and 1990s, and my own estimate of the longer-run nominal fed funds rate is 3 percent, or 1 percent in real terms.\n\nOf course, policy changes outside the realm of monetary policy could foster higher productivity growth and labor force growth and ultimately support higher potential output growth and equilibrium interest rates. But such policies need to be implemented as the country puts its longer-run fiscal situation on a sustainable path. Recently released projections by the Congressional Budget Office indicate that under current policy, the U.S. federal deficit as a share of GDP will be considerably higher 10 years from now, with rising government debt levels implying that a higher share of government spending will go to interest payments.15 This would tend to crowd out productive investments by the private sector and the government, thereby lowering productivity and longer-run growth.\n\nMonetary Policy Frameworks: Operations and Strategy\n\nLet me conclude by touching on two future monetary policy considerations: the operating framework that the FOMC uses to ensure that its policy rate is being maintained at the appropriate level, and the monetary policy framework that the FOMC uses to determine what that appropriate level of the policy rate is.16\n\nBefore the financial crisis, the FOMC kept the supply of bank reserves scarce. The FOMC could make small changes in that supply by buying or selling short-term Treasuries, and this allowed the FOMC to ensure that the fed funds rate was maintained at the FOMC’s target. But now, as a result of the Fed’s large-scale asset purchases, reserves are very abundant: indeed, banks are holding a bit more than $2 trillion in reserves in accounts at the Fed, and almost all of this is in excess of what is required by regulation. At these levels, small changes in the supply of reserves have little effect on the fed funds rate. Instead, the Fed brings the fed funds rate into its target range by adjusting the rate it pays on excess reserves, and by using overnight reverse repurchase agreements, which help put a floor on the fed funds rate. As normalization of the balance sheet progresses, the FOMC will need to decide which operating framework it will use going forward. The fed funds market has changed considerably since the financial crisis, and part of the consideration will be whether the fed funds rate will remain the best indicator of the general level of short-run interest rates.17\n\nAnother issue for the FOMC is the strategic framework it uses to determine appropriate monetary policy. Currently, we use a flexible inflation-targeting framework, which has served the FOMC well in effectively promoting our policy goals. But as the economy moves back to normal, it seems an opportune time for the FOMC to undertake a study of its framework. As a matter of good governance, a central bank should periodically review its assumptions, methods, and models. Moreover, if the longer-term equilibrium real interest rate does remain lower than in past decades, there will be less room for monetary policy to cushion against a negative economic shock, policy would likely hit the zero lower bound more often, and nontraditional monetary policy tools would have to be used more often. To the extent that these tools are less effective or are constrained from being used, the potential is for longer recessions and longer bouts of low inflation.\n\nGiven this potential scenario, now is the time to assess whether changes to our current framework could make monetary policy more effective in achieving our goals. Researchers have suggested several alternative frameworks, such as targeting an inflation rate higher than 2 percent, moving to an inflation-targeting range instead of a point goal, or targeting a path for the price level or for nominal GDP rather than for inflation. None of these alternative frameworks are without challenges, but the positives and negatives should be thoroughly reviewed to evaluate whether the net benefits of any of the alternatives would outweigh those of the flexible inflation-targeting framework currently in use.\n\nConclusion\n\nThree years ago at this conference, I discussed the challenges U.S. monetary policymakers faced in preparing for the start of monetary policy normalization. Today, the medium-run outlook for the U.S. economy is very favorable and policy normalization is well underway. While the economic environment has changed, monetary policy challenges remain. I appreciate the opportunity this conference has given me to explain how I’m approaching some of the policy issues the FOMC faces. I look forward to your questions."

            "content": "Let me begin by thanking Dean Arjang Assad of the Katz Graduate School of Business and Dmitri Shiry of Deloitte for inviting me to speak with you this evening. Dmitri performs important public service as a member of the board of directors of the Cleveland Fed's Pittsburgh Branch, and it just so happens that this building formerly housed our branch. In addition to including the western part of Pennsylvania, the Cleveland Fed's District comprises the state of Ohio and parts of Kentucky and West Virginia. The regional nature of the Federal Reserve has served the country well for more than 100 years. It allows monetary policy decisions to take into account the diversity of the American economy and its people and helps ensure that those decisions incorporate information from all parts of the country, not just Washington, D.C. or Wall Street.\n\nThis evening, I would like to give you my perspectives on the economy and monetary policy. My remarks will reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nSome Context: The Medium-Run Outlook and Monetary Policy\n\nLet me start with some context. Monetary policy affects the economy with a lag. Some sectors are more sensitive to interest rates than others, so it takes some time for changes in monetary policy to be transmitted through all parts of the economy. This means monetary policymakers have to formulate an outlook for the economy over the medium run and evaluate the risks around that outlook in order to set appropriate policy.\n\nAlthough we use state-of-the-art techniques and incorporate official data and anecdotal information from our contacts across the country, there is still a lot of uncertainty around any economic forecast. Indeed, in speaking about FOMC projections, former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke said, \"The only economic forecast in which I have complete confidence is that the economy will not evolve along the precise path implied by our projections.\"1\n\nBut just because we cannot forecast the future with as much precision as we'd like does not mean that the exercise is without value. The discipline of forecasting and assessing risks over the medium run helps us avoid focusing too much on short-run changes in the economic data or volatility in financial markets. It helps us be systematic, yet responsive to changes in economic conditions to the extent that they change the outlook. And the more that people understand this process, the more they'll be able to anticipate where policy is likely to go even if the economy develops in unexpected ways.\n\nWith that as background, let me turn to the outlook.\n\nThe Economy\n\nI expect 2018 to be another good year for the economy, with above-trend growth, continued labor market strength, and firming inflation. The economy will be supported by favorable fundamentals, including accommodative monetary and fiscal policy, healthy household balance sheets, rising personal income, and an improving global economy. Nonetheless, financial market volatility has risen from the very low levels of recent years, the trade picture has created uncertainty, and geopolitical concerns have risen. I view these as risks to the outlook, but at this point, these factors have not caused me to change my outlook for the overall economy. The task before monetary policymakers is to calibrate policy to this healthy economy to sustain the expansion. Monetary policy is still accommodative, and as the economy strengthens, we don't want to get behind the curve and find ourselves in a position of having to raise rates more aggressively than anticipated. But we also don't want to overreact to the positive outlook by raising rates too aggressively and potentially curtail the expansion. This takes some careful balancing.\n\nLast year, economic growth picked up to around 2-1/2 percent, and I expect growth this year to be a bit stronger. Admittedly, incoming data suggest a moderation in consumer and business spending in the first quarter. But this moderation was from high levels, and I expect the first-quarter softness in output growth to be temporary, just as it was in the past couple of years.\n\nLast year, growth became more balanced across sectors and less dependent on only the consumer. Nonresidential investment grew at a pace of about 6 percent in 2017, a significant pickup from the anemic pace of less than 1 percent in the prior two years. That earlier weakness reflected the steep decline in oil prices between mid-2014 and early 2016, which caused a sharp pullback in drilling, mining, and their suppliers. The oil price decline was accompanied by a sharp appreciation of the dollar, which hurt manufacturers and other firms dependent on exports. But last year, oil prices rose, the dollar depreciated, and the economies of our trading partners began to strengthen, all of which supported increased business spending.\n\nIndeed, for the first time in many years, economic activity around the world is picking up. This should be a positive for U.S. exports. However, the tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, rhetoric suggesting an escalation of reciprocal tariffs on certain goods traded between the U.S. and China, and the ongoing renegotiations of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) have clouded the trade picture. This cloud may not pass over quickly. Assessing the impact on the U.S. macroeconomy will ultimately depend on the actions taken by the U.S. and its trading partners with respect to trade, and whether those actions or the continuing uncertainty causes businesses and investors to reevaluate their outlook for the U.S. economy.\n\nWe have already seen a marked increase in volatility in the equity markets this year. However, it is helpful to put this volatility into perspective. Last year, the S&P 500 index rose 19 percent, amid extremely low volatility. Equity prices are little changed, on net, this year. More notable is the rise in volatility. We are less than four months into the year, but as of yesterday's close, there have already been 29 days on which the S&P 500 rose or fell by more than 1 percent. Through all of last year, there were only eight such days — a very low number compared to the average of about 60 days per year from 2010 through 2016.\n\nWhenever there are such big swings in the market, we need to assess their implications. The increased volatility this year has not been associated with signs of financial market stress, such as disorderly trading, a lack of liquidity, or contagion to other markets. And while a deeper and more persistent drop in equity markets could lead to a pullback in risk-taking and spending, the movements we have seen thus far are not close to this scenario. Contacts tell us higher volatility has not deterred planned spending. Equity prices remain considerably above their levels at the start of last year, and both business and consumer sentiment remain at high levels.\n\nThe changes in tax policy are expected to buoy both business and household spending this year. Lower tax rates and full expensing for investment in equipment and intangibles should spur additional business spending to meet higher near-term demand, some of which will be driven by higher federal spending. In a recent Cleveland Fed staff survey of firms in the District, over a third of the firms expecting tax savings this year said they planned to use some of the proceeds to increase investment.\n\nThe tax package adds a positive element to an already healthy outlook for consumer spending. Personal incomes are growing because labor market conditions are strong. Lower personal tax rates and higher standard deductions should spur some additional household spending in the aggregate, although the impact of tax changes on individual households will depend on the level and sources of their income. Household balance sheets are in much better shape since the Great Recession, reflecting a combination of deleveraging and increased savings.\n\nThe strength in the household sector is also supporting a moderately paced expansion of the housing sector, despite the increase in mortgage rates. In the aggregate, housing equity held by households is now above its peak before the housing crash. While the new tax law contains several provisions that affect the tax treatment of homeownership, I expect activity in the housing sector to continue to expand at a sustainable pace.\n\nThe economy's strength is well illustrated by the very strong conditions in labor markets. I expect that strength to continue. The unemployment rate, at 4.1 percent, is below its lowest point during the last expansion. It is under the 4-1/2 percent rate I gauge to be consistent with full employment over the longer run. I expect the unemployment rate to move below 4 percent this year and to remain below 4 percent next year.\n\nOver the first three months of the year, payroll jobs have grown by an average of about 200,000 per month. This is a pickup from last year's average monthly gain of about 180,000 jobs and is well above most economists' estimates of trend monthly job growth, which lie in the range of 75,000 to 120,000. Based on demographic factors, including the aging of the population, the longer-run trend in labor force participation is downward sloping, but participation has been fairly stable over the past two years, another sign of a strong labor market.\n\nRegional contacts continue to report that finding workers, both for higher-skill and lower-skill occupations, is very difficult, and that they are responding to labor shortages by offering higher wages and benefits and more flexible work schedules. The official statistics indicate that compensation growth has moved up, from under 2 percent earlier in the expansion to over 2-1/2 percent more recently. That's less of a pickup than what is typically seen given the tightness in labor markets, but it is consistent with the low productivity growth we've seen over the expansion.2 As investment continues to pick up, which should help to promote productivity growth, and firms continue to move wages up to attract and retain workers, I expect to see some strengthening in wage growth.\n\nCombining all the indicators, my assessment is that from the standpoint of the cyclical conditions monetary policy can address, we are slightly beyond maximum employment, one part of the Fed's monetary policy mandate.\n\nThe other part of the Fed's mandate is price stability. The FOMC has set a symmetric goal of 2 percent inflation, as measured by the year-over-year change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, that is, PCE inflation. The FOMC aims for inflation to be 2 percent because it believes that this rate is most consistent over the longer run with our statutory mandate. Inflation measures can vary from month to month due to idiosyncratic factors and in response to temporary economic and financial disturbances. So to assess where we are relative to goal, it's always a good idea to look through transitory movements in the numbers, both those above and those below our goal, and focus on where inflation is going on a sustained basis.\n\nGetting inflation back to 2 percent has been somewhat of a challenge, but since 2015, inflation has been generally moving up. At 1.8 percent, PCE inflation is near, but still slightly under, our goal. In the near term, we will likely see some higher inflation readings as last March's sharp decline in the prices of cell phone data plans drop out of the year-over-year measures, but we need to remain focused on the medium-run outlook for inflation.\n\nWith growth above trend, strong labor demand, and inflation expectations relatively stable, my outlook is that inflation will gradually move up to 2 percent on a sustainable basis over the next one to two years. I don't expect inflation to move up sharply. But as inflation firms, it is important that monetary policymakers continue to convey through policy decisions and communications that we are committed to achieving our dual mandate goals. Before I turn to monetary policy, let me discuss the Pittsburgh economy.\n\nThe path of the expansion in the Pittsburgh region reflects its industrial mix and the nature of the shocks that have hit the broader U.S. economy. Pittsburgh saw relatively strong employment growth early in the expansion. But by mid-2012, payroll growth had begun to weaken. The pullback in mining, drilling, and manufacturing in 2015 and 2016 had a significant effect on the Pittsburgh region. The region lost jobs in 2015, barely saw any job growth in 2016, and the unemployment rate moved up. But last year saw a significant improvement in job growth, and the unemployment rate resumed its decline and now stands at 4.8 percent.\n\nPayroll job growth picked up to a pace of nearly 2 percent last year, stronger than job growth in the state of Pennsylvania and in the nation. Reflecting the turnaround in energy prices, gains were especially strong in mining and construction. The region's growing reputation as an attractive tourist destination also led to a rise in tourism-related jobs. The rise seen in education and healthcare jobs reflects a longer-run trend of economic diversification in the Pittsburgh region, which was discussed in a recent Cleveland Fed report in the Bank's Industrial Heartland Series.3 Such diversification allows regions to better adapt to changing economic forces.\n\nBut the region faces some challenges. Pittsburgh's population has been declining over the past two decades, the population is aging, and despite the presence of some of the best colleges and universities in the country, many students leave the region after graduation. The Allegheny Conference on Community Development recently updated its report on regional labor supply and demand.4 The report projects that healthcare and information technology workers will remain in high demand, but there will also be a sizable demand for engineers and skilled technicians linked to emerging technologies, including autonomous vehicles, additive manufacturing, robotics, and ethane cracker and petrochemical development. The report documents a mismatch in the skill sets of residents in the region and the requirements for workers who will be in highest demand. Reading the report gives you a sense of the complexity of the issues at hand. But you also learn of the positive steps being taken by business, community, and civic leaders to address workforce development issues to ensure that Pittsburgh remains economically competitive in the future.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nLet me now turn to monetary policy. For some time now, the FOMC has been engaged in a strategy of gradually removing the high level of accommodation that was needed to address the Great Recession. This strategy is a balanced approach, reflecting the improvement in the economy over time and the progress that has been made on our longer-run monetary policy goals of maximum employment and price stability. In March, the FOMC raised the target range for the fed funds rate to 1-1/2 to 1 3/4 percent. I supported this increase, and if the economy evolves as I anticipate, I believe further increases in interest rates will be appropriate this year and next year.\n\nIn my view, a gradual upward path of interest rates will help sustain the expansion and balance the risks so that our monetary policy goals are met and maintained. We want to give inflation time to move back to goal, and I don't expect inflation to pick up sharply; this argues against a steep path. At the same time, the economy is slightly beyond maximum employment, and despite an increase in market volatility and longer-term interest rates since the start of the year, financial conditions are accommodative. It is appropriate to continue to remove some of the monetary policy accommodation to ensure we avoid a build-up in risks to macroeconomic stability that could arise if the economy were allowed to overheat. Recent research from the Cleveland Fed suggests that a strategy to overheat the economy in an attempt to pull more people back into the workforce is unlikely to have any lasting effect on labor force participation.5 Yet, overheating would have costs — it would necessitate sharper rate increases that could in themselves be destabilizing.\n\nA gradual upward path of interest rates should also help to avoid financial imbalances and a potential build-up of financial stability risks that could arise from the extended period of very low interest rates. Currently, in my assessment, financial stability vulnerabilities are at a moderate level. Leverage levels in the household, nonfinancial, and financial sectors are low to moderate, and vulnerabilities arising from the financial system's role in transforming the maturity of assets or funding long-term assets with short-term liabilities are moderate. But corporate bond yields relative to Treasury yields are quite low, and prices in the commercial real estate market continue to rise while capitalization rates, which measure operating income relative to the sale price of commercial properties, are at or near historical lows. These developments are worth watching.\n\nContinued gradual reduction in monetary policy accommodation, given the economic outlook, will put monetary policy in a better position to address whatever risks, whether to the upside or to the downside, are ultimately realized. The path policy actually takes will depend on how the economy actually evolves. If the upside risks to growth come to pass, we may need to steepen the path a bit; if inflation surprises on the downside, we may need to go a bit slower.\n\nSince last October, the FOMC has also been implementing its plan to normalize the Fed's balance sheet in terms of the size and composition of assets.6 To address the Great Recession, after the FOMC brought the fed funds rate down to effectively zero, it undertook several programs to purchase longer-term assets, including longer-maturity Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities. These purchases were undertaken to put further downward pressure on longer-term interest rates. We are now allowing maturing longer-term assets to roll off the balance sheet in a gradual and predictable way; this will take several years to complete.\n\nLonger-Run Issues\n\nI have been discussing the medium-run economic outlook and associated risks, but to conclude my talk, I'd like to address two interconnected longer-run issues facing the U.S. economy.\n\nA country's standard of living over the longer run depends on its longer-run growth rate, which, in turn, depends on the growth of the labor force and the growth of productivity, which measures how effectively the economy combines labor and capital to create output.\n\nBased on demographics, labor force growth is projected to be considerably slower than it has been in recent decades. In the 1970s, the labor force grew about 2 1/2 percent per year, on average, as baby boomers and women entered the workforce. But since then, labor force growth has slowed, rising at slightly more than 1/2 percent per year over 2010-2016, and it is expected to remain near that level over the next decade.7\n\nLabor productivity growth has also been slow during this expansion. Some of this is cyclical, but more persistent structural factors may also be at play.8 For example, the American spirit of innovation, entrepreneurship, ease of business entry and exit, and labor market flexibility have contributed to economic growth and well-being in the U.S. These factors of dynamism allow resources to be reallocated from less-productive to more-productive businesses and allow workers to move up the career ladder. But the level of dynamism has been declining for some time.\n\nThe combination of slow labor force growth and slow productivity growth suggests that the potential growth rate of the economy will be lower than it was in the past. My own estimate of output growth over the longer run is 2 percent, which is a lot slower than the 3 to 3-1/2 percent rate seen over the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nOf course, this is not a fait accompli. Investment in human capital, in the form of education and training, and investment in physical capital and infrastructure can improve outcomes. The recently adopted changes to the tax code may encourage such investment. Well-designed government policies can also help spur basic science, R&D, and innovation; make it easier for people to start up companies; and help to ease the transition for households, industries, and communities being negatively affected by globalization and technological change. A well-thought-out immigration policy that attracts labor to the U.S. is also a necessary ingredient to support longer-run growth.\n\nBut such policies need to be implemented as the country puts its longer-run fiscal situation on a sustainable path. Recently released projections by the Congressional Budget Office indicate that under current policy, the federal deficit as a share of GDP will be quite a bit higher 10 years from now, with the recent fiscal policy changes estimated to add $1.6 trillion to the cumulative deficit over the next 10 years.9 Because of the accumulating deficits, the ratio of federal debt held by the public to GDP is projected to rise from 78 percent at the end of this year to nearly 100 percent in 2028, the highest it has been since 1946. Note that the CBO estimates would be higher if the major provisions of the new tax and spending policies are extended instead of expiring as they do under current law.\n\nEver-rising government debt levels would mean a higher share of government spending going to interest payments. This would tend to crowd out productive investments by the private sector and the government, thereby lowering productivity and longer-run growth. Investors would demand a higher risk premium in order to hold U.S. government debt. With over 40 percent of publicly held U.S. Treasury debt held by foreigners, these interest payments need not be reinvested in the U.S. In addition, the sovereign debt crisis in Europe over 2009-2012 shows that high debt levels can pose severe problems if investors lose faith in the ability of governments to service their debts, generating spikes in what had previously been viewed as risk-free rates. Longer-run fiscal sustainability in the U.S. will depend on what combination of tax increases and spending controls are put in place to ensure that debt-to-GDP is on a downward path.\n\nAnd this brings me back to monetary policy. Unless the U.S. can get its longer-run fiscal situation in order, high debt levels will constrain using fiscal policy as a tool to buoy the economy in recessions. This will put more of the burden on monetary policy to stimulate the economy during downturns. But in a world with lower potential growth and lower equilibrium interest rates, monetary policy will also have less room to act. The zero lower bound on interest rates would be hit more often, and we would find ourselves having to rely more often on nonconventional policy tools like asset purchases.\n\nToday's healthy outlook for the U.S. economy over the medium run gives policymakers the opportunity to consider these longer-run issues, which the country will need to deal with in order to ensure a healthy economy in the future.\n\nBefore I overstay my welcome, let me end here and thank you for your attention. I look forward to your questions."

            "content": "I thank the organizers of this year's LEED program and Professor Fidelis Ikem, the dean of the College of Business, for inviting me to speak today. I am proud of the relationship that the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland is building with Central State University. It's great to be on campus today, where one feels a real sense of history. At the Federal Reserve, we are proud of the fact that while the first two attempts at central banks in the U.S. lasted only 20 years each, the Fed is in its 105th year. But Central State is even older. Founded in 1887, the university recently celebrated its 131st birthday. Central State's designation as a historically black college and its focus on providing a high-quality academic experience to all students are things to be proud of. They make this university a very good place for me to speak about the benefits of an education in economics and the importance of diversity in the field of economics. Before I continue, I should remind everyone that the views I'll present today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nWhy Study Economics\n\nI didn't start out to be an economist. I majored in mathematics at Barnard College but also pursued a second major in economics because it seemed interesting and didn't require much additional course work. I applied to graduate school in math but ended up in the economics Ph.D. program at Princeton because two professors there wrote me letters explaining that Princeton's economics program was very mathematical and encouraging me to come there and study economics. I've always thought that I lucked into economics. It has provided me with a fascinating career, and I hope that at least in a small way I've been able to provide some good in return through economic research and policymaking.\n\nMerriam-Webster defines economics as \"a social science concerned chiefly with description and analysis of the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services.\" Well, that's fine as far as it goes, but it sounds kind of dry. Others think of economics as a path to running a business or working in finance. That's also fine as far as it goes, but it is too limited a view. Instead, I like to think of economics as a social science that helps us think about how people use scarce resources, interact in markets or in other economic settings, respond to incentives, and make trade-offs. The fact that economics is a social science, one that involves people and their choices, makes economics complicated but also very interesting.\n\nBecause economics provides a rigorous way of thinking about trade-offs, incentives, and costs and benefits, it has many real-world applications. It can help a company be more profitable but it can also help policymakers formulate better public policies that affect people's lives. It can help us analyze the distribution of income across individuals, regions, and countries, and the causes for those differences. It can help us understand how a small financial shock might be propagated economy-wide or even globally, and what can be done to prevent such contagion. It can help us understand the issues facing people in or entering the workforce and provide evidence on which programs are most effective at helping them finance their education, develop new skills, and manage the changing job landscape driven by technological innovation. Economics can help us understand how people make financial decisions and how simple changes can result in better outcomes. For example, a simple change from making employees have to opt out of a company's savings plan, rather than opt in, can result in higher participation in the plan.1 One well-formulated study of a Fortune 500 company's 401(k) savings plan found that switching to automatic enrollment increased employee participation from 49 percent to 86 percent. It also found that employees' savings decisions tend to be inert, so the default contribution rate and fund allocation are important features to consider in designing such a plan.\n\nA default rule like this is an example of what behavioral economists call a nudge—something that isn't mandated but points people in the right direction and can change behavior.2 Richard Thaler, an economics professor at the University of Chicago, won a Nobel Prize last year for his foundational work in behavioral economics, which combines aspects of psychology with economics. In his Nobel Prize lunch lecture, he mentioned that good work is being done around the world to, and I quote: \"design and test scientifically informed policies that are working. People are being helped to save more for retirement, more poor kids—especially girls—are going to school, peasant farmers are retrieving more reliable harvests, and we are all being successfully nudged to use less energy.\"3 That passage lists just a few of the areas in which economics is having a real-world impact and doing some good. In the policy realm, economics helps guide decisions about the country's monetary and fiscal policies, but also policies on health care, education, and trade. It helps in the design and evaluation of programs at the local community level too, including workforce development and transportation policy. In a nutshell, I believe that economics helps society.\n\nI hope this piques your interest in studying economics. But if you need more convincing, you might want to know that economics offers a very good return on your education dollar. The ability to think critically, analyze a problem systematically, and deal with ambiguity are all skills developed through the study of economics and they are all skills highly valued in the job market. One recent study found that those with a bachelor's degree in economics earn about 20 percent more than graduates with degrees in other fields.4 Some of the salary differences reflect the fact that economics majors have access to a wide variety of occupations, many of which are higher-paying. You'll find people with economics degrees employed in many sectors, including education, accounting, law, business, finance, and government. The Federal Reserve System—the 12 Reserve Banks and the Board of Governors—employs about 700 Ph.D. economists and also many others with undergraduate and master's degrees in economics, and I can tell you from experience that the Fed is a very productive and fascinating place to work.\n\nThe State of Diversity in Economics\n\nThe good news is that economics is a popular major in U.S. colleges and universities. In 2016, U.S. postsecondary schools awarded about 33,500 bachelor's degrees in economics.5 While this represents less than 2 percent of all bachelor's degrees awarded by these schools, at the top 100 universities and top 100 liberal arts colleges without an undergraduate business major, about 10 to 20 percent of male undergraduates major in economics.6 That's a high number when you consider how many different majors there are. But despite its popularity, the field has had less success in attracting women or historically under-represented racial and ethnic minorities.7 While there has been some improvement compared to the 1970s, this under-representation has been going on for many years.\n\nUsing U.S. Department of Education data on four-year, non-profit colleges and universities over 2011-2015, Bayer and Wilcox found that while women earned more than half of all bachelor's degrees awarded across all fields, they earned less than a third of the bachelor's degrees in economics.8 And the numbers are lower for under-represented minorities, who earned slightly more than 20 percent of bachelor's degrees and about 11 percent of economics degrees awarded. If you think about this in terms of the share of female graduates who choose to major in economics and the share of male graduates who choose to major in economics, according to Bayer and Wilcox's numbers, there is one female economics major for every 100 female bachelor's degrees compared to about three male economics majors for every 100 male bachelor's degrees. That means women are choosing to major in economics at only a third of the rate of men.9 Similarly, minorities are choosing economics over other majors at only about half the rate of white students.\n\nWhile you don't need to have majored in economics to enter a Ph.D. program in economics, it is a natural path. So given the under-representation of women and minorities at the undergraduate level, it is probably not surprising they are also under-represented at the Ph.D. level and in academia. The good news is that representation of women among the ranks of academia, from first-year graduate student through full professor, is higher now than in 1970.10 The bad news is that progress has slowed. In 2017, females made up 32 percent of first-year grad students in economics compared to 30 percent in 1997. Almost a third of the new doctorates in 2017 were awarded to women, but gender diversity falls as one moves up the academic ranks. Women make up less than 30 percent of assistant professors, about 23 percent of tenured associates, and about 14 percent of full professors in economics. Unless there is a pickup in entry into graduate school, it is hard to see how these numbers can increase.\n\nAnalysis of minority representation in graduate economics is complicated a bit by the fact that almost 60 percent of doctorates awarded in economics are awarded to nonpermanent resident students. Some of these graduates return to their own countries, while others stay in the U.S. Restricting attention to U.S. citizens and permanent residents, of the 479 economics doctorates awarded in 2016, only 48, that is, 10 percent, were awarded to under-represented minorities: 15 were earned by African Americans and 33 by Hispanics or Latinos.11 In the academic professorial ranks, under-represented minorities make up less than 10 percent of assistant professors and less than 5 percent of full professors.\n\nThere has been some progress: the percentages of undergraduate and graduate degrees awarded to minorities have increased over the past two decades. But the rate of change has been slower than the growth of the minority population in the U.S. and slower than the growth of minority representation across all fields and in the STEM fields of science, technology, engineering, and math. Indeed, minorities earn a greater share of the degrees awarded in the STEM fields than they do in economics.12 Similarly, the representation of women in the STEM fields is also now higher than it is in economics.13\n\nWhy Isn't Economics Diverse and Why Does It Matter?\n\nAn interesting question is why women and minorities are under-represented in economics. One potential explanation is the lack of role models in the field. Seeing someone of the same race or gender being successful in a field can be validating, and having someone like you to run ideas by or get advice from can be very helpful. So, the relative lack of women and minorities in economics could be perpetuating under-representation. This is a plausible explanation but it may be only one piece of the puzzle, as the empirical evidence on role models is somewhat mixed.14 One study of a selective liberal arts college that essentially involved random assignment of students to instructors found that having an instructor of the same gender didn't increase the probability of a student taking more classes or majoring in the field, regardless of the gender distribution in the department, but it was associated with the student earning a higher grade in fields dominated by the opposite gender.15 That is, female students received higher average grades from female instructors when taking courses in fields dominated by men (such as economics)—the difference was on the order of moving from a B-minus to a B. And there was a similar effect for males, who received higher average grades from male instructors when taking courses in female-dominated fields (such as education). A separate study in a different setting found evidence that such grade differentials reflected achievement differentials and not just inflated grading.16 So the availability of role models appears to positively affect student achievement, but a lack of role models isn't the whole story about why some students choose not to continue in economics.\n\nWhat about different preferences at the time students enroll? It is true that males are more likely than females to list economics as their planned major when accepted at college. But this gender difference for incoming students is not the full story because research that looks at the progression of students through the major has found that female students are relatively more likely to drop out of the major and switch to another field compared to male students. For example, one study found that women need to do well in their principles of economics course in order to continue in the major, and that's less true of men.17\n\nOther hypotheses have to do with the way economics is taught or with the content of the courses. Do large lecture classes, often found in introductory economics programs at large universities, turn off women and minorities more than men? Do the topics incorporated into the intro courses appeal to one group and not another? And, if so, how could the content be amended so that all students, regardless of race, ethnicity, or gender, feel included and take up the opportunity to be an economics major? Could it be that implicit biases come to play at each stage of the academic ladder, as has been shown in other types of settings?\n\nAs a college math major, I am happy to say that the theory that women may be more turned off by the heavy mathematical content in economics does not pan out. In fact, women earn over 40 percent of bachelor's degrees in math and statistics, a higher share than in economics;18 women do well in math at the high school level; women are selecting other fields that are very quantitative, like psychology; and studies indicate that math aptitude doesn't explain gender differences in participation in upper-level economics courses.19\n\nSo there are several different theories being explored, and I suspect that, at the end of the day, there are multiple drivers of the under-representation of women and minorities in the field of economics. But you might ask: why should we care? Shouldn't students be able to choose their field of study and career path? The low level of diversity in economics may just reflect people's preferences. That's a possibility, but if that's the case, then it is incumbent upon those of us in the field and upon educators to ensure that students can make informed choices and that they understand the value of an economics degree to the individual and to society.\n\nMoreover, because economics is a field that influences policy, and policy affects all kinds of people, it's important to have diverse views inform that policy. As a public servant and Fed policymaker, I believe that policymakers need to consider the effects of our monetary, regulatory, and payments policies on all our constituents. In addition, I have seen firsthand how having a diversity of views expressed and discussed around the table can actually lead to better policy decisions, and there is actual research to back this up. Group dynamics are different when teams are diverse. Participants don't necessarily find it as comfortable to serve on a diverse team, but the diversity helps to avoid group-think. Diverse teams tend to be more objective and focus on the facts when making decisions; they may process information more carefully because they are forced to confront a different way of thinking and convince those with alternative views; and firms with more diversity tend to be more innovative.20 Research also shows that firms with diverse management tend to have above-average earnings21 Perhaps the better decision-making and innovation associated with diversity is showing up on the bottom line.\n\nBeyond current policy and business outcomes, another reason I'd like to see more diversity in the field of economics is so the field itself doesn't get stymied by group-think. To expand our knowledge, economics needs to continually take on new research questions and develop innovative techniques and ways of analysis to arrive at answers to these questions. Broader representation in economics means a broader set of issues will be tackled and a broader set of research disseminated, resulting in better policy outcomes that will improve the economic well being of a greater share of the population.\n\nSome Things Are Being Done\n\nThe American Economic Association, through its Committees on the Status of Women and the Status of Minority Groups in the Economics Profession, is taking a close look at diversity in the economics profession and is offering programs and resources aimed at increasing diversity at all levels. The association provides information to students who want to pursue careers or a graduate degree in economics, and also provides lesson plans to teachers. It offers a summer training and scholarship program to help prepare students for graduate school and, with the National Science Foundation, offers a Summer Economics Fellows Program, which is designed to increase the participation and advancement of women and under-represented minorities in economics.\n\nI serve on the board of the Council for Economic Education. This nonprofit organization's mission is to educate students in kindergarten through high school about economics and personal finance so they can make better decisions for themselves, their families, and their communities. The council provides many materials to teachers and also runs the National Economics Challenge, a quiz bowl competition, which reaches a wide population of students in terms of gender, race, and income. Last year, over 11,000 high school students participated in the challenge; of these, 42 percent were girls and 22 percent were under-represented minorities, and participation from these groups has been increasing over time. A recent survey found that participants' performance on advanced placement exams exceeds the national average, with especially strong gains shown by female and minority students, and that participants are more likely than nonparticipants to choose to major in economics.\n\nAt the Cleveland Fed, we strive for excellence in all that we do. And that means we are taking actions to foster a culture that champions diversity, inclusion, and opportunity throughout the organization. To increase our ability to recruit high-quality talent in a variety of positions, including banking, computer programming, data science, accounting, as well as economics, we are developing relationships with schools in our District, including Central State. Last June, we hosted a number of Central State students and several faculty members as part of your school's eight-week summer Banking Institute program, and we will host another group of CSU students again next month. You may have attended one of the guest lectures that some of our economists have given in your economics and business classes, and representatives are here today to tell you about paid internships and other employment opportunities at the Cleveland Fed. As a contribution to strengthening the pipeline of future economists, the Cleveland Fed will be hosting a workshop this summer for the research assistants across the Federal Reserve System to help them prepare for graduate school. The Cleveland Fed has also been promoting pre- and post-college education. Our Learning Center distributes lesson plans on economics and financial literacy to teachers in kindergarten through high school, and our Money Museum, which is open to the public, offers interactive exhibits on the financial system and the economy. These may be small steps, but economics can help solve many real-world problems while providing individuals with a rewarding career, and we want to ensure that the widest group of people enter the field.\n\nConclusion\n\nFifty years ago today, this country lost a great leader, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The tragedy of his death must not overshadow his many accomplishments and the lessons conveyed by his words and deeds. As I've discussed, there has been some progress over the past 50 years in increasing diversity, inclusiveness, and opportunity within the economics profession, but that progress has been slow. It is easy to get discouraged and accept the status quo. But we all must remember a key lesson from Dr. King's legacy: changing institutions is hard work and takes time. It must be met by perseverance and endurance. As a member of the economics profession, I will continue to seek ways to increase diversity, inclusion, and opportunity because I believe it will strengthen economic research and policymaking, and thereby help promote a healthier economy for a wider group of people. I encourage the students of Central State University to enter the field of economics and to join me in that mission."

            "content": "I thank the organizers at the Julis-Rabinowitz Center for inviting me to speak today. It's nice to be back at Princeton. Walking up from the Dinky station, I was impressed by the changes on campus, including several new buildings since my days here as a graduate student. But one thing hasn't changed, and that's the sense of energy and inquisitiveness among the people on campus. Although it has been several years since I graduated, I use the knowledge I gained at Princeton every day in my role at the Federal Reserve.\n\nToday, I'll discuss my views on the outlook for the economy and monetary policy and make a few remarks on two future issues for the monetary policy agenda. I believe it's important for Fed policymakers to explain the rationale for their policy decisions to the public, so I am looking forward to taking your questions after my remarks. Before I continue, I should remind everyone that the views I'll present today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Economy\n\nAt its meeting last week, the Federal Open Market Committee, the monetary policymaking body within the Fed, decided to raise the target range of the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, to 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent. This rate increase is consistent with the healthy outlook for the economy, and the achieved and expected progress on our monetary policy goals of maximum employment and price stability.\n\nThis year is shaping up to be another good year for the economy, and the task before monetary policymakers is to calibrate policy to this healthy economy so that the expansion is sustained. Given the economy's strength, we don't want to get behind the curve, but we also don't want to overreact to the positive outlook and potentially curtail the expansion. This takes some careful balancing, and in my view, last week's decision on rates reflects this type of balanced approach to achieving and maintaining our policy goals.\n\nLast year, economic growth picked up to 2-1/2 percent, and I expect growth to be a bit above that pace this year and next. This is an improvement from the average 2 percent pace over prior years of the expansion. In addition, growth is now more balanced across sectors. Business investment accelerated last year. Nonresidential investment grew at a pace of about 6 percent last year, compared to an anemic pace of less than 1 percent in 2015 and 2016. You may recall that oil prices fell sharply from mid-2014 through early 2016, and this led to a sharp pullback in the drilling and mining sectors and their suppliers. The drop in oil prices was coupled with a greater than 20 percent appreciation in the value of the dollar, which hurt manufacturers and other firms dependent on exports. Those conditions are now reversing. Last year, oil prices rose and the dollar depreciated as the economies of our trading partners began to strengthen.\n\nIndeed, for the first time in many years, economic activity around the world is picking up and forecasts for global growth are being revised up. This should have a positive feedback effect on the U.S. economy via exports. However, the tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and the recent announcement of planned tariffs on certain goods imported from China, as well as the ongoing renegotiations of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), add uncertainty to the trade picture. This uncertainty may not be resolved quickly. Assessing the impact on the U.S. macroeconomy will ultimately depend on how other countries react, including whether they impose their own tariffs or other trade barriers in response. I am monitoring trade developments, and while I see them as a risk to the forecast, at this point they have not led me to change my outlook for the overall economy.\n\nBusiness sentiment remains high and firms will gain from the tax changes passed in December. The recently passed federal budget and spending appropriation bills will add further fiscal stimulus in the form of increased federal spending. At this point, it is difficult to be precise about the magnitude and timing of the effect of these fiscal policy changes on output growth. I'm estimating they will add an additional 1/2 percentage point of annual growth over the next couple of years, but there is some upside risk that the effect could be larger. I expect to have a better read on the timing of the federal spending and on how households and firms are actually responding to the tax changes over the next several months.\n\nLower tax rates and full expensing for investment in equipment and intangibles should spur additional business spending to meet higher near-term demand. In a staff survey of firms in the Cleveland Fed District, over a third of the firms expecting tax savings this year said they planned to use some of the proceeds to increase investment. Smaller percentages of respondents said they planned to buy back shares of their stock, increase dividends, or pay down debt with their tax gains. About a third of the surveyed firms in the District said they planned to share some of their tax savings with employees in the form of increased wages, bonuses, or additions to employee pension plans. And some firms in the District and elsewhere in the nation have already done so.\n\nThis adds a positive element to an already healthy outlook for consumer spending, which makes up over two-thirds of output. Personal incomes are growing because labor market conditions are strong. Lower personal tax rates and higher standard deductions should spur some additional household spending in the aggregate, although the impact of tax changes on individual households will depend on the level and sources of their income. Household balance sheets are in much better shape since the Great Recession, reflecting a combination of deleveraging and increased savings. While there has been a marked increase in market volatility since the start of the year, equity prices are higher than they were a year ago.\n\nA moderately paced recovery in the housing sector continues, despite the increase in mortgage rates. Housing equity held by households is now above its peak before the housing crash. Overall, I expect activity in the housing sector to continue to expand at a sustainable pace.\n\nThe labor market is strong and I expect that strength to continue. Payroll jobs rose by more than 300,000 in February, following an increase of more than 200,000 in January. These job numbers are a pickup from last year's already strong pace of 180,000 jobs per month. Most economists put trend job growth somewhere in the range of 75,000 to 120,000 jobs per month. The variation depends on what one assumes about labor force participation. Based on demographic factors, including the aging of the population, the longer-run trend in participation is downward sloping. But the labor force participation rate has been fairly stable over the past two years, and last month we saw a rise in the participation rate, including that of prime-age males. Indeed, the participation rate of men aged 45 to 54 has shown a notable increase of nearly 1.5 percentage points over the past year.\n\nIncreased participation helps ease some of the tightness we are seeing in the labor supply. As both national and regional labor markets have tightened, our contacts have been reporting for some time that they are having trouble finding qualified workers. These reports are now coming from a wide range of firms across different sectors and cover both higher-skill and lower-skill occupations. The unemployment rate, at 4.1 percent, is low by historical standards. It's below its lowest point during the last expansion and below the range most economists associate with full employment.\n\nOf course, it's difficult to say with any precision how tight labor markets are. Usually we associate tight labor markets with rising wages. The official statistics indicate that compensation growth has moved up, from under 2 percent earlier in the expansion to over 2-1/2 percent more recently. And increasingly, firms are telling us that they are responding to labor shortages by offering higher wages and benefits to attract and retain workers. But so far wage growth hasn't been as strong as one might normally expect from tight labor markets. One partial explanation for this is the low level of productivity growth. Over the longer run, wages, adjusted for inflation, tend to reflect the marginal product of workers. During this expansion, labor productivity growth has been on the order of only 1 percent.1 This is less than half the pace over the prior two expansions. Last year we saw somewhat stronger growth in productivity than we saw earlier in the expansion. It is too soon to tell whether this rise will be sustained; however, the welcome pickup we are seeing in investment should help to promote productivity growth as the expansion continues, and this should help buoy wage growth.\n\nThe movements in labor force participation, combined with the fact that wage and price inflation have remained moderate even as labor markets continue to strengthen, suggest that labor market conditions may not be as tight as I had been assuming. So I recently moved my own estimate of the longer-run unemployment rate down by 1/4 percentage point, to 4-1/2 percent. I expect the unemployment rate to move below 4 percent this year and to remain below 4 percent next year. Overall, my assessment remains that from the standpoint of the cyclical conditions monetary policy can address, we are slightly beyond the maximum employment part of the Fed's monetary policy mandate.\n\nThe other part of the Fed's mandate is price stability. The FOMC has set a symmetric goal of 2 percent inflation, as measured by the year-over-year change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, that is, PCE inflation. \"Symmetric\" means that the 2 percent inflation goal isn't a ceiling; the FOMC would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or persistently below this goal and such persistent deviations warrant a policy response.2 But inflation measures can vary from month to month because of idiosyncratic factors and in response to temporary economic and financial disturbances. Sometimes inflation will be above and sometimes it will be below 2 percent. While monetary policy's control of inflation isn't precise enough to keep inflation at 2 percent at each point in time, averaging through temporary fluctuations, we aim for inflation to be 2 percent because the FOMC believes that this rate is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve's statutory mandate.\n\nGetting inflation back to this goal has been somewhat of a challenge. PCE inflation fell to very low levels in 2015, when inflation was held down by falling oil and import prices. Since then it has moved back up, even temporarily exceeding 2 percent early last year, until it moved back below 2 percent in the middle of last year partly due to special factors, like the drop in the prices of prescription drugs and cell phone service plans. Since then, inflation has picked up and several of our business contacts have reported that they now have more pricing power and have been able to pass along some of their cost increases to customers.\n\nPCE inflation has risen to about 1.7 percent, not quite at our goal. In the near term, we will likely see some higher inflation readings as the sharp price declines of last March drop out of the year-over-year measures. But just as we didn't overreact to weaker inflation readings last summer or to stronger inflation readings at the beginning of last year, we shouldn't overreact to these increases either. Mild temporary over- or under-runs of inflation should not be cause for concern. Instead, we need to remain focused on the medium-run outlook for inflation.\n\nMy outlook is that inflation will gradually move up to 2 percent on a sustainable basis over the next one to two years. This forecast reflects my expectation that the economy will continue to grow above trend and the demand for labor will continue to strengthen. Stable inflation expectations are another important component of this forecast because inflation expectations help to anchor actual inflation rates. We already saw how valuable stable inflation expectations were during the Great Recession. At that time, the deep pullback in activity and collapse in demand could have led to deflation — not just low inflation rates but a declining overall price level. This would have made the economy even worse by making demand even weaker than it was and raising debt burdens in real terms. But deflationary conditions did not develop because policy responses helped to maintain people's expectations that prices would remain stable over the longer run and that inflation would eventually return to goal.\n\nOne of the risks of having inflation under-run the 2 percent goal for so long is that inflation expectations could have become unanchored. That didn't happen. Now, as inflation firms, it is equally important that monetary policymakers continue to convey through policy communications and decisions our commitment to achieving our dual mandate goals.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nThe recent policy action to increase the target range for the fed funds rate to 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent is consistent with this commitment and continues the process to gradually increase interest rates as the economy has continued to make progress on our monetary policy goals. I supported the increase in the fed funds rate last week and, if the economy evolves as I anticipate, I believe further gradual increases in interest rates will be appropriate this year and next year. In my view a gradual upward path of interest rates will help sustain the expansion and balance the risks so that our longer-run goals of price stability and maximum employment are met and maintained. We want to give inflation time to move back to goal; this argues against a steep path. At the same time, the economy is slightly beyond maximum employment, and despite an increase in market volatility and longer-term interest rates since the start of the year, financial conditions are accommodative. It seems appropriate to remove some of the monetary policy accommodation to ensure we avoid a build-up in risks to macroeconomic stability that could arise if the economy were allowed to overheat. In addition, a gradual upward path of interest rates should help avoid financial imbalances and a potential build-up of financial stability risks that could arise from the extended period of very low interest rates. And it puts monetary policy in a better position to address whatever risks, whether to the upside or to the downside, are ultimately realized.\n\nThe gradual upward path of interest rates is consistent with the median path across the projections submitted by FOMC participants at last week's meeting. The median path of appropriate policy in those projections has the fed funds rate gradually rising to between 2 and 2-1/4 percent by the end of this year, with further gradual increases over the next two years should the economy evolve as anticipated. Compared to the December projections, the FOMC's median path over next year and the following year has steepened a bit, reflecting the policymakers' views that the medium-run outlook has strengthened, with somewhat stronger output growth and a lower unemployment rate. The change in the median path is an excellent illustration of how our views of appropriate policy are related to the economic outlook. Policymakers don't react to any small change in the data, but if incoming information suggests a change in our medium-run forecast, our projected appropriate policy path can change. The FOMC projections give a sense of the participants' current views on appropriate policy given their current outlook. But the path policy actually takes will depend on how the economy actually evolves and the implications of incoming information for the medium-run outlook and risks around the outlook. If the upside risks to growth come to pass, we may need to steepen the path a bit; if inflation surprises on the downside, we may need to go a bit slower.\n\nI've been discussing the fed funds rate because changing its target range is the main way to adjust the stance of policy during normal times. But during extraordinary times, other tools are needed. To address the Great Recession, the FOMC brought the fed funds rate down to effectively zero, and then to put further downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, it undertook several programs to purchase longer-term assets, including longer-maturity Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS). As a result of the purchases, the Fed's balance sheet grew, from nearly $900 billion in assets in 2007, or 6 percent of nominal GDP, to about $4.4 trillion today, or 23 percent of nominal GDP. The balance sheet's composition changed from mainly short-term Treasuries to longer-maturity Treasuries and agency MBS.\n\nLast October, the FOMC began implementing its plan to normalize the Fed's balance sheet in terms of the size and composition of assets.3 Maturing Treasuries and principal payments of agency MBS and agency debt are allowed to gradually roll off the balance sheet up to a monthly cap, with the caps rising over time. The gradual, predictable decline in assets, which will take several years to complete, allows balance-sheet normalization to run in the background and monetary policy to focus on setting the appropriate level of the fed funds rate, our conventional monetary policy tool.\n\nFuture Considerations for the Monetary Policy Agenda: Operating Framework and Monetary Policy Framework\n\nI'd like to end my talk by briefly touching on two future monetary policy considerations: the operating framework that the FOMC uses to ensure that its policy rate is being maintained at the appropriate level, and the monetary policy framework that the FOMC uses to determine what that appropriate level of the policy rate is to promote our longer-run monetary policy goals.4\n\nYou may have noticed that I didn't tell you how large the Fed's balance sheet will be once we complete normalization. We do know the balance sheet will be larger than it was prior to the financial crisis for the simple reason that the public's demand for currency is rising over time. But the balance sheet will also likely be considerably smaller than it is today. Just how much smaller depends on how the FOMC implements monetary policy in the future.5 Before the crisis, the FOMC kept the supply of bank reserves scarce. The FOMC could make small changes in that supply by buying or selling short-term Treasuries, and this allowed the FOMC to ensure that the market-clearing interest rate at which banks lend reserves to each other overnight, the fed funds rate, was maintained at the FOMC's target.\n\nBut now, as a result of the Fed's large-scale asset purchases, reserves are very abundant: indeed, banks are holding around $2.2 trillion in reserves in accounts at the Fed, and about $2 trillion of this amount is in excess of what is required by regulation. At these levels, small changes in the supply of reserves have little effect on the fed funds rate. Instead, the Fed brings the fed funds rate into its target range by adjusting the rate it pays on excess reserves.\n\nEach of these operating frameworks has its strengths, and as balance-sheet normalization progresses, the FOMC will need to decide which operating framework it will use going forward.\n\nAnother consideration for the FOMC is the framework it uses to determine appropriate monetary policy. Currently, we use a flexible inflation-targeting framework. This framework recognizes that, over the longer run, monetary policy can influence only inflation and not the underlying real structural aspects of the economy such as the natural rate of unemployment or maximum employment, but that monetary policy can be used to help offset shorter-run fluctuations in employment from maximum employment. I believe this framework has served the FOMC well and has been effective in promoting our policy goals. It has been the choice of many central banks around the globe.\n\nNevertheless, it is legitimate to ask whether any changes in our monetary policy framework would be helpful in maintaining macroeconomic stability. First, as a matter of good governance, a central bank should periodically review its assumptions, methods, and models.6 Second, based on demographics, higher demand for safe assets, and other factors, many economists anticipate that the longer-term equilibrium real interest rate will remain lower than in past decades. If so, then compared to the past, there would be less room for monetary policymakers to cushion against a negative economic shock, the probability of the policy rate hitting the zero lower bound would be higher, and nontraditional monetary policy tools would need to be used more often. To the extent that these tools are less effective than the traditional interest rate tool or are constrained from being used, the potential would be for longer recessions and longer bouts of low inflation.7\n\nTo help mitigate this issue, researchers have suggested several alternative frameworks, such as targeting an inflation rate higher than 2 percent, or instead of targeting inflation, targeting a path for the price level or for nominal GDP. The positives and negatives of these and other frameworks would need to be thoroughly reviewed. Such reviews take considerable time and so it may be appropriate for the FOMC to commence a framework assessment later this year.\n\nI am open-minded on the outcome, but at the same time, I think the bar should be high for adopting a new framework. The current framework has been largely successful, there is little experience with alternative frameworks here or abroad, and since we are not starting from scratch, transition costs would need to be considered. Even if the FOMC concludes it is best not to adopt a new framework, the review will help determine if improvements to the current framework could make it even more effective at achieving our monetary policy goals, given the current and future economic environment.\n\nNow, paraphrasing French mathematician Blaise Pascal, if I had had more time, I would have written a shorter speech. Before we run out of time for questions, I'd like to end here and thank you for your attention."

            "content": "I will focus my brief remarks on the FOMC's monetary policy framework for determining the appropriate policy to promote our longer-run monetary policy goals.1 The views I'll present are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nRecently, some economists and policymakers have recommended that the FOMC evaluate its monetary policy framework. Indeed, a careful reader of the January FOMC minutes, released earlier this week, might have noticed that a few participants suggested such an examination.2 The FOMC has not indicated whether or not it will undertake such a review. But let me provide my own thoughts on the rationale for undertaking an assessment, what it might cover, and the timing, that is, the why, what, and when of a review. I'll also briefly discuss some alternative frameworks that should be part of the assessment. But first, some background.\n\nFlexible Inflation Targeting\n\nThe Fed's longer-run monetary policy goals are price stability and maximum employment. Congress specified these goals but gave the Fed considerable independence in choosing the framework used to achieve these goals. The FOMC currently uses a flexible inflation-targeting framework. This framework recognizes that, over the longer run, monetary policy can influence only inflation and not the underlying real structural aspects of the economy such as the natural rate of unemployment or maximum employment, but that monetary policy can be used to help offset shorter-run fluctuations in employment from maximum employment.\n\nThe framework is briefly described in the FOMC's statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy.3 This statement was initially released in January 2012 when the FOMC adopted an explicit numerical inflation goal. This is a symmetric goal of 2 percent, as measured by the year-over-year change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE inflation. \"Symmetric\" means that the 2 percent inflation goal is not a ceiling. The inflation measures will vary from month to month, sometimes above and sometimes below 2 percent, but we aim to keep inflation at 2 percent on average over the longer run.\n\nWhy Review the Framework?\n\nThe flexible inflation-targeting framework has served the FOMC well and has been effective in promoting our monetary policy goals. So why review the framework? There are a couple of reasons. First, as a matter of good governance, it behooves the Fed to conduct periodic reviews of its assumptions, methods, and models. This is the way the FOMC has operated for some time. For example, as indicated in the minutes, the January FOMC meeting included staff briefings and a discussion of inflation analysis and forecasting models.4 It is a standard best practice for a central bank to assess its performance.5\n\nAnother reason for the FOMC to review its framework derives from the experience of the Great Recession and its aftermath. To fight disinflationary pressures and economic contraction, the policy rate was brought to effectively zero, where it remained for seven years, and unconventional tools, including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, were used. Although the recovery was slow in coming, the economic expansion is now firmly in place, labor markets are strong, and inflation is expected to return to 2 percent on a sustained basis over the next couple of years. Nonetheless, the post-crisis economic environment is expected to differ in some important ways from the pre-crisis world.\n\nThe expected slowdown in population growth and labor force participation rates due to changes in demographics will weigh on long-run economic growth, the natural rate of unemployment, and the longer-term equilibrium interest rate.6,7 Real interest rates may potentially remain lower than in past decades. If so, then compared to the past, there would be less room for monetary policymakers to cushion against a negative economic shock, the probability of the policy rate hitting the zero lower bound would be higher, and nontraditional monetary policy tools would need to be used more often. To the extent that these tools are less effective than the traditional interest rate tool or are constrained from being used, the potential would be for longer recessions and longer bouts of low inflation. This raises the legitimate question of whether any changes in our monetary policy framework would be helpful in maintaining macroeconomic stability in this environment.8\n\nWhat Should a Review Cover?\n\nWe cannot know whether the FOMC would have been even more successful had it used a different monetary policy framework in the times leading up to and following the financial crisis. But that's the wrong question. The review should focus on evaluating whether changing the framework could make monetary policy even more effective given the current and future economic environment.\n\nI remain open-minded on this. At the same time, a change from flexible inflation targeting shouldn't be decided cavalierly. There is little experience with alternative frameworks because the central banks of most advanced economies like the U.S. have used some form of inflation targeting. In my view, the success of the current framework, coupled with the lack of empirical evidence on alternatives, means that the bar should be high for changing to a new framework. It is important to recognize that any framework will have positives and negatives and we are not starting from scratch, there is a framework in place, so transition costs need to be considered.\n\nTwo important parts of any framework are communication and credibility. The FOMC has been on a journey over the past couple of decades to make our monetary policy more transparent to the public and Chairman Powell has emphasized that the FOMC will continue on this journey.9 When the public has a better understanding of the goals and rationale for monetary policy decisions, they are better able to hold policymakers accountable for their actions. But effective communication also makes monetary policy itself more effective by providing the public with information about the economic outlook and aligning the public's expectations about future policy actions. Thus, an important aspect of any framework is how well it communicates monetary policy to businesses and households that are making economic decisions. If the framework is not well understood, its benefits cannot be captured.\n\nAnother important aspect of any monetary policy framework is its credibility. Is the framework credible to the public so that they will formulate expectations about future policy based on the framework? Is it a framework that future Committees will stick with? Of course, one determinant of a framework's credibility is its effectiveness in achieving monetary policy goals. So effectiveness, communication, and credibility, and the interactions among these three need to be part of assessing the framework\n\nWhen Should a Review Commence?\n\nAfter coming through the financial crisis and Great Recession, the economy has returned to normal and monetary policy, including the policy rate and the balance sheet, is normalizing. The smooth transition to new Fed leadership is also underway. Nothing is broken and a return to a normal economy and normal policymaking gives us an opportunity to look at some longer-run issues. This suggests to me that it may be appropriate later this year to begin an assessment of our current monetary policy framework and alternatives. Such reviews take time and should be thorough. As I mentioned, the FOMC adopted its numerical inflation goal in January 2012, but this came after years of study and discussion going back to at least May 1996, with subsequent discussions in 2005, 2009, and 2011. Even if the FOMC concludes that it is best to stay with its current framework, the review will have served the Committee well and may indicate some ways we can further improve our monetary policy transparency and communication.\n\nSome Alternative Frameworks\n\nI will end my remarks by briefly noting some alternative frameworks that could be assessed as part of a review. I will not have time to discuss their strengths and weaknesses at length, but I can give you a flavor.10\n\nOne alternative is to keep the flexible inflation-targeting framework but set a higher longer-run inflation target, say, 4 percent instead of 2 percent.11 This would be a familiar arrangement but give the nominal rate more of a cushion from hitting the zero lower bound for any given negative shock. But does the gain from more likely avoiding the zero lower bound when a negative shock hits outweigh the costs of running a higher level of inflation at all times? Will it be easy to raise inflation expectations after having successfully anchored them at 2 percent? Is 4 percent inflation seen as consistent with price stability? These questions will need to be answered.\n\nPrice-level targeting and nominal GDP targeting involve targeting a path for the nominal level rather than a growth rate. Unlike inflation targeting, which lets bygones-be-bygones, these level-targeting frameworks make up for past deviations from the path.12 For example, when inflation has been running low, price-level targeting builds in a form of forward commitment to higher inflation in the future and a \"low for longer\" interest rate strategy. In theory, this can move current inflation expectations up, buoying current inflation and limiting the time the economy spends at the zero lower bound.13 There is little international experience with these frameworks and there are measurement issues to contend with: the starting point for the path matters, data revisions would be more serious because these frameworks do not let bygones-be-bygones, and to know what inflation will be along the nominal GDP path, one needs a reliable estimate of potential real output growth.14,15 There are also credibility issues. Is it credible that policymakers will keep interest rates low to make up for past shortfalls even when demand is growing strongly or that they will tighten policy when demand is weak after a supply shock has raised the price level?\n\nFormer Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has suggested a temporary price-level-targeting framework, which involves targeting inflation in normal times but switching to price-level targeting once the policy rate has fallen to the zero lower bound.16 Policymakers would revert to inflation targeting and begin to raise interest rates once the cumulative inflation rate from the time the zero lower bound was hit had risen sustainably back to target. This framework might be easy to communicate because it could be discussed solely in terms of the inflation goal; however, determining and communicating the timing of when to switch back to the inflation-targeting regime could be complex.\n\nSummary\n\nA review of monetary policy frameworks should consider these alternatives, as well as others. The goal would be to assess which framework would make monetary policy the most effective at achieving its goals, given the current and future economic environment, and whether any changes to the current framework could enhance monetary policy communications, credibility, and transparency."

            "content": "I thank the Dayton Area Chamber of Commerce for inviting me to speak at today's breakfast. Yesterday I had the opportunity to meet with several community organizations and to tour several Dayton neighborhoods. As I'm sure you know, we analyze a lot of data at the Fed. But augmenting the economic and financial statistics by getting out and about in the Fourth District gives me a better sense of what is happening in the economy in real time. Nothing provides a more powerful reminder that Federal Reserve policy affects real people and local communities. They say that all politics is local. In a sense, monetary policy is, too. Although we set a national monetary policy, the local information we gather from contacts around the country allows those policy decisions to take into account the diversity of the American economy and its people. The Fed's regional structure, with 12 Reserve Banks distributed across the country, overseen by the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., supports us in this work. The information we get in the field helps us evaluate economic developments, formulate an outlook, and ultimately make better policy decisions.\n\nToday, I will provide my assessment of economic developments, and my outlook for the economy and monetary policy. As always, the views I'll present today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Economy\n\nLet me start with an issue that is on everybody's mind: what's going on in financial markets? The past week or so has been a roller coaster ride of ups and downs in the stock market, with a sudden increase in volatility. Longer-term bond rates have also moved up. It's helpful to put this into perspective. Equity markets had generally been on a sizable upswing over the past year, with the S&P 500 index up 19 percent in 2017, amidst extremely low volatility. While some commentators thought that the low level of interest rates and high earnings prospects supported high stock market valuations, others thought that equity prices had begun to outpace earnings, that bond yields were too low given the economic outlook, and that a correction was waiting to happen, it was just a matter of time. Of course, it is investors, not commentators, who determine prices and yields. Even with the recent movements, as of Friday, the S&P 500 index is still significantly higher than it was a year ago. Bond yields are at levels seen at the start of 2014.\n\nWhenever there are such big swings in the market, we need to assess their implications. In the near term, we look at whether the market swing is accompanied by disorderly trading, a lack of liquidity, or contagion to other markets. We have not seen this: trading has been relatively orderly, markets have remained generally liquid, and there hasn't been a pullback in credit. We also assess whether there are spillovers to the broader economy that could affect the medium-run economic outlook. While a deeper and more persistent drop in equity markets could dash confidence and lead to a pullback in risk-taking and spending, the movements we have seen are far away from this scenario. I'll continue to monitor financial market developments closely, but for now, I expect the economy will work through this episode of market turbulence and I have not changed my outlook. In my view, the underlying fundamentals supporting the economy are very sound.\n\nFinancial conditions remain accommodative. Household and business balance sheets are healthy and incomes are growing. We've also seen improvement in the economies of many of our trading partners, which helps U.S. export growth. Monetary policy is accommodative and the changes in tax policy will also have a positive effect on growth this year and next.\n\nThe economic expansion is now in its ninth year, and I expect 2018 will be another good year for the economy, with growth around 2-1/2 percent, which is stronger than my 2 percent estimate of trend growth. I anticipate that the tax package will add about 1/4 to 1/2 percentage point to annual growth over the next couple of years, but based on the positive reactions so far, there's an upside risk that the effect could be larger. Labor markets have been strong, and I expect that strength to continue, with above-trend employment growth continuing and the unemployment rate falling below 4 percent. Inflation has been running under 2 percent, but I expect it to gradually move up to our goal of 2 percent over the next one to two years.\n\nThe task before Fed policymakers is to calibrate monetary policy to this healthy economy so that our congressionally mandated long-run goals of maximum employment and price stability are met. This means making sure we don't get behind the curve given the economy's strength but also making sure we don't overreact to the positive outlook. To my mind, that means if economic conditions evolve as expected, we'll need to make some further increases in interest rates this year and next year, at a pace similar to last year's. I think this gradual approach is the best strategy for sustaining the expansion and balancing the risks to our dual-mandate goals.\n\nThat's a summary of my outlook, which is informed by economic information, so let's review some of that now.\n\nLast year, economic growth picked up to 2-1/2 percent from a moderate annual pace of about 2 percent over the prior years of the expansion. Consumer spending, which makes up over two-thirds of output, showed strength last year and my outlook is that it will remain healthy. Personal incomes are growing because labor market conditions are strong. In addition, household balance sheets are in much better shape since the Great Recession, reflecting a combination of deleveraging and increased savings. Even after the recent downturn in stock prices, increases in stock prices and house prices over the past year have contributed to a rise in household wealth in the aggregate. In fact, the housing equity held by households is now above its peak before the housing crash.\n\nThe recovery in housing took some time to gain traction. Buyers, sellers, developers, and bankers were all wary about re-entering the market because of the fallout from the housing bust. But low interest rates and the improved financial condition of households and lenders have led to increased construction and sales. Overall, I expect activity in the housing sector to continue to expand at a sustainable pace.\n\nThe pickup in business investment last year was a welcome development. Investment was weak in 2015 and 2016, as the sharp drop in oil prices and the strengthening of the dollar weighed on the energy and manufacturing sectors. Last year, conditions improved: oil prices rose and the dollar depreciated as the economies of our trading partners began to strengthen. For the first time in many years, growth around the world is picking up and forecasts for global growth are being revised up. This has a positive feedback effect on the U.S. economy via exports. In the U.S., business sentiment is high, our business contacts are reporting increasing demand, and national and regional surveys show rising levels of activity and orders in the manufacturing and service sectors.\n\nThe labor market is strong and I expect that strength to continue. Last year, the economy added over 2 million jobs, about 180 thousand per month. In January, payroll jobs rose by 200 thousand. This pace of job growth is well above trend, which most estimates put in the range of 75,000 to 120,000 jobs per month. The unemployment rate is now 4.1 percent. This is seven-tenths of a percentage point lower than it was a year ago and below its lowest point during the last expansion. It is well below the range most economists associate with full employment, including my own estimate of 4-3/4 percent. Other indicators, including broader measures of unemployment, the job openings rate, and the job turnover rate, show that the labor market is strong. I expect this strength to continue and that the unemployment rate will move down below 4 percent this year.\n\nDayton has also benefited from an improving job market. After peaking at just over 12 percent after the Great Recession, the unemployment rate has fallen to 4.5 percent. Over the past year, payrolls have grown at a brisk 2-3/4 percent pace. This is quite a reversal, as Dayton has had its challenges. Over the 2001-2007 expansion, the Dayton region lost over 5 percent of its payroll jobs, while jobs grew more than 5 percent in the nation. During the Great Recession, payroll jobs fell about 8 percent here compared to 5 percent in the nation. But things have improved. In the Dayton region, payrolls are up 10 percent since the start of the expansion, an increase of about 35 thousand jobs.\n\nSome of the regional differences reflect differences in industry mix. Wright-Patterson Air Force Base remains the largest employer in the area. It added jobs during the recession and helped to cushion some of the job losses in other sectors. On the other hand, manufacturing employment has been on a longer-term downward trend, at both the regional and the national level, and compared to the nation, manufacturing represents a relatively larger share of payroll jobs in the Dayton region. Even so, that difference has narrowed over time as Dayton's economy has been transitioning from one that is largely dependent on manufacturing and heavy industry to one that is diversifying into health care and education. In the 1990s, manufacturing represented about 19 percent of Dayton's jobs and \"eds and meds\" represented about 13 percent. Those shares have now reversed. In the past decade, the share of jobs in eds and meds has been 19 percent, while the share in manufacturing has been 11 percent. Regions that have diversified their industrial base have generally fared better over time, and effective leadership, like that provided by the Dayton Area Chamber of Commerce, can help the region navigate this transition.\n\nAs both national and regional labor markets have tightened, our contacts throughout the Fourth District have been reporting for a while that they've had trouble finding qualified workers. These reports are now coming from a wide range of firms across different sectors and cover both higher-skill and lower-skill occupations. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the tightness in the labor market is gradually showing up in higher compensation. Earlier in the expansion compensation growth was under 2 percent; more recently, it has increased to over 2-1/2 percent. The latest employment report showed another pickup in wage growth. These increases are consistent with the increasing number of reports from firm contacts who tell us that they are responding to labor shortages by offering higher wages and benefits to attract and retain workers.\n\nOverall, my assessment is that from the standpoint of the cyclical conditions monetary policy can address, we are slightly beyond the maximum employment part of the Fed's monetary policy mandate.\n\nThe other part of the Fed's mandate is price stability. The FOMC has set a symmetric goal of 2 percent inflation, as measured by the year-over-year change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, that is, PCE inflation. \"Symmetric\" means that the 2 percent inflation goal isn't a ceiling. The inflation measures will vary from month to month, sometimes above and sometimes below 2 percent, but we aim to keep inflation at 2 percent on average over the longer run.\n\nInflation has been running below this goal for some time, but the recent news on inflation has been positive. Inflation moved up from the very low levels seen in 2015, when it was held down by falling oil and import prices. Inflation readings were above 2 percent early last year, but then fell below 2 percent partly due to special factors, like the drop in the prices of prescription drugs and cell phone service plans. Since the lows seen last summer, inflation has moved up. We will likely see higher inflation numbers once the price declines of last March drop out of the year-over-year measures. But just as we didn't overreact to last summer's weaker inflation readings, we shouldn't overreact to these increases either. Instead, I remain focused on the medium-run outlook for inflation, and I anticipate that with the economy growing above trend and the demand for labor resources continuing to strengthen, inflation will gradually move up to 2 percent on a sustainable basis over the next one to two years.\n\nStable inflation expectations are an important component of this forecast. Inflation expectations help to anchor actual inflation rates, and this stability has already proved its value during this business cycle. During the dark days of the Great Recession, the deep pullback in activity and collapse in demand could have led to deflation — not just low inflation rates but actually falling prices. But deflationary conditions did not develop because policy responses helped to maintain people's expectations that prices would remain stable over the longer run and that inflation would eventually return to goal. The fact that inflation expectations remain reasonably stable gives me confidence that inflation will gradually move back to goal. But since inflation forecasts are subject to considerable uncertainty, I'll keep evaluating my inflation forecast as the year progresses.1, (2 I'll also need to continue to evaluate the effects of the recent changes in tax policy. So let me discuss fiscal policy before I turn to monetary policy.\n\nFiscal Policy\n\nI expect that the tax changes will increase spending and raise economic growth over the next couple of years. At this point, it is difficult to be precise about the magnitude of the effect of the fiscal stimulus from the tax changes; as I mentioned, I'm estimating an additional 1/4 to 1/2 percentage point of annual growth this year and next year, but there is some upside risk that the effects could be larger. The impact on individual households will depend on the level and sources of their income, but in the aggregate, I expect lower personal tax rates and higher standard deductions to spur some additional household spending. On the corporate side, lower tax rates and full expensing for investment in equipment and intangibles should spur additional business spending to meet higher near-term demand, but how much remains to be seen. Except for firms in the tax consulting business, the majority of our business contacts have told us that while they welcome lower tax rates, they aren't planning to make significant changes to their capital or hiring plans as a result of the change in taxes. Instead, those firms planning to increase spending and hiring say those increases are driven by brighter sales prospects and stronger demand. At the same time, some businesses attributed the firm-wide bonuses they paid to workers at the end of the year to the tax cuts, and others have taken the occasion to implement wage increases they had contemplated for some time. Firms might also be expected to spend some of their tax savings on increased dividends and share buybacks. I expect to have a better read on how households and firms are actually responding to the tax changes over the next several months.\n\nA stronger outlook for business spending and hiring is a welcome development because investment and labor force growth are key determinants of productivity growth and productivity growth is a key determinant of an economy's longer-run output growth and of living standards. The U.S. economy has been struggling with very low productivity growth during this expansion, on the order of only 1 percent.3 This is less than half the pace over the prior two expansions, and partially explains why wage growth has been relatively sluggish despite the tightness in labor markets. In addition, as a result of lower population growth and labor force participation, the growth of the U.S. labor force has slowed considerably, from 2.5 percent per year, on average, in the 1970s, to around 0.5 percent per year over 2010-2016. It is expected to remain near that level over the next decade.4\n\nI expect some increase in productivity growth as the expansion continues. It is possible that the tax changes could spur higher labor force participation and investment in physical and human capital, thereby having a positive effect on the economy's productive capacity, its productivity growth, and its trend growth rate. But these effects from the tax changes are even more difficult to estimate than the effects on near-term spending, and they would play out over a longer period of time. So I have not incorporated them into my own projection for longer-run growth, which I put at 2 percent.\n\nAnother aspect of fiscal policy that needs to be considered is its effect on the longer-run budget deficit. Before the tax package and recently passed federal budget deal, projected longer-run fiscal imbalances were unlikely to be sustainable.5 Were the trend growth rate not to pick up, lower tax revenues and higher federal spending would add to the deficit relative to GDP, making it even more likely that the government would eventually need to respond with some combination of increased borrowing, reduced or restructured benefits, and increased taxes, thereby reducing any long-run positive effects of the recent changes in fiscal policy. We will need to continue to evaluate the responses to tax changes not only as the year progresses but into the future.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nThis brings me to monetary policy. At its January meeting, the FOMC maintained the target range for the fed funds rate at 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent. This range was set in December, which saw the fifth increase in rates since December 2015, when the FOMC began removing some of the extraordinary monetary policy accommodation that was necessary in the wake of the financial crisis and Great Recession. In January, the FOMC also continued to implement its plan to normalize its balance sheet in terms of the size and composition of assets.6 To address the Great Recession and put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates once the fed funds rate had hit effectively zero, the Fed undertook several programs to purchase longer-term assets, including longer-maturity Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS). As a result of the purchases, the Fed's balance sheet grew, from nearly $900 billion in assets in 2007, or 6 percent of nominal GDP, to about $4.5 trillion today, or 23 percent of nominal GDP. The composition changed from mainly short-term Treasuries to longer-maturity Treasuries and agency MBS. The normalization plan, which began last October and will take several years to complete, involves letting maturing Treasuries and principal payments of agency MBS and agency debt to gradually roll off the balance sheet up to a monthly cap, with the caps rising over time. The gradual, predictable decline in assets allows balance-sheet normalization to run in the background and monetary policy to focus on setting the appropriate level of the fed funds rate, our conventional monetary policy tool. The ultimate size of the balance sheet will depend on how the FOMC decides to implement monetary policy in the future, a decision that has not yet been made.7\n\nI supported implementing the balance-sheet normalization plan and the December and January decisions on interest rates. If the economy evolves as I anticipate, I believe further increases in interest rates will be appropriate this year and next year, at a pace similar to last year's. I believe this gradual upward path of interest rates will help balance the risks and prolong the expansion so that our longer-run goals of price stability and maximum employment are met and maintained. This policy path gives inflation time to move back to goal while, at the same time, avoiding a build-up of risks to macroeconomic stability that could arise if the economy is allowed to overheat, with the Fed then having to raise rates sharply in response. It helps avoid a build-up of risks to financial stability should overly low interest rates encourage investors to take on excessively risky investments in a search for yield. And it puts monetary policy in a better position to address whatever risks, whether to the upside or to the downside, are ultimately realized.\n\nOf course, this is my current view of monetary policy. We will need to calibrate our policy decisions to how the economy actually evolves and the implications of incoming information for the medium-run outlook and risks around the outlook. If the upside risks to growth come to pass, we may need to steepen the path a bit; if inflation surprises on the downside, we may need to go a bit slower. But this is normal monetary-policy-setting behavior — we will calibrate our policy based on the outlook and the realized and expected progress on our dual-mandate monetary policy goals."

            "content": "I thank Nan Morrison, president and CEO of the Council for Economic Education, for inviting me to speak this evening, and I thank Nan and Barry Haimes, chairman of the board, for inviting me to join the board of the CEE. The CEE's vision is to teach every child in America about personal finance and economics, and the Council offers abundant resources to help teachers do just that. The Federal Reserve System also supports economic education as part of our mission to engage in our communities. The Cleveland Fed's Learning Center and Money Museum offers various programs for teachers and students with the goal of increasing financial and economic literacy. What we have learned over the years is that when people have a better understanding of the economy, they can make better financial decisions and be part of the national discourse on the important economic policy choices facing the country.\n\nFederal Reserve policymakers are also in the economic education business. One of our tasks is to explain our views on the economy and monetary policy to the public. When they understand the rationale for our policy decisions, people can hold us accountable for those decisions. But in addition, our policy is more effective when people understand how policy is likely to react to changes in the economic outlook. So I'm very happy to have this opportunity to talk about the economy and monetary policy. Let me remind you that the views I'll provide today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\n\nThe economic expansion is 8-1/2 years long and counting. It is now the third longest on record. But looking at it this way is a little misleading. Remember, the economy had to dig out of a very deep hole after the financial crisis and Great Recession. So it took quite a long time for the labor market to heal and the expansion to gain traction. Now labor markets are strong and economic growth picked up to around 2-1/2 percent last year, compared to the 2 percent pace seen over much of the expansion. This is about a quarter of a percentage point stronger than I expected at the beginning of last year. So the economy is coming into 2018 with positive momentum, and for the first time in a while, there are some more salient upside risks to the forecast.\n\nThe underlying fundamentals supporting the economy are very sound. Monetary policy and financial conditions are accommodative. Household and business balance sheets continue to improve, and incomes are growing. In addition, conditions in the economies of many of our trading partners are improving. You'll notice that I haven't said anything yet about the recently passed tax package. The reduction in business and personal taxes will likely also have some positive effect on growth this year and next.\n\nOverall, I expect 2018 to be a good year for the economy. My own expectation is that output growth will be around 2-1/2 percent, above my 2 percent estimate of trend growth. I anticipate that fiscal policy will add about ¼ to ½ percentage points to growth over the next couple of years. There's an upside risk that the effect could be larger. I expect labor markets will remain strong this year, with above-trend employment growth continuing and the unemployment rate falling below 4 percent. Inflation ended up last year slightly lower than I thought it would at the start of the year, but I anticipate it will gradually move up to 2 percent over the next one to two years.\n\nThe goals of monetary policy, given to us by Congress, are to promote maximum employment and price stability. The task before us is to calibrate monetary policy to this healthy economy, so that the economic expansion is sustained. In my view, this means that if the economy evolves as I anticipate, we'll need to make some further increases in interest rates this year and next year, at a pace similar to last year's. That's a summary of my outlook, but let me give you some context so you'll see how I got there.\n\nOver the expansion, output growth has maintained a moderate pace of a bit more than 2 percent, on average. But last year, after a weak first quarter, growth picked up to an average pace of around 3 percent over the remainder of the year. This pickup came in the midst of a severe hurricane season that caused a lot of damage in parts of the country. Growth was relatively balanced across sectors. Earlier in the expansion, while consumer spending was relatively good, business spending was weak, and net exports were a drag on growth. Last year, all three sectors made positive contributions, as did residential housing. This balance should help to sustain the expansion going forward.\n\nAs I mentioned, I expect real GDP will grow at an above-trend 2-1/2 percent pace this year. Consumer spending makes up over two-thirds of output and the outlook for consumers remains sound. Spending during the fourth quarter, including the holiday season, was healthy. Readings on consumer sentiment and confidence remain high, but even more important for spending, personal incomes are growing because labor market conditions are strong. Household balance sheets are in much better shape since the Great Recession, reflecting a combination of deleveraging and increased savings. The increases in stock prices and house prices over the past year have contributed to a rise in wealth in the household sector in the aggregate. Although not true for every homeowner, the equity that households as a group have in housing has risen above its previous peak before the housing crash.\n\nThis housing recovery has taken some time, but activity has picked up in recent months. Buyers, sellers, developers, and bankers were all wary about reentering the market, and rightfully so, given the fallout from the housing bust. But low interest rates and the improved financial condition of households and lenders have led to increased construction and sales. Rebuilding after the hurricanes and fires in California will also add to construction activity for a time. In some places, demand for housing is outpacing supply and house prices are accelerating. They are rising at between 6 and 7 percent, on average, nationally. Overall, I expect activity in the housing sector to continue to expand at a sustainable pace.\n\nBusiness investment has also picked up and this is a welcome development. Investment was weak in 2015 and 2016, as the sharp drop in oil prices and the strengthening of the dollar weighed on the energy and manufacturing sectors. But conditions improved last year. Oil prices rose and the dollar depreciated as the economies of our trading partners began to strengthen. In fact, for the first time in many years, growth around the world is picking up. Business sentiment remains at high levels, and our business contacts in manufacturing and services report increasing demand, consistent with readings from national and regional business surveys.\n\nThe labor market is strong. Last year, the economy added over 2 million jobs, about 170 thousand per month, and the unemployment rate fell by six-tenths of a percentage point, to 4.1 percent. The pace of job growth is well above trend, which most estimates put in the range of 75,000 to 120,000 jobs per month. The unemployment rate is below the lowest level reached during the last expansion; it is well below the range most economists associate with full employment; and it is below the 4.3-5.0 percent range that FOMC participants project for the unemployment rate over the longer run.1 In addition, the broader measure of the unemployment rate that includes discouraged workers and those working part-time who would prefer full-time jobs is near its pre-Great Recession low, and other labor market indicators like job openings and turnover rates indicate a strong labor market. I expect this strength to continue and that the unemployment rate will move down further, ending the year at slightly under 4 percent. This is low by historical standards and well below my current estimate of its longer-run rate, which I put at 4-3/4 percent.\n\nWe continue to hear from a wide range of firms that labor market conditions are tight and businesses are finding it hard to find workers, both in high-skill occupations and in lower-skill jobs. Wages have accelerated from under 2 percent earlier in the expansion to about 2-1/2 percent more recently. That strikes some people as a rather modest acceleration given the tightness in labor markets, but it is consistent with the low level of productivity growth we've seen over this expansion.2 Our business contacts are increasingly reporting that they are responding to labor shortages by increasing wages and offering other benefits to attract and retain workers. These increases should eventually find their way into the aggregate compensation measures.\n\nOverall, my assessment is that from the standpoint of the cyclical conditions that monetary policy can address, we are slightly beyond the maximum employment part of the Fed's monetary policy mandate. One might ask, what's wrong with low unemployment? An unemployment rate below what is sustainable can be a positive in the short run by bringing in workers from the sidelines of the labor market, but over time, it can be a negative by creating bottlenecks, lowering productivity growth, and putting upward pressure on inflation, which might require a policy response.\n\nConsistent with meeting the price stability part of its mandate, the FOMC has set a symmetric goal of 2 percent inflation, as measured by the year-over-year change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, that is, PCE inflation. The 2 percent inflation goal isn't a ceiling. The inflation measures will vary from month to month, sometimes above and sometimes below 2 percent, but we aim to keep inflation at 2 percent on average over the longer run.\n\nInflation has been running below this goal for some time. Inflation moved up from the very low levels seen in 2015, when it was held down by falling oil and import prices. Inflation readings were above 2 percent early last year, but then fell below 2 percent partly due to special factors, like the drop in the prices of prescription drugs and cell phone service plans. Toward the end of the year, inflation readings showed some stability, but inflation ended the year at 1-3/4 percent, below our goal.\n\nI anticipate that with the economy growing above trend and the demand for labor resources continuing to strengthen, inflation will gradually move up to 2 percent on a sustainable basis over the next one to two years. Stable inflation expectations are an important component of this forecast. Inflation expectations help to anchor actual inflation rates, and this stability has already proved its value during this business cycle. During the dark days of the Great Recession, the collapse in demand could have led to deflation—not only low inflation rates but actually falling prices—because the pullback in activity was so deep. But deflationary conditions did not develop because policy responses helped to maintain people's expectations that prices would remain stable over the longer run and that inflation would eventually return to goal. The fact that inflation expectations remain reasonably stable gives me confidence that inflation will gradually move back to goal. Of course, I also recognize that inflation forecasts—including my own—are subject to a lot of uncertainty.3 4 In determining appropriate monetary policy, we'll need to keep evaluating the inflation forecast as the year moves on. We'll also need to evaluate the effects of the recent changes in tax policy, which are part of the economic environment. So let me discuss fiscal policy before I turn to monetary policy.\n\nFiscal Policy\n\nI expect that the recently enacted tax changes will have a positive effect on economic growth over the next couple of years. It is difficult to be precise about the magnitude of the effect of the fiscal stimulus; I'm estimating an additional ¼ to ½ percentage point of growth this year and next, but there is some upside risk that the effects could be larger.

In addition to having a positive effect on near-term demand, if lower taxes spur higher labor force participation, investment in physical and human capital, research and development, and innovation, the tax package could also have a positive effect on the economy's productive capacity, its productivity growth, and its trend growth rate. Productivity growth is a key determinant of an economy's longer-run output growth and of living standards. The U.S. economy has been struggling with very low productivity growth during this expansion, on the order of only 1 percent.5 This is less than half the pace over the prior two expansions, and partially explains why wage growth has been relatively sluggish despite the tightness in labor markets. In addition, as a result of lower population growth and labor force participation, the growth of the U.S. labor force has slowed considerably, from 2.5 percent per year, on average, in the 1970s, to around 0.5 percent per year over 2010-2016.

We will need to continue to evaluate the responses to tax changes as the year progresses and into the future.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nAt its meeting last month, the FOMC raised the target range for the fed funds rate by one-quarter percentage point to 1 1/4 to 1-1/2 percent. This was the fifth increase in rates since December 2015, when the FOMC began removing some of the extraordinary monetary policy accommodation that was necessary in the wake of the financial crisis and Great Recession.\n\nIn October, the Fed began implementing the plan to normalize its balance sheet in terms of the size and composition of assets.8 To address the Great Recession and put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates once the fed funds rate had hit effectively zero, the Fed undertook several programs to purchase longer-term assets, including longer-maturity Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS).

We will need to calibrate our policy decisions to how the economy actually evolves and the implications of incoming information for the medium-run outlook and risks around the outlook. If you think this sounds like normal monetary policy-setting behavior, you're right—a positive sign that the economy is finally back to normal."

            "content": "I thank Tom Prusa, chair of the economics department, and Professor Joe Hughes for inviting me to present the Tangri Lecture. It is an honor for me to be with you today. I'd also like to take the opportunity to thank Joe for our research collaboration, which has spanned many years—probably more than we care to admit. Joe is a wonderful co-author, and he often tells me of the innovative techniques he is bringing to the classroom, so I would venture to say he is a dedicated and highly effective teacher as well.\n\nThis afternoon I will speak about the structure of the Federal Reserve System and the value of clear monetary policy communications. I'll summarize some of the improvements the Fed has made to its communications, and then offer my recommendation for potential next steps. Of course, my remarks will reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nFed Structure, Monetary Policy Independence, and Accountability\n\nBefore we can discuss monetary policy communications, it's important to have a sense of the structure of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nAfter a period of financial instability, Congress established the Fed in 1913 to promote the health of the U.S. economy and financial system. Congress designed the Fed to operate in the public interest as a decentralized central bank: the Fed is independent within the government but not independent from the government. At the time, there were concerns that the central bank would become dominated by financial interests in New York or political interests in Washington. So the design includes representation from across the country and balances public-sector and private-sector interests, and Wall Street and Main Street concerns.\n\nThe Federal Reserve System has 12 regional Reserve Banks and a seven-member Board of Governors in Washington, D.C. that oversees those Banks. The governors are appointed by the president of the United States and confirmed by the Senate. Governors serve staggered terms of up to 14 years. These terms span several terms of the president and members of Congress, which is intended to insulate the governors from short-term political influence and allows them to take a longer-run perspective when setting monetary and financial regulatory policy. The chair and vice chair of the Board of Governors, and the governor who serves as vice chair of supervision, a position created by the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, are chosen by the president and confirmed by the Senate from among the sitting governors for four-year terms. The chair and vice chairs can be reappointed until their terms as governors expire.\n\nThe 12 Reserve Banks are distributed around the country in locations that were the centers of economic activity back when the Fed was established.1 Each Reserve Bank has a board of directors whose nine members are chosen in a nonpolitical process, with three representing banks and six representing business, agricultural, industrial, and public interests in the Districts they serve. The nonbank directors are responsible for choosing a Reserve Bank's president, who is subject to approval of the Fed's Board of Governors.\n\nThis regional structure has served the country well for more than 100 years. It allows monetary policy decisions to take into account the diversity of the American economy and its people, and also helps us to carry out our other responsibilities. These include supervising and regulating banks and other important financial institutions, promoting the stability of the financial system, playing a major role in overseeing the nation's payments system, providing certain financial services to the U.S. government, and identifying effective community development policies and best practices for promoting economic progress and access to credit in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, is the body within the Fed that is responsible for setting monetary policy. It holds eight regularly scheduled meetings per year in Washington, D.C. The FOMC was established by the Banking Act of 1935 and has 12 members: the seven members of the Board of Governors, the president of the New York Fed, and four other Reserve Bank presidents, who serve on a rotating basis. As president of the Cleveland Fed, I vote every other year, rotating my vote with the president of the Chicago Fed. Other than New York, Cleveland, and Chicago, the other presidents vote every third year. I am a voting member this year, but it's important to note that all presidents, whether voting or nonvoting, participate in FOMC meetings.\n\nSo the discussions at FOMC meetings contain a mosaic of economic information and analysis from all parts of the country. And this regional information, along with economic and financial data and analysis, plays an important part in the FOMC's setting of national monetary policy in pursuit of our goals.\n\nThose monetary policy goals were given to the Fed by Congress. The Federal Reserve Act says that the Fed should conduct monetary policy to \"promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.\" When prices are stable and the economy is at maximum employment, long-term interest rates are typically at moderate levels, so it is often said that Congress has given the Fed a dual mandate.\n\nWhile Congress has set the Fed's goals, it has also wisely given the Fed independence in making monetary policy decisions in pursuit of those goals. This means monetary policy decisions do not have to be approved by the president or Congress. This is wise because a substantial body of research and actual practice indicate that when a central bank formulates monetary policy free from short-run political interference and is held accountable for its decisions, better economic outcomes result.\n\nBut independence does not mean that the Fed should be unaccountable for its monetary policy decisions or that it shouldn't be transparent about the rationale for those decisions. In fact, accountability must go hand in hand with independence or else independence from the political process won't be sustainable. Because it takes some time for monetary policy to affect the economy, the public won't be able to immediately see whether a policy action was a good one. So it is incumbent upon policymakers to explain their decisions, their assessment of economic conditions, and their outlook for the economy. In other words, clear communications play a crucial role in monetary policymaking.\n\nThe Benefits of Clear Communications in Monetary Policymaking\n\nOne important benefit of clear communication is that it can actually make monetary policy more effective by helping households and businesses make better economic and financial decisions. The public will have a better understanding of monetary policy when policymakers are clear about their policy goals, those aspects of the economy monetary policy can and can't influence, and the economic information that influences their forecasts and policy decisions. And when policymakers strive to be systematic in their policy responses to changes in economic conditions that influence the outlook, the public will have a better idea of how monetary policy is likely to change as economic conditions evolve. They will have a better sense of how policy will react not only to anticipated changes in conditions but also to unanticipated economic developments. With such knowledge, households and firms can plan better; they can make better saving, borrowing, investment, and employment decisions. In addition, when the public has a clearer understanding of the strategy monetary policymakers follow in normal times, they will also understand when nonstandard monetary policy action is required in extraordinary circumstances.\n\nIndeed, in extraordinary times, like the financial crisis and deep recession we've lived through, policy communications not only provide transparency but they can also serve as a monetary policy tool. In particular, once interest rates hit their effective zero lower bound, providing forward guidance about the path that policy will likely follow in the future has the potential to increase the current degree of monetary policy accommodation. By reducing uncertainty about the future path of policy, forward guidance helps lower interest rates by reducing the premiums investors demand to compensate them for interest-rate uncertainty. In addition, in theory, if the central bank indicates that the future path of short-term interest rates will be low for a long time—lower and for longer than would have been consistent with the central bank's past behavior—this can also put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, thereby adding accommodation and spurring current economic activity. In theory, if people believe that the central bank is committed to keeping interest rates very low, they will expect higher economic activity and higher inflation in the future and that will induce them to make investments in capital and labor today, thereby helping the current economy.\n\nThe Fed and other central banks used forward guidance as a tool during the Great Recession. The Fed's forward guidance took several forms. First, it was qualitative: the FOMC indicated in December 2008 that it anticipated that weak economic conditions were likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the fed funds rate for \"some time.\" In March 2009, \"some time\" became an \"extended period.\" In August 2011, this qualitative forward guidance changed to calendar-date guidance when the FOMC said it anticipated an exceptionally low fed funds rate at least through mid-2013. That date was later extended to late 2014, and then to mid-2015. In December 2012, calendar-date guidance was changed to state-contingent guidance when the FOMC said that it anticipated that the 0-to-¼ percent target range for the fed funds rate would be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remained above 6½ percent, inflation between one and two years ahead was projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continued to be well anchored. Some form of this threshold guidance was used until March 2014. Since then, as the economy has returned to normal and policy is normalizing, the FOMC has been providing information about the factors that will influence the future path of policy, but this is in the realm of regular policy communication conveying a sense of how the FOMC is likely to react to economic developments rather than guidance as a policy tool.\n\nSteps the FOMC Has Taken to Enhance Monetary Policy Communications\n\nOver the past couple of decades, as the benefits of enhanced transparency have become better appreciated, the Federal Reserve has taken several steps to enhance its regular policy communications. I believe we've made substantial progress, although I also believe that achieving clearer monetary policy communications is better viewed as a journey rather than as a destination and we should always be working to make our communications more effective.\n\nSome commentators have criticized the Fed for being, perhaps, a bit too transparent—with a cacophony of Fed voices speaking too many times. So it might surprise you to know that it wasn't until 1994 that the FOMC began explicitly announcing changes in its targeted policy rate, the fed funds rate. Before 1994, there was no post-meeting FOMC statement; the public had to infer what the FOMC decided by looking at how it implemented policy through its open market operations in financial markets. Now, the post-meeting statement describes the FOMC's view of the state of the economy and the rationale for its decisions. Since 2002, the statement has also included the votes of individual members and the preferred policy choices of any dissenters. Further context for the decisions is provided in the meeting minutes. Before 2005, these minutes weren't released until after the subsequent FOMC meeting. Now they are released with only a three-week lag. Recently, the FOMC used the minutes to convey information about the strategies it was considering for normalizing the size and composition of the Fed's balance sheet.2 By the time it was announced in June 2017, the plan was well understood by market participants. In addition to minutes, the FOMC publishes a full transcript of each meeting with a five-year lag.\n\nAn important enhancement to monetary policy communications was the FOMC's statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy, adopted in January 2012 and reviewed and reaffirmed each year since.3 This statement laid out for the first time the guiding principles the FOMC uses in setting monetary policy. It recognizes that over the longer run, monetary policy can influence only inflation and not the underlying real structural aspects of the economy such as the natural rate of unemployment or maximum employment, but that monetary policy can be used to help offset shorter-run fluctuations in employment from maximum employment. Importantly, the statement also established an explicit numerical goal for inflation over the longer run. This is a symmetric goal of 2 percent, as measured by the year-over-year change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE inflation. The explicit target not only provides transparency to the public but it also underscores the FOMC's commitment to price stability, thereby helping to anchor expectations about inflation. Since inflation expectations are an important determinant of actual inflation, having an explicit target helps promote price stability.\n\nOutside of the blackout period around FOMC meetings, many of the FOMC participants present speeches—like this one—in which they share their perspectives on the economy and monetary policy with the public. As I mentioned, sometimes this speaking is criticized, but as a public servant, I think it's one of my duties to explain my views. In addition to speeches, the chair testifies before subcommittees of both houses of Congress at two regularly scheduled monetary policy hearings a year, and at additional hearings when asked. And since 2011, the chair has held press briefings after four FOMC meetings per year. These briefings allow the chair to expand on things that are too complex to discuss in the FOMC's relatively short post-meeting statement and to respond to questions from the media. The four meetings followed by press briefings are also ones at which the FOMC releases its Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP.\n\nThese projections, which are now quarterly, began in 2007. In ensuing years, the projections have been enhanced in various ways and I would expect us to consider further enhancements to the SEP over time, as part of our ongoing efforts to make our communications even more effective. The SEP now includes more variables and a longer time horizon. The variables included are real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and core inflation, that is, inflation excluding food and energy prices, which tend to be volatile. The projections also include participants' anticipated path of appropriate policy given their outlook and their assessment of risks around the outlook. The projections are for the current year and for up to three additional years, and also provide participants' longer-run estimates of key economic variables. Most recently, the FOMC added confidence bands around the median projections across the participants.\n\nI view the addition of confidence bands as an important enhancement, because these bands illustrate in a simple way the reasonable amount of variation to expect in forecasts and in outcomes relative to projections. They remind us of the important message that the economy can evolve in unexpected ways. For example, as shown in the latest SEP projections,4 the 70 percent confidence interval around the median forecast of real GDP growth is about ±1.7 percentage points for this year and a little over ±2.0 percentage points for each of the following two years; for inflation, it is about ±1.0 percentage point for each of the next three years, and for the fed funds rate, it is about 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 percentage points over the next three years.\n\nThe Communications Challenge\n\nAccording to Voltaire, \"Uncertainty is an uncomfortable position, but certainty is an absurd one.\" In our context, this means it is important to remember that monetary policymakers have to deal with uncertainty, which takes several forms. The economy is constantly being buffeted by shocks that can lead economic conditions to evolve differently than anticipated. In addition, our view of current economic conditions can be cloudy because many economic data are revised over time, and these data revisions complicate forecasting and setting monetary policy in real time. There is also model uncertainty: it isn't clear which model will best predict the future path of the economy at any given time. One approach that I like is to average across various models to develop a forecast, or to look at the forecasts from several different models and to analyze different scenarios. In speaking about FOMC projections, former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke said, \"The only economic forecast in which I have complete confidence is that the economy will not evolve along the precise path implied by our projections.\"5\n\nThe FOMC is not prescient, nor should anyone expect it to be. Yet, because policy affects the economy with a lag, policymakers need to make medium-run forecasts and acknowledge the uncertainty. But this poses a fundamental communications challenge—how can policymakers be transparent about their current assessment of economic conditions, the economic outlook, and their anticipated appropriate policy path without being perceived as having made a promise they won't necessarily keep should the economy evolve in an unanticipated way. Added to this is the tendency for market participants, among others, to prefer more explicit statements and less uncertainty, and the potential that they will interpret the forecasts of the economy and the appropriate policy path as having more certitude than they actually do, which creates communication issues when the forecasts and policy path change.\n\nI note that here I'm talking about normal times. In extraordinary times, for example, when interest rates have reached the zero lower bound and policymakers want to run a policy of keeping interest rates very low for longer than they otherwise would, the challenge is just the opposite—how can policymakers credibly commit to such a policy path that differs from normal policy?\n\nPolicy Communications Recommendations\n\nI believe that to meet these challenges, we should focus our policy communications on conveying a better sense of the FOMC's reaction function in normal times, that is, the relationship between changes in monetary policy and changes in the economic outlook. This takes us away from having to predict the various shocks that may hit the economy, shocks that can arise from many different sources. Instead, we should provide a better sense of how policy can be expected to react when there is a change in economic conditions and the medium-run outlook, whether those changes were anticipated or not. Of course, policymakers do not necessarily agree on the precise form of the policy reaction function. Still, there is consensus on some of the factors that should influence policy, including measures of the unemployment rate, employment growth, output growth, inflation, and longer-run inflation expectations.\n\nFrom a practical viewpoint, let me offer three suggestions of what the FOMC can do to create a better understanding of our policy reaction function.\n\nFirst, let's ensure that our post-meeting FOMC statement focuses less on short-term changes in the data released between FOMC meetings and more on accumulated changes in economic and financial conditions and their effect on the medium-run outlook and progress toward our monetary policy goals. The statement should help the public and financial market participants to better understand policymakers' consensus assessment of what is signal versus noise in the data. While the statement has been evolving in this direction, I believe it could do more to dissuade people from thinking short term. The statement is a very important part of FOMC communications. We could improve the public's understanding of our monetary policy reaction function if the statement provided more of a narrative of our assessment of how changes in economic and financial data have or have not changed the medium-run outlook, the risks around that outlook, and therefore, the appropriate policy path. In addition to the narrative, the statement would describe the current stance of policy and any policy actions taken, and some information on the future path of policy. In extraordinary economic circumstances, this might be explicit forward guidance that serves as a policy tool, as it did during the Great Recession and early part of the recovery. But during normal times, the statement would, instead, provide a rationale for future policy decisions. It would articulate the considerations the Committee would take into account when determining future changes in policy. If we provided more consistency about the conditions we systematically assess in calibrating the stance of policy, I believe the public and market participants would get a better sense of the Committee's reaction function over time and their policy expectations will better align with those of policymakers, thereby making policy more effective and, at least to some extent, reducing market volatility. What I'm suggesting would likely not result in a shorter statement but, I believe, a more informative one.\n\nSecond, let's begin using simple monetary policy rules as benchmarks to explain our policy decisions. You can find updates for a set of seven rules and their outcomes across several forecasts on the Cleveland Fed's website, and the Federal Reserve Board's Monetary Policy Report now includes a section on policy rules.6 These types of rules describe policy reaction functions that have been shown to yield good economic outcomes in some models and in some economic circumstances. I am not advocating setting policy mechanically according to a simple policy rule; no rule works well enough across a variety of economic models and circumstances. However, using the rules as reference points and discussing why our policy may differ from these policy descriptions could go some way in helping to explain our own policy reaction function to the public.\n\nThis doesn't go as far as having the FOMC present a forecast that could serve as the benchmark for understanding the FOMC's policy actions and post-meeting statements, a recommendation I've made in the past.7 The median paths in the SEP are somewhat of a step in that direction, but because the variables are not linked across participants, the median paths don't really represent a coherent forecast. For example, there is no guarantee that someone projecting the median inflation path would necessarily be projecting the median output path. In 2012, the FOMC experimented with developing a forecast representing the consensus of the Committee, but it proved difficult to achieve.8 In lieu of that, the FOMC should consider publishing the Board staff's forecast as a benchmark against which policymakers could explain how and why their forecasts may differ.\n\nThird, let's link the variables in the SEP. As I just mentioned, right now, each variable in our projections is reported independently, so, for example, there is no way to see whether a person low in the range of unemployment rate forecasts is high in the range of inflation projections. The SEP could be enhanced by linking the variables for each participant's projection so that the public could see what each policymaker is projecting for growth, unemployment, and inflation, and what policy path he or she believes is appropriate given those projections. This could be done without revealing the identities of the participants and would convey information on each individual policymaker's reaction function. We might also consider other enhancements to help the public understand that the policy paths in the SEP are not necessarily commitments but depend on how the economy evolves. Although this message may already be understood because of the FOMC's actions: last year, the economy evolved in a way that resulted in the FOMC raising the fed funds rate three times. This was consistent with the median projection of FOMC participants in March 2017. However, in both 2015 and 2016, the FOMC raised the funds rate fewer times than the median projection made in March of those years, clearly demonstrating that when economic conditions evolve differently than anticipated, the FOMC will adjust policy accordingly.\n\nConclusion\n\nLet me end by noting that 14 years ago, Alan Greenspan, then chairman of the Federal Reserve, gave an economic outlook speech. The next day's headline in The New York Times read: \"Greenspan Hints at End to Low Rates,\" while the headline in The Wall Street Journal read: \"Greenspan Suggests Continued Patience on Rates.\"9 That one speech generated such contradictory messages illustrates the challenges monetary policymakers face when communicating with the public. I suspect that monetary policy communication will likely always remain somewhat of a challenge, but over the past couple of decades, the FOMC has been taking significant steps on its journey toward increased transparency and better communication. It is important for the FOMC to continue on this journey because when the public has a better understanding of how monetary policy decisions are made, not only will the public have the information it needs to hold us accountable for our decisions but monetary policy itself will be more effective. I have offered some concrete suggestions on how we might improve our communications by conveying a better sense of our policy reaction function. I expect the FOMC will continue to make progress because the benefits of clearer communication are clearly worth the effort."

            "content": "I thank Diana Hancock and Wayne Passmore for inviting me to speak today. I will use my time to discuss four topics: the relationship between financial stability and monetary policy, the Federal Reserve's current framework for assessing and monitoring financial stability risks, an exercise aimed to assess possible policy responses to such risk, and some of the governance issues we face in addressing these risks. The views I'll present are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nFinancial Stability and Central Banks\n\nThe global financial crisis and the deep recession that followed were a rude awakening that much more needed to be done to assess and address vulnerabilities in the financial system. In the U.S., significant resources have been brought to bear to improve financial system resiliency, both to lower the probability that financial instability will arise and to limit the damage when financial shocks occur. Financial stability matters to central banks. One reason is that monetary policy affects the real economy by affecting financial conditions. During the financial crisis, we saw that when financial markets are not functioning well, the transmission of monetary policy to the economy can be disrupted. Another reason central banks care about financial stability is that the goals of monetary policy and financial stability are interconnected. Indeed, the definition of financial stability is often framed in terms of a financial system that is able to provide its valuable credit, risk-management, and liquidity services to businesses and households in the face of economic and financial shocks. Disruptions to the financial system that could interfere with its ability to provide these services include fire sales of assets, runs on financial firms, shortages of liquid assets, and contraction of credit in the face of unknown counterparty risk. We saw all of these during the global financial crisis.\n\nBecause central banks care about financial stability to the extent that it affects the health of the real economy, volatility or minor disruptions in financial markets that represent the ebb and flow of a dynamic economy but do not threaten the health of the economy are not something monetary policy should respond to. In most circumstances, the goals of monetary policy and financial stability are complementary. For example, price stability helps businesses, households, and financial institutions make better decisions, thereby fostering the stability of the financial system. And a stable financial system allows for more effective transmission of monetary policy throughout the economy. But in the short run, at times there may be trade-offs between monetary policy and financial stability, as macroprudential actions may slow the economy for a while. If such actions are needed to maintain the stability of the financial system, then these actions would also foster the monetary policy goals of price stability and maximum employment over the medium run, and would be complementary to economic growth.1\n\nThe first line of defense against financial instability should involve making the structure of the financial system more resilient. Structural resiliency is promoted by requiring higher levels and quality of capital (including a minimum non-risk-based leverage ratio, as well as risk-based capital standards), liquidity standards, stress tests, living wills, effective resolution methods for systemically important banks and nonbank financial institutions, and reforms to improve the stability of certain nonbank markets. The latter include changes to regulations governing money market mutual funds to reduce the chance of investor runs on these funds, rules requiring standardized over-the-counter derivatives contracts to be cleared through central counterparties, and limiting interday credit exposures in the tri-party repo market.2 In contrast to structural tools, which apply regardless of the level of vulnerability, the countercyclical capital buffer is an example of a cyclical tool that can be varied with the perceived level of vulnerabilities in the financial system. The Federal Reserve Board has indicated that it will use this tool only when systemic vulnerabilities are \"meaningfully above normal\" and that, when using the tool, it intends to increase the buffer in a gradual way.3 The U.S. has not had much experience with this tool, so the focus on increasing the resiliency of the structure of the financial system seems well-founded.\n\nI believe monetary policy should remain focused on promoting price stability and maximum employment and not be given a third objective of financial stability. But I also recognize that monetary policy and financial stability goals and actions are interrelated and that if we assessed the risks to financial stability to be sufficiently great, achieving our dual-mandate monetary policy goals would also be in jeopardy. In this situation, the distinction between financial stability goals and monetary policy goals would be blurry, and to the extent that financial instability affects macroeconomic stability, those using a risk-management approach to monetary policy might be compelled to act, even though financial stability is not an explicit part of the FOMC's monetary policy mandate.\n\nThe FOMC recognizes these linkages. It has acknowledged that nonconventional monetary policy, including large-scale asset purchases and the extended period of essentially zero interest rates, could pose potential risks to financial stability by affecting market functioning and spurring risk-taking in a search for yield.4 One study using Spanish data found that a lower overnight policy rate induced low-capitalized banks to lend more to ex ante riskier firms and to require less collateral compared to high-capitalized banks, direct evidence of monetary policy's effect on risk-taking.5 The low-interest-rate environment has also posed challenges for bank profitability. In addition, to the extent that asset valuations have been elevated relative to historical standards because of the low level of interest rates (which means a low discount rate), as interest rates rise, valuations might be expected to fall, which would pose some risks to financial stability.6\n\nEffects also run in the reverse direction, from macroprudential policy to monetary policy: Tight macroprudential policy can tighten financial conditions more generally, thereby increasing the likelihood that a monetary policy response will be needed.\n\nSo when we are making monetary policy decisions, we need to be cognizant of the linkages between our monetary policy actions and financial stability and we need to monitor financial system conditions and developments as part of the economic environment. Well before the financial crisis, the FOMC discussed financial stability considerations at its meetings when setting monetary policy.7 But since the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has developed a framework for systematically tracking risks, and financial stability surveillance is receiving regular attention at FOMC meetings. This regular attention is important because, as we learned during the financial crisis, even in periods when conditions look benign, vulnerabilities may be building.\n\nThe Fed's Framework for Monitoring Financial Stability\n\nThe basic framework used by Federal Reserve staff to monitor financial stability risks is described in Adrian, Covitz, and Liang (2013, 2015). The framework recognizes the complex nature of the financial system in the U.S., with its mix of bank-based finance and market-based finance and its multiplicity of regulatory and supervisory bodies. The framework is informed by experience during the financial crisis, as well as the theoretical and empirical literature on financial stability.\n\nThis literature demonstrates that systemic risk is endogenous, determined by the choices of financial market participants, and that it varies across the cycle. When the economy is performing well, collateral values increase, which supports further borrowing. Funding constraints fall, and with credit amply available to borrowers, the volatility of output and the volatility of asset prices fall. This induces banks to increase their leverage and lend even more. Leverage and maturity mismatch build up, the price of risk falls, and asset values rise. But these developments mean the system is more vulnerable, so that when a negative shock hits the economy and output declines, collateral values also fall, lenders become risk-averse, and credit contracts. This causes households and businesses to pull back on their spending, which depresses output even further, thereby propagating the shock to the real economy.\n\nOn a conceptual level, the Fed's framework is based on an understanding of these mechanisms through which shocks can be amplified and propagated throughout the financial system and to the real economy.8 The framework tracks a standard set of financial system vulnerabilities that could amplify and propagate shocks using a set of indicators on various financial activities in four categories: asset valuation pressures (reflecting the price of risk and risk appetites among investors), leverage, maturity and liquidity transformation, and interconnectedness and complexity. Tools like heat maps and data-visualization techniques aid in the tracking over time.9\n\nThe financial crisis underscored the importance of assessing and monitoring risks more broadly than just in individual regulated banks, so these vulnerabilities are assessed across four sectors of the economy: the banking sector; the nonbank financial sector, including capital markets, nonbanks, and shadow banks; the nonfinancial business sector; and the household sector.\n\nThe framework makes a distinction between shocks and vulnerabilities.10 Shocks are difficult to predict and arise from various sources, whereas vulnerabilities are characteristics of the financial system and depend on the behavior of providers of financial services, their customers, and their regulators. Some of these vulnerabilities, like leverage, vary over the business and financial cycles; others, like complexity, are more structural in nature, reflecting the design of markets and intermediaries.\n\nTo see the distinction between shocks and vulnerabilities, consider the financial crisis. Developments in the subprime mortgage market constituted a shock that precipitated the crisis. Recall that, at the time, many thought that the subprime market was too small to pose major problems in the financial system. That view turned out to be terribly wrong because it failed to recognize both the interconnectedness across markets and institutions and the fact that, at the time, the financial system was highly vulnerable to a shock due to high leverage and reliance on short-term funding. The easing of underwriting standards and the demand for securitized subprime mortgage assets led to a build-up in leverage before the crisis. When house prices fell, losses on subprime mortgages were amplified because the loans were funded by short-term funding sources, such as asset-backed commercial paper. Banks that sponsored these funds felt compelled to support these vehicles, diverting funds from other types of lending; they pulled back on risk because of the drop in the value of mortgages and other assets. The drop in the value of asset-backed securities caused problems in other markets, such as the repo market, where these assets were used as collateral. Thus, leverage and reliance on short-term funding were vulnerabilities that allowed the original shock to propagate across the financial system, becoming amplified and wreaking much destruction as it went. Another distinction between vulnerabilities and shocks is that, unlike with shocks, it is feasible that policies could be designed to limit the build-up of vulnerabilities, thereby promoting financial stability.\n\nUsing the framework helps the Fed be systematic in its analysis of the financial system's vulnerability to a range of possible shocks. Systematic analysis means we can better identify changes in vulnerabilities over time and compare the level of vulnerabilities to historical experience at similar stages of the business cycle. An assessment of individual vulnerabilities is then combined to get an assessment of the overall vulnerability of the financial system. For example, when asset valuations are high and leverage is high, the financial system is likely more vulnerable to shocks because the combination can lead to rapid credit growth and excessive risk-taking that can reverse quickly when a negative shock hits.\n\nThe minutes of the FOMC meetings indicate the types of discussions of financial conditions that regularly take place. At each meeting, the staff briefs the Committee on developments in financial markets over the intermeeting period. This discussion includes movements in equity prices; government and corporate bond yields; availability of credit to households and businesses; credit standards, loan growth, and financing conditions in various sectors, including the business, consumer, and residential and commercial real estate sectors; conditions in short-run funding markets; foreign exchange movements; and financial conditions abroad. At every other meeting, the staff reports on its assessment of the vulnerabilities in the U.S. financial system, discussing how the vulnerabilities have changed since the last report and over time. Recognizing the global interconnectedness of financial systems, the staff has developed tools to assess foreign financial stability as well.11\n\nAn evaluation of developments related to financial stability and the assessment of the financial system's vulnerabilities have also become a regular section in the Board of Governors' monetary policy report. The report occasionally includes additional in-depth information on particular sectors. For example, the latest report included a section discussing liquidity in the corporate bond market.12 Although market participants had been expressing concerns about reduced liquidity in the market, the Board's analysis suggested that liquidity strains in the market were minimal. And as a member of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), the Federal Reserve contributes to the FSOC's annual report that identifies potential risks to financial stability and makes recommendations about what can be done to mitigate those risks.13\n\nThe Fed has made a lot of progress on building a system to monitor and assess changes in the financial system's vulnerabilities. Analysis suggests that the vulnerabilities now being tracked had, indeed, been building up for several years before the onset of the financial crisis.14 As discussed in the minutes of the October FOMC meeting, the Fed staff assessed that overall vulnerabilities in the U.S. financial system remained moderate. Valuation pressures were elevated but vulnerabilities stemming from leverage in the nonfinancial sector were moderate; those stemming from leverage in the financial sector and from maturity and liquidity mismatch remained low. The staff also assessed that overall vulnerabilities to foreign financial stability were moderate.\n\nOngoing work at the Fed continues to evaluate what changes in vulnerabilities may signal about financial stability and how policy should respond to signs of emerging financial stability risks and, in particular, how financial stability concerns should be incorporated into monetary policymaking.\n\nA Financial Stability Tabletop Exercise\n\nIncluded in these efforts is the tabletop exercise that was undertaken by the Financial Stability Subcommittee of the Conference of Presidents of the Federal Reserve System in June 2015.15 This exercise involved working through a plausible scenario of loose financial conditions, reflected by falling term and risk premia, leading to pressures on valuations in the commercial property market and increasing leverage in the form of higher corporate debt issuance and leveraged lending that was funded by short-term wholesale funding. The context included monetary policy that was gradually removing accommodation, as in 2015-2016, with inflation below the FOMC's 2 percent goal but the economy at full employment. The scenario reflected some historical episodes of financial market instability, including the real estate boom and bust in New England in the mid-1980s and in Sweden in 1989-1990, but with the incorporation of increased leverage in the nonfinancial sector, as well as in banking, and a focus on commercial real estate as opposed to residential real estate.\n\nWithin this scenario, financial conditions were judged to be too loose given macroeconomic conditions and despite the gradual withdrawal of monetary accommodation. A sharp reversal in the pricing of risk would have adverse effects on the corporate bond market and a sharp drop in commercial real estate prices could adversely affect the banking sector. Either would have implications for the real economy. The reliance on short-term wholesale funding could exacerbate the problems, and with many of the providers of this funding outside of the supervisory purview of the Federal Reserve, it would be difficult to directly address this issue.\n\nThe objective of the exercise was for the policymaker participants to use available macroprudential tools and/or monetary policy to reduce the probability of and the severity of financial disruptions associated with the scenario. The macroprudential tools considered included leverage ratios; countercyclical capital buffers, which could vary across sectors; liquidity requirements; limits on loan-to-value and debt-to-income ratios; capital and liquidity stress testing; supervisory guidance; and moral suasion.\n\nAs the scenario played out, the limits to the macroprudential tools were illuminated. The macroprudential tools that ended up being favored were stress testing, margins on repo funding, and supervisory guidance. Capital-based, liquidity-based, and loan-to-value and debt-to-income limits, while good in theory, were deemed to have implementation challenges, such as having to coordinate across multiple regulators or, in some cases, to follow administrative procedures like public comment periods, which would slow down the process. Another limitation to some tools is that they applied to regulated banking firms but not necessarily to shadow banks or other types of institutions.\n\nWhile my preference going into the exercise was, and continues to be, to start with the macroprudential tools that can be implemented more promptly, the limits on these tools suggest that, in some circumstances, monetary policy might have to be used to address financial stability concerns. This is all the more reason to take steps to ensure that the financial system is structurally resilient, as increased resiliency would lessen the need to shift some of monetary policy's focus away from its macroeconomic goals of price stability and maximum employment. In addition, we must continue to hone our methods of assessing financial system vulnerabilities – in both the regulated and unregulated sectors and between the two. We don't want to over-identify such risks. Finding risks around every corner where none exist would stifle productivity and innovation in the financial services sector and markets, and thereby undermine longer-run economic growth.16 This leads me to my final topic: the governance of financial stability policy.\n\nThe Governance of Financial Stability Policy\n\nThe complexity of the U.S. financial system, with multiple types of financial services providers and multiple regulators, complicates the application of macroprudential policy. The multiple financial regulators in the U.S. include the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the National Credit Union Administration, the U.S. Treasury, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency. In addition, there are regulatory agencies at the state level. In many cases, the regulatory authority of these agencies is defined by type of institution rather than by instrument. The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) was created by the Dodd-Frank Act to promote coordination and information sharing across these financial system regulators. Its membership includes the heads of the regulatory agencies, with the Secretary of the Treasury as chair. The Office of Financial Research (OFR), also established by the Dodd-Frank Act, supports the FSOC and has been working to improve the data resources available to assess financial stability risks. This is particularly important as some segments of the financial system are less regulated than others, e.g., hedge funds, and without data, it is difficult to ascertain emerging risks in these sectors. Moreover, even when data are collected, it is harder to track emerging risks to the extent that data aren't standardized across segments.17\n\nEstablishing the FSOC and the OFR, and the regulatory changes to increase the structural resiliency of the financial system, including higher capital requirements and liquidity requirements, were important steps. Still, it has to be recognized that other than the ability to designate firms as systemically important financial institutions and, therefore, subject to enhanced regulation by the Fed, the FSOC does not have the authority to take actions to mitigate emerging risks. Instead, it can make recommendations to the agencies and to Congress, who can then decide to act or not.18\n\nAs the tabletop exercise I just spoke of illuminated, regulatory and financial system complexity and the need for coordination impose some limits on the efficacy of countercyclical macroprudential policy to mitigate financial stability risks that build up over time. If implementation is delayed so much that the policies take effect after the risks are realized, at best, they would be ineffective and, at worst, they would exacerbate the situation rather than shore up the financial system. Moreover, unless the policies are coordinated across the entire financial services landscape, they could result in regulatory arbitrage whereby activities move to the sector with less stringent rules.\n\nThe need to be preemptive when wielding countercyclical macroprudential tools poses another challenge: that of communication. The tools will have to be used well before there are clear signs of instability. This might be difficult to explain, and there may be various interests that would prefer the tools not be invoked in seemingly good times. Thus, it's important that policymakers have some independence in setting macroprudential policy, with appropriate accountability to elected officials and the public.19 This argues for transparency and regular testimony before Congress to explain the rationale behind policies. The FSOC and OFR annual reports, as well the materials included in the minutes of FOMC meetings and the Board's monetary policy report, all contribute to needed transparency.20\n\nFinally, it is important to have a clearer understanding of how monetary policy and financial stability policy should interact. Loose monetary policy, to the extent that it allows financial vulnerabilities to build up, can pose risks to financial stability when the monetary policy is reversed. And tightening macroprudential rules to counteract growing imbalances can impede the flow of credit, thereby dampening economic growth.\n\nTabletop exercises like the one I described can be helpful in clarifying strategies for both monetary policy and financial stability policy. We are still some distance away from being able to articulate a clear strategy about the circumstances under which monetary policy should be used as a tool for financial stability. But progress on this will be important to provide clarity not only to the public but also to ourselves as policymakers. As Kohn (2014) describes, the institutional structure in the U.K. has allowed it to be further along in this respect. In August 2013, the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee initiated forward guidance that it would hold interest rates low and consider additional asset purchases at least until the unemployment rate had fallen to 7 percent.21 But it also said that one of the conditions that would vacate this guidance would be if the Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee found that the stance of monetary policy was threatening financial stability in a way that couldn't be contained by the available macroprudential tools. Note that both policy committees are within the Bank of England. The committees are independent but they also share members, which allows for good communication and information sharing between the two committees.\n\nIn the U.S., the FSOC should not play a similar role, as this would compromise the independence of monetary policy decisions. This independence must be preserved because, as shown by a substantial body of research and actual practice, when a central bank formulates monetary policy free from short-run political interference and is held accountable for its decisions, better economic outcomes result. Instead, the Federal Reserve, itself, should work to make further progress on clarifying the strategies for the interactions between monetary policy and financial stability policy. With the continued focus throughout the Federal Reserve System on improving our ability to monitor emerging financial stability risks and on developing tools and policies to address those risks, I am confident that such progress will be made."

            "content": "I thank George Kahn for inviting me to speak in this session. I will use my time to discuss the framework the FOMC uses for setting monetary policy and some alternative frameworks. Let me emphasize that this is a longer-run issue and not one that is of immediate concern. It lies in the realm of what economists and policymakers should have on their agendas for study given the economic developments we've seen over the past decade and what is expected over the coming decade. The views I'll present are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe FOMC currently uses a flexible inflation-targeting framework to set monetary policy. It is briefly described in the FOMC's statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy.1 The U.S. adopted an explicit numerical inflation goal in January 2012. This is a symmetric goal of 2 percent, as measured by the year-over-year change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE inflation. In establishing this numerical goal, the U.S. joined many other countries, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Sweden, and the U.K., as well as the European Central Bank, that conduct monetary policy with a goal of achieving an explicit inflation target. An explicit target provides transparency to the public and helps anchor expectations about inflation. Congress has given the Fed a dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment. The flexible inflation-targeting framework recognizes that, over the longer run, monetary policy can influence only inflation and not the underlying real structural aspects of the economy such as the natural rate of unemployment or maximum employment, but that monetary policy can be used to help offset shorter-run fluctuations in employment from maximum employment.\n\nThe financial crisis and Great Recession imposed large economic costs on people and businesses. To fight disinflationary pressures and economic contraction, Fed policymakers brought the policy rate to effectively zero, where it remained for seven years, and augmented their usual policy tools with unconventional tools, including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases. This was not business as usual. But now the economic expansion is firmly in place, labor markets are strong, and I expect that inflation, which has been running under our goal for quite some time, will return to our 2 percent goal on a sustained basis over the next couple of years. Nonetheless, the post-crisis economic environment is expected to differ in some important ways from the pre-crisis world.\n\nAs I've discussed elsewhere, the expected slowdown in population growth and labor force participation rates due to changes in demographics will weigh on long-run economic growth, the natural rate of unemployment, and the longer-term equilibrium interest rate.2 In fact, FOMC participants have been lowering their estimates of the fed funds rate that will be consistent with maximum employment and price stability over the longer run. The median estimate has decreased from 4 percent in March 2014 to 2.8 percent today. Empirical estimates of the equilibrium real fed funds rate, so-called r-star, while highly uncertain, are lower than in the past. So real interest rates may potentially remain lower than in past decades. If so, then there will be less room for monetary policymakers to cushion against a negative economic shock than in the past.3 Said differently, the policy rate will have a higher chance of hitting the zero lower bound, necessitating the use of nontraditional monetary policy tools more often. To the extent that these tools are less effective than the traditional interest rate tool or are constrained, the potential is for longer recessions and longer bouts of low inflation. This raises the legitimate question of whether any changes in our monetary policy framework would be helpful in maintaining macroeconomic stability in this environment. I'm not going to answer that question today. Nor am I going to discuss other government policies that could be brought to bear to increase the long-term growth rate and equilibrium interest rate, which would give monetary policy more room to act. Instead, I'm going to outline four alternative monetary policy frameworks that have received some attention and discuss some of their pros and cons.\n\nHigher Inflation Target\n\nOne alternative would be to set a higher inflation target, say, 4 percent instead of 2 percent.4 Since the equilibrium nominal fed funds rate is the sum of the inflation target and the equilibrium real rate, a higher inflation target would offset a lower equilibrium real rate and so the nominal rate would be less likely to hit the zero lower bound for any given negative shock. One advantage of this framework is that it is very familiar because it is similar to the current framework. But there are also several challenges. First, the transition could be difficult. The benefits of the higher target come only if the public views the increase as permanent so that inflation expectations rise to the new higher target. But inflation expectations are reasonably well anchored at 2 percent, so raising expectations would not necessarily be easy to do. Second, a higher level of inflation may be associated with higher inflation volatility and with higher inflation risk premia, neither of which is desirable. Third, it isn't clear whether an inflation rate at 4 percent should be viewed as consistent with the Fed's mandate of price stability. If, for this reason, one then opted to raise the target to 3 percent instead, this would add only modest room for keeping the policy rate from the zero lower bound. And finally, one would need to evaluate whether the gain from avoiding the zero lower bound when a negative shock hits the economy outweighs the costs of running a higher level of inflation at all times, remembering that much of the economy is not indexed to inflation.\n\nPrice-Level Targeting\n\nA second alternative framework involves targeting a path for the nominal level of prices rather than inflation, which is the growth rate of prices. Inflation targeting lets bygones-be-bygones: it does not make up for past deviations of inflation from target. Instead, the inflation-targeting policymaker just tries to bring inflation back to target. For example, if inflation has run low for a time (so that the price level falls below its targeted price path), the inflation-targeting policymaker would aim to move the inflation rate back up to its target rate and allow the price level to remain at a level permanently below its targeted path. In contrast, price-level targeting makes up for past deviations of the price level from its path.5 If inflation has run low so that the price level has fallen below its targeted path, the price-level targeter would try to move the price level back up to path, and this would entail inflation running high for a while. Similarly, if inflation had been running high, the inflation targeter would aim to bring it down to target, while a price-level targeter would aim to bring the price level back down to its targeted path, which would mean inflation would be low for a while.\n\nThus, the price-level-targeting framework builds in a form of forward commitment, thereby affecting current economic conditions. When inflation has been running low, the framework builds in a \"low for longer\" interest-rate strategy, as the policymaker would keep rates low for longer until the price level moved back to its targeted path. The anticipation of higher inflation in the future should move inflation expectations up, and this would tend to buoy the current level of inflation and shorten the amount of time the economy spends at the zero lower bound, therefore yielding better outcomes than inflation targeting. In fact, the academic literature suggests that a price-level-targeting framework may approximate optimal monetary policy when policymakers want to minimize fluctuations in the output gap and in inflation around a target, and it can be particularly useful at the zero lower bound by putting upward pressure on inflation expectations and, thereby, downward pressure on the real rate.6 Before I talk about some challenges, let me discuss a third related framework: nominal GDP targeting.\n\nNominal GDP Targeting\n\nThis framework is similar to price-level targeting in that it targets the level of nominal GDP rather than the growth rate. Of course, nominal GDP comprises real GDP and inflation, so this framework explicitly incorporates both parts of the Fed's mandate. For example, targeting the level of nominal GDP to be on a path rising by 4 percent per year would be consistent with 2 percent inflation and 2 percent potential growth. This strategy, like price-level targeting, makes up for past deviations. But it may perform better than price-level targeting when there are supply shocks to which the policymaker would not want to respond because such supply shocks tend to push prices and real output in opposite directions, leaving nominal income stable.\n\nWhile both price-level and nominal GDP targeting have the benefit of building in some forward commitment, which is useful at the zero lower bound, there would be some challenges in implementing either framework. First, there is little international experience with such frameworks to assess how they would work in practice.7 Second, for frameworks targeting levels instead of growth rates, the starting point matters, and these frameworks are complicated by other measurement issues as well. For example, [FIGURE 1] shows the price-level path using four different starting points: the first quarters of 1990, 1995, 2001, and 2007. As you can see on the left-hand side of the chart, if the starting point is 1990Q1, the price level is essentially on its path, and if the starting point is 2001Q1, it is near its path. The other two starting points, on the right-hand side of the chart, show a larger gap.\n\nMoreover, because the level-targeting frameworks do not let bygones-be-bygones, data revisions pose a more serious issue than they do with inflation targeting (see [FIGURE 2]), and are perhaps greater for nominal GDP targeting than price-level targeting because revisions to nominal GDP tend to be larger than revisions to prices. Also, the path of the nominal GDP target depends on estimates of potential real output growth. If the nominal income target incorporates an unrealistically high estimate of potential growth, then inflation will need to be higher in order to hit the target.\n\nA third complication, and perhaps the largest, for frameworks targeting nominal levels is that the benefits depend on the public's not only understanding the framework but believing that future Committees will follow through. Explaining this unfamiliar framework to the public could be difficult. One also has to ask whether it is a credible commitment on the part of policymakers to keep interest rates low to make up for past shortfalls even when demand is growing strongly or to act to bring inflation down in the face of a supply shock by tightening policy even in the face of weak demand. If it is not credible that policymakers will do so, then the benefits of nominal level targeting will not be realized.\n\nThe final framework I'll discuss was suggested by former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke and is a hybrid between inflation targeting and price-level targeting, which tries to capture the advantages of each while minimizing the challenges.8\n\nTemporary Price-Level Targeting\n\nUnder the temporary price-level-targeting framework, monetary policymakers would target inflation in normal times, but when the policy rate fell to the zero lower bound, they would begin targeting the price level from that starting point. Under this framework, consistent with optimal monetary policy, policymakers would have a more powerful commitment at the zero lower bound than would be the case under inflation targeting. Switching to price-level targeting at the zero lower bound means that policy would be kept at zero at least until the cumulative inflation rate from the time the zero lower bound had been reached had risen back to target. Once policymakers were satisfied that this goal had been met, the policy rate could begin to rise and policymakers would revert to targeting inflation.\n\nThis framework has benefits similar to those of price-level targeting in that when monetary policy is not able to provide more stimulus because it is constrained by the zero lower bound, the framework builds in a forward commitment of easier monetary policy in the future. But this hybrid framework could be easier to communicate because it could be discussed solely in terms of the inflation goal (see [FIGURE 3]). It would also mean that some of the commitment problems of nominal level targeting, including having to make up for supply shocks that would temporarily raise inflation even if aggregate demand were low, could be avoided when away from the zero lower bound because policymakers would be targeting inflation and not the price level there. However, a drawback of the hybrid approach is that determining and communicating the timing of when to switch back to the inflation-targeting regime could be complex. Policymakers would not want to switch back prematurely, so they would need to be sure that inflation had sustainably made up for the cumulative shortfall. This would seem to involve a considerable amount of discretion, which would undermine some of the benefits of the framework.\n\nSummary\n\nIn summary, there are several alternative monetary policy frameworks that potentially offer some benefits in a low interest rate environment. None of these alternative frameworks are without challenges and we will need to evaluate whether the net benefits of any of the alternatives would outweigh those of the flexible inflation-targeting framework currently in use in the U.S. and in many other countries. Each framework is worthy of further study, and now may be an appropriate time to undertake such study because the economy is growing, labor markets are strong, and inflation is projected to move back to our goal."

            "content": "Watch video of President Mester’s address here\n\nI thank the organizers for inviting me to speak at the Cato Institute’s 35th annual monetary conference. To some of us, 35 seems relatively young, but for a conference series, it is a ripe old age. The series’ longevity underscores the important contributions it has made over the years to the public discourse on monetary economics and policy. Whether you interpret 35 as young or old depends on the context, which brings me to my topic today: demographics and their implications for the economy and policy. This might seem like an unusual topic for a Cato conference, but demographics have been on my mind, and not just because I had a birthday last month.\n\nThe word “demographics” comes from the Ancient Greek: “demo” meaning people and “graphics” meaning measurement. There is a strong tradition of studying demography as part of economics. Malthus’s writings on population growth are a part of many history-of-thought courses in economics. More recently, as the economy has moved from financial crisis and the Great Recession to sustainable expansion, attention has shifted from cyclical aspects of the economy to structural factors. In addition, as policy has begun to normalize, the question has been raised: “what is normal?” To answer such a question, we need to understand how the underlying fundamentals of the economy are evolving. A critical factor is demographics. Demographic change can influence the underlying growth rate of the economy, structural productivity growth, living standards, savings rates, consumption, and investment; it can influence the long-run unemployment rate and equilibrium interest rate, housing market trends, and the demand for financial assets. Moreover, differences in demographic trends across countries can be expected to influence current account balances and exchange rates. So to understand the global economy, it helps to understand changing demographics and the challenges they pose for monetary and fiscal policymakers.\n\nToday I will talk about some of these demographic trends and their policy implications. Of course, the views I’ll present are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nDemographic Trends\n\nUntil the early 18th century, world population grew little because high mortality rates offset high fertility rates.1 But increased knowledge and technological change in the form of advances in medicine, public health, and nutrition began to lower mortality rates. Fertility rates also began to decline. In the U.S. there were shifting preferences for smaller families because of the rising opportunity costs of having children and the higher costs of raising and educating them. The shift in population from rural to urban areas reduced the need for large families to run farms. There were changes in social norms regarding the use and availability of birth control. The baby boom in the U.S. after World War II, and the subsequent echo when the baby boom generation began having their own children, were exceptions to a generally downward trend in the birth rate. Today, the fertility rate in the U.S. is 1.88 births per woman.2 This is less than the United Nations’ estimated 2.1 replacement rate needed to keep the population stable, and it is considerably less than the fertility rate in 1900, which was over 3.3\n\nAs these demographic changes have played out, the average life expectancy in the U.S. has risen and the population has aged. Average life expectancy at birth is now nearly 80 years old, 30 years higher than it was in 1900.4 The median age of the U.S. population is approaching 38 years old, nearly 10 years older than in 1970.5 By 2050, the U.N. projects that the median age in the U.S. will be 42 years old and that the number of people age 65 or older per 100 of working-age people, those age 15 to 64, will be more than double what it was in 1970.6\n\nReflecting projections of relatively stable fertility rates and continued aging of the population, world population growth is expected to slow.7 It averaged around 2 percent per year in the latter half of the 1960s and slowed to 1.2 percent per year over 2010-2015.8 U.S. population growth, including net international migration, is expected to slow from about 0.8 percent in recent years to under 0.5 percent in 2050, with nearly two-thirds of that growth coming from net migration.9\n\nA number of advanced economies are further along in this demographic transition than the U.S. is, and the process of population aging is accelerating worldwide.10 In Japan, the population has been shrinking over the past five years, the ratio of older people to working-age people is the highest in the world, and the median age is almost 47 years old.11 Across Europe, fertility rates have been below the replacement level for some time.12 In China, the growth rate of the working-age population has slowed since the late 1980s, and partly because of its previous one-child policy, China’s population is also rapidly aging.13 The median age in China has increased from around 19 years in 1970 to 37 years in 2015.\n\nOn the other hand, many low- and middle-income countries are at a considerably earlier phase in the demographic transition, with young and faster growing populations, and rising labor force participation rates. In India, the median age is around 27 years and the annualized growth rate of the population from 2010 to 2015 has been 1.2 percent.14 The U.N. projects that, in seven years, the population of India will surpass that of China, currently, the most populous country, and that India’s population will continue to grow through 2050. Much of the increase in world population between now and 2050 is projected to be in Africa, where fertility rates remain high.\n\nThe implications of these global demographic patterns for the future of the U.S. economy are worth considering because they pose some challenges for policymakers. Indeed, the magnitude of the effects will depend on policy responses. The remainder of my talk will discuss some of the ways these changing demographics could influence the U.S. economy, in particular, labor markets and economic growth. Then I will turn to considerations for monetary, fiscal, and other government policies.\n\nDemographic Implications for Labor Markets\n\nDemographics influence the supply of labor. Typically, as mortality rates decline and people live longer, the supply of labor increases. We saw this pattern begin in the U.S. in the late 1960s and the 1970s, especially as women and the baby boomers began entering the workforce. The result was an increase in the available supply of prime-age workers, both females and males, and potential growth rates in the 3 to 4 percent range.15\n\nEven though increased life expectancy means individuals will need to work longer in order to save more for retirement, usually, population aging eventually leads to a downward trend in labor force participation in the aggregate.16 This is already happening in the U.S. Labor force participation peaked at 67.3 percent in early 2000 and fell to 66.0 percent in December 2007, as the Great Recession was beginning. Since then, it has fallen further, to 62.7 percent as of October. While some of the decline represents cyclical factors, research suggests that most of the fall in the overall participation rate can be attributed to demographics: the combination of an aging population and reduced participation rates at older ages.17\n\nAs a result of lower population growth and labor force participation, the growth of the U.S. labor force has slowed considerably, from 2.5 percent per year, on average, in the 1970s, to around 0.5 percent per year over 2010-2016. It is expected to remain near that level over the next decade.18\n\nThe changing age distribution of workers can affect not only labor force growth and participation but also the longer-run natural rate of unemployment. Older workers typically have lower unemployment rates than other age groups, and they tend to change jobs less frequently.19 Young people now make up a smaller share of the labor force. All else equal, the combination of lower quit rates for older workers and lower numbers of younger workers should imply a lower natural rate of unemployment compared to the 1990s.20 Of course, the timing and magnitude of this demographic effect are not certain because there are some counterbalancing factors, including the fact that, so far, contrary to expectations, the retirement age for older workers hasn’t changed much, the productivity of a worker varies with age, and policies such as unemployment and retirement benefits can affect labor market choices.\n\nDemographic Implications for Economic Growth\n\nThe expected slowdown in population growth and labor force participation rates will have implications for long-run economic growth and the composition of growth. The key determinants of the economy’s longer-run growth rate are labor force growth and structural productivity growth — how effectively the economy combines its labor and capital inputs to create output. Demographics suggest that labor force growth will be considerably slower than it has been in recent decades, and this will weigh on long-run economic growth.\n\nIn addition, in theory, the aging of the population may also have a negative effect on structural productivity growth. Over the past five years, labor productivity, measured by output per hour worked in the nonfarm business sector, has grown at an annual rate of only about a half of a percent; over the entire expansion, it has averaged 1 percent. While some part of the slowdown is likely cyclical, reflecting persistent effects of the Great Recession on investment spending, structural factors are also weighing on productivity growth. Older workers tend to stay longer in their jobs than younger workers, who are more likely to change jobs and employers. This allows older workers to gain deeper experience, which can be positive for productivity growth. At the same time, lower labor mobility means workers may remain in jobs that are not the best match to their skill sets. This would be a negative for productivity growth. Indeed, one study finds that both short tenures and long tenures adversely affect productivity growth.21 And historical evidence suggests a hump-shaped relationship between age and productivity, with productivity increasing when a person enters the workforce, stabilizing, and then declining toward the end of a person’s work life.22 Research also indicates that an individual’s innovative activity and scientific output peaks between the ages of 30 and 40, although that age profile has been shifting older over time.23\n\nLabor mobility and business dynamism, including the number of start-ups in key innovative sectors like high-tech, have been declining for some time.24 Whether dynamism will remain low is an open question, but the aging of the population is here to stay. So far, the magnitude of the negative effect of the aging workforce on productivity growth appears to be quite small.25 Even so, the demographics-induced slower growth of the labor force and the possible dampening effect on productivity growth suggest that longer-run output growth will likely remain below the 3 to 3.5 percent rate seen over the 1980s and 1990s, unless there is some effective countervailing policy response.26\n\nIn addition to affecting the economy’s trend growth rate, demographics will likely affect the composition of growth by shaping aggregate consumption, saving, and investment decisions. Increased longevity means that people will need to save more over their working life to fund a longer retirement period. This is especially true given the degree of underfunding of public pension plans at the state and federal levels. Demand for healthcare will continue to rise, and an aging population will place different demands on the housing sector than a younger population, affecting the demand for single- versus multi-family properties, for owning versus renting, and for residential improvements that allow older adults to age in place.27 By affecting the composition of output, changes in the age distribution have the potential to affect the business cycle. Because of its cyclical and structural implications, demographic change also has implications for monetary policy. Let me talk about three.\n\nDemographic Implications for Monetary Policy\n\nFirst, although monetary policy cannot affect the growth rate of potential output or the long-run natural rate of unemployment, it needs to take these into account as part of the economic environment, and to consider the downward pressure demographics put on both relative to their historical levels.\n\nSecond, changes in demographics could also affect the transmission mechanism of monetary policy to the economy, in particular, the strength of wealth effects versus income effects. Older people tend to hold more assets than the young and tend to be creditors while drawing down their assets to fund their consumption during retirement. Younger people tend to be borrowers but face tighter credit constraints than the old because they hold fewer assets. As the share of the population shifts from young to old, the propagation of an interest rate change through the economy is likely to change. There will be a smaller share of young borrowers able to take advantage of a decrease in interest rates but a larger share of older people who benefit from higher asset prices; similar reasoning applies for an increase in interest rates. Demographic change may mean that wealth effects become a more important channel through which monetary policy affects the economy.28\n\nA third important implication of demographic change for monetary policy is through its effect on the equilibrium long-term interest rate. FOMC participants have been lowering their estimates of the fed funds rate that will be consistent with maximum employment and price stability over the longer run. The median estimate has decreased from 4 percent in March 2014 to 2.8 percent today. And empirical estimates of the equilibrium real fed funds rate, so-called r-star, while highly uncertain, are lower than in the past.29\n\nDemographic change may be a factor in this decline to the extent that it results in a lower long-run growth rate of consumption and, therefore, of output, which is a key determinant of the longer-run equilibrium interest rate. The magnitude of any effect is difficult to determine because complicated dynamics are at work. Static analysis might suggest that as longevity increases, people will want to accumulate more assets to fund their retirements and this would put upward pressure on asset prices and, therefore, downward pressure on returns. Moreover, because people prefer to reduce their exposure to risk as they age, we might expect to see a shift toward assets with fixed returns, putting upward pressure on risk premia and downward pressure on risk-free rates.30 However, older people also tend to save less because once people reach retirement age, they need to draw down their savings and perhaps sell assets to fund their retirement. This countervailing effect from dissaving, as well as public spending on retiree benefits, would tend to put upward pressure on interest rates.31 Thus, the magnitude and even the sign of the effect of demographic change on interest rates are empirical questions.\n\nSo far, there is little evidence that demographic trends are driving large-scale shifts into fixed-income investments that would depress returns; indeed, the evidence suggests that people are under-saving for retirement.32 Historically, there appears to be only a weak correlation between age structure in the U.S. and asset returns.33\n\nUltimately, how demographics affect economic outcomes will also depend on how governments respond, so in the remainder of my time, let me discuss the implications of demographic change for fiscal and other government policies.\n\nDemographic Implications for Fiscal and Other Government Policies\n\nThe rising share of older people will put significant pressure on Social Security and Medicare in the U.S., which are structured as pay-as-you-go programs, with current workers providing support for current retirees. Other developed countries’ government pension and healthcare funds will also be stressed. Projected longer-run fiscal imbalances are unlikely to be sustainable, and it seems likely that governments will need to respond with some combination of increased borrowing, reduced benefits, increased taxes, program restructuring, and policies intended to stem the growth rate of healthcare costs.34 Longer-run fiscal sustainability will depend on what combination is used, and how effective the actions are.\n\nAccording to CBO projections, under current policy, the federal deficit as a share of GDP will more than triple over the next 30 years, from 2.9 percent in 2017 to 9.8 percent in 2047.35 During this time period, outlays for Social Security and Medicare are projected to rise from 8 percent to 12.4 percent of GDP. As a result, the federal debt-to-GDP ratio rises dramatically, from 77 percent in 2017 to 150 percent in 2047. This increase dwarfs the run-up in debt to fund World War II. The extent to which such an increase, per se, will crowd-out productive investments and lower economic growth is debatable.36 But the sovereign debt crisis in Europe over 2009-2012 shows that high debt levels can pose severe problems if investors lose faith in the ability of governments to service their debts, generating spikes in what had previously been viewed as risk-free rates.\n\nIf financing the funding shortfall through increased government borrowing is undesirable, raising taxes and reducing benefits or other expenditures are not very appealing either. Depending on how such policies are implemented, they could ultimately hurt the economy’s longer-run growth prospects, leaving the fiscal outlook even worse. Moreover, in a world where countercyclical fiscal policy is constrained, business cycle volatility could rise, and monetary policy could find itself near the zero lower bound more often, potentially requiring the use of nontraditional policy tools such as asset purchases and forward guidance in order to meet monetary policymakers’ economic objectives.37\n\nMore effective policies to overcome the effects of the aging population on fiscal imbalances would focus on reducing the rising costs of healthcare, not just on health insurance. In addition, policies that increase the growth and productivity of the workforce would address not only fiscal imbalances but the downward pressure on longer-run growth from demographics or other sources. Policies that increase immigration, not reduce it, that support continuing education, that encourage R&D and innovation, and that provide incentives so people work longer should receive attention.\n\nSummary\n\nIn summary, demographic change will result in a slower-growing and older population. This transition will likely put downward pressure on the growth rate of potential output, the natural rate of unemployment, and the long-term equilibrium interest rate. The magnitude of these effects and the timing are uncertain because they depend on complicated dynamics and the behavior of consumers and businesses. Demographic change may also affect the business cycle and the monetary policy transmission mechanism. Monetary policymakers will need to continually evaluate these structural and cyclical effects in determining appropriate policy. Demographic trends present challenges for fiscal policymakers as well. Rising fiscal imbalances are projected to lead to higher government debt-to-GDP levels, potentially putting upward pressure on interest rates, and crowding out productive investment. But steps can be taken to offset some of the negative consequences of demographic change for the economy. These include policies that focus on increasing productivity and labor force growth and that address growing fiscal imbalances."

            "content": "I thank the Brevan Howard Centre for Financial Analysis at Imperial College London and the Initiative on Central Banking and Financial Policy at Columbia University, and in particular Franklin Allen and Trish Mosser, for inviting me to speak on this panel. The views I'll provide today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nSome of you may be too young to remember the original Star Trek — the one with William Shatner playing Captain Kirk. But in a famous episode, Kirk, Spock, and McCoy find themselves on a planet whose society is modeled on gangsters from Prohibition-era Chicago.1 At one point, Kirk creates a diversion by engaging the gangsters in a card game called \"fizzbin,\" making up the rules as he goes along. Each player gets six cards, except for the dealer and the player to his right, who each get a seventh card. The second card is turned up, except on Tuesday. If you get two Jacks, you have a half fizzbin, which is good, but if you get a third Jack, you have a shronk, which is bad. A King and a two are good, except at night, when you want to get a Queen and a four instead. The aim of the game is to get a royal fizzbin, but the odds are astronomically against that. I think you get the idea.\n\nAt times, the regulatory framework that has arisen since the global financial crisis can seem like the game of fizzbin — very complicated, seemingly without rationale, and constantly changing. In such an environment, sometimes it helps to take a step back and focus on some underlying principles that should serve as a foundation for any financial regulatory framework, and that can help guide any potential changes to strengthen the framework and promote cross-country harmonization.2\n\nMy first principle, similar to Star Trek's prime directive, is that financial system regulation should be tailored to the risks imposed on the system, thereby fostering systemic resiliency. By resiliency I mean a system in which financial institutions remain strong enough to continue to lend and offer other valuable financial services throughout the ups and downs of the business cycle. The corollary is that if current regulations are not furthering this principle, they should be rethought. Similarly, if a portion of the financial system is prone to systemic problems but doesn't have adequate oversight, this situation should be rethought, too.\n\nThis principle recognizes that financial services firms provide value. Indeed, the fact that the crisis and its aftermath were very dark times for households, businesses, banks, and policymakers and that the financial system was at the heart of the crisis attests to the vital role a sound financial system plays in supporting a vibrant economy. This principle also recognizes that bank regulation and supervision should concern itself not only with the safety and soundness of individual institutions but also with the risk of the system overall. The absence of such a focus prior to the financial crisis contributed to a buildup in financial imbalances and systemic risk. The post-crisis changes made to the regulatory framework aim to strengthen resiliency by lowering the probability of another financial crisis, and by reducing the costs imposed on the rest of the economy when a large shock hits the financial system. Important components include capital requirements, liquidity requirements, stress tests, living will resolution plans, and resolution methods that allow systemically important institutions to fail without causing problems for the entire financial system. As a result of the financial crisis and these regulatory changes, banks themselves have also altered how they monitor risks and run their businesses.\n\nFocusing on risk management makes it clear that institutions posing the most systemic risk should face enhanced prudential standards and supervisory attention, while institutions not imposing costs on the rest of the financial system or creating the kinds of contagion that can put the entire financial system at risk should face a different type of oversight. Institutions should not be burdened by rules that make it more costly for them to serve their customers but do little to further the goal of a healthy and resilient financial system. For large banks, the combination of risk-based capital requirements, a leverage ratio requirement as a backstop, liquidity requirements, and annual stress testing is appropriate. But there is now some recognition that there may be opportunities to reduce regulatory burden without increasing systemic risk. In the U.S., some increase in the thresholds at which some of the enhanced requirements kick in would be reasonable, as would a reduction in the regulatory burden that has been placed on community banks.3 Some steps are already being taken. For example, in late September, the federal banking agencies issued for public comment proposed changes to the capital rules for community banks intended to simplify and reduce the burden of rules imposed by Dodd-Frank.4\n\nAt the same time, it's important not to throw the baby out with the bathwater. We learned during the financial crisis that bank capital standards were too low, that some forms of capital considered to be Tier 1 by the regulators did not protect the banks when there was a severe shock, and that neither the market nor central bank lender-of-last-resort functions were adequate to address severe liquidity problems when collateral values could not be determined. Any changes to the regulatory framework will need to heed the first principle and preserve the strength and resiliency of the financial system, which benefit the economy. It will be an ongoing challenge to strike the right balance between enhanced financial system resiliency and maintaining the system's ability to deliver economic value by innovating and taking on risk.\n\nMy second principle is that the regulatory framework must recognize that it creates incentives for financial institutions, their customers, and the regulators themselves and that market forces are always at work. A corollary is that regulations that align incentives with financial stability and that work with market forces rather than against them will likely be more effective than those that don't.\n\nUnless the incentive effects are taken into account, even well-intentioned regulations can create unintended consequences. For example, before the crisis, some part of the strong growth in financial intermediation that occurred outside of the regulated banking system was driven by the desire to avoid regulation. Regulatory requirements that differ across sectors can create distortions and undesirable outcomes, especially when activity can easily be shifted from a sector that is monitored to a sector that is difficult to monitor. Even within a regulated sector, distortions can creep in. The asset thresholds that trigger increased regulatory requirements create incentives to remain below the thresholds. To the extent that these thresholds are a good measure of systemic risk, creating such incentives can be productive. For example, some banks have taken steps to decrease the complexity of their organizations. However, if the thresholds are only loosely connected to risk, efforts to remain slightly below the thresholds and regulatory attention on these triggers are not useful.\n\nRegulatory requirements that differ across countries are perhaps even more problematic, as they can result in cross-country regulatory arbitrage and put institutions in some countries at a competitive disadvantage. For example, a growing body of research has documented that there are significant scale economies in banking that are driven by technological advantages and not by safety-net subsidies.5 Suppose policymakers in one country decide to put a limit on firm size because they believe that the potential costs of systemic risk posed by large institutions outweigh the efficiency gains. This would put the country's large banks at a competitive disadvantage in global markets unless other countries implemented similar constraints. Because the restrictions would be working against market forces given the scale economies, it is unlikely that size restrictions would be effective in the country imposing them. They would create great incentives for firms to try to evade them by moving activities outside of the more regulated sector but they would not necessarily reduce systemic risk. Risk would migrate but not be eliminated. There would need to be more intensive monitoring of both the regulated and the less-regulated sectors.\n\nThis example suggests that it is desirable to have international agreements on capital and liquidity requirements for systemically important institutions, and coordination when a cross-border institution gets into trouble. The Basel III rules have taken some aspects of capital regimes that were used only in a subset of countries and have applied them more broadly. For example, the rules include a leverage requirement, which was used in the U.S. but not in Europe prior to the crisis, and they include a liquidity requirement, which was used in a few but not many countries prior to the crisis. The hope is that international coordination leads to more effective regulatory regimes rather than forces movement to the lowest common denominator.\n\nThe example also suggests that if regulation could benefit from understanding market forces, there may also be benefits from harnessing market discipline to promote financial stability. A prerequisite for this would be increased disclosure from financial firms so that their creditors and other market participants are in a position to exert such discipline.\n\nPerhaps most important to remember is that regulators also face incentives. During the financial crisis, regulators and policymakers faced significant time-inconsistency problems when confronting systemically important financial institutions on the brink of failure. They faced a classic dilemma: either rescue the insolvent firm and create future moral hazard problems or let the firm fail and risk causing a cascade of other failures. As Ben Bernanke reportedly said: \"There are no atheists in foxholes or ideologues in financial crises.\"6 Without a credible resolution method, it is reasonable to expect that well-intentioned policymakers will be biased toward bailouts. Said simply, policymakers and regulators are people, too. Recognizing regulatory incentives should guide the design of the regulatory regime. This underscores the need for credible methods of resolving insolvent firms and of well-designed lender-of-last-resort functions that reduce perceived stigma.\n\nMy final principle is that the regulatory framework needs to be designed so that institutions, regulators, and policymakers can be held accountable for the responsibilities assigned to them. There has been a rise in skepticism about institutions since the financial crisis. This is understandable given the depth and breadth of the crisis and its aftermath, but it also suggests there is some urgency to considering how to increase accountability in productive ways. A framework that encourages regulators to be more systematic and less discretionary in how they implement regulations can help, as it sets up appropriate expectations.\n\nIn addition, while the regulatory framework needs to acknowledge that the financial structure is complex, the framework itself should only be as complex as necessary to be effective.7 The notion that \"everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler\" is often (perhaps erroneously) attributed to Albert Einstein. But it applies to regulatory regimes. A sometimes overlooked lesson from the crisis is that regulatory complexity can complicate supervision, risk monitoring, compliance, and enforcement. Too much complexity can make it harder for regulators to assess compliance and identify risk-shifting behavior, which means it is difficult to impose consequences for firms that fail to meet the standards.\n\nEqually important, complexity also makes it difficult to monitor the regulators and align their incentives to carry out effective supervision and regulation. We should always be assessing whether we would be better off with a simpler regulatory structure that is easier to implement and govern, and that is approximately right across various states of the world, even if it is never optimal in any particular state or in any particular model of the economy.\n\nIf the system is too complex to evaluate, it will be difficult for the public and their representatives to hold regulators accountable. Either there will be no accountability or the regulators and policymakers will be held accountable for every bad outcome, regardless of whether the outcome stems from poor performance on their part or not. A simpler system allows for more effective accountability.\n\nAt the same time, we should not be seduced by regulations that appear to be simple but would, in fact, be ineffective and result in unintended consequences. Because the financial system is complex and ever-changing, there will need to be some complexity in the regulatory framework. As I mentioned earlier, proposals to break up the banks or set a size limit might seem appealing as a solution to the too-big-to-fail problem, but I think this would cause unintended and counterproductive consequences.\n\nSpeaking of simplicity, the three guiding principles I have discussed — aligning regulations with systemic risk, paying attention to incentives and market forces, and increasing accountability — sound simple but are, in fact, difficult to pull off. Still, I think they deserve attention as we strive for a regulatory framework that is more effective and better able to deliver the benefits of a well-functioning financial system to the public."

            "content": "Introduction\n\nI thank the organizers for inviting me to share my views on the economy and monetary policy. This is a very opportune time for me to be here. The Federal Open Market Committee, the monetary policymaking body within the Fed, meets in less than two weeks. Traveling to Pittsburgh allows me to hear first-hand from people in this part of the Fourth Federal Reserve District, which comprises western Pennsylvania, Ohio, eastern Kentucky, and the northern panhandle of West Virginia. Of course, as an economist, I look at data and economic models to help formulate my views, but the information on emerging issues that the Cleveland Fed staff and I gather directly from contacts throughout the District is also very important in assessing how the economy is doing. The FOMC spends considerable time discussing regional economic conditions at our meetings, and this information from all across the country helps us set national monetary policy.\n\nIn addition to providing an opportunity to hear from you, my talk today also lets me explain my views on monetary policy. Congress has given the Fed its monetary policy goals of maximum employment and price stability. At the same time, Congress has also wisely granted the Fed independence in setting monetary policy in pursuit of those goals, meaning that policy decisions are insulated from short-run political considerations. But accountability must go hand in hand with that independence. I call this \"accountable independence.\" In order for the public and Congress to have the information they need to hold the Fed accountable for monetary policy decisions, it is important for Fed policymakers to regularly communicate their views. So I value this time with you today.\n\nAt this point, it is probably a good idea to remind people that the views I'll provide today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\n\nThe economic expansion is now in its ninth year, one of the longest on record. But as everyone knows, age does not always indicate maturity. It's good to remember that the economy had to climb out of a very deep hole after the financial crisis and Great Recession, and it took some time for the expansion to gain traction. Of course, there have been some ups and downs along the journey. Our thoughts are with the people in Texas and along the Gulf Coast, and all those coping with the destruction in the wake of Hurricane Harvey. We are gathering information from our contacts, but it is still too early to assess the full economic impact of the storm. Experience suggests that soon after the storm passes, clean-up and rebuilding begin, oil refineries are assessed and brought back on-line, and shipping channels reopen. These are huge undertakings and I expect we will see fortitude and resilience as this hard work proceeds. One help is that the underlying fundamentals supporting the economy remain sound. These fundamentals include accommodative monetary policy and financial conditions, a stronger U.S. banking system, improved household balance sheets and income growth, continued strength in the U.S. labor market, and improving conditions in the economies of our trading partners.\n\nOver the expansion, output growth has maintained a moderate pace of a bit more than 2 percent, on average, and I anticipate that GDP will expand over the next year or so at a pace somewhat above trend, which I estimate at 2 percent. The hurricane in the Gulf will likely dampen economic activity in the current quarter, with subsequent rebuilding efforts adding to growth in subsequent quarters. Although storms like Harvey and Irma are atypical—thank goodness—quarterly variation in the data is not unusual. Consumer spending, which makes up over two-thirds of output, slowed in the first quarter but picked up in the second quarter. The outlook for household spending remains sound. Readings on consumer sentiment and confidence remain high, but more important for spending, personal incomes are growing because labor markets continue to improve. Household balance sheets are in much better shape since the Great Recession, reflecting a combination of deleveraging and increased savings, coupled with cumulative increases in stock and house prices. Although not true for every homeowner, in the aggregate, the equity households have in housing is now back to what it was at the peak.\n\nThe recovery in the housing market has taken some time. Buyers, sellers, developers, and bankers were all wary about reentering the market, and rightfully so, given the fallout from the housing bust. But with support from low interest rates and the improved financial condition of households and lenders, we've seen a gradual increase in housing construction and sales over the expansion. In some places, demand for housing is outpacing supply, putting upward pressure on home prices, which are rising at about a 6 percent pace, on average, nationally.1 Overall, I expect activity in the housing sector to continue to expand at a sustainable pace.\n\nAn encouraging sign in the economy is the strengthening in business activity and investment this year, after subdued readings in 2015 and 2016. In recent years, oil prices and the value of the dollar have been important influences on business spending. You'll recall that there was a sharp drop in oil prices from over $100 per barrel in mid-2014 to around $30 in early 2016. This led to a sharp pullback in activity in the mining and drilling sector and its suppliers, including the steel industry. At the same time, a sharp 20 percent appreciation of the dollar hurt manufacturers and other firms dependent on exports. Since then, conditions supporting business spending have improved. The rebound in oil prices to around $50 per barrel and the rise in natural gas prices have spurred a strong recovery in mining and drilling activity. The modest appreciation in the dollar over the second half of 2016 and depreciation since the start of this year reflect improved conditions in the economies in our trading partners. This has led to a pickup in U.S. manufacturing activity and in our exports to other countries.\n\nCurrently, business sentiment remains at high levels and supportive of continued spending, but some of my business contacts report that mounting political and fiscal policy uncertainty has begun to temper some of that optimism. There are scattered reports from a few firms that they are delaying some of their planned investment until the picture becomes clearer. We'll need to keep a watch on whether this wait- and-see attitude spreads and begins to weigh more broadly on spending and investment decisions.\n\nA pullback on investments in physical and human capital or in research and development leading to innovations would be particularly troubling because these investments can have a positive effect on productivity growth, which measures how effectively the economy combines its labor and capital inputs to make output. Productivity growth is a key determinant of an economy's longer-run output growth and of living standards. But the U.S. economy has been struggling with very low productivity growth. Over the expansion, annual growth in labor productivity, measured by output per hour worked in the nonfarm business sector, has averaged 1 percent. This is a step down from the 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent pace seen over the prior two expansions. Low productivity growth, coupled with slower growth of the labor force, helps to explain why the trend economic growth rate, which I estimate at 2 percent, is lower than the 3 to 3-1/2 percent rate seen over the 1980s and 1990s. It also helps to explain why the acceleration in wages since 2013 has been relatively subdued despite the strength we've seen in labor markets and reports of shortages of qualified workers in many occupations.\n\nAs the economic expansion has progressed, firms have been adding people to their payrolls. So far this year, job increases have averaged 176,000 per month, a bit under last year's pace. This rate exceeds most estimates of trend employment growth, which fall in the range of 75,000 to 120,000 per month. The unemployment rate peaked at 10 percent after the Great Recession, but as the economy has added jobs at an above-trend pace, the unemployment rate moved down. For the past five months, the unemployment rate has stabilized, with monthly readings bouncing between 4.3 and 4.4 percent; the rate is now essentially at the lowest level reached during the last expansion. Of course, to gauge labor market conditions, we look at more than payroll employment growth and this headline measure of the unemployment rate. We examine a broad set of indicators, including job opening and turnover rates, and broader measures of the unemployment rate, such as those that include the number of part-time workers who would rather work full time and the number of people who have been discouraged from looking for a job. These measures also indicate that substantial progress has been made in the labor market. Although we may see a weaker payroll employment number for September due to the hurricane, I expect that labor market conditions will remain healthy and that over the next year the unemployment rate will stay below 4-3/4 percent, my current estimate of its longer-run rate.\n\nGranted, there is considerable uncertainty around estimates of the longer-run unemployment rate. The relatively modest acceleration in wages, from under 2 percent earlier in the expansion to 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent in recent quarters, suggests to some that there is still considerable slack in labor markets and that the longer-run unemployment rate is lower than the current rate. For me, a more salient factor in the relatively slow growth in wages is the low level of productivity growth.2 Firms have indicated that there isn't much slack in the labor market, and we are hearing more frequent reports from our labor and business contacts across a broad set of industries that businesses are having trouble finding qualified workers, both in high-skill occupations and in lower-skill jobs. Some of these firms report they are responding by raising wages and offering other benefits to attract and retain workers. These increases should eventually find their way into the aggregate compensation measures, but unless productivity growth picks up, I wouldn't expect to see a strong acceleration in wages.\n\nSo my assessment is that from the standpoint of the cyclical conditions that monetary policy can address, we have achieved the maximum employment part of the Fed's monetary policy mandate. At the same time, there are some longer-run structural issues in the labor market that cannot be addressed by monetary policy but that the country must tackle. Technological advances and globalization are changing the nature of available jobs and the skill sets needed to perform those jobs. While the overall economy will eventually benefit from these forces, many individuals and some regions are adversely affected by these structural trends. Government policies and programs and public-private partnerships can and should be brought to bear to help people gain the skills needed for jobs in the modern economy and to help communities make the transition. This is already happening in Pittsburgh. The Allegheny Conference on Community Development has published an in-depth analysis of the expected supply and demand for labor in the Pittsburgh region over the next decade and has made a number of recommendations to help the region prepare for the coming changes.3 The study drew on some of the work being conducted by the Federal Reserve System's community development function. In October, the Fed will hold a capstone conference on a collaborative initiative that has focused on reframing workforce development efforts as investments, allowing for larger-scale solutions with increased accountability for outcomes.4\n\nPrice stability is the other part of the Fed's mandate. Inflation has had its ups and downs over the expansion. It has moved up from the very low levels seen in 2015, when it was held down by falling oil and import prices. But the last couple of readings were on the weak side and inflation continues to run below the Fed's goal of 2 percent. The year-over-year increase in PCE inflation stood at 1.4 percent in July, up from about 1 percent a year ago. Most people understand why high inflation is a problem: it erodes the purchasing power of their money. But inflation that is too low is also a problem: it can lead consumers and businesses to delay purchases and it increases debt burdens, either of which could slow the economy.\n\nIn assessing where we are relative to the inflation goal, it's always a good idea to look through temporary movements in the numbers, both those above and those below our goal, and focus on where inflation is going on a sustained basis. For example, when assessing the underlying trend in inflation, we should look through a temporary increase in gasoline prices stemming from disruptions caused by Hurricane Harvey. Similarly, some of the weakness in recent inflation reports reflects special factors, like the drop in the prices of prescription drugs and cell phone service plans earlier in the year. It may take a couple more months for these factors to work themselves through, but these types of price declines aren't signaling a general downward trend in consumer prices from weak demand. Instead, they reflect supply-side factors and relative price changes. At the same time, we need to recognize that weak inflation numbers, no matter what the source, can become a problem if they start to undermine the public's expectations about future inflation. If inflation expectations were to become unanchored and began steadily declining, it would be much more difficult to raise inflation back to the Fed's goal.\n\nI don't expect the economy to get to that point, and my current assessment is that inflation will remain below our goal for somewhat longer but that the conditions remain in place for inflation to gradually return over the next year or so to our symmetric goal of 2 percent on a sustained basis. These conditions include growth that's expected to be at or slightly above trend, continued strength in the labor market, and reasonably stable inflation expectations.\n\nWe need to recognize that there are risks around any inflation projection—both upside risks, considering the current and future expected strength in labor markets, and downside risks, given the softness in recent inflation readings. In fact, inflation is difficult to forecast: based on historical forecast errors over the past 20 years, the 70 percent confidence range for forecasts of PCE inflation one year ahead is plus or minus 1 percentage point5, and a significant portion of the variation in inflation rates comes from idiosyncratic factors that can't be forecasted.6 Indeed, since the 1990s, assuming that inflation will return to 2 percent over the next one to two years has been one of the most accurate forecasts. In the recent period, this is perhaps a testament to the importance of well-anchored inflation expectations and of the FOMC's commitment to its 2 percent symmetric inflation goal. In any case, I will be scrutinizing incoming data on inflation and inflation expectations and the reports from my business contacts to help me assess the inflation outlook.\n\nAs I mentioned at the start of my talk, evaluating regional economic conditions plays an important role in setting national monetary policy, so let me spend a few minutes discussing the Pittsburgh-area economy. For some time, this region's economy has been transitioning from one that is largely dependent on steel, coal mining, and heavy industry, to one that is diversifying into health care, education, financial services, and technology.7 This is a promising development because regions that remain dependent on one particular industry have fared less well over time than those that have been able to diversify their industrial bases and adapt to changing economic forces. Nonetheless, Pittsburgh's industrial mix and the types of shocks that hit the economy played a role in how the area has fared over the expansion.\n\nThe Great Recession took its toll on the region but Pittsburgh was an early achiever in the expansion. In 2012, Pittsburgh was one of the first major U.S. metropolitan areas to see payroll jobs move back up to pre-Great Recession levels. The U.S. as a whole didn't achieve that milestone until mid-2014, and Pennsylvania, not until 2015. The unemployment rate in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area peaked at around 8-1/2 percent in 2010 and had fallen to about 5-1/4 percent by the end of 2014.\n\nBut the decline in energy prices and the appreciation of the dollar in 2014 to 2016 took a toll on the region, causing a contraction in energy exploration and production, and steel production. Though job losses in these sectors were offset by continued increases in service-sector jobs, the unemployment rate began to rise.\n\nThe good news is that once energy prices and the dollar stabilized, the unemployment rate began falling again to its current level of just over 5 percent, and overall employment began growing again. Certain sectors are still losing jobs, but the pace of job cuts in mining and drilling has slowed and job cuts in manufacturing have stabilized. Losses in these sectors are being more than offset by gains in the service sector, where we see relatively strong growth in scientific R&D jobs in the metro area.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, the FOMC will be meeting later this month to discuss the economy and decide on monetary policy. We will also be releasing a new round of economic projections, something we do four times a year. Based on the economic outlook and risks around the outlook, the FOMC has begun to normalize the stance of monetary policy by removing some of the extraordinary accommodation that was necessary in the wake of the financial crisis and Great Recession. Appropriate adjustments in monetary policy are those that will sustain the expansion, not curtail it, so that our longer-run goals of price stability and maximum employment are met and maintained.\n\nBecause we know that it takes some time for monetary policy to work itself through the economy, we can't wait until these policy goals are fully met to act. We need to assess what incoming information is telling us about where the economy is going over the medium run, and the risks around that medium-run outlook, and set policy appropriately.\n\nIn my view, if economic conditions evolve as anticipated, I believe further removal of accommodation via gradual increases in the fed funds rate will be needed and will help sustain the expansion. A gradual removal of accommodation helps avoid a build-up of risks to macroeconomic stability that could arise if the economy is allowed to overheat, as well as risks to financial stability if interest rates remain too low, encouraging investors to take on excessively risky investments in a search for yield or engendering other financial imbalances. The gradual approach to normalization allows for the kind of fluctuations we've seen in the data on the economy and inflation without having to change our strategy. I see this consistency as a positive in that it underscores our systematic approach to promoting our policy goals and it removes policy ambiguity at a time when uncertainty seems to be rising on other fronts.\n\nIt's important to notice that the gradual path I anticipate does not entail an increase at each FOMC meeting. At its July meeting, the FOMC decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1 to 1-1/4 percent. It also announced that economic conditions are expected to evolve in a way that will warrant further gradual increases; the pace of those increases will depend on what incoming information implies about the medium-run outlook.\n\nNormalizing the stance of monetary policy also means taking steps to normalize the Fed's balance sheet in terms of the size and composition of assets. To address the Great Recession, the Fed undertook several programs to purchase longer-term assets, including longer-maturity Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS). These purchases aimed to put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates once the FOMC's traditional policy tool, the fed funds rate, had been reduced to effectively zero. As a result of the purchases, the Fed's balance sheet grew, from nearly $900 billion in assets in 2007, or 6 percent of nominal GDP, to about $4.5 trillion today, or 23 percent of nominal GDP.8 In addition, the composition of the Fed's assets has changed from mainly short-term Treasury securities to mainly longer-maturity Treasuries and agency MBS. In tandem with the increase in Fed assets, there was a sizable increase in Fed liabilities, namely, depository institution deposits, or reserves, held at the Fed. Reserves have increased from about $11 billion in 2007 to over $2 trillion today. In October 2014, the Fed stopped the program to increase the size of its balance sheet, but since then, we've been reinvesting the returns from maturing securities, thereby maintaining the balance sheet's large size.\n\nThe FOMC's intention is to reduce the size of the balance sheet over time to the smallest size needed to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively and, in the longer run, to hold primarily Treasury securities.9 In June, the FOMC described its program for normalizing the balance sheet by gradually reducing the amount of reinvestments it is making in a predictable way.10 The gradual, predictable decline allows balance-sheet normalization to run in the background and monetary policy to focus on setting the appropriate level of the fed funds rate, our conventional monetary policy tool. The FOMC expects to begin implementing the program relatively soon,11 and I favor doing this in the near future. First, by design, it will be a very gradual process of decreasing the amount of assets reinvested each month, with balance sheet normalization taking several years.12 Second, the plan has been well telegraphed in advance. Both of these aspects make it less likely that we will see a sudden or sizable increase in long-term yields as a result of the announcement of the start of implementation. Indeed, in my view, other factors, including the ongoing discussions about the debt ceiling, rising geopolitical tensions, and political uncertainty, would be more likely to influence Treasury yields in the near term.\n\nRegarding the ultimate size of the balance sheet, we know the balance sheet will be larger than it was prior to the financial crisis for the simple reason that the public's demand for currency is rising over time.13 But it will also likely be considerably smaller than it is today. How much smaller depends on how the FOMC decides to implement monetary policy in the future.14 But because it will take several years to reduce the size of the balance sheet through asset run-off, there is no reason to delay the start of normalization until this decision is made.\n\nAs a final remark, it's important to remind everyone that there are risks around the economic outlook, and because of that, monetary policy is not pre-set. The confidence bands the FOMC is now providing around its economic and policy path projections are visual reminders to both the public and policymakers that there is always a lot of uncertainty around economic forecasts. Policy needs to remain systematic in how it reacts to incoming information relevant to the outlook, but not be dogmatic should the outlook indeed materially change. That said, I view the steps the FOMC is taking to gradually normalize monetary policy—both the fed funds rate and the balance sheet—as a welcome acknowledgment that the economy itself has normalized."

            "content": "Introduction\n\nI thank the Community Bankers Association of Ohio for the opportunity to speak at your annual convention and for your ongoing engagement with the Federal Reserve. That engagement actually goes back to the very beginnings of the Federal Reserve System. It might surprise some of you to know that in 1913, Elvadore Fancher, a vice president with Union National Bank of Cleveland, wrote to Congress suggesting how the regional Reserve Banks might be structured. A year later, Fancher was chosen to be the first head of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, a position in which he served for two decades.1 Today, I enjoy the fruits of the strong relationship that has developed between Ohio bankers and the Cleveland Fed. The bankers who serve on our Community Depository Institutions Advisory Council (CDIAC) and on our board of directors generously provide me with their valuable insights into regional economic and banking conditions. As you all know, community banks play a vital role in the economic health of their communities, providing creditworthy businesses the wherewithal to prosper and households the ability to improve their financial standing and quality of life. Because of their important work, community bankers are among the most knowledgeable about changes in conditions on the ground in local areas. Such information often takes much longer to show up in official statistical reports. So I find the insights gained from speaking with bankers to be especially valuable as part of the mosaic of information I use in formulating my views on appropriate monetary policy.\n\nOf course, from time to time, I also hear from community bankers about matters pertaining to banking regulation and supervision. Recently, these conversations have highlighted the burden of the regulatory changes put in place since the financial crisis. I am grateful to the bankers who willingly discuss both the economy and regulation with me, and today I would like to return the favor and provide you with some of my perspectives on both. Of course, the views I'll present today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy\n\nThe economic expansion turned eight years old this summer. It got off to a slow start from a very weak place, but now this expansion is one of the longest on record. The sustainability of the expansion through various economic shocks is a testament to the U.S. economy's resiliency, and I believe the underlying fundamentals supporting the economic expansion remain sound. While the quarterly pattern has had its share of ups and downs, it is usually a good idea to smooth through this volatility when trying to assess underlying conditions. Over the expansion, output growth has maintained a moderate pace of a bit more than 2 percent, on average. This year, growth in the first quarter was a bit soft, but it picked up in the second quarter. Favorable fundamentals should support GDP growth over the next year at somewhat above trend, which I estimate at 2 percent. These fundamentals include accommodative monetary policy and financial conditions, a sound U.S. banking system, improved household balance sheets and income growth, continued strength in the U.S. labor market, and improving conditions in the economies of our trading partners.\n\nIn 2016, the economy added over 2.2 million jobs, about 187,000 per month on average. So far this year, that strength has been sustained, with an average increase of 180,000 jobs per month. The pace is well above estimates of trend employment growth, which range from around 75,000 to 120,000 per month, depending on what one assumes about labor force participation. The trend pace of employment growth is lower than it was a few decades ago because there has been a downward trend in participation, reflecting demographic factors, including the aging of our population. The fact that the participation rate has been basically stable for the past three years in the face of a declining trend is another sign of strength in the labor market.\n\nOver the expansion, as the economy has added jobs, the unemployment rate has been moving down. The unemployment rate peaked at 10 percent after the Great Recession. In June, it stood at 4.4 percent, matching the lowest level reached in the previous expansion. In addition, broader measures of the unemployment rate, which track the number of part-time workers who would rather work full time and the number of people who have been discouraged from looking for a job, have also fallen significantly since their business cycle peaks. Given the progress that has already been made, payroll job growth is likely to slow a bit from its current pace, but I expect that over the next year the unemployment rate will stay below my estimate of its longer-run rate, which I now estimate at 4-3/4 percent. I recently lowered my estimate from 5 percent, and even though this change is not statistically significant, I thought it was time to acknowledge that even as labor markets continue to tighten, inflation has remained moderate.\n\nInflation has had its ups and downs over the expansion. It has moved up from the very low levels seen in 2015 when it was held down by falling oil and import prices. But the last couple of readings were on the weak side and inflation continues to run below the Fed's goal of 2 percent. In assessing where we are relative to the goal, it's always a good idea to look through transitory movements in the numbers, both those above and those below our goal, and focus on where inflation is going on a sustained basis. Some of the weakness in recent inflation reports reflects special factors, like the drop in the prices of prescription drugs and cell phone service plans. It may take a couple of months for these factors to work themselves through, but these types of price declines aren't signaling a general downward trend in consumer prices. I'll be scrutinizing incoming inflation data and reports from my business contacts, but at this point, my assessment is that the conditions remain in place for inflation to gradually return over the next year or so to our symmetric goal of 2 percent on a sustained basis. These conditions include growth that's expected to be at or slightly above trend, continued strength in the labor market, and reasonably stable inflation expectations.\n\nBased on the economic outlook and risks around the outlook, the Fed has begun to normalize the stance of monetary policy by removing some of the extraordinary accommodation that was necessary in the wake of the financial crisis and Great Recession. Appropriate adjustments in monetary policy are those that will sustain the expansion so that our longer-run goals of price stability and maximum employment are met and maintained. We can't wait until the goals are fully met because monetary policy affects the economy with a lag. We need to remain focused on the medium-run outlook, and risks around the outlook, assessing what incoming economic reconnaissance implies about the outlook and risks. If economic conditions evolve as anticipated, I believe further removal of accommodation via gradual increases in the fed funds rate will be needed.\n\nThe gradual path that the FOMC has communicated for some time is appropriate given the outlook will help prolong the expansion, not curtail it. A gradual removal of accommodation helps avoid a build-up of risks to macroeconomic stability that could arise if the economy is allowed to overheat, as well as risks to financial stability if interest rates remain too low and encourage investors to take on excessively risky investments in a search for yield. The gradualism has allowed us to follow a consistent strategy even as the data on the economy and inflation have shown some fluctuations. I see benefits to this consistency: it removes some ambiguity and it underscores the fact that we set monetary policy systematically, with a focus on the medium-run outlook and risks around the outlook and their implications for our policy goals.\n\nIt's important to notice that the gradual path I anticipate does not entail an increase at each FOMC meeting, and last week, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1 to 1-1/4 percent; it also announced that economic conditions are expected to evolve in a way that will warrant further gradual increases.\n\nNormalizing the stance of monetary policy also means taking steps to normalize the Fed's balance sheet in terms of the size and composition of assets. The balance sheet grew when, to address the Great Recession, the Fed undertook several programs to purchase longer-term assets, including longer-maturity Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS). These purchases aimed to put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates once the FOMC's traditional policy tool, the fed funds rate, had been reduced to effectively zero. As a result of the purchases, the Fed's balance sheet has grown from nearly $900 billion in assets in 2007 to about $4.5 trillion today, and its composition has changed from mainly short-term Treasury securities to mainly longer-maturity Treasuries and agency MBS.\n\nFrom the very start of using the nontraditional tools, the FOMC recognized it would need to eventually return to a more normal balance sheet. In June, the FOMC described its program for normalizing the balance sheet by gradually reducing the amount of reinvestments it is making in a predictable way.2 Last week, the FOMC said it expected to begin implementing the program relatively soon.3\n\nOnce started, the plan is to allow up to $6 billion a month of maturing Treasuries and $4 billion a month of principal payments of agency MBS and agency debt to run off the balance sheet. These caps would be increased by $6 billion and $4 billion per month, respectively, every three months, until they reach $30 billion per month for Treasuries and $20 billion per month for agency MBS and agency debt. Thereafter, those caps would be maintained and the balance sheet would gradually decline. The gradual, predictable decline allows balance-sheet normalization to run in the background and monetary policy to focus on setting the appropriate level of the funds rate, our conventional monetary policy tool.\n\nRegarding the ultimate size of the balance sheet, the intention is to reduce it over time to the smallest size needed to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively. We know the balance sheet will be larger than it was prior to the financial crisis for the simple reason that the public's demand for currency is rising over time.4 But it will also likely be considerably smaller than it is today. Just how much smaller depends on how the FOMC implements monetary policy in the future. The FOMC has not yet decided whether its long-run framework will be one in which bank reserves are scarce, as was the case before the financial crisis, or one in which reserves are abundant.5 However, because it will take several years to reduce the size of the balance sheet through asset run-off, the FOMC can begin normalizing the balance sheet before we have decided on the balance sheet's ultimate size.\n\nIt's important to remind everyone that there are risks around the economic outlook, and because of that, monetary policy is not pre-set. In March, the FOMC began providing confidence bands around its economic and policy path projections.6 These are visual reminders to both the public and policymakers that there is always a lot of uncertainty around economic forecasts. Policy needs to remain systematic in how it reacts to incoming information relevant to the outlook, but not be dogmatic should the outlook indeed materially change. That said, I view the steps the FOMC is taking to normalize monetary policy—both the fed funds rate and the balance sheet—as a welcome acknowledgment that the economy is transitioning back to normal after being in the abyss of the financial crisis and Great Recession.\n\nFinancial System Regulation\n\nAs everyone in this room knows, the crisis and its aftermath were very dark times for households, businesses, banks, and policymakers. That the financial system was at the heart of the crisis attests to the fact that a sound financial system is a vital part of a vibrant economy. The 2008 financial crisis exposed gaps in the regulatory and supervisory architecture in the U.S., which contributed to a buildup in financial imbalances and systemic risk. In response to the crisis, changes were made to how banks are regulated and supervised, and banks themselves have made changes in how they monitor risks and run their businesses. As a result, the U.S. financial system is considerably stronger and more resilient than it was leading up to the financial crisis. This strength and resiliency benefit the economy and must be preserved.\n\nHowever, just as the improved economy affords us the opportunity to begin to normalize monetary policy, the improved health of the banking industry makes this an opportune time to consider whether any adjustments to the regulatory and supervisory framework could make it even more effective. I won't keep you in too much suspense: the Federal Reserve and the other financial regulatory agencies are already taking steps to improve the effectiveness of their supervision. Before I discuss some of the steps that are particularly relevant for community banks, it might be helpful to review why banks are regulated and the basic approach to effective regulation.\n\nBanks play an important role in the economy by providing funding to creditworthy borrowers, both businesses and households, by offering customers methods to save and make payments, and by helping people and firms manage their financial affairs. Community banks play a crucial role in their local economies, and particularly so in many small towns and rural areas where the choices of financial services are limited.7 Small businesses rely heavily on community banks for credit, and given the important role that small businesses play in the economy, it isn't hard to see that serving these types of firms helps to promote growth.8 In addition, community banks tend to have close ties to the communities and customers they serve, and this allows them to offer products and services tailored to their customers' needs.9\n\nBut banks of all sizes are able to provide these valuable credit, payment, and financial management services because they are designed to take risks and are highly leveraged compared with nonfinancial businesses. This risk-taking and leverage raise the possibility of systemic problems that could threaten the functioning of the financial system, hurt real economic activity, and impose significant economic costs. The bank regulatory and supervisory framework is meant to address the potential problem of systemic risk, as well as the safety and soundness of individual institutions. The framework aims to foster a financial system that's resilient: one in which financial institutions remain strong enough to continue to lend and offer other valuable services through the ups and downs of the business cycle.\n\nPost-crisis regulatory changes focused on increasing resiliency in two ways: first, by lowering the probability of another financial crisis, and second, by reducing the costs imposed on the rest of the economy when a shock hits the financial system. Important components of the regulatory-supervisory framework include capital requirements, liquidity requirements, stress tests, living will resolution plans, and resolution methods that allow systemically important institutions to fail without causing problems for the entire financial system.\n\nThe focus on risk management means that institutions that pose the most systemic risk should face enhanced prudential standards and supervisory attention. The Dodd-Frank Act took a step in this direction and the Federal Reserve takes a tiered approach to banking supervision. Aligning oversight with risk helps to ensure that institutions aren't burdened by rules that make it more costly for them to serve their customers but that do little to further the goal of a healthy and resilient financial system. Community banks generally don't impose costs on the rest of the financial system or create the kinds of contagion that can put the entire financial system at risk, so their oversight should differ from that of systemically important institutions. At the same time, as the savings and loan crisis in the 1980s and the commercial real estate crisis in the late 1980s and early 1990s remind us, when many smaller institutions get in trouble at the same time, this can also harm the economy. So maintaining the safety and soundness of smaller institutions cannot be neglected. It's a matter of aligning oversight with potential risk.\n\nThis tiering of oversight by risk adds some complexity to the financial system's regulatory framework. But the U.S. financial system is quite complex and ever-changing, with various types of banks and nonbank providers of financial services. So some complexity is to be expected. To paraphrase H.L. Mencken: \"For every complex problem there is a solution that is clear, simple, and wrong.\" That said, it's important that the regulatory framework avoid excessive complexity, which can complicate supervision, risk monitoring, compliance, and enforcement. Too much complexity can make it harder for banks to understand the standards they are being asked to meet, and harder for regulators to assess compliance and overall risk. Better aligning our regulation and supervision with the risks imposed could allow simplifications without sacrificing safety, soundness, and resiliency.\n\nThe Volcker rule is perhaps an obvious example of this. Dodd-Frank generally limits banks from engaging in proprietary trading of financial instruments and investing in hedge funds and private equity funds. But the rule is quite complex. Given that community banks are not likely to participate in such activities, there doesn't appear to be much to gain from having them maintain a compliance program. So I support exempting community banks from the Volcker rule.\n\nOther simplifications are already taking place. Earlier this year, the federal banking agencies completed their decennial review of banking regulations to identify provisions that are outdated or unnecessary.10 As a result of the review, 78 guidance letters were deemed out-of-date and were eliminated, and the data-reporting requirements for small community banks were reduced and simplified, resulting in a shorter Call Report.\n\nIn addition, exam frequency has been reduced for a large set of institutions. Now, 83 percent of all insured depository institutions qualify to be examined every 18 months rather than every 12 months, as a result of a provision in the Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act that raised the asset threshold from $500 million to $1 billion.\n\nThe agencies are also working to develop a simplified capital framework for community bank organizations.11 For large banks, the combination of risk-based capital requirements, a leverage ratio requirement as a back stop, liquidity requirements, and annual stress testing is appropriate. But one has to ask whether the compliance costs faced by small community banks in adhering to a complicated risk-based capital regime outweigh the benefits in terms of safety, soundness, and financial system resiliency, compared to an alternative regime comprising a leverage ratio requirement based on high-quality capital, combined perhaps with a simplified risk-weighted capital requirement.\n\nThe guiding principle of aligning the degree of prudential oversight with risk applies not only to community banks but also to larger banks. Dodd-Frank requires that banks with assets between $10 billion and $50 billion be subject to company-run stress tests and that banks with assets of $50 billion or more be subject to annual supervisor-administered stress tests, capital planning, living will, and other enhanced prudential requirements. I support some increase in the thresholds but also believe that the combination of these requirements at systemically important banks has led to a stronger and more resilient financial system and should be maintained.12\n\nSome of the amendments I've mentioned would require legislation; others would require coordinated action across the bank regulatory agencies. But the Fed is also working to improve its own supervisory processes to make them better aligned with risk and more efficient so that speedier decisions can be made. Since 2014, the Fed has used a risk-focused consumer compliance examination framework for community banks that helps examiners focus their attention on more serious compliance issues.13 While this has been helpful, I have heard from several community bankers that it is still taking too long to close compliance examination findings. In looking at the timelines, even though some of the cases are complex, I have to agree that we can and should do a better job of reaching decisions in a reasonable period of time. Clarifying supervisors' expectations with respect to consumer compliance and community development rules would also be a good step.\n\nThe Fed is also undertaking a comprehensive review of its safety and soundness examination framework for community banks, and developing analytical tools so that we can better focus our supervisory efforts on the highest risks while reducing the regulatory burden on low-risk community banks.\n\nI hope this brief review illustrates that the Federal Reserve is committed to following the guiding principle of aligning regulatory and supervisory oversight with the level of potential risk. This will allow us to reduce undue regulatory burden without compromising the health and resiliency of the financial system, an approach that will benefit banks of all sizes and the overall economy.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe financial crisis and ensuing Great Recession took a toll on all of us. Now, the economy and financial system have returned to health, and the goal is to keep both of them there. Monetary policymakers need to set policy appropriately to ensure that the expansion continues and our policy goals of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation are met and sustained. In my view, that means continuing on the path of gradually normalizing interest rates and the balance sheet. With respect to financial regulation and supervision, it means ensuring that the financial system remains resilient, with an appropriate focus on limiting systemic risk and the costs such risks impose on the economy when they are realized, helping to ensure that banks remain sound and able to extend financial services to their communities through the ups and downs of the business cycle, and avoiding regulations that impose burdens but do not further these goals. Getting the right balance entails a tiered approach to banking supervision and regulation. This tiered approach recognizes that the risk a banking organization poses to the financial system is likely to vary according to its size, range of activities, and complexity, and so supervision and regulation should vary along these dimensions as well. The rules and oversight that apply to community banks should not be the same as those that apply to systemically important institutions.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has been taking steps to right-size its oversight of banking institutions consistent with the risks they pose to the financial system because a sound financial system conveys benefits on households and businesses. Bankers have also taken important steps to better monitor their risks so that they can better deliver services to their customers.\n\nAt the end of the day, the public will be the judge of whether we have successfully met the challenges. According to the Financial Trust Index, published by the business schools at the University of Chicago and Northwestern University, there is still a ways to go.14 While there has been some improvement since 2008, still only about 27 percent of those polled for the index said they trusted their financial institutions, broadly defined to include banks, the stock market, mutual funds, and large corporations. Lest I leave you on that disappointing note, I want to mention that the survey results differ significantly by type of institution. Nearly 60 percent of the people polled said they trusted their local bank.15 This is an encouraging sign that by focusing on safety, soundness, resiliency, and customer service, we can create a financial system that the public views as beneficial, and one that truly is."

As is clear from the many conversations we've had over the past two days — and over the past 14 years of this summit — there are no easy answers. But there are some answers, and I have confidence that your dedication, expertise, and collaboration will result in effective solutions being implemented more widely and even better solutions being devised. I hope that the discussions over the past two days have inspired you to continue the important work you are doing.\n\nToday, I want to talk about the Federal Reserve's role in the community development arena. I will touch on \"the why, the how, and the what\" of this work: why we at the Fed see our community development efforts as important to our mission of fostering a healthy economy, how we go about doing this work, and some of what we are focusing on. As always, the views I'll present are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Structure of the Fed\n\nTo begin, it helps to know a little bit about the structure of the Federal Reserve System. To say that the Fed is an \"interesting\" institution is an understatement. I've spent my career at the Fed, and I am still learning arcane things about the Fed's structure and history. The Federal Reserve System was established by an act of Congress that was signed into law in 1913. We like to say that the Federal Reserve is a decentralized central bank, which is independent within the government but not independent from the government. The structure is one of balance. Congress designed the Fed to alleviate concerns that it would become dominated by financial interests in New York or political interests in Washington or by any particular individual group. The design includes representation from the entire nation, balancing public-sector and private-sector interests, and Wall Street and Main Street concerns.\n\nThe Federal Reserve System has 12 regional Reserve Banks that are distributed across the country and a seven-member Board of Governors in Washington that oversees those Banks. The governors, who serve the public, are appointed by the president of the United States and confirmed by the Senate. The Reserve Banks also operate in the public interest. Each has a nine-member board of directors whose members are chosen in a nonpolitical process to represent business, agricultural, industrial, bank, and public interests in the Districts they serve. The nonbank directors are responsible for choosing the Bank's president, who is subject to approval by the Fed's Board of Governors. Some of the Reserve Banks also have Branches with boards, and each Reserve Bank has a number of advisory councils drawing membership from various sectors and geographies in their Districts.\n\nThis regional and balanced structure has served the country well for more than 100 years. The U.S. is very diverse, encompassing large cities, small towns, and rural areas, with a mix of different industries and occupations. The Fed's structure allows decisions on monetary policy, financial system regulation and supervision, and payments to take into account the diversity of the American economy and its people. We recognize that our policy decisions affect Main Streets and communities all across the country.\n\nAs a participant at Federal Open Market Committee meetings, I can attest to the fact that the members of the Board of Governors and Reserve Bank presidents do bring different perspectives to the table. My own perspectives are informed not only by economic and financial data and models but also by the information gleaned from a diverse set of business, consumer, and labor contacts throughout the Fourth District, which includes the state of Ohio, the western part of Pennsylvania, the eastern part of Kentucky, and the northern panhandle of West Virginia. By design, the discussions at our meetings contain a mosaic of economic information and analysis from all parts of the country. The FOMC does not suffer from group think. We come together, share our different perspectives, and work to develop a consensus to set national monetary policy in pursuit of our monetary policy goals of price stability and maximum employment, goals that Congress gave us.\n\nCongress has also given the Fed independence in making monetary policy decisions. Neither Congress nor the U.S. president has to approve monetary policy decisions, so the decisions are insulated from short-run political considerations. At the same time, the Fed is held accountable for its decisions when it regularly communicates the rationale for its policy decisions in testimony before Congress, and in policy statements, meeting minutes, reports, and speeches. This system of accountable independence has been shown to yield better policy decisions and better economic outcomes for the country. The regional, private-public structure of the Federal Reserve System helps to reinforce this system of independence and accountability by ensuring that diverse information from all sectors of the economy and all parts of the country is brought into monetary policy discussions, with the policymakers themselves distributed across the nation and not concentrated in one location.\n\nFederal Reserve System and Community Development: The Why\n\nIn addition to aiding monetary policymaking, the Fed's structure allows us to perform our other functions more effectively, too. Of course, one of those is near and dear to everyone in this room: the Federal Reserve System's role in identifying effective community development policies and best practices for promoting economic progress and access to credit in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.\n\nThe origin of the Fed's community development work lies with the passage of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) in 1977. At the time, many people thought that limited access to credit and illegal practices such as redlining contributed to the deterioration in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods throughout the U.S. The CRA was meant to help ensure equitable access to credit for all individuals and neighborhoods by reaffirming that insured depository institutions must serve the communities in which they are chartered to do business. In 19811, the Board of Governors asked each Reserve Bank to appoint a Community Affairs Officer, and from there, the Fed built a function to provide technical training and support to depository institutions to help bolster compliance with the CRA.\n\nOver time, the Fed's interest and activities in community development have grown. Partly this reflects the desire to promote consistent implementation of the CRA across the nation, recognizing that, to do this, we need a good understanding of all of the interrelated challenges facing lower-income communities. But another motivation is the fact that our community development activities at the local level, facilitated by the Fed's regional structure, have allowed us to gain valuable reconnaissance on the economic health of people and communities across our Districts. Even if the Federal Reserve, along with other federal regulators, were not charged with implementing the CRA, our community development activities would remain an important component of the Fed's work because they help us monitor the health of the economy across various segments of the population and geographies, which is an important component of setting appropriate monetary policy.\n\nThe financial crisis and ensuing recession provide a vivid illustration of this interconnectedness and the importance of local engagement. As the housing market slowed and the number of subprime mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures began to rise, the Federal Reserve began monitoring these developments more intensively. No doubt, at the beginning, we underestimated the negative effects that problems initially centered in the subprime mortgage market would ultimately have on the broader economy. However, members of the Fed's community development staff were already engaged with industry and consumer advocates who were focused on helping troubled borrowers. These staff members were able to provide first-hand knowledge and objective information to Fed policymakers, raising their awareness that the problems were not insignificant. Fed staff with expertise in mortgage markets and housing in the community development, economic research, and bank supervision functions were mobilized. Our regular contact with local organizations across the country indicated that a lack of data on delinquencies and foreclosures was impeding progress. So Federal Reserve staffs across the country began collecting data; they analyzed delinquency and foreclosure trends and helped to evaluate policies and programs aimed at aiding troubled borrowers and addressing the growing problem of foreclosures. Ohio had one of the highest foreclosure rates in the country, coupled with high numbers of vacant and abandoned properties, so the Cleveland Fed was particularly active in this analysis, working with government agencies, financial institutions, and community-based organizations — perhaps with many of you in this room.2\n\nWhile our community development work gives us insights into the economic health of communities, which helps inform our monetary policy, monetary policy is not the right tool to address the many challenges facing lower-income households and neighborhoods. What monetary policy can do is promote greater economic stability overall by focusing on price stability and maximum employment, and thereby lower the risk of recessions, which disproportionately harm the more vulnerable parts of our society. But an interconnected set of factors determines the economic vitality of households and neighborhoods, including access to credit, capital, and financial services, affordable housing, workforce development, job training and education, health and wellness services, and infrastructure, including transportation and broadband services. While monetary policy cannot address issues such as income inequality, the longer-run issues of workforce development, or the distributional effects of globalization and technological change, other government policies and private-public programs, if they are well-designed, can. This is where the Federal Reserve's community development work comes in.\n\nFederal Reserve System and Community Development: The How\n\nThe Fed is not the entity that can set these policies or implement these programs, but the Fed is committed to increasing knowledge about the economic challenges facing low- and moderate-income households and communities and helping to identify effective policies and best practices to address these challenges. I believe the structure of the Federal Reserve System gives us some advantages in doing this work. In particular, our regional structure insulates us from political influence, so we are viewed as a trusted and objective party. We hold that public trust very dearly, and always strive to maintain our credibility. That is why we aim to conduct our research with the utmost rigor and the highest quality standards, looking objectively at all sides of an issue and potential solutions. Our reputation for objectivity helps us play an important role as a \"convener\" and, I would add, as a \"catalyst.\" We all know that the issues facing lower-income regions in a dynamic economy such as ours are complex ones. Many of the solutions will be complex as well. At the very least, they will take committed and collaborative actions from various stakeholders, and probably some compromises, too.\n\nThe Fed plays a useful role here by convening forums and workshops with the groups needed to effect change. Such forums foster a common understanding of the magnitude and breadth of the issues, allow best practices to be shared, spur quicker dissemination of insights, and can catalyze action that ultimately leads to more effective economic policies and programs. The Fed values the relationships we have built with key organizations working to improve the economic outcomes of people in communities across the country. I have had the privilege of meeting with many dedicated community development practitioners and engaging with people who live and work in lower-income areas in our region. I have seen first-hand that the information my Fed colleagues and I glean from such interactions has informed our research and has helped us learn about the promising programs many of you lead throughout the country. For example, the Atlanta, Cleveland, and Philadelphia Reserve Banks' project to identify \"opportunity occupations,\" those occupations that pay higher than the median wage but don't require a bachelor's degree, grew out of our hearing repeatedly from various parties of the need for these types of jobs.3 We have also seen that practitioners and policymakers have used Federal Reserve research, so there are important synergies to be gained by actionable research coupled with convening meetings and workshops.\n\nJust as getting all stakeholders together can help yield more effective solutions, the Federal Reserve System recognizes that Reserve Banks and the Board of Governors can achieve more by working together on community development issues without sacrificing the focus each Reserve Bank has on particular issues affecting its individual District. The System-wide approach allows us to deploy resources more efficiently, to develop more in-depth expertise that can be shared, to identify those issues that loom large in many parts of the country, and to track emerging economic developments in a way that we couldn't if we weren't regionally distributed and didn't work together.\n\nFederal Reserve System and Community Development: The What\n\nI would like to spend the remainder of my time discussing some of the Fed's community development work. As I mentioned earlier, many factors influence the economic vitality of households and neighborhoods, including access to credit and capital workforce development, affordable housing, infrastructure, and health services. There is ongoing research and engagement across the Federal Reserve System in each of these topic areas — far too much work to summarize in my remaining time. One focus has been on areas of concentrated poverty, which exist in both urban and rural settings. The Minneapolis Fed's Center for Indian Country Development; the Dallas Fed's Colonias project on neighborhoods along the U.S.-Mexico border; the St. Louis Fed's Delta Communities Initiative, which is working with distressed communities across the Arkansas and Mississippi Delta regions; the efforts of the Atlanta, Cleveland, and Richmond Feds in Appalachia; and the joint efforts among several Reserve Banks in the industrial heartland and older cities have pointed to some key issues affecting the economic vitality of the people and communities in these areas. Workforce development is one of those issues that span regions, and so considerable efforts are underway across the Federal Reserve System and with our community partners to find solutions to ensure that people have access to the education and skill-development programs needed to ensure that they can be productive members of the modern workforce.4 Our activities focused on workforce development have improved our understanding of the labor market outcomes of different groups and communities and of labor markets more broadly; this work has obvious spillovers to the Fed's need to understand labor market conditions when setting monetary policy.\n\nOf course, to make progress on any of the issues facing distressed communities you need to be able to measure the scale of the problems. In addition, you need to ensure that those with funds and an interest in effecting solutions are brought together with those with effective programs in need of financing. Let me discuss some of the contributions the Fed is making in these two areas.\n\nAs was clear during the foreclosure crisis, inadequate data can be a sizable impediment to understanding challenges and finding solutions. So the Fed's community development function is providing data and analytical tools to the public. These disaggregated data help us understand emerging issues that can be masked by looking only at aggregate statistics. The Fed's Small Business Credit Survey is a good example.5 This survey started as individual surveys conducted by a few Reserve Banks, but under the New York Fed's leadership, it became a common national survey in 2016, with more than 15,000 small business respondents. This survey could not have been carried out without the 400 organizations, including chambers of commerce and economic development agencies, that partnered with the Fed to gather responses. The results allow us to track access to credit from several individual segments of the small business population, including minority-owned businesses, women-owned businesses, startups, microenterprises, and the self-employed.\n\nAnother example of data gathering is the Board of Governors' Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking, which has been conducted since 2013 and provides data to help track the economic well-being of households.6 The survey contains information on access to credit, retirement savings, student loans, and other evidence on how households are faring financially.\n\nA third example is the data provided by the Dallas Fed and Cleveland Fed on broadband access. Broadband internet access has become a necessity in our connected world, allowing for higher income growth rates and lower unemployment rates in areas with higher adoption rates.7 But both access and adoption rates vary with household income levels, with a considerably smaller proportion of lower-income households using broadband at home compared to higher-income households.8 There is also wide disparity in broadband access, especially access to higher-speed broadband, between rural and urban areas, putting the growth prospects of rural areas at a disadvantage. Recent revisions to the CRA rules recognize that a reliable communications infrastructure, such as broadband internet service, can help to revitalize or stabilize underserved nonmetropolitan middle-income areas. So depository institutions now receive credit for investing in this infrastructure for the purposes of meeting the CRA requirement of serving the needs of low- and moderate-income communities.9 The Dallas Fed produced a comprehensive guide for financial institutions to help them understand how broadband can benefit the communities they serve and how their planned investments could qualify for CRA credit. The guide includes several tables and maps, based on U.S. Census bureau data, measuring broadband access at the national level and in the Dallas Fed's District.10 The Cleveland Fed has provided similar data from the Federal Communications Commission for the Fourth District.11\n\nIn addition to data, the Federal Reserve is providing tools to help the public use the data. Let me mention three of these. Last month, the Philadelphia and Cleveland Feds released the Home Mortgage Explorer tool.12 Based on Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data, this tool allows users to track trends in mortgage lending at the national, state, metropolitan, and nonmetropolitan levels, by purpose and type of loan. Information is provided on the reasons a loan application was denied and on applicant and neighborhood income.\n\nRecently, the Chicago Fed launched the Peer City Identification Tool. This tool allows a user to easily determine which cities, among the 300 included in the data set, are experiencing similar trends or challenges along four key themes: racial and socioeconomic composition; economic change and labor market conditions; demographic and economic outlook; and housing affordability, tenure, and housing-stock age.13 The themes were determined based on areas of concern cited by city leaders in more than 200 interviews across 10 cities. Users of the tool can determine which cities among the 300 are considered peers with respect to the particular theme, and the values of the theme's indicators for each of the peer cities. The underlying data on the 28 indicators for all 300 cities are downloadable so people can use the data in other analyses as well.\n\nA third data tool, Following the Money, was created by the Atlanta and Philadelphia Feds, based on data from the Foundation Center.14 Foundation grants are becoming a more important source of funding for community development, and this tool allows the user to see the distribution of foundation grants across 366 metropolitan areas across the U.S., or for a user-defined selection from among these metro areas. Data on the grant volume per capita, on the types of activities the grants are funding, and on the number of community and economic development nonprofits in the metro areas are provided.\n\nAs the Following the Money tool reminds us, once potential solutions for challenges affecting lower-income communities are found, those solutions need to secure funding. While the Federal Reserve cannot make those investments, the Fed's community development function has been working to improve access to credit and capital by helping to match funders to those programs and projects that research has shown to be effective in helping low- and moderate-income households and communities. The Dallas Fed's work on broadband and the CRA fits this theme by giving banks guidance in determining which broadband projects are CRA-eligible.\n\nAnother very good example is the Boston Fed's Working Cities Challenge, which began in 2013.15 Boston Fed research on small and mid-sized cities that lost manufacturing employment found that \"resurgent cities,\" meaning those that successfully reinvigorated their economies, exhibited a high degree of leadership and collaboration among key institutions and individuals, including nonprofits, private citizens, corporations, and government.16 Informed by this research and designed in partnership with the Boston Fed's network of community development stakeholders, the Working Cities Challenge is a grant competition aimed at strengthening civic collaboration and partnerships to help low-income areas. Eligible cities can make one proposal for an idea or program that will unite the public, private, and nonprofit sectors, and community members in improving the lives of low- and moderate-income people in an enduring way. There are four rounds underway — two in Massachusetts, one in Rhode Island, and one in Connecticut — with $10 million in funding to be awarded. In a related effort, the San Francisco Fed is now engaged with the Strong, Prosperous, and Resilient Communities Challenge (SPARCC), which is modeled on the Working Cities Challenge.\n\nMy last example of a successful Federal Reserve effort enabling better access to funding is the Kansas City Fed's Investment Connection program.17 In their discussions with the Kansas City Fed, banks had indicated they were having trouble identifying CRA-eligible investment opportunities in their service areas, and community leaders were saying they were having trouble getting funding. Seeing a potential opportunity to improve the situation, the Kansas City Fed created the Investment Connection program. Under the program, community and economic development organizations in the District can have project proposals pre-screened by Kansas City Fed staffers to determine whether they are CRA-eligible, and then get a chance to pitch their proposals to potential funders, including banks and foundations. So far, the Kansas City Fed has facilitated connections between nearly 60 community organizations and almost 100 funders. Given the regional structure of the Federal Reserve System, a successful program like this one can now potentially be expanded into other regions.\n\nConclusion\n\nI hope that this review of \"the why, the how, and the what\" of the Federal Reserve System's community development efforts has been helpful. I have the privilege of chairing the committee that oversees the community development efforts at the Federal Reserve Banks. I can assure you that the professionals in the community development function at the Fed are dedicated to this work and realize that little could be accomplished without the productive relationships and partnerships they have with the many groups represented in this room, including government agencies, financial institutions, foundations, academia, research centers, and community-based organizations. Going forward, the Fed will continue to leverage the benefits from its regional structure. This structure allows the Reserve Banks and the Board of Governors to uncover common issues and find solutions for the challenges facing low- and moderate-income communities and individuals across the country while allowing each Reserve Bank to remain focused on the particular needs in its specific region. We look forward to our continued collaboration with you to make the economy work well for all."

            "content": "I thank the Economic Club of Minnesota for the opportunity to speak today. In looking at your website, I noticed a long list of distinguished speakers, including many from the Federal Reserve and other central banks around the world. I also discovered that John Surma, former chairman and CEO of U.S. Steel and current chair of the Cleveland Fed's Board of Directors, has addressed your group. And with my current colleague Neel Kashkari and former colleague, friend, and fellow opera lover Chris Cumming here, I feel a connection and I am honored to participate. Today, I will discuss my current outlook for the economy and my views on monetary policy. I will also talk about some longer-run issues facing the economy. Of course, these are my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\n\nThe economic expansion will celebrate its eighth birthday next month – that's 56 in dog years – which is long by historical standards. Of course, expansions don't die from old age and there is no reason to think that this one cannot continue. In fact, one of my focuses as a monetary policymaker is to set policy to meet and maintain our dual mandate goals of price stability and maximum employment. Doing so will help promote continued expansion.\n\nThe expansion got off to a slow start from a very weak place in the aftermath of the Great Recession. But the fact that the expansion has endured through a variety of economic shocks is a testament to the U.S. economy's resiliency. First quarter readings on real activity were soft, but it is not unusual to see variability in the monthly and even the quarterly data. To get a reading on where the economy is headed, it is important to smooth through the volatility and focus on underlying fundamentals. I believe the fundamentals supporting continued expansion are sound. These fundamentals include accommodative monetary policy and financial conditions, improved household balance sheets, and increases in personal income that have come from the continued strength in labor markets. In addition, although geopolitical risks remain, economic conditions in our global trading partners have improved.\n\nOf course, we always need to view things with humility: economics is not an exact science, nothing is certain, and there are upside and downside risks to my forecast. With that in mind, my modal outlook is that over the next year, the U.S. economy will expand at a pace at or slightly above its longer-run trend, which I estimate to be about 2 percent, and the unemployment rate will remain below its longer-run level, which I estimate to be about 5 percent. With appropriate adjustments in monetary policy, I believe the conditions are in place for a sustained return over the next year or so to our symmetric goal of 2 percent inflation. Let me expand a bit on growth, employment, and inflation, before turning to monetary policy.\n\nDespite the strong fundamentals, output growth in the first quarter was weak. I am not taking much of a signal about future growth from that reading. Some of the weakness reflects transitory factors like reduced spending on energy because of unseasonably warm weather early in the year. There is also likely what economists call residual seasonality in the data, meaning that even though the data are adjusted for seasonal effects, we've seen a pattern over the past several years of weak growth in the first quarter followed by stronger growth in subsequent quarters.1 I anticipate we'll see stronger consumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of output, over the rest of the year. Readings on consumer sentiment and confidence remain high, but more important for spending, personal incomes are growing. Moreover, household balance sheets have improved over time. As a result of the Great Recession, households in the aggregate lost $13 trillion in net worth, made up of financial and housing equity. The deleveraging that households undertook and their increased savings, coupled with the cumulative increase in stock and house prices over the expansion, mean that households as a group have recovered that loss and have added another $25 trillion in net worth to their balance sheets. In the aggregate, households' housing equity is now back to what it was at the peak, as the housing sector continues to gradually improve.\n\nDemand for housing is rising and is outpacing supply in some places. This mismatch between supply and demand is putting upward pressure on home prices, which are rising at about a 6 percent pace, on average, nationally, and are driving the increase in homeowners' housing equity. It shouldn't be too surprising that the housing recovery has been a moderate one. The housing boom and crash are not something anyone wants repeated. Households have been careful not to take on more mortgage debt than they can handle, and lenders are extending credit, but to those with good credit quality. Overall, I expect activity in the sector to continue to expand at a sustainable pace.\n\nBusiness activity and investment are starting to strengthen after being quite subdued last year and through much of the expansion. Part of the weakness reflected the sizable drop in oil prices from mid-2014 through early 2016, which led to a sharp pullback in the drilling and mining sectors and their suppliers. At the same time, the 20 percent appreciation of the dollar hurt manufacturers and other firms dependent on exports. Since then, conditions supporting business spending have improved. Over the past year, oil prices have been roughly stable near $50 a barrel and the dollar has appreciated only modestly. In addition, the firming in global economic growth has increased demand for U.S. exports. We've seen a pickup in the mining sector and in manufacturing, and the data on new orders suggest investment in equipment will expand further. Contacts in the Cleveland Fed District tell us that even if some of the proposals for tax reform, health insurance, infrastructure spending, and regulatory changes are delayed, they expect the business environment to remain positive and that this will translate into further increases in business spending and hiring.\n\nIn fact, labor markets have been strengthening for some time and I expect that to continue. In 2016, the economy added over 2.2 million jobs, an average of about 187,000 jobs per month. Over the first four months of this year, firms sustained that pace, with an average monthly gain of 185,000 jobs. This is a slower pace than in the two expansions in the 1980s and 1990s.2 But it's important to remember that because trend labor force participation is lower, trend employment growth is also lower. Indeed, estimates of trend employment growth range from around 75,000 to 120,000 per month, depending on the precise assumptions one makes about the participation rate. So the recent employment growth numbers are well above trend.\n\nAs the economy has added jobs, the unemployment rate has moved down. It stood at 4.4 percent in April, less than half its peak of 10 percent in late 2009 and at the lowest reading achieved in the previous expansion. Given the progress that has been made in the labor market, payroll job growth is likely to slow from its current pace, but I expect it will be sufficient to keep the unemployment rate below my estimate of its longer-run rate of 5 percent over the next two years.\n\nOther gauges of the under-utilization of labor have also improved significantly. For example, the broader U6 measure of unemployment, which includes the number of part-time workers who would rather work full time and the number of people who have been discouraged from looking for a job, has fallen to 8.6 percent, its lowest level since late 2007. The labor force participation rate has been essentially stable for the past three years. This is another sign of labor market strength because, based on demographics, the trend in the participation rate is downward.\n\nThe strengthening in the labor market has led to a gradual acceleration in wages from earlier in the recovery. For some time we have heard from our labor and business contacts across a broad set of industries that firms are having trouble finding qualified workers, both in high-skill occupations and in lower-skill jobs. More and more of these firms report they are responding by raising wages and offering other benefits to attract and retain workers. Contacts in the Cleveland Fed District expect wage increases to average about 3 percent this year, with significantly higher increases expected for highly skilled workers.\n\nOn balance, there has been a sustained cyclical recovery in labor markets since the Great Recession. There are some longer-run structural issues that the country must tackle, such as making sure people have access to the training and development needed for the jobs in the modern economy. But from the standpoint of the cyclical conditions that monetary policy can address, I believe we have achieved the maximum employment part of the Fed's monetary policy mandate.\n\nThe other part of the Fed's dual mandate is price stability. Consistent with meeting this part of the mandate over the longer run, the FOMC has set a goal of 2 percent inflation, as measured by the year-over-year change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, that is, PCE inflation. Most people understand why high inflation is a problem: it erodes the purchasing power of their money. But inflation that is too low is also a problem: it can lead consumers and businesses to delay purchases, thereby slowing the economy, and it increases debt burdens.\n\nFor some time, inflation has been running below the Fed's 2 percent goal, but over the past two years, inflation has been moving up. Measured year-over-year, headline PCE inflation stood at 1.8 percent in March, up from under 1 percent a year ago.\n\nI expect there will be some variability in the monthly data, but in determining where inflation is relative to our goal, we need to look through transitory movements in the numbers, both those below and those above our goal, and focus on where inflation is headed and where it will be maintained on a sustained basis. The inflation rate over the longer run is primarily determined by monetary policy, but we know that we can't keep actual inflation at 2 percent at each point in time; inevitably shocks hit the economy and the inflation numbers move, sometimes below our goal and sometimes above. Still, we want to take actions to keep inflation from running either persistently below or persistently above 2 percent. In other words, our goal is symmetric – it isn't a ceiling – and we aim to keep inflation at 2 percent on a sustainable basis.\n\nWith appropriate adjustments in monetary policy, I believe the conditions are in place for a sustained return over the next year or so to our symmetric goal of 2 percent inflation. These conditions include the firming in inflation that we've seen over time, reasonably stable inflation expectations, continued strength in the labor market, and growth expected to be at or slightly above trend.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nWhen I say \"appropriate adjustments in monetary policy\" I mean those that will sustain the expansion so that our longer-run goals of price stability and maximum employment are met and maintained. As I mentioned, in my view, we have met the maximum employment part of our mandate and inflation is nearing our 2 percent goal.\n\nIf economic conditions evolve as anticipated, I believe further removal of accommodation via increases in the federal funds rate will be needed. In March, the FOMC raised the target range for the fed funds rate by one-quarter percentage point to 3/4 to 1 percent, and two weeks ago, the FOMC decided to maintain this range. Both decisions are consistent with the gradual upward path of interest rates that the Committee has indicated for some time is likely to be appropriate. This upward policy path will help prolong the expansion, not curtail it. It will help avoid a build-up of risks to macroeconomic stability that could arise if the economy is allowed to overheat. It will help avoid a build-up of risks to financial stability should overly low interest rates encourage investors to take on excessively risky investments in a search for yield. It will put monetary policy in a better position to address whichever risks, whether to the upside or to the downside, are ultimately realized.\n\nGiven my outlook, I don't believe that removing accommodation calls for an increase in the fed funds rate at each meeting, but I do anticipate more than the one-increase-per-year seen in the past two years. In addition, as we continue to make progress on our goals, I think that it's important for the FOMC to remain very vigilant against falling behind, especially given the low level of interest rates and the large size of our balance sheet. We know that monetary policy affects the economy with long and variable lags, so policy actions have to be taken before our policy goals are fully met. If we delay taking further normalization steps for too long and then find ourselves in a situation where the labor market becomes unsustainably tight, price pressures become excessive, and we have to move rates up steeply, we could risk a recession. This is a bad outcome that disproportionately harms the more vulnerable parts of our society.\n\nIn addition to removing accommodation by raising interest rates, we also have to consider the Fed's balance sheet. To address the financial crisis and Great Recession, the FOMC undertook several programs to purchase longer-maturity assets. These purchases aimed at putting downward pressure on longer-term interest rates once the FOMC's traditional policy tool, the fed funds rate, had been reduced to effectively zero. As a result of the purchases, the Fed's balance sheet has grown from nearly $900 billion in assets in 2007 to about $4.5 trillion today, and its composition has changed from mainly short-term Treasury securities to agency mortgage-backed securities and longer-maturity Treasuries.\n\nCurrently, the FOMC is continuing to reinvest the proceeds of maturing Treasuries and principal payments from agency securities, essentially maintaining the balance sheet at its very large size. But normalizing the stance of policy also means taking steps to normalize the balance sheet. As indicated in the minutes of our March meeting, the FOMC is discussing its reinvestment policy, including when and how best to implement a change in reinvestments.3 Such a change should be done in a way that allows for a gradual and predictable reduction in the Fed's asset holdings so that over time the balance sheet is reduced to the smallest size needed to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively.4\n\nIn my view, if economic conditions evolve as I anticipate, I would be comfortable changing our reinvestment policy this year, with clear communication in advance about how we plan to implement the change. My preference is that once we decide on a plan, we stay with it; the fed funds rate should be our main tool for responding to changes in the outlook during normal times, with purchases of longer-term assets reserved for nontraditional times, times when we have lowered our policy rate to near zero and we need to add more monetary policy stimulus because of a deterioration in economic and financial conditions. Ending reinvestments and beginning the journey toward a smaller balance sheet composed mainly of Treasury securities will be a welcome acknowledgment that the economy has entered normal times and policy is transitioning back to normal, too.\n\nIt's important to remind everyone that there are risks around the economic outlook, and because of that, monetary policy is not pre-set. In March, the FOMC began providing confidence bands around its economic and policy path projections.5 These are visual reminders to both the public and policymakers that there is always a lot of uncertainty around economic forecasts. Policy needs to remain systematic in how it reacts to incoming information relevant to the outlook, but not be dogmatic should the outlook indeed materially change.\n\nLonger-Run Issues\n\nAstute listeners will have noticed that I didn't tell you how large the balance sheet will be or how high the fed funds rate will be once we complete normalization. That is, I haven't told you the end points. To answer those questions, we need to consider some longer-run issues.\n\nRegarding the ultimate size of the balance sheet, we do know it will be larger than it was prior to the financial crisis for the simple reason that the public's demand for currency is rising over time. But the balance sheet will also likely be considerably smaller than it is today. Just how much smaller depends on how the FOMC implements monetary policy in the future.6 Before the crisis, the FOMC kept the supply of bank reserves scarce. Making small changes in that supply by buying or selling short-term Treasuries, allowed the FOMC to ensure that the market-clearing interest rate at which banks lend reserves to each other overnight, the fed funds rate, was maintained at the FOMC's target.\n\nBut now, as a result of the Fed's large-scale asset purchases, reserves are very abundant: indeed, banks are holding around $2.3 trillion in reserves, and more than $2.1 trillion of this amount is in excess of what is required by regulation. At these levels, small changes in the supply of reserves have little effect on the fed funds rate, and the FOMC brings the fed funds rate into its target range by adjusting the rate it pays on excess reserves.\n\nEach of these systems has its strengths, and the FOMC has not yet decided which framework it will use in the long run and, therefore, what the size of the balance sheet will be at the end of the normalization process.7 However, because it will take several years to reduce the size of the balance sheet through asset run-off, the FOMC can end reinvestments before we have decided on the balance sheet's ultimate size.\n\nIn terms of where the fed funds rate will be in the longer run, one needs to consider what policy rate is consistent with maximum employment and stable inflation over the longer run. There is reason to believe that this equilibrium rate is lower now than it used to be. In fact, FOMC participants have been lowering their estimates of the longer-run fed funds rate over time. For example, in March 2014, the median estimate was 4 percent. Now it is 3 percent. The equilibrium rate is determined by the long-run rate of the growth of consumption and, therefore, of output. So where the fed funds rate will be after normalization depends on the longer-run potential growth rate of the economy.\n\nThe key determinants of the economy's longer-run growth rate are structural productivity growth – how effectively the economy combines its labor and capital inputs to create output – and labor force growth. Over the past five years, labor productivity, measured by output per hour worked in the nonfarm business sector, has grown at an annual rate of only about a half of a percent; over the entire expansion it has averaged 1 percent. This is a step down from the 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent pace seen over the prior two expansions. Some of the slowdown in productivity growth likely reflects the difficulty in measuring productivity in the service sector. Some of the slowdown is likely cyclical, reflecting persistent effects of the Great Recession, which has retarded investment spending. As the expansion continues and investment expands, it is reasonable to assume that the cyclical impediments will abate and we'll see somewhat stronger productivity growth. But structural factors are likely weighing on productivity growth, as well.\n\nOne such factor is a reduced level of economic dynamism. An enviable aspect of the U.S. economy around the globe is our spirit of innovation, entrepreneurship, ease of business entry and exit, and labor market flexibility. This dynamism has contributed to economic growth and well-being in the U.S. by allowing resources to be reallocated from less-productive to more-productive businesses and allowing workers to move up the career ladder.\n\nBut the degree of dynamism in the U.S. economy has been declining for some time. On average, over the 1990s and until the Great Recession, business start-ups accounted for about 3 percent of total employment per year.8 Since then, this share has fallen to around 2 percent.9 Since 2000, key innovative sectors like high-tech have seen a sharp slowing in the rate of start-ups.10 The decline in business and labor market dynamism is a structural factor that may be contributing to the slowdown we've seen in productivity growth.11\n\nLabor force growth, the other key determinant of long-run economic growth, is projected to be considerably slower than it has been in recent decades. In the 1970s, the labor force grew about 2 1/2 percent per year, on average, as baby boomers and women entered the work force. Labor force growth has slowed since then, rising at slightly more than 1/2 percent per year over 2010-2016. Demographic factors, including the aging of the population and a lower birth rate, suggest slow growth at about that pace will continue.12 So, longer-run output growth will likely remain below the 3 to 3-1/2 percent rate seen over the 1980s and 1990s.13\n\nMy own estimate is that longer-run growth will be about 2 percent, but I acknowledge that such estimates have wide confidence bands around them and economists hold different views about the future growth prospects of the U.S. economy.14,15 The difference in views largely stems from different assessments of the prospects for investments in technology and human capital.\n\nThose pessimistic about the future don't expect to get large productivity gains from today's innovations such as robotics, artificial intelligence, and computers, and believe that technological advances have been slowing since the 1970s. Other observers note that it is very difficult to predict where future technology is going, and they are much more optimistic that computerization, nanotechnology, genome mapping, and other advances in biology will have impacts not yet fully harnessed.16 For example, a recent article in The New Yorker describes how machine learning is being used to accurately diagnose malignancies, with the potential to displace the doctor as diagnostician – a fundamental change in the practice of medicine.17\n\nChanges in technology with widespread applicability can lead to higher levels of productivity growth and output growth, but because adapting to the changes takes time, it will take longer to see those positive effects.18 In fact, the disruption caused by technology can have negative effects at first. Workers need to retrain and some industries may be pushed out by the new technology. As the economy adapts, eventually there are gains, but not all people, industries, and communities will automatically share in the benefits.\n\nHuman capital and technology are intricately linked. For technology to enhance productivity, workers need to have the abilities and knowledge to apply it. So, technological change can induce higher investments in human capital. But the reverse is true, too. Investment in human capital may spur investment in innovation because firms are more likely to develop and adopt a new technology if they are more certain they will be able to hire workers with the requisite skills to use it. Many studies have documented the importance of investment in human capital to a nation's economic growth and well-being.19 And at the individual level, better education is correlated with higher wages and lower levels of unemployment. Moreover, research suggests that technological change is driving the rising skill premium and is affecting how work is organized. Medium-skill jobs that are more likely to involve routine, non-physical work are being handled by computers.20 This shift in the distribution of jobs helps to explain the wider gap in wages for highly skilled vs. lower skilled workers, and the increasing return to gaining the education required to obtain those skills.\n\nGlobalization in the form of lower barriers to trade is another phenomenon that influences productivity growth. Free trade enhances productivity growth by allowing countries to focus resources on their comparative advantage and by spurring competition. Globalization and technological change are linked: globalization allows new technologies to be deployed more broadly and quickly and, by increasing competition, can drive firms to create and develop new and more productive technologies.\n\nWhile globalization leads to long-run improvements in the standard of living in the aggregate, similar to technological change, it can be disruptive in the short run as production shifts to the industries in which the country has a comparative advantage and workers in the contracting sectors need to retrain or relocate to find jobs.\n\nMonetary policy cannot affect the economy's long-term growth rate. But other government policies, if they are well-designed and focused on spurring productive investments in human and physical capital, R&D, and innovation, would be helpful, and could, with sufficient time, lead to a somewhat higher longer-run growth rate.21 Policies can also help to ensure that the aggregate longer-term gains from technological change and globalization are better distributed, and that households, industries, and communities that are negatively affected are provided with some cushion to help ease the transition. Policies and programs that enable people to gain the skills needed to be productive members of the modern workforce are part of such a cushion.\n\nOn the technology side, in addition to public-private ventures for developing technological innovations, a good case can be made for expanded government support of basic science and R&D, a building block for higher productivity growth. Basic R&D has a public good aspect to it because its benefits can be widely applied throughout various parts of the economy, while an individual firm might be deterred from such investment as it cannot fully capture the returns.\n\nFinally, we should recognize that immigrants make up over 16 percent of the U.S. workforce today.22 Given U.S. demographics, immigrants will become an increasingly important source of labor supply for the U.S. This suggests that a well-thought-out immigration policy that attracts labor to the U.S. is also a necessary ingredient to support longer-run growth.\n\nIt is important for the country to tackle these longer-run issues in order to improve the economic health of individuals and communities and to maintain and enhance our future standard of living.\n\nOne of my favorite composers, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, was known for writing beautiful music but he was also an avid letter writer. In one letter, he quoted his great-grandfather, who said: \"It is a very great art to talk eloquently and well, but an equally great one is to know the right moment to stop.\" In looking at the clock, I fear I have not succeeded in either art today. So on that note, let me end here. I am happy to take your questions."

            "content": "I thank the Chicago Council on Global Affairs for this opportunity to speak about the economy and monetary policy. I was very pleased to receive this invitation from Michael Moskow. I have known Michael for quite a while now, having seen him in action around the FOMC table when he was president of the Chicago Fed and I was the director of research at the Philadelphia Fed. Michael personified what's best about the FOMC's collegial atmosphere. He was able to explain his thinking, listen to alternative views, and then persuade others about the appropriate path forward. Michael's last FOMC meeting was on August 16, 2007. It was the second unscheduled conference call that month and the FOMC discussed the profound deterioration in credit market conditions. Of course, we all know what happened to the economy after that. It is common knowledge that Michael stepped down as Chicago Fed president because he had reached the official term limit, but I'm now wondering if the timing might also reflect his very keen ability to forecast the future.\n\nAs everyone in this room knows, economic forecasting is both science and art. Today, I will discuss my outlook for the economy and my views on monetary policy. Of course, these are my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\n\nThe economic expansion turns eight years old next month. It got off to a slow start from a very weak place, but now this expansion is one of the longest on record. While the quarterly pattern has had its share of ups and downs, output growth has maintained a moderate pace of a bit more than 2 percent, on average, over the expansion. The sustainability of the expansion through various economic shocks is a testament to the U.S. economy's resiliency. While some of the recent readings on real activity have been soft, it is normal to see variability in the monthly and quarterly data.\n\nIn my view, the underlying fundamentals supporting continued expansion remain sound. These fundamentals include accommodative monetary policy and financial conditions, improved household balance sheets, and strength in the labor market that has led to increases in personal income. In addition, although geopolitical risks remain, global economic conditions have improved. Supported by accommodative monetary policy, the recovery in Europe has gained traction, with unemployment rates down and inflation moving up, and the slowdown in the Chinese economy has been more orderly and moderate than what some had feared early last year.\n\nWhile there are upside and downside risks around my forecast, my modal outlook is that over the next year, the U.S. economy will expand at a pace at or slightly above its longer-run trend, which I estimate to be about 2 percent, and the unemployment rate will move further below its longer-run level, which I estimate to be about 5 percent. With appropriate adjustments in monetary policy, I believe the conditions are in place for a sustained return over the next year or so to our symmetric goal of 2 percent inflation. Let me put this outlook into context.\n\nDespite the strong fundamentals, GDP growth in the first quarter was weak. At this point, I'm not taking much of a signal about future growth from that reading; there are reasons to think this was a transitory slowdown. We've seen a pattern over the past several years of weak growth in the first quarter followed by stronger growth in subsequent quarters. So even though the data are adjusted for seasonal effects, there appears to be some residual seasonality in the GDP data.1\n\nThe unseasonably warm weather early in the year appears to have weighed on growth, shifting spending from one quarter to another. For example, after growing strongly in the fourth quarter of last year, consumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of U.S. output, decelerated in the first quarter in part because the warm weather led to lower spending on utilities. It is usually a good idea to average through some of these ups and down when trying to detect the underlying trend. Readings on consumer sentiment and confidence remain high, but more important for spending, personal incomes are growing. So the softness in the first quarter hasn't changed my medium-run outlook, and I expect a rebound in consumer spending over the rest of the year.\n\nThe housing sector continues to gradually improve. Despite a rise in mortgage rates, demand for housing is increasing, and in some places, supply has not kept pace with demand. The months' supply of existing homes on the market has fallen to under four months, its lowest level since early 2005. Business contacts report that, in some cases, it has been difficult to find construction workers to build new supply. The mismatch between supply and demand is putting upward pressure on home prices, which are rising at about a 6 percent pace, on average, nationally.\n\nIt shouldn't be too surprising that the housing recovery has been a moderate one. The housing boom and crash are not something anyone wants to repeat. It took some time for household balance sheets and the labor market to recover to a point where households were confident enough to take on mortgage debt again. Borrowers are being careful not to take on more debt than they can handle, and lenders are extending credit, but to those with good credit quality. Multifamily housing activity has picked up more than single-family housing. Going forward, the mix between multifamily and single-family housing may differ from what it has been in the past, as both younger people and empty-nesters are drawn to urban environments, and some prefer to rent rather than buy. Overall, I expect activity in the sector to continue to expand at a sustainable pace.\n\nBusiness activity and investment are starting to strengthen after being quite subdued last year and through much of the expansion. The sizable drop in oil prices from over $100 per barrel in mid-2014 to around $30 in early 2016 led to a sharp pullback in the drilling and mining sectors and their suppliers. The 20 percent appreciation of the dollar from mid-2014 to the end of 2015 hurt manufacturers and other firms dependent on exports. But since then, conditions supporting business spending have improved. Oil prices began to firm in early 2016 and have been roughly stable near $50 per barrel since then, and the dollar has appreciated only modestly, on net, over the past year. In addition, the firming in global economic growth has increased demand for U.S. exports.\n\nU.S. business sentiment is at a very high level, but it has not translated into a surge in activity. Nonetheless, we are starting to see a pickup in business spending, driven by the improvement in underlying economic conditions. This gives me some confidence in positive momentum even if there is some downward adjustment in expectations going forward. Mining activity has increased: the number of active oil drilling rigs remains well below the level seen before the oil price drop, but has roughly doubled over the past year. National and regional manufacturing surveys suggest an improvement in activity and capital spending plans even if overall sentiment has been tempered. Even though motor vehicle production softened in March, manufacturing production was higher in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter and compared to a year ago. This is particularly good news for the Cleveland Fed and Chicago Fed Districts, which have a higher share of employment in manufacturing compared to the nation. Both regions felt the brunt of the cyclical pullback in manufacturing, as well as the longer-run shift from manufacturing to services.2 Contacts in the Cleveland Fed District tell us that even if some of the proposals for tax reform, health insurance, infrastructure spending, and regulatory changes are delayed, they expect the business environment to remain positive and that this will translate into further increases in business spending and hiring.\n\nI would welcome a pickup in business investment in plant, equipment, and research and development because investment is an important factor influencing underlying productivity growth. Structural productivity growth — how effectively the economy combines its labor and capital inputs to create output — is a key determinant of an economy's longer-run growth rate, the standard of living of its people, and wage growth. And productivity growth depends on factors like investment in human and physical capital and R&D that yields innovative products and processes.\n\nOver the past five years, labor productivity, measured by output per hour worked in the nonfarm business sector, has grown at an annual rate of only about a half of a percent; over the entire expansion it has averaged 1 percent. This is a step down from the 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent pace seen over the prior two expansions. Some of the slowdown in productivity growth likely reflects the difficulty in measuring productivity in the service sector, including health care, intellectual property, and information technology, which is becoming a larger share of the U.S. economy. Some of the slowdown is likely cyclical, reflecting persistent effects of the Great Recession. Indeed, it took a long time for investment in physical and human capital, key determinants of productivity growth, to emerge during this expansion.\n\nAs the expansion continues and investment expands, it is reasonable to assume that the cyclical impediments will abate and we'll see somewhat stronger productivity growth. This assumption underlies my expectation that longer-run growth will be 2 percent. But, in addition to measurement and cyclical issues, structural factors are likely weighing on productivity growth, as well. Monetary policy cannot address these structural issues, but other government policies, if they are well-designed and focused on spurring productive investments in human and physical capital, R&D, and innovation, would be helpful, and could, with sufficient time, lead to a somewhat higher longer-run growth rate.3\n\nAnother important determinant of long-run growth is growth in the labor force. U.S. demographic factors, including the aging of the population and a lower birth rate, especially if coupled with restrictions on immigration, suggest that labor force growth will be considerably slower than it has been in recent decades. This means longer-run growth will likely remain lower than the 3 to 3-1/2 percent rate seen over the 1980s and 1990s.4\n\nIndeed, the downward trend in the labor force participation rate is one of the factors we consider when assessing the condition of the labor market. So let me discuss labor market developments now.\n\nIn 2016, the economy added over 2.2 million jobs, about 187,000 jobs per month on average. Over the first four months of this year, firms sustained that pace, with a monthly average gain of 185,000 jobs. This is a slower pace than in the two expansions in the 1980s and 1990s.5 But it's important to remember that because trend labor force participation is lower, trend employment growth is also lower. Indeed, estimates of trend employment growth range from around 75,000 to 120,000 per month, depending on the precise assumptions one makes about labor force participation. So the recent employment growth numbers are well above trend.\n\nAs the economy has added jobs, the unemployment rate has moved down. It stood at 4.4 percent in April, less than half its peak of 10 percent in late 2009 and at the lowest reading achieved in the previous expansion. Although payroll job growth is likely to slow a bit from its current pace given the progress that has already been made in the labor market, I expect the pace will be sufficient to keep the unemployment rate below my estimate of its longer-run rate of 5 percent over the next two years.\n\nOther gauges of the under-utilization of labor have also improved significantly. For example, the broader U6 measure of unemployment, which includes the number of part-time workers who would rather work full time and the number of people who have been discouraged from looking for a job, has fallen to its lowest level since late 2007. In addition, the labor force participation rate has been essentially stable for the past three years. So relative to the downward trend, the stability we've seen in participation is actually another sign of strength in the labor market.\n\nFor much of the expansion, wage growth has been subdued compared to what we've experienced in other expansions. Partly this reflects slow productivity growth.6 Still, we have seen a gradual acceleration in wages over time as labor market conditions have strengthened. For some time we have heard from our labor and business contacts across a broad set of industries that firms are having trouble finding qualified workers, both in high-skill occupations and in lower-skill jobs. More and more of these firms are responding by raising wages and offering other benefits to attract and retain workers. Contacts in the Cleveland Fed District expect wage increases to average about 3 percent this year, with significantly higher increases expected for highly skilled workers. These anecdotal reports are showing through to the wage data, where measures such as the employment cost index and average hourly earnings have accelerated from earlier in the recovery. This is a welcome state of affairs. As one of the characters in Beethoven's opera \"Fidelio\" sings: \"If you haven't money by you, happiness is hard to find...But when it jingles round your pockets fate is at your mercy.\"\n\nOn balance, we've seen a sustained cyclical recovery in labor markets since the Great Recession. There are some longer-run structural issues that the country must tackle, such as making sure people have access to the training and development needed for the jobs in the modern economy. But from the standpoint of the cyclical conditions that monetary policy can address, I believe we have achieved the maximum employment part of the Fed's monetary policy mandate.\n\nThe other part of the Fed's dual mandate is price stability. Consistent with meeting this part of the mandate over the longer run, the FOMC has set a goal of 2 percent inflation, as measured by the year-over-year change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, that is, PCE inflation. Most people understand why high inflation is a problem: it erodes the purchasing power of their money. But inflation that is too low is also a problem: it can lead consumers and businesses to delay purchases, thereby slowing the economy, and it increases debt burdens.\n\nFor some time, inflation has been running below the Fed's 2 percent goal, but over the past two years, inflation has been moving up. In March, we saw a decline in readings on consumer price inflation. But I'm taking little signal about the future path of inflation from those numbers. They partly reflected some one-off changes, such as the decline in prices for cell phone service plans, and they came after strong readings in January and February. Measured year-over-year, headline PCE inflation stood at 1.8 percent in March, up from under 1 percent a year ago.\n\nIn determining where inflation is relative to our goal, we need to look through transitory movements in the numbers, both those below and those above our goal, and focus on where inflation is headed and where it will be maintained on a sustained basis. The inflation rate over the longer run is primarily determined by monetary policy, but we know that we can't keep actual inflation at 2 percent at each point in time; inevitably shocks hit the economy and the inflation numbers move, sometimes below our goal and sometimes above. Still, we want to take actions to keep inflation from running either persistently below or persistently above 2 percent. In other words, our goal is symmetric — it isn't a ceiling — and we aim to keep inflation at 2 percent on a sustainable basis.\n\nWith appropriate adjustments in monetary policy, I believe the conditions are in place for a sustained return over the next year or so to our symmetric goal of 2 percent inflation. These conditions include the firming in inflation that we've seen over time, reasonably stable inflation expectations, continued strength in the labor market, and growth expected to be at or slightly above trend.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nAppropriate adjustments in monetary policy are those that will sustain the expansion so that our longer-run goals of price stability and maximum employment are met and maintained. In my view, we have met the maximum employment part of our mandate and inflation is nearing our 2 percent goal. Although we live in a high-frequency world, we cannot overreact to transitory movements in incoming data; our policymaking has to focus on what changes in economic and financial conditions imply for the medium-run outlook and risks around the outlook.7\n\nIf economic conditions evolve as anticipated, I believe further removal of accommodation via increases in the federal funds rate will be needed. In March, the FOMC raised the target range for the fed funds rate by one-quarter percentage point to 3/4 to 1 percent, and last week, the FOMC decided to maintain this range. Both decisions are consistent with the gradual upward path of interest rates that the Committee has indicated for some time is likely to be appropriate to achieve and maintain our objectives, should the economy evolve as anticipated. This upward policy path will help prolong the expansion, not curtail it. It will help avoid a build-up of risks to macroeconomic stability that could arise if the economy is allowed to overheat and risks to financial stability, should overly low interest rates encourage investors to take on excessively risky investments in a search for yield. It will put monetary policy in a better position to address whichever risks, whether to the upside or downside, are ultimately realized.\n\nGiven my outlook, I don't believe that removing accommodation calls for an increase in the fed funds rate at each meeting, but I do anticipate more than the one-increase-per-year seen in the past two years. In addition, I think that it's important for the FOMC to remain very vigilant against falling behind as we continue to make progress on our goals, especially given the low level of interest rates and the large size of our balance sheet. We know that monetary policy affects the economy with long and variable lags, so policy actions have to be taken before our policy goals are fully met. If we delay too long in taking the next normalization step and then find ourselves in a situation where the labor market becomes unsustainably tight, price pressures become excessive, and we have to move rates up steeply, we could risk a recession. This is a bad outcome that disproportionately harms the more vulnerable parts of our society.\n\nIn addition to removing accommodation by raising interest rates, we also have to consider the Fed's balance sheet. To address the financial crisis and Great Recession, the FOMC undertook several programs to purchase longer-maturity assets. These purchases aimed at putting downward pressure on longer-term interest rates once the FOMC's traditional policy tool, the fed funds rate, had been reduced to effectively zero. As a result of the purchases, the Fed's balance sheet has grown from nearly $900 billion in assets in 2007 to about $4.5 trillion today, and its composition has changed from mainly short-term Treasury securities to mortgage-backed securities and longer-maturity Treasuries.\n\nNormalizing the stance of policy also means taking steps to normalize the balance sheet, and the FOMC recognized this need from the very start of using nontraditional tools. Currently, the FOMC is continuing to reinvest the proceeds of maturing Treasuries and principal payments from agency debt and mortgage-backed securities, essentially maintaining the balance sheet at its very large size. But, as indicated in the minutes of our March meeting, the FOMC is discussing its reinvestment policy, including when and how best to implement a change in reinvestments.8 Such a change should be done in a way that allows for a gradual and predictable reduction in the Fed's asset holdings so that over time the balance sheet is reduced to the smallest size needed to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively.9\n\nIn my view, if economic conditions evolve as I anticipate, I would be comfortable changing our reinvestment policy this year, with clear communication in advance about how we plan to implement the change. My preference is that once we decide on a plan, we stay with it; the fed funds rate should be our main tool for responding to changes in the outlook during normal times. Because it will take several years to reduce the size of the balance sheet through asset run-off, we can end reinvestments before we have decided on the ultimate size of the balance sheet. This decision is essentially one about our longer-run monetary policy implementation framework: do we want to operate with scarce banking reserves (the so-called corridor system) or abundant reserves (the so-called floor system)?10 Regardless of which framework is chosen, the Fed's balance sheet will be considerably smaller than it is today.\n\nI view the purchase of longer-term assets as a nontraditional tool that should be reserved for nontraditional times, times when we have lowered our policy rate to near zero and we need to add more monetary policy stimulus because of a deterioration in economic and financial conditions. Ending reinvestments and beginning the journey toward a smaller balance sheet composed mainly of Treasury securities will be a welcome acknowledgment that the economy has entered normal times and policy is transitioning back to normal, too.\n\nAcknowledging Risks\n\nIn concluding, it's important to remind everyone that there are risks around the economic outlook, and because of that, policy is not pre-set. Policy needs to remain systematic in how it reacts to incoming information relevant to the outlook, but not be dogmatic should the outlook indeed materially change.\n\nIn March, the FOMC began providing confidence bands around its economic and policy path projections.11 These are very good reminders to both the public and to policymakers that there is always a lot of uncertainty around economic forecasts. There's forecast uncertainty because the economy is constantly being buffeted by shocks, data are revised over time, and it isn't clear which model will best predict the future path of the economy.\n\nToday, I view the risks to the real economy and to inflation over the medium run — the time horizon relevant for monetary policy — as roughly balanced and see a gradual reduction in monetary policy accommodation as appropriate. I acknowledge that there are geopolitical risks out there, including tensions in North Korea and the Middle East, but these aren't the kinds of risk that preemptive monetary policy action can mitigate. Still, these types of risk need to be recognized when assessing changes in economic and financial conditions. Indeed, some of the recent downward pressure on long-term interest rates likely reflects some flight-to-quality flows in the face of rising geopolitical tensions, rather than a material re-evaluation of the modal outlook\n\nIn addition, there remains uncertainty around what fiscal and other economic policies might be forthcoming. These include changes to infrastructure spending, regulation, and policies pertaining to taxes, immigration, and trade. When one gauges the effects — both positive and negative — of any forthcoming policy changes on the outlook for growth, employment, and inflation over the short, medium, and longer runs, the devil will be in the details in terms of the size, composition, timing, and financing of such initiatives.\n\nMy view that it is appropriate to continue on our gradual path of monetary policy normalization is not dependent on fiscal policy but, instead, is based on my reading of the resiliency in the U.S. economy's underlying momentum and the progress we have made on reaching our monetary policy goals of maximum employment and price stability."

            "content": "I thank the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and DePaul University's Center for Financial Services for inviting me to participate in this Tenth Annual Risk Conference. A conference series that has lasted a decade has something going for it, and this series is no exception. The first risk conference was held in 2008, in the midst of an emerging financial crisis, when the deficiencies in risk management and measurement became all too apparent. I think we have learned a thing or two since then — at least I hope we have. One of those things is that the world is constantly moving and innovating. Financial services is no exception. Given the important role that financial services plays in the economy, it behooves all of us — providers, supervisors, regulators, and consumers — to understand the risks that are inherent in the financial system and to manage those risks effectively so that the benefits of a sound and stable financial system can be realized for all. Although the technological changes affecting the industry are accelerating, we shouldn't let that distract us from the fundamental matter of risk management. While technological change may increase some risks, it also has the potential to improve our methods of assessing risks, and we should harness its power.\n\nTechnological change is very apparent in the payments system. This morning, I will focus a large portion of my remarks on an initiative that the Federal Reserve is leading to address the rapidly changing landscape in the payments industry in the U.S. This initiative is a collaborative effort between the Fed and a broad array of private-sector participants, and aims to improve the speed, efficiency, security, and ubiquity of the U.S. payments system. I am happy to say that the effort has made significant progress and that several important milestones will be reached this year.\n\nBut before I turn to payments, it behooves me to say a little bit about the economy in which the payments system plays such an important role. I should add that what I say today about payments and about the economy are my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Underlying Fundamentals Supporting the Economic Expansion Are Sound\n\nAt its mid-March meeting, the FOMC raised the target range for the federal funds rate by one-quarter percentage point to 3/4 to 1 percent. This decision was based on the Committee's view of actual and expected economic performance, the risks around the outlook, and the progress toward our goals of maximum employment and price stability. I fully supported this further step on the path of increases in the federal funds rate that the Committee has indicated for some time is likely to be appropriate to achieve and maintain our objectives, should the economy evolve as anticipated.\n\nIn my view, the underlying fundamentals supporting the economic expansion are sound. Looking through the quarterly pattern of ups and downs, we find that output has sustained a moderate pace of about 2 percent growth, on average, over the past three years. While growth in the first quarter may come in on the weak side, I think this largely reflects transitory factors and residual seasonality in the data, and I see favorable fundamentals as supportive of GDP growth over the next year at somewhat above trend, which I estimate at 2 percent. These fundamentals include accommodative monetary policy and financial conditions, improved household balance sheets and income growth, and continued strength in the labor market.\n\nIn 2016, the economy added over 2.2 million jobs, about 187,000 per month on average. This year, that strength has been sustained, with an average increase of 237,000 jobs per month in January and February, well above estimates of trend employment growth.\n\nIn a further sign of strength, as the economy has added jobs, labor force participation has been basically stable for the past three years rather than declining like its trend, and the unemployment rate has been moving down. In February, the unemployment rate stood at 4.7 percent, less than half of its peak after the Great Recession. Although payroll job growth is likely to slow a bit from its current pace, given the progress that's already been made, it will be sufficient to put further downward pressure on the unemployment rate. I expect the unemployment rate to stay below my estimate of its longer-run rate of 5 percent over the next two years.\n\nFor a while, inflation has been running below the Fed's target of 2 percent. But inflation has picked up over the past year and is moving in the right direction. There are likely to be monthly variations in the inflation numbers as previous changes in energy and import prices roll out of our year-over-year measures, and current fluctuations roll in. In determining where we are relative to goal, we need to look through transitory movements in the numbers, both those above and those below our goal, and focus on where inflation is going on a sustained basis. The inflation rate over the longer run is primarily determined by monetary policy, and with appropriate adjustments in monetary policy, I believe the conditions are in place for a sustained return over the next year or so to our symmetric goal of 2 percent inflation. Conditions supporting the return to goal include the firmer data on inflation, reasonably stable inflation expectations, continued strength in the labor market, and growth expected to be at or slightly above trend.\n\nThe appropriate adjustments in monetary policy are those that will sustain the expansion so that our longer-run goals of price stability and maximum employment are met and maintained. If economic conditions evolve as anticipated, I believe further removal of accommodation via increases in the fed funds rate will be needed. My current assessment is that the pace of removal won't call for an increase in the fed funds rate at each meeting, but it does mean more than the one-increase-per-year seen in the past two years. This upward policy path will help prolong the expansion, not curtail it. It will help avoid a build-up of risks to macroeconomic stability that could arise if the economy is allowed to overheat, as well as risks to financial stability if interest rates remain too low and encourage investors to take on excessively risky investments in a search for yield.\n\nAlong with its rate increase, in mid-March the FOMC also announced that it was maintaining its policy of reinvesting the proceeds of maturing Treasury securities and principal payments from agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, essentially maintaining the Fed's balance sheet at its very large size. The balance sheet grew when the Fed undertook several programs to purchase longer-term assets. The FOMC used this nontraditional policy tool to address the Great Recession, once its traditional policy tool, the fed funds rate, had been reduced to effectively zero. As Chair Yellen mentioned in her press briefing, the FOMC is discussing its reinvestment policy, but no decisions have been made. If economic conditions evolve as I anticipate, I would be comfortable changing our reinvestment policy this year. I view this as consistent with our principles of policy normalization and our statement that we anticipate continuing reinvestments \"until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way.\"1 Ending reinvestments is a first step toward reducing the size of the balance sheet and returning its composition to primarily Treasury securities over time — a welcome acknowledgment that the economy and policy are transitioning back to normal.\n\nThe Payments System Is Vital to a Sound Economy\n\nI don't think anyone would disagree with the statement that a well-functioning and secure payments system is vital to a sound economy. Like highways, bridges, railroads, and water treatment plants, the payments system is a critical part of the infrastructure of our country. As the nation's central bank, the Federal Reserve has an interest in promoting the macroeconomic and financial stability of our nearly $19 trillion economy, and our oversight of the payments system has this in mind. Indeed, everyone in the country has a stake in a sound payments system. According to the Fed's latest payments study, in 2015 consumers, businesses, and government agencies executed 144 billion noncash, nonwire-transfer payments with a value of almost $178 trillion; that's an average of 550 million payments worth $680 billion per working day.2 Because the current system works well, most people have spent little time thinking about the backbone that makes these payments possible and ensures that the payments system is reliable and secure.\n\nBut with the changes brought by new technology, more people are seeking new ways to execute transactions, whether it be online or via cell phone, and they want to execute them faster. For example, the U.S. Census Bureau reports that e-commerce sales accounted for about 8 percent of total U.S. retail sales in 2016, more than double their share of 10 years ago.3 According to analysis commissioned by the Federal Reserve, about a third of consumers and three-quarters of businesses are willing to pay a fee for payments that offer faster availability to the payee.4 Demand is also rising for a more efficient way to execute payments across international borders, and to make person-to-person payments. On the supply side, we have seen an expanded set of providers, beyond traditional commercial banks, seeking to satisfy this demand for new and faster payments.\n\nOf course, innovation is nothing new. The U.S. has experienced a long history of payments system innovation, including the introduction of ATMs and debit cards, the move from paper checks to check imaging and electronic presentment, the introduction of online bill payment with the advent of the Internet, and expanded offerings of mobile banking. Some of the enhancements, like check imaging, made the system more efficient, while others, like chip credit and debit cards, made the system more secure. Yet, we have seen an increasingly rapid pace of technological change over the past several years, and this is again driving change in the industry. While the current system is working, we have to recognize that the evolution of the payments landscape has led to a fragmented patchwork of payment vehicles and providers, often lacking interoperability with one another or the ability to combine invoice information with a payment. The complexity of the payments system, involving incumbent providers, new entrants, and end users, makes it harder to coordinate payments innovations. Platforms for making payments, including ACH, check, and credit and debit card systems, are lagging behind the technological advances. The current U.S. payments system has not kept up with the evolving expectations and demands of end-user consumers and businesses. Nor has it kept up with developments in other countries that have taken steps to modernize their payments systems. According to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), nearly 20 countries have either implemented or are building systems that offer real-time or nearly real-time payments, available as near as possible to 24 hours, 7 days a week. The role the central bank played in fostering these systems differs across countries; the roles include catalyst, overseer, and/or operator.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Is Taking a Collaborative Approach to Fostering Payments Modernization\n\nThe role that the Federal Reserve is playing in our payments system initiative is broadly a leadership/catalyst role. Assessing the trends in the payments landscape, the Federal Reserve and a diverse set of industry stakeholders have come to agree that the U.S. payments system needs to evolve further and faster to support the changing nature of commerce, keep pace with the global economy, meet the changing needs of end users, and address new and ongoing threats to security. An improved payments system — one that is more efficient and also secure — has several benefits. It will contribute to public confidence, economic growth, and global competitiveness. In addition to meeting customer demand, a modernized payments system could have an added societal benefit by helping the unbanked and underbanked join the financial mainstream, thereby receiving its benefits. It could also help low-income households, small businesses, and others who need to closely manage their finances to gain faster access to their funds.\n\nIn 2015, the Federal Reserve Board and Reserve Banks published a paper laying out the strategies and tactics that the Federal Reserve is pursuing in collaboration with a broad array of payments system stakeholders to facilitate the move to a faster, more efficient, ubiquitous, and secure payments system.5 Of course, a lot of work was done before the 2015 paper was published. In 2002 and in 2012, the Fed undertook gap and opportunity assessments of the payments environment. It sought and received considerable input from the public on possible improvements to the payments system.6 That work helped frame the current initiative that seeks to achieve five outcomes: (1) a payments system that offers a safe and faster electronic solution for making a variety of personal and business payments, and one that is ubiquitous and available on demand; (2) one that is secure and resilient, so the public can have high confidence in it; (3) an efficient payments system that offers better value to consumers and businesses; (4) one that allows for cross-border payments in a more convenient, cost-effective, and timely way; and (5) a payments system that has been improved via a collaborative process involving a broad array of payment participants.7\n\nTo further this work, the Fed has taken a leadership role to spur a private-sector solution that will align private-sector interests with those of the public. We view this as consistent with our responsibility to foster a well-functioning payments system for the benefit of the public. The Fed believes that comprehensive improvement of the system for making payments end-to-end will require a comprehensive approach. It will need collaboration among and actions from a diverse set of payment stakeholders, including traditional and nontraditional payment providers, technology companies, the government, and end-user businesses and consumers. We think this collaboration will encourage ubiquitous access and widespread adoption of new payment-system capabilities, which are keys to success.\n\nNote that the Fed's initiative is not preempting or competing with other efforts already being undertaken by the industry; nor is it halting our efforts to improve the efficiency of the payment services the Fed itself provides. For example, late last year, Early Warning announced its Zelle network, a faster payments network available to mobile banking customers, and The Clearing House, a large-bank association and payments company, is working on a real-time payments system that will be available to all U.S. financial institutions and is expected to be operable this year.8 Also, last September the Federal Reserve enhanced its same-day ACH service, consistent with NACHA's (formerly, the National Automated Clearinghouse Association) new rules, which will result in wider usage of this service.9 And the Fed has also adopted new global messaging standards (ISO 20022) for wire and cross-border ACH payments to ensure better interoperability across platforms.\n\nI should note that the Fed's approach to supporting and guiding the various parties working on improving the payments system differs somewhat from approaches taken in other countries. Perhaps this is not too surprising. For one thing, the number of entities involved in the U.S. payments system is quite large. According to BIS statistics, in 2015, over 12,000 entities offered payments services to non-banks in the U.S., compared to around 160 in Australia and around 360 in the United Kingdom.10 Even if we normalize this by population, the U.S. has many more service providers: 39 per million inhabitants in the U.S., compared to under 7 in Australia and under 6 in the U.K. In addition, the Fed does not have the power to mandate a solution, nor could we implement meaningful payment improvement on our own. We recognize that many payment innovations have come from the industry. Of course, even countries that have officially mandated changes to speed the adoption of more efficient payments systems recognize the important role the industry must play. For example, the Faster Payments Service launched in the U.K. in 2008 was implemented by the private sector at the request of the government.11 The New Payments Platform for immediate low-value payments, currently being built in Australia and expected to be operational in the second half of this year, was an industry-based solution proposed after the Reserve Bank of Australia, that country's central bank, undertook a review of payments innovation and published strategic objectives it expected the payments system to meet.12\n\nConsiderable Progress Has Been Made on the Fed's Payments System Improvement Initiative\n\nStakeholder engagement has been better than we might have hoped for. Our Payments Strategy Director, Gordon Werkema, who oversees the initiative, hails from right here, the Chicago Fed, and has done a remarkable job. Two task forces were initiated in 2015 to work toward proposed solutions to our goals. In setting up the task forces, we knew it was important to have the perspectives of the diverse set of representatives with an interest in the payments system. The Faster Payments Task Force has over 300 members from eight segments, including small, medium, and large financial institutions; nonbank providers like technology companies; consumer interest organizations; government end users; business end users; and other industry segments, including regulators, rules and standards organizations, consultants, and academic institutions.13 The Payments Security Task Force has over 175 members, and it, too, includes wide stakeholder representation. These task forces are operating under the direction of steering committees and have set up a framework for ensuring that task-force decisions and work products have broad support across members. Several work streams are now underway.\n\nThe Faster Payments Task Force reached an important milestone in February 2016 when the Faster Payments Effectiveness Criteria were published.14 This set of criteria is being used to evaluate whether proposed alternative approaches would be effective in delivering a safe and ubiquitous faster payments capability. The 36 criteria fall into six categories: ubiquity, efficiency, safety, speed, legal considerations, and governance. The criteria were not intended to be a set of minimum requirements, but rather to differentiate the effectiveness of proposals across many dimensions, recognizing that many times there may be tradeoffs. For example, higher speed might entail lower security unless coupled with a mitigant.\n\nIn the next stage, participants submitted proposed solutions for faster payments. Nineteen proposals have progressed through the review process, with reviews by an independent assessment team and the members of the two task forces.\n\nIn an effort to be transparent about the process and the progress being made, in January, the Faster Payments Task Force published the first part of its final report, providing an overview of the task force's mission and process, and the motivation for the work given the payments landscape. The second part of the final report will be published this summer. It will provide details of the proposed solutions for faster payments that have been evaluated against the effectiveness criteria, as well as a discussion of challenges, opportunities, and recommendations to the industry for implementing faster payments solutions.\n\nIt is very important not to think about faster payments separately from secure payments. Indeed, each proposed faster payments solution is being assessed in terms of its security, including identity management, authentication, the security of sensitive information as the payment travels through the system, the handling of fraudulent or erroneous payments, and the robustness of the system. While the types of risks need not change with faster payments, some risks might be exacerbated. For example, while a faster payments system makes funds available to the payee much faster, settlement may still take some time. Deferred settlement means that the payee's payments system is taking on credit risk until it gets the funds from the payer's payments system. To reduce this risk, some, but not all, of the faster payments systems around the world couple real-time or near real-time settlement with faster payments.15\n\nIn addition to considering the security of the future faster payments system, the Secure Payments Task Force is also focusing on the security of the current payments system. The task force has mapped existing identity management practices in end-to-end payment flows to help discover ways to improve current practices; it has defined guiding principles for protecting sensitive data associated with payments, which could serve as the foundation for building a more comprehensive data-protection framework for the industry; and it has completed an inventory of current industry efforts to share information for fraud and risk prevention. As indicated in the January progress report, the Secure Payments Task Force plans to release further information on these initiatives later this year.16\n\nThere Is More Work to Be Done\n\nAs I mentioned, the Faster Payments Task Force will publish the second part of its final report this summer, providing evaluations of the proposed solutions in terms of their effectiveness in providing the U.S. with a faster, more efficient, ubiquitous, and secure payments system. But that's just the start of what needs to be accomplished to modernize the U.S. payments system. A lot of further work will be needed to implement solutions, and I believe it will require the same high level of collaboration across the many payments system stakeholders that has proved to be so important to the progress made to date.\n\nAt the same time, the Federal Reserve System, which has served as a catalyst for this effort, will need to consider what further steps we should take to support payments system modernization. As I mentioned earlier, central banks across the globe have played different roles in fostering their countries' efforts regarding faster and secure payments. Some have served as catalysts, others have overseen industry efforts, and others have been providers. Today, the Federal Reserve plays all three roles with respect to payments. We have been a leader and catalyst for the current initiative, we provide retail and wholesale payment services, and we have some supervisory and regulatory oversight responsibility for the payments system deriving from the fact that a well-functioning and secure payments system plays an important role in fostering macroeconomic and financial stability in the public interest.\n\nThe technological change we've experienced in recent years isn't likely to stop, so it seems prudent that we should be working to ensure that our payments system evolves in a productive way. Innovation, competition, collaboration, broad accessibility, common standards, risk management, and appropriate supervision and regulation — all are important facets of a well-functioning payments system. Indeed, as the payments system evolves, I anticipate that how we go about effectively supervising the payments system will need to evolve as well to ensure that the system remains secure, effective, and broadly accessible. As new providers enter the field, we'll need to focus on the risks rather than on the type of entity providing the service.\n\nOne way in which central banks in several countries are supporting innovation in payments systems is by providing a \"regulatory sandbox.\" Such a sandbox allows private-sector firms to test out innovative products, services, business models, or methods of delivery in a real-life environment, with some reduction in full regulatory requirements but with appropriate safeguards for consumers and the financial system in place during the experiments. The U.K. was the first country to provide such a sandbox in 2016, and several other countries, including Australia, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Singapore, also offer sandboxes.17 Regulatory sandboxes have the potential to encourage more competition and faster, more effective innovation in the payments system, by allowing new ideas to be tried out, to be made more effective through experimentation, and to be designed to better comply with consumer protections and other regulatory requirements. Even if the tested ideas aren't brought to market, finding out early on that an idea won't work would seem to be very valuable information. The industry seems to have viewed the introduction of the sandboxes favorably. For example, the regulatory sandbox in the U.K. received 69 applications for its first cohort from a wide variety of firm-types, including start-ups and incumbents, with 24 applications meeting the eligibility requirements to move on to development toward testing. Although they are in their early stages, I find the regulatory sandboxes to be an intriguing idea and will be following the results closely. They provide but one example of the type of productive collaboration that central banks and regulators can have with the payments industry.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's payments modernization efforts, which I discussed today, are another important example of the value of collaboration. As the work moves forward, the Federal Reserve is committed to facilitating collaborative efforts with payment stakeholders to foster the move to a faster, secure, efficient, and ubiquitous payments system in the U.S. on behalf of the public."

            "content": "I thank Dean Nancy Bagranoff, Professor Dean Croushore, and the University of Richmond’s Robins School of Business for the opportunity to deliver this year’s Stanley S. Watts lecture. I feel honored to join the list of distinguished speakers who have previously presented the Watts lecture. I have had the pleasure of knowing and working with Professor Croushore for many years. Through his research and analysis, Dean has made important contributions to the Federal Reserve System and to the economics profession. As a professor, he is passing on his knowledge by training the next generation of economists and business people, an important public service.\n\nThis evening, I will speak about monetary policy and the role of communications in Federal Reserve policymaking. I serve on the Federal Open Market Committee’s subcommittee on communications, so it may not be surprising that I believe communications play an essential role in monetary policy implementation. Of course, my remarks this evening will reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nLast Week’s FOMC Monetary Policy Decision and the Economic Outlook\n\nThis is an opportune time to talk about policy communications because, as I’m sure many of you know, the FOMC announced last week that it had decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate by one-quarter percentage point to 3/4 to 1 percent. This decision was based on the Committee’s view of actual and expected economic performance, the risks around the outlook, and the progress toward our goals of maximum employment and price stability. I fully supported this further step on the path of increases in the federal funds rate that the Committee has indicated for some time is likely to be appropriate to achieve and maintain our objectives, should the economy evolve as anticipated.\n\nIn my view, the underlying fundamentals supporting the economic expansion are sound. Looking through the quarterly pattern of ups and downs, we find that output has sustained a moderate pace of about 2 percent growth, on average, over the past three years. So far, based on the limited data available, tracking estimates suggest that growth in the current quarter may come in on the weak side. I am not taking much of a signal from this, as it likely reflects some transitory factors like reduced energy demand due to unseasonably warm weather early in the year and residual seasonality in the data—we’ve seen a pattern over the past several years of weak growth in the first quarter followed by stronger growth in subsequent quarters. I see favorable fundamentals as supportive of GDP growth over the next year at somewhat above trend, which I estimate at 2 percent. These fundamentals include accommodative monetary policy and financial conditions, improved household balance sheets and income growth, and continued strength in the labor market.\n\nIn 2016, the economy added over 2.2 million jobs, about 187,000 per month on average. This year, that strength has been sustained, with an average increase of 237,000 jobs per month in January and February. The pace is well above estimates of trend employment growth, which range from around 75,000 to 120,000 per month, depending on what one assumes about labor force participation. Demographic factors, including the aging of our population, have resulted in a downward trend in participation, which is one of the reasons trend employment growth is lower than it was a few decades ago. But rather than declining like its trend, the participation rate has been basically stable for the past three years. This is a further sign of strength in the labor market.\n\nAs the economy has added jobs, the unemployment rate has been moving down. In February, it stood at 4.7 percent, less than half of its peak after the Great Recession. Although payroll job growth is likely to slow a bit from its current pace, given the progress that’s already been made, it will be sufficient to put further downward pressure on the unemployment rate. I expect the unemployment rate to stay below my estimate of its longer-run rate of 5 percent over the next two years.\n\nThe other part of the Fed’s dual mandate is price stability. For a while, inflation has been running below the Fed’s target of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, that is, total PCE inflation. But inflation has picked up over the past year and is moving in the right direction. There are likely to be monthly variations in the inflation numbers as previous changes in energy and import prices roll out of our year-over-year measures, and current fluctuations roll in. In determining where we are relative to goal, we need to look through transitory movements in the numbers, both those above and those below our goal, and focus on where inflation is going on a sustained basis. The inflation rate over the longer run is primarily determined by monetary policy, and with appropriate adjustments in monetary policy, I believe the conditions are in place for a sustained return over the next year or so to our symmetric goal of 2 percent inflation. Conditions supporting the return to goal include the firmer data on inflation, reasonably stable inflation expectations, continued strength in the labor market, and growth expected to be at or slightly above trend.\n\nThe appropriate adjustments in monetary policy are those that will sustain the expansion so that our longer-run goals of price stability and maximum employment are met and maintained. If economic conditions evolve as anticipated, I believe further removal of accommodation via increases in the fed funds rate will be needed. My current assessment is that the pace of removal won’t call for an increase in the fed funds rate at each meeting, but it does mean more than the one-increase-per-year seen in the past two years. This upward policy path will help prolong the expansion, not curtail it. It will help avoid a build-up of risks to macroeconomic stability that could arise if the economy is allowed to overheat, as well as risks to financial stability if interest rates remain too low and encourage investors to take on excessively risky investments in a search for yield.\n\nAlong with its rate increase, last week the FOMC also announced that it was maintaining its policy of reinvesting the proceeds of maturing Treasury securities and principal payments from agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, essentially maintaining the Fed’s balance sheet at its very large size. The balance sheet grew when the Fed undertook several programs to purchase longer-term assets. The FOMC used this nontraditional policy tool to address the Great Recession, once its traditional policy tool, the fed funds rate, had been reduced to effectively zero. As Chair Yellen mentioned in her press briefing, the FOMC is discussing its reinvestment policy, but no decisions have been made. In my view, if economic conditions evolve as I anticipate, I would be comfortable changing our reinvestment policy this year. I view this as consistent with our principles of policy normalization and our statement that we anticipate continuing reinvestments “until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way.”1 Ending reinvestments is a first step toward reducing the size of the balance sheet and returning its composition to primarily Treasury securities over time—a welcome acknowledgment that the economy and policy are transitioning back to normal.\n\nFed Structure, Monetary Policy Independence, and Accountability\n\nI have already mentioned two important pieces of monetary policy communication, namely, the FOMC’s post-meeting statement and the Chair’s press briefing. But before I go any further, it will help if I provide a little information about the structure of the institution responsible for setting U.S. monetary policy.\n\nCongress established the Fed in 1913 to operate in the public interest to promote the health of the U.S. economy and financial system. Congress designed the Fed as a decentralized central bank, independent within the government but not independent from the government. The Fed’s design balances public-sector and private-sector interests, and Wall Street and Main Street concerns.\n\nThe Federal Reserve System has 12 regional Reserve Banks distributed across the country—including one right here in Richmond. The Reserve Banks are overseen by a seven-member Board of Governors in Washington, D.C.2 I believe the regional structure of the Federal Reserve has served the country well for more than 100 years. This design allows monetary policy decisions to take into account the diversity of the American economy and its people. Setting monetary policy is a complex undertaking, and I believe the history of the Fed has shown that better policy decisions are made when diverse information and views are considered. The Fed’s structure also helps us to carry out our other responsibilities. These include supervising and regulating banks and other important financial institutions, promoting the stability of the financial system, playing a major role in overseeing the nation’s payments system, providing certain financial services to the U.S. government, and identifying effective community development policies and best practices for promoting economic progress and access to credit in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.\n\nThe FOMC comprises the seven members of the Board of Governors, the president of the New York Fed, and four other Reserve Bank presidents, who serve on a rotating basis. As president of the Cleveland Fed, I vote every other year, as does the Chicago Fed’s president. The other presidents vote every third year. I note, though, that all Reserve Bank presidents, whether voting members at the moment or not, participate in FOMC meetings. Thus, by design, the discussions at our meetings contain a mosaic of economic information and analysis from all parts of the country. When I attend FOMC meetings, I make it a point to bring the economic information the Cleveland Fed staff and I have garnered from business, consumer, and labor contacts throughout the Fourth District, which comprises the state of Ohio, western Pennsylvania, eastern Kentucky, and the northern panhandle of West Virginia. This regional information, along with economic and financial data and analysis, plays an important part in the FOMC’s setting of national monetary policy in pursuit of our goals of maximum employment and price stability, which were given to us by Congress.\n\nWhile Congress has set the Fed’s goals, it has also wisely given the Fed independence in making monetary policy decisions in pursuit of those goals. That is, monetary policy decisions do not have to be approved by the president or Congress. This is wise because a substantial body of research and actual practice indicate that when a central bank formulates monetary policy free from short-run political interference and is held accountable for its decisions, better economic outcomes result.\n\nIndependence in setting monetary policy is worth preserving because it yields more effective policy. But accountability must go hand in hand with independence. A central bank cannot expect to remain independent from the political process unless it is transparent about the rationale for its policy decisions. It takes some time for monetary policy to affect the economy, so the public won’t be able to immediately see whether a policy action was a good one. So it is incumbent upon policymakers to explain their decisions, including their assessment of economic conditions, as well as their outlook for the economy. In other words, clear communications play a crucial role in monetary policymaking.\n\nThe Benefits of Clear Communications in Monetary Policymaking\n\nClear communications can make monetary policy more effective by helping households and businesses make better economic and financial decisions. When policymakers are clear about the goals of monetary policy and the economic information that is important in their forecasts and policy decisions, and set policy in a systematic way, the public will have a better idea of how monetary policy is likely to change as economic conditions evolve. They will have a better sense of how policy will react not only to anticipated changes in conditions but also to unanticipated economic developments. Such knowledge helps households and firms make better saving, borrowing, investment, and employment decisions.\n\nAchieving clearer monetary policy communications is better viewed as a journey rather than as a destination. Indeed, over the past two decades, the Fed has taken several steps on this journey to become more transparent, as the benefits of transparency have become better appreciated. It might surprise you to know that it wasn’t until 1994 that the FOMC began to explicitly announce changes in its fed funds rate target and later added more description about the state of the economy and the rationale for its decisions. Before 1994, there was no post-meeting FOMC statement; the public had to infer what the FOMC decided by looking at how it implemented policy through its open market operations in financial markets. Now, the post-meeting statement describes the FOMC’s view of the state of the economy and the rationale for its decisions, as well as the votes of individual members and the preferred policy choices of any dissenters. Further context for the decisions is provided in the meeting minutes, which are released by the FOMC three weeks after the meeting, and a full transcript is released with a five-year lag. Outside of the blackout period around FOMC meetings, many of the FOMC participants present speeches—like this one—in which they share their perspectives on the economy and monetary policy with the public. In fact, as a Reserve Bank president, I view myself as a public servant and believe one of my duties is to explain the rationale for my decisions to the public.\n\nIn addition to speeches, the Chair testifies before subcommittees of both houses of Congress at two regularly scheduled monetary policy hearings a year, and at additional hearings when asked. And the Chair holds press briefings after four FOMC meetings per year. These briefings, which started in 2011, allow the Chair to expand on things that are too complex to discuss in the FOMC’s relatively short post-meeting statement. The four meetings followed by press briefings are also ones at which the FOMC releases its Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP. I would like to spend the balance of my talk discussing the role of these projections in monetary policy communications and a recent enhancement the FOMC made to the SEP.\n\nThe Summary of Economic Projections\n\nThe Summary of Economic Projections, released four times a year, provides information on individual participants’ economic projections, conditional on the path of policy that each participant sees as appropriate to promoting the FOMC’s goals of price stability and maximum employment. It is worth noting that unlike private-sector forecasts, the SEP policy path projections are not policy forecasts, but rather the individual participants’ view of what constitutes appropriate policy. The projected economic variables included in the SEP are real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and core inflation, that is, inflation excluding food and energy prices, which tend to be volatile, with appropriate policy given by the federal funds rate. The projections are for the current year and for up to three additional years, and also include the participants’ estimates of the longer-run values for these variables.\n\nI believe the SEP is an important part of monetary policy communications. Because monetary policy affects the economy with a lag, policymakers need to be forward looking, and the SEP provides the public with a sense of where FOMC participants see the economy evolving and the associated policy path consistent with that outlook.\n\nOf course, it is important to put the FOMC’s projections into proper context. The economy can evolve in unexpected ways. The FOMC is not prescient, nor should we expect it to be. At the end of the year, the media often writes a story on how the economy actually fared compared to what the FOMC was projecting at the start of the year, and when the misses are large, more than one story is written. For example, according to the central tendency of the projections, at the start of 2012, FOMC participants expected real GDP growth for the year to be 2.2 to 2.7 percent. It turns out that the economy grew at only a 1.3 percent pace that year, a forecast miss of around 1.0 to 1.5 percentage points. On the other hand, participants underestimated the improvement seen in the unemployment rate in 2012. At the start of the year, they projected an unemployment rate of 8.2 to 8.5 percent by the fourth quarter, but the unemployment rate ended up lower, at 7.8 percent. The FOMC also was more optimistic about growth at the start of 2015 than what came to pass, and inflation ran below projections over 2013-2015.\n\nThe public has to hold the FOMC accountable for its performance, but it should not hold monetary policymakers to an unrealistic standard. To evaluate the performance of FOMC projections, it is important to put these forecast misses into context by remembering that even though forecast errors of this magnitude, both above and below actual outcomes, may seem large, they are the norm among economic forecasters, not the exception.3 Forecasting is a difficult task. The economy is constantly being buffeted by shocks that can lead economic conditions to evolve differently than anticipated. Moreover, our view of current economic conditions can be cloudy because many economic data are revised over time. Data revisions complicate forecasting and setting monetary policy in real time. University of Richmond’s Dean Croushore is at the forefront of economic research into how forecasters and policymakers should incorporate data revisions into their work. Another reason forecasting is difficult is what economists call “model uncertainty”: it isn’t clear which model will best predict the future path of the economy at any given time. One way to approach this model uncertainty is to average across various models to develop a forecast. From a practical policymaking standpoint, I find that looking at forecasts from several models gives me a better sense not only of the most likely forecast but also the risks around the forecast. It is important to keep in mind that around any economic forecast there is typically quite a lot of uncertainty.\n\nTo illustrate the level of uncertainty around its projections, the FOMC will now be providing charts showing confidence bands, so-called fan charts, around the median projections, something I have advocated for quite some time.4 The future is inherently uncertain, and the confidence bands will give the public a better sense of the reasonable amount of variation to expect in forecasts and in outcomes relative to projections. The confidence bands are also a helpful reminder to policymakers to remain humble about our ability to know the future with much certainty.\n\nFigures 1 to 4 show 70 percent confidence intervals (in light blue and teal) around the median projections from the FOMC’s March SEP. If the level of uncertainty is similar to that experienced in the past and the upside and downside risks around the forecast are broadly balanced, then there’s a 70 percent probability that the actual outcomes will lie within the band. For example, for real GDP growth, a 70 percent confidence interval around the forecast is about ±1.6 percentage points for this year and a little over ±2.0 percentage points for each of the following two years. The intervals tend to fan out over time because there is increasingly more opportunity for unforeseen shocks to occur. The miss of the FOMC’s early 2012 forecast that I referred to earlier was within the interval. The confidence bands around forecasts of unemployment and inflation are also pretty wide. So the FOMC’s forecast performance has been quite reasonable by this metric.\n\nThe policy path in the SEP receives considerable scrutiny. In March, there was essentially no change in the median policy path compared to December because there was little change in the economic outlook. The median projection for the federal funds rate is 1.4 percent at the end of this year, 2.1 percent at the end of next year, and 3 percent at the end of 2019, which is its median longer-run value. The SEP indicates that most participants expect that an upward path of policy will be appropriate based on their current assessment of the outlook.\n\nThe federal funds rate path differs from the other variables in the SEP because policymakers choose the path. But because there is uncertainty around the economic outlook, there is also uncertainty around the appropriate policy path. The confidence band is a reminder that the median policy path in the SEP is not meant to be a firm commitment on the part of the FOMC. Instead, policy should be expected to respond to changes in economic and financial conditions that materially affect the medium-run outlook. As you can see, the range of reasonable outcomes for the policy path is actually quite wide, and considerably wider than some of the variation we’ve seen in the SEP policy path over time, even though those small shifts have often drawn considerable media attention. The dispersion in forecasts across participants also receives attention, but as you can see in the figures, that dispersion—shown in dark blue for the economic variables and in the famous dot plot for the fed funds rate—is quite a bit narrower than the degree of uncertainty around the forecasts.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe addition of fan charts to the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections is the most recent step the Committee has taken on its journey of increased transparency and better communication. The FOMC will continue to strive for further improvements because when the public has a better understanding of how monetary policy decisions are made, the policy itself is more effective, and the public will have the information it needs to hold us accountable for our decisions. This accountability provides a crucial foundation for allowing monetary policymakers to pursue the congressionally mandated goals of price stability and maximum employment free from short-run political considerations. This independence of monetary policy decisions results in better economic outcomes. Because our policy decisions depend on the economic outlook, it is important for the FOMC to provide as much information as we can on our current assessment of the outlook, at the same time explaining that the forecast can change because economic conditions can evolve differently than expected.\n\nLet me conclude with something former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan once said about monetary policy: “Because monetary policy works with a lag, we need to be forward looking, taking actions to forestall imbalances that may not be visible for many months. There is no alternative to basing actions on forecasts, at least implicitly. It means that often we need to tighten or ease before the need for action is evident to the public at large, and that policy may have to reverse course from time to time as the underlying forces acting on the economy shift. This process is not easy to get right at all times, and it is often difficult to convey to the American people, whose support is essential to our mission.”5 Alan Greenspan made these remarks more than 20 years ago, yet they strike me as just as relevant today as they were then."

            "content": "I thank Michael Drury and the Global Interdependence Center for inviting me to speak in their Central Banking Series. I have had the opportunity to attend many GIC programs over the years and I have always walked away with new insights into the global economy and financial markets. I have also been honored to speak at two earlier GIC events. I'm hoping that when the organizers invited me to be on today's program they weren't thinking, \"the third time's the charm\"! For my part, I feel privileged to share some of my views and I thank our local hosts in Singapore for providing such a beautiful setting in which to do it.\n\nRather than provide a standard economic outlook talk, I'd like to speak about a challenge that monetary policymakers face in the aftermath of the financial crisis and Great Recession. That challenge is managing expectations. When we think about expectations in the context of monetary policy, we usually mean expectations about inflation or expectations about the future path of policy. But today, what I mean is managing expectations about the role monetary policy can play in promoting a healthy economy. While I'll focus on the Federal Reserve, I believe a similar challenge applies to central bankers around the world. Of course, the remarks I'll provide are my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nA decade has passed since the onset of the global financial crisis and the ensuing Great Recession. The U.S. economy has emerged from those dark days; it is now on sound footing. But it took a set of extraordinary actions outside the realm of normal monetary policy to get us back to this point. Because of the pain they caused, the global financial crisis and Great Recession rightly shined a bright light on the role of central banks. People who had never heard of the Federal Reserve before the crisis now hold strong opinions. There has been a healthy debate about the role monetary policy might have played in the run-up to the crisis, the effect of near-zero interest rates on the economy and financial markets, and the efficacy of the nontraditional tools used to address the Great Recession, including purchases of mortgage-backed securities and longer-maturity Treasuries.\n\nSome critics of the Fed believe that monetary policy was excessively accommodative and a key driver of conditions that led to the crisis, while other critics believe that the economy could have emerged much more quickly from the deep recession had monetary policy reacted differently. On the other side, there are fans of the Fed who believe that the nontraditional actions taken by central banks were very successful — so successful that policymakers should consider expanding the use of monetary policy beyond its typical purview.\n\nIn my view, both sides represent exaggerated expectations of what monetary policy can achieve. And this distorted view is troubling because it makes it harder for the public to understand the rationale for policymakers' decisions and to evaluate their performance. It is no secret that there are several legislative proposals to change the way the Fed pursues its congressionally mandated monetary policy goals. Some proposals seek to restrict the Fed's ability to pursue these goals in a way that is insulated from short-run political influence. This restriction on monetary policy's independence would be a significant loss for the nation because, as a substantial body of research and actual practice indicate, when a central bank formulates monetary policy free from short-run political interference and is held accountable for its decisions, better economic outcomes result.\n\nAccountability must go hand in hand with independence. That's why I believe it is time to recalibrate expectations of what monetary policy can achieve. The public needs to know what it can reasonably hold monetary policymakers accountable for. Indeed, even those who set policy would benefit if we kept in mind the serenity prayer: give me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.\n\nFor the rest of my talk, I'll elaborate on what this serenity prayer means for four aspects of monetary policy: how monetary policy should address business cycle fluctuations; monetary policy and long-run growth; monetary policy vis-à-vis fiscal policy; and monetary policymakers' projections of the economy and future path of policy.\n\nMonetary Policy and Business Cycle Fluctuations\n\nAt times during the recovery, the public discussion seemed to suggest that by setting interest rates appropriately, monetary policymakers could offset the deep shock that afflicted the economy and speed up the recovery. But this view ignores lessons from modern economic theory and historical experience. When a shock hits the economy, it takes some time for businesses to adjust their prices and for households to adjust their behavior. This delay allows monetary policy to affect the real side of the economy — output growth and employment — providing a bit of a cushion against the shock. However, it is a temporary effect that lasts only until prices adjust and the shock dissipates. We don't know the exact timing and magnitude of that impact; moreover, we can't predict with much precision the future shocks that will hit the economy. So attempting to fine-tune monetary policy to counteract the effects of a variety of temporary current and future shocks, some negative and some positive, is likely to lead to less economic stability rather than more.\n\nIn addition, not all shocks are transitory. Well-known research by Ken Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart documents that recessions associated with financial crises tend to be deeper and more prolonged than other types of recessions.1 The loss in output after financial crises is usually not fully recovered.2 In the case of the Great Recession, the housing crash required a large shift of resources out of that sector, and some Cleveland Fed research indicates that it typically takes the economy a long time to recover after a housing bust.3 In other words, some part of the shock that caused the Great Recession was likely permanent or very persistent rather than the type of transitory shock monetary policy might temporarily cushion. Given the size of the shock, it took a long time for the economy to adjust. Monetary policy could not be expected to make up for that permanent loss.\n\nThat said, this doesn't mean that monetary policy should be unresponsive to changes in economic conditions. Monetary policy can ease the transitions the economy has to make after shocks hit by responding in a way that fosters monetary policy's longer-run goals, which for the Fed are price stability and maximum employment.4 This means policy will vary over the business cycle as economic conditions change. For example, suppose there is a negative shock to aggregate demand. Firms will begin to cut their supply and reduce investment and employment. As output and employment fall, and demand and supply rebalance, the market level of interest rates will also fall. So long as inflation is near target, monetary policymakers would want to accommodate that fall in the market rate by reducing the short-term policy rate, supporting the economy's return to equilibrium. If policymakers didn't reduce the policy rate, prices would have to fall further, and this would lead to disinflationary pressures, which is counter to promoting price stability.\n\nOr consider a positive shock to productivity growth. In this case, firms would respond by increasing output and investment, and this would lead to a higher equilibrium interest rate in the economy. So long as inflation was near target, the central bank would want to raise its policy rate as the market interest rate rose. A failure to do so would allow inflationary pressures to build. In both of these cases, monetary policy isn't attempting to totally offset the shock. Instead, to foster price stability and maximum employment over the longer run, policymakers are moving the short-run policy rate consistent with changes in the equilibrium interest rate as the economy adjusts to shocks. Notice that in this view, the maximum employment benchmark for evaluating the performance of monetary policy isn't static; it depends on the types of shocks that hit the economy and the time it will take for the economy to adjust. In terms of our serenity prayer, it's important to have the serenity to know there will be shocks to the economy that monetary policy should not attempt to offset, and the courage, instead, to set policy to promote the longer-run goals of price stability and maximum employment.\n\nMonetary Policy and Long-Run Growth\n\nMy second topic is long-run growth. The recent discussion among economists and others about long-run growth has led some people to overestimate what monetary policy can achieve. A long-standing economic tenet is that while monetary policy can affect real growth in the short run, it cannot affect the economy's long-run growth rate. Unfortunately, this distinction between short-run and long-run effects has become somewhat muddled.\n\nSo let's take a step back and consider the drivers of long-run growth. The amount of goods and services an economy can produce depends on the amount of capital and labor it has — its inputs — and on how productively it can combine those inputs to create output. For the economy to grow, there needs to be an increase in labor or capital or an increase in productivity, or both. Labor force growth is largely determined by demographic factors like the birth rate, age distribution, and immigration. Labor force growth, along with labor force skills and the economy's infrastructure and institutional arrangements, such as the rule of law and well-developed financial markets, can all affect the quantity and quality of inputs and therefore the level of output a country can produce over the longer run. But sustained increases in output, that is, long-run economic growth, and increasing standards of living are determined by productivity growth. And productivity growth depends on factors like investment in human and physical capital and R&D that yields innovative products and processes.5\n\nIt is these underlying fundamentals, and not monetary policy, that determine the economy's long-run growth rate and sustainable unemployment rate. In economists' terminology, in the long run, monetary policy is said to be neutral with respect to the real side of the economy and to affect only the price level and inflation rate.\n\nThe FOMC's statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy, which was adopted in 2012 and reaffirmed each year since, recognizes this distinction.6 It clearly says that \"the inflation rate over the longer run is primarily determined by monetary policy, and hence the Committee has the ability to specify a longer-run goal for inflation.\" In contrast, \"the maximum level of employment is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market. These factors may change over time and may not be directly measurable.\" It's true that poor monetary policy can inhibit the ability of the economy to achieve its long-run growth potential, but by promoting the longer-run goals of price stability and maximum employment, monetary policy can contribute to the economy's ability to reach its long-run growth rate, even though it cannot affect what that long-run rate is.\n\nWhile monetary policy can't affect the economy's long-run growth rate, it cannot ignore it either, because the economy's long-run equilibrium real rate of interest, that is, the rate consistent with stable prices and maximum employment over the long run, is determined by the long-run growth of consumption and, therefore, of output. A sizable shock to the economy can affect the potential growth rate, and monetary policy will need to take that into account. The financial crisis and Great Recession affected not only aggregate demand but also aggregate supply. Potential growth fell and, with it, so did the economy's equilibrium interest rate. There is ongoing research into the mechanism through which large shocks might affect potential growth. Regardless of the mechanism, the fact that potential growth fell had implications for monetary policy. The Fed's policy rate has been lower than what it would have been had there been no change in the equilibrium rate. The lower equilibrium rate is reflected in the FOMC's economic projections. For example, in January 2012, the median level of the longer-run fed funds rate was 4-1/4 percent. In the most recent projections, in December 2016, that level is 3 percent.\n\nAn easy way to see the effect of lower equilibrium interest rates is to look at simple monetary policy rules that are often used to assess the degree of monetary accommodation. I don't believe that monetary policy should be set mechanically using a single policy rule; no rule works well enough across a variety of economic models and in a variety of economic circumstances. But I do find it useful to look at the outcomes of an array of simple, robust monetary policy rules as a gauge. You can find updates for a set of seven rules and their outcomes across several forecasts on the Cleveland Fed's website.7 The equilibrium interest rate is a parameter in most of these rules, and when it falls, so does the policy outcome from these rules, indicating that policy should respond to changes in these fundamental aspects of the economy.\n\nBut this is different from trying to actively use monetary policy to affect the longer-run growth rate of the economy or the longer-run unemployment rate. As Chair Janet Yellen said in her press briefing after the December FOMC meeting, this is not a strategy she has recommended, and rightly so.8 I am very doubtful that monetary policy could be targeted to spur a strong pickup in the types of investment in human capital and physical capital that would raise productivity growth. Monetary policy is a blunt instrument, and despite very low interest rates, we certainly haven't seen that type of effect during this cycle. Indeed, one of the conundrums has been the low productivity growth rates we've been experiencing. Attempting to use monetary policy to spur productivity growth would be a risky experiment, both in terms of our ability to achieve our longer-run goal of price stability and in terms of financial stability given the excessive accommodation such a strategy would require. So once again, we need the serenity to accept that monetary policy cannot affect the economy's long-run growth rate, and the courage to keep monetary policy focused on what it is capable of achieving: price stability that promotes maximum employment.\n\nMonetary Policy vs. Fiscal Policy\n\nRather than monetary policy, other forms of economic policy are better suited to affecting the fundamentals that drive productivity growth and potential growth. Policies and programs that encourage higher levels of investment in R&D and innovation, that help workers displaced from jobs because of technological change or globalization to transition to other jobs, and that spur investments in education to help people gain the skills needed in the modern economy all have the potential to raise productivity and longer-run growth. Tax-code changes, immigration policy, and trade policy also have the potential to affect the economy's longer-run growth rate, but whether in a positive or negative direction depends on the particular changes that are made, how they are implemented, and how they are financed.\n\nGovernment spending and tax policies fall under the purview of fiscal policy, not monetary policy. The distinction is important, yet it has become somewhat muddled in the aftermath of the crisis. During the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve established some special credit and liquidity programs that went beyond traditional monetary policy. Some of these programs, like the term auction facility, which auctioned longer-term credit to depository institutions, were related to the Federal Reserve's role as lender of last resort. Other lending programs targeted specific markets, like the commercial paper market. In addition, to put downward pressure on longer-term yields and to support the housing market, the Fed purchased large volumes of housing agency debt and agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities. These purchases had the desired effect of adding accommodation once the traditional tool of policy, the fed funds rate, had reached its effective lower bound. But they also entailed the Fed's allocating credit to a particular sector, housing, something the Fed traditionally has not done.\n\nThese programs were necessary, but they did have some negative aspects. One was that they opened up the Fed to requests to aid other industries or to use its balance sheet to fund government initiatives. During December 2008, as Congress debated a bailout for American automakers, several members of Congress requested of then-Chair Ben Bernanke that the Fed lend directly to auto companies. Needless to say, the Fed was reluctant to go down this path, which would have put it squarely in the midst of industrial policy, a responsibility of Congress.9 More recently, the 2015 Fixing America's Surface Act, or FAST Act, tapped the Fed's surplus account to pay for highways.\n\nTo avoid the erosion of monetary policy's independence, it is important to bring monetary policymaking back to more normal footing. The Fed recognized this need from the very start of its use of nontraditional tools. For example, many of the special lending facilities were designed to be self-liquidating as credit-market conditions improved. And the Fed clearly states in its policy normalization principles that it intends, in the longer run, to hold no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively, and that the composition of assets will return to being primarily Treasury securities.10 This will mean a smaller balance sheet than what we hold today, regardless of the longer-run policy implementation framework the Fed ultimately adopts.11 The return to primarily Treasuries will take some time, but it will be welcome because it will minimize the effect of the Fed's asset holdings on the allocation of credit across sectors of the economy, and it may help guard against future calls for the Federal Reserve to enter into the realm of fiscal policy. We need the serenity to accept that monetary policy and fiscal policy are distinct, and the courage to push against attempts to use monetary policy for goals that fall under the purview of fiscal policy.\n\nFOMC Projections\n\nThe final topic I'd like to discuss is the FOMC's projections of the economy and federal funds rate path. The FOMC is not prescient, nor should we expect it to be. Four times a year, the FOMC provides a summary of economic projections across FOMC participants, conditional on the path of policy that each participant sees as appropriate. The media focuses attention on changes in the projections over the year, and at the end of the year, stories are written about what actually came to pass compared to what the FOMC was projecting at the start of the year. For example, according to the central tendency of FOMC participants' projections, at the start of 2012, real GDP growth for the year was expected to be 2.2 to 2.7 percent. It turns out that the economy grew at only a 1.3 percent pace that year, a forecast miss of around 1.0 to 1.5 percentage points. On the other hand, participants underestimated the improvement seen in the unemployment rate in 2012. At the start of the year, they projected an unemployment rate of 8.2 to 8.5 percent by the fourth quarter, but unemployment ended up lower, at 7.8 percent. The FOMC also was more optimistic about growth at the start of 2015 than what came to pass, and inflation ran below projections over 2013—2015.\n\nThe public has to hold the FOMC accountable for its performance, but it should not hold monetary policymakers to an unrealistic standard. To evaluate the performance of the FOMC's projections, it is important to put these forecast misses into context by remembering that forecast errors of this magnitude, both above and below actual outcomes, are the norm among economic forecasters, not the exception.12 Forecasting is difficult because the economy is constantly being buffeted by shocks, data are revised over time, and there is uncertainty about which model will best predict the future path of the economy at any given time. In its Summary of Economic Projections, the FOMC publishes a table of the average historical forecast errors across various private-sector and government forecasts.13 For real GDP growth, a 70 percent confidence interval around the forecast one year out is about ±1-3/4 percentage points. The forecast the FOMC made in early 2012 was within the interval. The confidence bands around forecasts of unemployment and inflation one year out are also wide: about ±3/4 percentage point for the unemployment rate, and about ±1 percentage point for inflation. So the FOMC projection performance is quite reasonable by this metric.\n\nSimilar scrutiny has been applied to changes in the policy path that the FOMC includes in its projections. A small change in the path can generate many headlines. But we should expect the policy paths to be responsive to changes in economic conditions and changes in fiscal and other government policies, to the extent that they change the outlook. Changes in appropriate policy that are based on sound monetary policymaking principles and are systematically related to changes in underlying conditions that affect the medium-run outlook provide useful information on the Fed's reaction function, helping the public better anticipate how the Fed will change policy when economic conditions change.\n\nAs a way to convey some of the uncertainty around our future policy path and outlook, I have been an advocate of the FOMC's publishing confidence bands around its projections.14 The Committee is discussing it.15 Confidence bands will help the public understand some of the risks around our projections and remind them of the reasonable amount of variation to expect in outcomes relative to projections. The bands will also illustrate that while the dispersion across FOMC participants' projections of the policy path often gets a lot of attention, this dispersion is actually quite narrow compared with the confidence bands. Finally, confidence bands will also be a helpful reminder to policymakers themselves of the uncertainty we constantly live with. So, we all need the serenity to accept that policymakers aren't prescient and their forecasts will change over time, and the courage to hold policymakers accountable for being principled and systematic in how they react to changes in economic conditions.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, I am a strong supporter of insulating monetary policy decisions from short-run political considerations. Accountability must go hand in hand with such independence. For the public to be able to hold policymakers accountable for their policy decisions, it must understand what it is appropriate to expect from monetary policy. Today, I talked about four areas where expectations need some recalibration: how monetary policy should address business cycle fluctuations; the relationship between monetary policy and long-run growth; monetary policy vis-à-vis fiscal policy; and monetary policymakers' economic and policy path projections. The serenity prayer provides some guidance for that recalibration: We need the serenity to accept the things that cannot be changed by monetary policy (and look for more appropriate solutions). We need the courage to change the things we can (by keeping monetary policy focused on its longer-run goals of price stability and maximum employment). And we need the wisdom to know the difference."

As you may know, in addition to being president and CEO of the Chamber, Doris chairs the board of the Pittsburgh Branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Doris for her service to my organization and to the country. In her role as chair, Doris brings us a wealth of information on the regional economy, information she has gathered from the entrepreneurs and other contacts in the region. I am sure that many of you provide Doris with insights into how your businesses and communities are faring, so I'd like to also thank you for your service.\n\nThe Cleveland Fed represents the Fourth Federal Reserve District, which comprises western Pennsylvania, as well as the state of Ohio, eastern Kentucky, and the northern panhandle of West Virginia. As president of the Cleveland Fed, I make it a point to bring the economic information we have garnered throughout the District from business, consumer, and labor contacts to meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The FOMC is the body within the Fed that sets monetary policy. The regional information, along with economic and financial data and analysis, plays an important part in the FOMC's setting of national monetary policy in pursuit of our statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability.\n\nIndeed, the regional structure of the Federal Reserve has served the country well for more than 100 years. Congress established the Fed in 1913 to operate in the public interest to promote the health of the U.S. economy and financial system. Congress designed the Fed as a decentralized central bank, independent within the government but not independent from the government. The Fed's design balances public-sector and private-sector interests, and Wall Street and Main Street concerns.\n\nThe Federal Reserve System has 12 regional Reserve Banks distributed across the country and overseen by the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C. This design allows monetary policy decisions to take into account the diversity of the American economy and its people. The regional structure also helps us to carry out our other responsibilities. In addition to setting national monetary policy, the Fed is also responsible for supervising and regulating banks and other important financial institutions, promoting the stability of the financial system, playing a major role in overseeing the nation's payments system and providing certain financial services to the U.S. government, and identifying effective community development policies and best practices for promoting economic progress and access to credit in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.\n\nToday, I would like to focus on our monetary policy role by discussing my outlook for both the national and regional economy and my views on monetary policy. Of course, these are my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\n\nThe economic expansion is now in its eighth year, and considerable progress has been and continues to be made on both parts of the Fed's statutory goals of full employment and price stability. In my view, the underlying fundamentals supporting the economic expansion remain sound. Growth has been moderate, and although the quarterly pattern has had its share of ups and downs, the economy has been resilient to a number of shocks throughout the expansion. One of those shocks, the sharp decline in energy prices between mid-2014 through the end of 2015, was a major negative for the energy-producing sector and its suppliers in this region and elsewhere. Still, the economy and, in particular, employment growth persevered.\n\nAll forecasts carry risk, and sometimes, it is difficult to extract the signal about where the economy is headed from noisy economic and financial market data. With these usual caveats in mind, my modal forecast is that over the next couple of years, the U.S. economy will expand at a pace at or slightly above its longer-run trend, which I estimate to be about 2 percent; that the unemployment rate will move further below its longer-run level, which I estimate to be about 5 percent; and that inflation will return to the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target.\n\nAfter a slow first half, U.S. output growth picked up in the third quarter. Consumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of U.S. output, has been the driver of growth and I expect that to continue. Improving household balance sheets, growth in personal income, low borrowing rates, and low oil prices have all supported consumer spending.\n\nSmoothing through the monthly volatility in housing sales, starts, and permits indicates that the housing sector is gradually improving. I expect activity in the sector to continue to expand at a sustainable pace. The gradual nature of the housing recovery likely reflects a mixture of supply and demand factors. Builders report that they are having trouble finding qualified workers in some of the construction trades, and they are avoiding over-building, having learned from the housing boom and crash. Mortgage rates are low, but households are being careful not to take on more mortgage debt than they can handle, and banks are lending, but to those with good credit quality.\n\nIn contrast to consumer spending and housing, manufacturing has been restrained and business fixed investment has been weak. As I mentioned earlier, part of the weakness in investment reflects the impact that the earlier sharp drop in oil prices had on the drilling and mining sectors and their suppliers. In western Pennsylvania, steel production, which supplies the energy sector, has been down and firms tied to the energy sector have had to cut jobs and curtail investment plans. On a positive note, oil prices have stabilized and are up somewhat this year, and we have started to see a pickup in oil drilling activity. The relatively slow growth of our trading partners, which has led to an appreciation in the value of the dollar, has also weighed on manufacturing and investment at firms that are reliant on exporting goods. But even outside of the energy- and trade-related sectors, business investment has been soft despite generally accommodative financial conditions. Some firms seem to be using the low interest rate environment to buy back stock rather than to expand plant and equipment spending. More generally, there just seems to be a sense of caution on the part of businesses.\n\nI do expect investment to begin to pick up with economic growth, which would be welcome because a stronger pace of capital spending would help raise labor productivity growth from recent low levels. This is important because structural productivity growth is a key determinant of the longer-run growth rate of output and of living standards. And a key determinant of productivity growth is investment in physical and human capital. Labor productivity growth has risen at an annual rate of a little above a half of a percent over the past five years. Part of this weakness is cyclical; some of it reflects longer-run demographics, including the aging of the population, and some of it likely reflects difficulties measuring productivity in the service sector, including intellectual property and information technology. It is difficult to forecast productivity growth, so the recent softness may reverse itself, or it may be longer lasting and reflect a structural issue. If it's the latter, then the longer-run growth rate of the U.S. economy may be lower than the 2 percent growth I've been assuming.\n\nI do not need to tell this audience about the important role that small and new businesses play in the U.S. economy. The vast majority of firms in the U.S. are small businesses; in fact, three-quarters of U.S. businesses have fewer than 10 employees. So while it is true that large and mature businesses employ the most people, still, over a quarter of U.S. private-sector jobs are at firms with fewer than 50 employees, and over half are at firms with fewer than 500 employees.1 Digging deeper into the data, economist John Haltiwanger and his co-authors have documented the important role played, in particular, by young firms. This group includes new firms, which are almost all small to begin with. Their research shows that young firms disproportionately contribute to both overall job creation and job destruction in the U.S. economy, and on average, over the 1990s and until the Great Recession, business start-ups accounted for about 3 percent of total employment per year.2 More recent data show that since the Great Recession, this share has fallen to around 2 percent,3 which brings up a cautionary note about our economy.\n\nAn enviable aspect of the U.S. economy around the globe is our spirit of innovation, entrepreneurship, ease of business entry and exit, and labor market flexibility. Small and young businesses have played an important role in the dynamics of the U.S. economy. This dynamism has contributed to economic growth and well-being in the U.S. It allows resources to be reallocated from less-productive to more-productive businesses and allows workers to move up the career ladder, resulting in higher productivity growth and rising incomes.\n\nBut research by Haltiwanger and others has shown that the degree of dynamism in the U.S. economy has been declining for some time. As indicated above, the start-up rate has been declining, and since 2000, key innovative sectors like high-tech have seen a sharp slowing in the rate of start-ups.4 The decline in business and labor market dynamism may be contributing to the slowdown we've seen in productivity growth.5\n\nTo better understand one factor important to start-ups and small firms, for the past three years, the Federal Reserve has conducted a survey on small-business credit. In 2015, seven Reserve Banks, including the Cleveland Fed, collaborated on the survey, gathering responses from over 5,400 firms with fewer than 500 employees and located in 26 states.6 The 2015 results indicate that among the more than 3,400 employer firms — those small businesses employing at least one person in addition to the owner — both firm performance, in terms of the share reporting profitability and revenue growth, and financing success improved over the previous year. Slightly less than 50 percent of surveyed employer firms applied for credit and about half of those received all the credit they sought. Among the firms receiving less credit than they wanted, micro-businesses (those firms with less than $100,000 in annual revenue) and start-ups had somewhat less success in gaining credit approval. The differential in credit approval by revenue and age of firm may appropriately reflect the risks entailed in lending to these types of firms. Nonetheless, it does point out that the availability of credit is one of the challenges smaller and younger firms are facing as they try to grow, and that appropriate access to credit will remain a key attribute of an innovative economy.\n\nAs this brief overview suggests, some parts of the U.S. economy have fared better than others. But overall, economic growth has proven to be resilient, and I expect growth over the next two years to be at or slightly above a trend of around 2 percent. The pace of growth, while lower than in other expansions, has been sufficient to generate significant and sustained progress in labor markets.\n\nIn fact, since the employment trough in early 2010, the U.S. labor market has added more than 15 million jobs, about a 10 percent increase. The national unemployment rate has fallen more than 5 percentage points from its peak of 10 percent in late 2009. In addition, other gauges of the under-utilization of labor have improved significantly. These include the broader measures of unemployment that track the number of part-time workers who would rather work full time and the number of people who have been discouraged from looking for a job.\n\nSo far this year, firms have added slightly more than 1.8 million payroll jobs, or around 180,000 jobs per month. That's well above estimates of trend employment growth, which range from 75,000 to 120,000 per month depending on what one assumes about labor force participation. Demographic factors, including the aging of our population, have resulted in a downward trend in labor force participation, which is one of the reasons trend employment growth is lower than it was a few decades ago.\n\nAs labor market progress has been made, we have been hearing increasingly from our labor and business contacts across a broad set of industries that firms are having trouble finding qualified workers, both in high-skilled occupations and in lower-skilled jobs, and that they are responding by raising wages. Now those anecdotal reports are showing through to the wage data where measures such as the employment cost index and average hourly earnings are accelerating moderately from year-ago levels.\n\nI expect to see the labor market continue to tighten somewhat over the next couple of years. Although payroll job growth is likely to slow a bit from its current pace given the progress that's already been made, it will be sufficient to put further downward pressure on the unemployment rate. I expect the unemployment rate to stay below my estimate of its longer-run rate of 5 percent over the next two years. So in my view, we have met the maximum employment part of our monetary policy dual mandate; that is, maximum employment from the standpoint of what monetary policy can achieve.\n\nIn saying that, I certainly do not want to underestimate the difficulty in finding work that many people have had and some continue to have, or the persistent differences in the employment situation faced by different demographic groups in the U.S. Technological advances and globalization are changing the nature of available jobs and the skill sets needed to perform those jobs. While the overall economy will benefit from these forces, many individuals and some regions are adversely affected by these structural trends. Government policies and programs, and public-private partnerships, can and should be brought to bear to help people and communities make the transition.\n\nA promising start is being taken right here in Pittsburgh to help ensure that people are developing the skills that will be needed in the workforce of the future, and that those providing the education and training understand what those jobs will be. Earlier this year, the Allegheny Conference on Community Development published an in-depth analysis of the expected supply and demand for labor in the Pittsburgh region over the next decade and made a number of recommendations to help the region prepare for the coming changes.7 One recommended initiative would create a digital career awareness hub to help teachers and students in kindergarten through high school better match curriculum offerings and choices to the skill sets in demand in the future. Another would create a digital jobs database to make it easier to match those with particular skills to employers currently in need of those skills. A further recommendation is to focus resources on high-growth \"opportunity occupations,\" positions that pay higher than the median wage but don't require a bachelor's degree. This diverse group of occupations includes certain jobs in health care, transportation, and bookkeeping.8\n\nThe Federal Reserve, through its Community Development function, has a role to play in easing these types of transitions. Our objective analysis can help in evaluating the pros and cons of various policies and programs, and provide guidance on how to best scale-up those programs found to be most effective. Although I don't believe monetary policy is the right tool for solving the longer-run workforce development issues facing our economy, I do believe monetary policy can positively contribute by fostering conditions to ensure that the economy achieves an economic expansion that endures. This economic stability will help those demographic groups — minorities, older workers, and lower-income people — who are disproportionately harmed by economic downturns.\n\nThe other part of the Fed's dual mandate is price stability. Inflation has been running below the Fed's target of 2 percent for a while, but it has picked up over the past year and I believe the conditions are in place for a return to 2 percent over the next couple of years. As the drags from earlier declines in oil prices and non-petroleum imports have dissipated, year-over-year headline inflation measures have moved up, from the very low levels recorded last year to over 1 percent in recent months. To get a better sense of the underlying trend in inflation, economists often look at measures that smooth through or strip out some of the more volatile components. These include core PCE inflation and trimmed-mean PCE inflation, which are gradually nearing the 2 percent goal, as well as core CPI inflation and median CPI inflation, which are now over 2 percent. Indeed, the Cleveland Fed median CPI measure has been above 2-1/4 percent all year, and near 2-1/2 percent for the past several months.9\n\nWhat people think inflation will be over the long run — what economists call inflation expectations — is an important factor that influences the path inflation actually takes. If people are confident that the Fed will set monetary policy to achieve 2 percent inflation over the long run — in other words, if longer-run inflation expectations are stable — then they will look through shocks that temporarily raise or lower inflation when they make financial or business decisions. This helps inflation move back toward the target after the effect of the shock dissipates. To assess whether inflation expectations are stable, we look at a number of different measures and indicators. Some are based on surveys of consumers and of professional forecasters; others are based on financial market data. The Cleveland Fed's expectations measure of five-year inflation, five years from now, which combines survey and market data, has been stable this year, in a range of 1 3/4 to 2 percent.10 After dipping earlier in the year, other measures have risen in recent weeks. Based on the various measures, in my view, long-run inflation expectations have been reasonably stable. This, along with evidence that inflation is moving up, the continued strength in the labor market, and growth expected to be at or slightly above trend all suggest that inflation is on a path of returning to our 2 percent goal over the next couple of years.\n\nAs I mentioned at the start of my talk, assessing regional economic conditions plays an important role in setting national monetary policy, so let me spend a few minutes discussing the Pittsburgh-area economy. The Pittsburgh region has undergone the type of regional economic transformation I discussed earlier, moving from an economy that was dependent largely on steel, coal mining, and heavy industry, to one that has diversified into health care, education, financial services, and technology.11 This is a promising development because we have seen that regions that remain dependent on one particular industry have fared less well over time than those that have been able to diversify their industrial bases and adapt to the changing economy.\n\nThe path of the economic expansion in Pittsburgh reflects its industrial mix and the nature of the shocks that have hit the economy during the expansion. The Great Recession took its toll on the region, as it did in the rest of the nation, and the region is also sharing in the benefits of the expansion. Indeed, Pittsburgh was an early achiever in the recovery.\n\nIn 2012, Pittsburgh was one of the first major U.S. metropolitan areas to see payroll jobs move back up to pre-Great Recession levels. The U.S. as a whole didn't achieve this milestone until mid-2014, and Pennsylvania, not until 2015. But since 2012, job growth in Pittsburgh has been relatively flat, while jobs in Pennsylvania and the U.S. have been expanding. A similar story can be told about Pittsburgh's unemployment rate. After falling sharply from a peak of over 8 percent in 2010 to under 5 percent early this year, the unemployment rate has moved up to 6 percent, about a percentage point higher than the national level.\n\nSome of the recent weakness in the regional labor markets is related to the earlier drop in energy prices. The Marcellus region is now the most important shale-based source of natural gas in the U.S., accounting for about 40 percent of domestic natural gas from shale sources. As a result, among the 50 states, Pennsylvania is now the second-largest producer of natural gas behind Texas. But while the region gained as the natural gas industry developed, the recent contraction in the industry has been a negative. Over 2014 and 2015, both natural gas prices and the number of active rigs in the Marcellus region were cut in half, resulting in considerable job losses and lower earnings. This year, natural gas prices have begun to increase, and since the summer, the number of active rigs has picked up as well. Although Allegheny County is less exposed to the natural gas sector than other parts of the Marcellus region, it felt the spillovers of lower energy prices, as well as slower global growth, both of which put a considerable drag on the steel industry. Here, too, the modest rise in oil prices this year has been a positive development.\n\nAnother positive is the region's well-educated workforce. Among the 100 largest metropolitan areas, Pittsburgh ranks in the top half in terms of the percentage of its population holding a bachelor's degree or higher, and among people aged 25 to 34, its ranking rises to 12th out of 100.12 This bodes well because when it comes to the economic well-being of entire regions, many studies have documented the importance of investments in human capital.13 As a home to strong universities and a well-educated workforce, Pittsburgh is already attracting and sustaining many of the businesses of the future. No doubt, this made Pittsburgh an excellent choice to host this October's White House Frontiers Conference on the future of innovation both in the U.S. and around the world.\n\nIn addition to a quality workforce, research shows that effective leadership can make a big difference in how regional economies navigate the type of transition Pittsburgh has accomplished. I commend the African American Chamber of Commerce of Western Pennsylvania for its leadership in the region.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nLet me now turn to the implications of the economic outlook for monetary policy. All participants on the FOMC share the same objective — setting monetary policy to promote our longer-run goals of maximum employment and price stability. In setting monetary policy, we assess the realized progress the economy has made on our goals and our expectation of further progress based on the economic outlook over the medium run and the risks to the outlook.\n\nIn my view, economic developments have corroborated the Committee's medium-run outlook that labor markets will continue to show strength, that growth will rebound to a pace at or slightly above trend, and that inflation will gradually rise to our 2 percent target. We have seen sustained improvement in the labor market, which, in my view, is now basically at full employment from the standpoint of what monetary policy can do, and inflation has been moving up closer to our goal. I view the risks to the outlook as broadly balanced.\n\nThe current target range for our policy rate, the federal funds rate, is 1/4 to 1/2 percent, which is quite accommodative. When the Committee met in early November, it assessed that the case for moving the policy rate up had continued to strengthen but decided, for the time being, to wait for some further evidence of continued progress toward the dual-mandate objectives. I, and one of my colleagues, dissented from that decision, preferring to see a 25-basis-point rise.\n\nI view a small step up in interest rates as appropriate, not because I want to curtail the expansion, but because I believe it will help prolong the expansion. We know that monetary policy affects the economy with long and variable lags, so policy actions have to be taken before our policy goals are fully met. The lesson that policy should be forward looking is based on the history of poor outcomes when that strategy hasn't been followed and we've fallen far behind the curve. If we delay too long and then find ourselves in a situation where the labor market becomes unsustainably tight, price pressures become excessive, and we have to move rates up steeply, we could risk a recession, a bad outcome that disproportionately harms the more vulnerable parts of our society. Delaying for too long might also induce investors to search for yield, raising risks to financial stability. I do not think we are behind the curve yet, but I think the risks to macroeconomic stability and to financial stability will grow over time should we fail to take appropriate action given where we are on our goals and the current low level of our policy rate. I view another increase in interest rates as a prudent step to take.\n\nI anticipate that a gradual upward path of policy is likely to be appropriate given economic developments. That means that the policy rate won't be moving up at each meeting and that policy will remain accommodative for some time, continuing to lend support to the economic expansion going forward. It will allow us to recalibrate policy over time as we gain more insight into the underlying structural aspects of the post-crisis economy and as the economy evolves.\n\nConclusion\n\nBetween now and when the FOMC next meets in December, I will continue to assess economic and financial conditions to see if any change is warranted in my medium-run outlook. My colleagues on the FOMC will be doing that too, and, in December, the FOMC will provide a new set of forecasts summarizing our current views on the economy and monetary policy. I look forward to the meeting, and I commend Chair Janet Yellen for fostering an atmosphere of serious deliberation and the free exchange of ideas in FOMC meetings. Setting monetary policy is a complex undertaking, and I believe the history of the Fed has shown that better policy decisions are made when a diversity of information and views is considered.\n\nSometimes I'm asked whether the FOMC routinely coordinates our monetary policy actions with those of other countries. The answer is no — we set our monetary policy to promote our goals of maximum employment and price stability in the U.S.14 But we operate in a global economy and there are ties among economies and financial markets, so we must consider economic and financial developments abroad to the extent they affect the outlook for the U.S. economy. For example, weak growth abroad has been a drag on our economy because it has meant weaker U.S. export growth. Similarly, the appreciation in the value of the dollar that began in mid-2014 put downward pressure on inflation by holding down import prices. So these developments factored into our assessment of appropriate monetary policy. U.S. fiscal policy is also part of the economic environment. The prospects for some changes to fiscal and other economic policies, such as infrastructure spending, tax code changes, immigration policy, and trade policy, have likely increased. But the form any policy change will take, the timing of passage, and the timing and size of the impacts are very uncertain at this point. When we gauge the effects of any forthcoming fiscal and other economic policy changes on the outlook for growth, employment, and inflation, the devil will be in the details.\n\nAs we gain more clarity about the policies that might be forthcoming, the FOMC will assess their effects, as well as the implications of economic and financial developments, on the medium-run economic outlook and appropriate monetary policy. Monetary policy is not on a pre-set course and we will continue to use the best available models, analysis, and judgment to assess the situation. As an FOMC member, I will remain focused on and committed to setting monetary policy to promote the Federal Reserve's longer-run goals of price stability and maximum employment for the benefit of the public."

            "content": "It is a pleasure to welcome you to the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. Since my arrival in Cleveland over two years ago, I have seen first-hand the important role that the Greater Cleveland Partnership plays in supporting the growth of our regional economy and I am very proud to serve on its board. Of course, as president of one of the country's 12 Federal Reserve Banks I have a keen interest in our regional economy. As we gather in the lobby of this historic building, it is hard not to think back to a time more than 100 years ago and applaud the Congressmen — yes, they were all men back then — who came up with such an ingenious design for our Federal Reserve System. Congress established the Fed in 1913 as a decentralized central bank, independent within the government but not independent from the government. The Fed's design balances public-sector and private-sector interests, and Wall Street and Main Street concerns. I believe the design has served the country well by allowing monetary policy decisions to take into account the diversity of the American economy and its people.\n\nAs president of the Cleveland Fed, I make it a point to bring the economic information we have garnered from business, consumer, and labor contacts throughout the District to meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The FOMC is the body within the Fed that sets monetary policy. The insightful regional perspectives provided by our directors, advisory council members, and other regional contacts, along with economic and financial data and analysis, all play an important part in the Fed's setting of national monetary policy in pursuit of our statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability. I commend Chair Janet Yellen for fostering an atmosphere of serious deliberation and the free exchange of ideas in FOMC meetings. Setting monetary policy is a complex undertaking, and I believe the history of this institution has shown that better policy decisions are made when a diversity of information and views is considered.\n\nSome of that diversity was on display when the FOMC met last week and decided to maintain its policy rate at 1/4 to 1/2 percent. I, along with two of my colleagues, dissented from that consensus decision in favor of moving the federal funds rate up by 25 basis points. The reason I believe a gradual upward path of policy continues to be appropriate and that I favored taking another step on that path in September is because of the realized progress the economy has made on our monetary policy goals and my expectation of further progress. That expectation is based on my outlook for the economy. So today, I would like to discuss my outlook for both the national and regional economy and my views on monetary policy. Of course, these are my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\n\nThe underlying fundamentals supporting the economic expansion remain sound. Household balance sheets have improved greatly since the recession and households feel confident enough to be borrowing again. We have seen sustained progress in the labor market and wages are gradually beginning to accelerate. Oil prices remain low, and while the decline in energy prices has been a considerable negative for the energy-producing sector, it has benefited households and the many businesses that consume energy. The underlying strength in the economy is demonstrated by the resiliency it has shown through a number of bumps along the road of expansion. Some of the recent bumps include the gyrations in financial markets at the beginning of the year, the slowdown in growth in China, economic weakness in Europe, the large appreciation of the dollar between mid-2014 and the start of this year, and the uncertainty surrounding the United Kingdom's vote to leave the European Union.\n\nAll forecasts carry risk, and sometimes it is difficult to extract the signal about where the economy is headed from noisy economic and financial market data. With those usual caveats, my modal forecast is that over the next couple of years, the U.S. economy will expand at a pace at or slightly above its longer-run trend, which I estimate to be about 2 percent; that the unemployment rate will move further below its longer-run level, which I estimate to be about 5 percent; and that inflation will continue to gradually return to the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target.\n\nU.S. output growth in the first half of the year was quite slow, coming in at only around 1 percent. Much of that sluggishness was due to a decline in business inventories, and so GDP growth underestimated the underlying strength in demand. Based on incoming data, growth is poised to rebound in the second half of the year. Consumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of U.S. output, has been a driver of growth and I expect that to continue. Improving household balance sheets, growth in personal income, low borrowing rates, and low oil prices have all buoyed consumer spending.\n\nThe housing sector is gradually improving and I expect activity in the sector will continue to expand at a sustainable pace. The monthly home sales numbers have been volatile from month-to-month, reflecting a mixture of supply and demand factors. Builders have been telling us that they are having trouble finding qualified workers in some of the construction trades and they are cautiously avoiding over-building, having learned from the housing boom and crash. Mortgage rates are low, but households are being careful not to take on more mortgage debt than they can handle, and banks are lending but to those with good credit quality.\n\nIn contrast to housing, business fixed investment remains weak, and this weakness is somewhat of a puzzle. Given the sharp drop in oil prices since mid-2014, it's not surprising that firms in the drilling and mining sector, their suppliers, and regions whose economies depend on the energy sector were hurt. We have seen the effects in parts of the Cleveland Fed District where steel production, which supplies the energy industry, has been down and other firms tied to energy have cut jobs and reduced investment. But even outside of the energy sector, business investment has been soft despite generally accommodative financial conditions. Manufacturing firms are telling us they are investing, but mainly to sustain current operations rather than to expand. Some of the softness in investment reflects weak demand outside of the U.S., which has hurt U.S. exports. Other firms seem to be using the low interest rate environment to buy back stock rather than to expand plant and equipment spending. More generally, there just seems to be a sense of caution on the part of firms.\n\nI expect investment to begin to pick up with economic growth. But the weakness in investment and the associated slow pace of productivity growth pose a risk for the longer-run growth of the U.S. economy. Structural productivity growth is a key determinant of the longer-run growth of output and increases in living standards. And a key determinant of productivity growth is investment in physical and human capital. Labor productivity growth has risen at an annual rate of only one-half percent over the past five years. Part of this weakness is cyclical; some of it reflects longer-run demographics, including the aging of the population, and some of it likely reflects difficulties measuring productivity in the service sector, including intellectual property and information technology. It is difficult to forecast productivity growth, so the recent softness may reverse itself, or it may be longer lasting and reflect a structural issue. If it's the latter, then the longer-run growth rate of the U.S. economy may be lower than the 2 percent growth I've been assuming.\n\nMonetary policy cannot affect these longer-term structural aspects of the economy, but it needs to consider them. For example, in an economy with lower trend growth and productivity, the average level of interest rates that balances supply and demand — what economists call the neutral rate of interest — will be lower. But just because monetary policy can't move the trend growth rate higher doesn't mean there aren't other steps the country can take to address these longer-run issues: policies that encourage investments in technology and human capital, tax and regulatory changes, and longer-run fiscal policy should all be under consideration.\n\nAs this brief overview suggests, some parts of the U.S. economy have fared better than others. But overall, economic growth has proven to be resilient and I expect growth over the next two years to be at or slightly above a trend of around 2 percent. The pace of growth, while lower than in other expansions, has been sufficient to generate significant and sustained progress in labor markets.\n\nSince the trough in early 2010, the U.S. labor market has added more than 14 million jobs, which is about 10 percent of employment, and the unemployment rate has fallen more than 5 percentage points from its peak of 10 percent in late 2009. The past two years have also seen significant improvements in other gauges of the under-utilization of labor, such as measures tracking the number of part-time workers who would rather work full-time and the number of people who have been discouraged from looking for a job.\n\nSo far this year, firms have added over 1.4 million payroll jobs, an average of about 180,000 jobs per month. That's well above estimates of trend employment growth, which range from 75,000 to 120,000 per month. We are increasingly hearing from businesses across a broad set of industries that they are having trouble finding qualified workers, both in high-skilled occupations and in lower-skilled jobs. And we are now beginning to see firms respond by raising wages.\n\nI expect to see the labor market continue to tighten. Although payroll job growth is projected to slow a bit from the current pace given the progress that's been made, it will be sufficient to put further downward pressure on the unemployment rate. I expect the unemployment rate to stay below 5 percent over the next two years.\n\nI do not want to underestimate the difficulty that many people have had finding work during the recession and slow recovery and that many continue to have, or the persistent differences in the employment situation faced by different demographic groups in the U.S. Technological advances and globalization are changing the nature of available jobs and the skill sets needed to perform those jobs.\n\nI recently visited Hazard, Kentucky, a part of the Cleveland District in the heart of Appalachia. I spoke with some coal miners who were graduating from an electrical-fiber optic lineman training program at the Hazard Community and Technical College.1 All 28 graduates had jobs lined up or were entertaining several job offers. Although this is just one program, it does demonstrate that progress can be made in addressing the longer-run workforce development issues our country faces.\n\nThe Federal Reserve, through its Community Development function, has a role to play in easing such regional transitions. By objective analysis, we can help measure the scope of the problems communities in transition face, determine how best to scale up small, effective programs, and evaluate the pros and cons of alternative approaches and policies.\n\nMonetary policy has an important role to play in fostering conditions to ensure that the economy achieves an enduring economic expansion. This economic stability will help those demographic groups — minorities, older workers, lower-income people — who are disproportionately harmed by economic downturns. But monetary policy cannot directly affect longer-run workforce development problems, and from the vantage point of our dual-mandated goals, I believe we are at maximum employment.\n\nThe other part of the Fed's dual mandate is price stability. Inflation has been running below the Fed's target of 2 percent for quite a while, but it has picked up over the past year. I believe the conditions are in place for a gradual increase in inflation back to 2 percent over the next couple of years. The current low inflation rate partly reflects the effects of earlier declines in the price of oil and other commodities, as well as the appreciation of the dollar, which has held down import prices. As these effects have worked themselves through, headline PCE and CPI inflation, measured year-over-year, have moved up from the very low levels recorded last year to around 1 percent in recent months. To get a better sense of the underlying trend in inflation, economists often look at other measures of inflation that smooth through or strip out some of the more volatile components. These include core PCE inflation and trimmed-mean PCE inflation, which are both at 1.6 percent and gradually nearing the 2 percent goal, as well as core CPI inflation and median CPI inflation, which are now over 2 percent. Indeed, the Cleveland Fed median CPI measure has been above 2-1/4 percent all year, and at or above 2-1/2 percent for the past four months.2\n\nStable long-run inflation expectations are an important component of inflation dynamics. We look at a number of different indicators of inflation expectations. Some are based on surveys of consumers and of professional forecasters; others are based on financial market data. The Cleveland Fed's expectations measure of five-year inflation, five years from now, which combines survey and market data, has been stable this year, in a range of 1-3/4 to 2 percent.3\n\nReasonably stable long-run inflation expectations, evidence that inflation is moving up, continued strength in the labor market, and growth expected to be at or slightly above trend all suggest that inflation is on a path of gradually returning to our 2 percent goal over the next couple of years.\n\nBefore I turn to the implications of the economic outlook for monetary policy, let me talk about our regional economy. The Cleveland District comprises all of Ohio, western Pennsylvania, eastern Kentucky, and the northern panhandle of West Virginia. Our regional economy is quite diverse, but the path of economic expansion here and the outlook are similar to the nation's. To be sure, our region tends to be more dependent on manufacturing than other parts of the country. For example, manufacturing accounts for 15 percent of private-sector jobs in Ohio compared to about 10 percent in the U.S. as a whole. So the region has borne the brunt of the weakness in manufacturing. Similarly, the region had enjoyed the benefits of a sharp increase in production and employment in the oil and gas extraction sector as new technologies were brought to bear, but the sharp drop in oil prices since mid-2014 has resulted in a significant slowdown in natural gas and oil exploration in the Marcellus and Utica shale regions, which include northern Ohio and western Pennsylvania. The weakness in the energy sector is expected to persist somewhat longer, and the longer-term shift away from coal as a source of energy will have lasting effects on the coal-producing parts of the region that have not diversified their economies.4\n\nOn the other hand, the region has benefited from the strength in auto sales, construction, and the service sector, including health and education. We are seeing a modest pickup in regional manufacturing, particularly in firms that are more focused on domestic markets and the auto sector. The auto industry represents a significant share of manufacturing in Ohio and Kentucky, and over the past few years, District auto plants have produced about 17 percent of the nation's autos and light trucks. As auto sales have risen to record levels, regional production has risen as well. Our contacts in the District's auto sector remain optimistic, even though the record sales pace is leveling off.\n\nHousing markets in the region have shown improvement over time. During the housing boom, we didn't see the sharp increases in home prices experienced in other parts of the country. But we did suffer from the housing bust with a large number of foreclosures and vacant properties. The situation has improved. Residential real estate prices in Ohio are now increasing in the 3-1/2 to 4 percent range, with the usual variation across local markets. And according to the Cleveland Fed's Community Stabilization Index, communities across the Fourth District experienced increased housing market stability in 2015, with mortgage delinquencies and foreclosure rates down.5 Residential builders tell us they are optimistic that regional housing markets will continue to strengthen.\n\nLike the nation, our region has seen considerable improvement in labor markets since the start of the recovery. In Ohio, the unemployment rate peaked at 11 percent in December 2009, and is now down to 4.7 percent. This is near the national average and quite a bit lower than the near 6 percent average Ohio experienced during the last expansion. Since the start of the recovery, Ohio has had a net gain of a half million jobs, and payrolls have now surpassed their previous peak by more than 1 percent. People have been reentering the work force, and over the past year, payroll employment has risen nearly 1-1/2 percent in Ohio — a net addition of 78,000 jobs. Job growth here is somewhat slower than the national pace of 1-3/4 percent, but we are doing considerably better than during the previous expansion, when employment in Ohio was essentially flat.\n\nThis is all good news. But like the nation, the regional economy also faces longer-run challenges regarding investments in human and physical capital, as well as low levels of population growth and business formation. These challenges will need to be addressed if we are to remain a region with a healthy economy.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nLet me now turn to monetary policy by first laying some groundwork. The theory and practice of central banking provides several lessons for monetary policymakers. First, policymakers should be forward-looking because monetary policy affects the economy with long and variable lags. This means policy actions need to be taken before our policy goals are fully met, based on the economic outlook over the medium run and the risks around that outlook. Second, policymakers should strive to be consistent in how they respond to economic conditions and to effectively communicate the rationale for their decisions. This helps the public form expectations about the future path of policy and raises public confidence in the policy itself. Third, policymakers should always remain humble about what they know about the economy and how monetary policy can affect it. There is uncertainty around the outlook, around the monetary policy transmission mechanism, and around underlying structural aspects of the economy, such as the longer-run levels of the unemployment rate, trend output growth, structural productivity growth, and equilibrium interest rates. Policymakers need to recognize that it is possible for the structure of the economy to change, but they should not throw out all that's been learned from past experience or be led astray by thinking this time is completely different.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, last week, the FOMC decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 1/4 to 1/2 percent. In the Committee's view, the case for an interest rate increase has strengthened but it decided for the time being to wait for further evidence of continued progress toward the dual-mandate objectives. According to the new projections, FOMC participants continue to anticipate that a gradual upward path of the policy rate will be appropriate over the next three years. But the consensus view was that it was better not to take the next step on that path in September.\n\nI, and two of my FOMC colleagues, dissented from that decision, preferring to see a 25-basis-point increase in September. All participants on the FOMC share the same objective — setting monetary policy to promote our longer-run goals of maximum employment and price stability — even if we disagree from time to time on the best way to achieve those goals.\n\nIn my view, economic developments have corroborated the Committee's medium-run outlook that labor markets will continue to show strength, that growth will rebound to a pace at or slightly above trend, and that inflation will gradually rise to our 2 percent target. We have seen sustained improvement in the labor market, which is now basically at full employment from the standpoint of what monetary policy can do, and inflation has moved up over the past year. The risks that have concerned the Committee, including the volatility in financial markets at the start of the year, economic weakness abroad, and the aftermath of the U.K. vote to leave the European Union, have subsided, and the economic expansion has proved to be resilient.\n\nI view another small step on the gradual upward path as appropriate, not because I want to curtail the expansion, but because I believe gradually moving rates up as we continue to make progress on our goals will help prolong the expansion. It is also consistent with the policy communications we have been issuing for quite a while. I note that the gradual path I'm anticipating means that policy will remain accommodative for some time, continuing to lend support to the economic expansion going forward. The gradual path will also allow us to recalibrate policy over time as we gain more insights into the underlying structural aspects of the post-crisis economy.\n\nNow, one can always say it's better to wait for more information before making a move, and a cautious approach has served us well so far during the expansion. But there are also risks to delaying for too long. If we continue to delay even as we make further progress on our inflation goal and labor markets continue to tighten, we risk having to undertake a considerably steeper policy path later on. Such a strategy is inconsistent with what we have been communicating; it risks confusing the public about our policy rationale and undercutting the credibility of Fed communications. This would cause problems for future policymaking. In addition, if we delay too long and then find ourselves in a situation where the labor market becomes unsustainably tight, price pressures become excessive, and we have to move rates up steeply, we could risk a recession, a bad outcome that history tells us disproportionately harms the more vulnerable parts of our society. I think we also have to recognize that if we fail to exit gracefully from the nontraditional policy actions we took in the aftermath of the crisis — actions I thought were necessary and effective — we could jeopardize their use in the future, should the need arise again.\n\nFor these reasons, I favor taking the next step on the gradual path of rising interest rates. The lesson that policy should be forward looking is based on the history of poor outcomes when that strategy hasn't been followed. In the face of evidence that the economy is on track to meet our goals over the medium run, sometimes being prudent means moving the policy rate up.\n\nConclusion\n\nTwo years ago in one of my first media interviews after becoming president of the Cleveland Fed, I was asked where I saw myself on the avian spectrum — would I be a dove, who would tend to favor low interest rates, or a hawk, who would tend to favor higher interest rates. My answer was that I'd prefer not be thought of as either; instead, my hope was to be viewed as an owl. Of course, that's not up to me to decide — being thought of as an owl is my aspiration. But what I can do and will continue to do is explain to the public my view of economic conditions, the economic outlook, and the rationale for my policy decisions. I view this as an essential part of Fed communications so that the public can hold us accountable for our policy decisions. I hope that you and our other regional contacts will continue to generously provide the Cleveland Fed with your perspectives on the regional economy. This regional information plays an important role in helping us to set national monetary policy in pursuit of the Federal Reserve's longer-run goals of price stability and maximum employment for the benefit of the public."

            "content": "I thank the Kentucky Philanthropy Initiative (KPI) for inviting me to be with you today, and for the great partnership KPI has forged with the Cleveland Fed as we work together to understand and find solutions to the economic challenges facing this region. I appreciate this opportunity not only to enjoy the beautiful bluegrass scenery but also to gather firsthand information about economic conditions in this part of the country. Yesterday I observed an electrical/fiber optic lineman training program at Hazard Community and Technical College and met with representatives of the Eastern Kentucky Concentrated Employment Program, the Foundation for Appalachian Kentucky, the Housing Development Alliance, and the Mountain Association for Community Economic Development. These were very productive discussions.\n\nEastern Kentucky is part of the Fourth Federal Reserve District, which also includes the state of Ohio, western Pennsylvania, and the northern panhandle of West Virginia. That's a pretty diverse region, encompassing larger cities, small towns, and rural areas, with a mix of different industries and occupations. The Federal Reserve System, established by Congress more than 100 years ago, was designed in a way to ensure that the Fed's decisions about monetary policy take into account this very diversity. We recognize that our policy decisions affect Main Streets and communities all across the country. As the president of a Federal Reserve Bank, I make it a point to bring the economic information we have garnered from business, consumer, and labor contacts throughout the District to meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee. That's the body within the Fed that sets monetary policy. The insightful regional perspectives that our contacts provide, along with economic and financial data and analysis, all play an important part in the Fed's setting of national monetary policy in pursuit of our statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability.\n\nWhile most people associate the Federal Reserve with monetary policy, the Fed has had an interest in community development issues for quite a long time. In 1981, the Fed created its Community Affairs function to provide technical training and support to depository institutions to bolster their compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act, a law that promotes equitable access to credit for all individuals and neighborhoods.\n\nFrom this targeted beginning, the Federal Reserve's work in the area of community development has evolved and expanded, much as the nature of community development in general has changed over time. As people in this room know, access to credit is but one factor — albeit an important one — in determining the economic vitality of households and neighborhoods. Today, the Fed's community development function is active in research and outreach concerning housing markets, workforce development, education, health, and small business lending, among other issues.\n\nWhile the focus may have changed over time, one thing that hasn't changed is the Federal Reserve's commitment to helping to identify effective policies and best practices for promoting economic progress in low- and moderate-income communities. The Cleveland Fed very much values the relationships we have built with key philanthropic, government, and other organizations working on programs aimed at improving the economic outcomes of people in eastern Kentucky. Those relationships were instrumental in informing our analysis of some of the community development efforts I'll discuss today. I want you to know that the Cleveland Fed's work is just part of the initiatives taking place at the 12 Federal Reserve Banks across the country. For example, the Minneapolis Fed has established a Center for Indian Country Development to forge partnerships between the Fed and other organizations to study business, housing, and educational issues affecting Native American communities. The Dallas Fed's Colonia project is examining infrastructure, housing, and economic opportunity efforts in the neighborhoods along the U.S.-Mexico border. And the St. Louis Fed's Delta Communities Initiative is working with distressed communities across the Arkansas and Mississippi Delta regions.\n\nThere are many other examples, but today I will focus on approaches and programs that are helping to make a difference in regions like eastern Kentucky, regions that are undergoing significant economic transitions. Before I continue, let me note that the views I'll present are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nEastern Kentucky in Transition\n\nEastern Kentucky, comprising 31 counties, has been facing economic challenges for some time. In 1964, President Lyndon Johnson knelt on the front porch of a Martin County family's cabin as part of his administration's \"War on Poverty\" tour. A photograph of that meeting became an icon in the country's effort to eradicate poverty.1 As discussed in two recent Cleveland Fed articles, while some progress has been made, the challenges remain substantial.2 In the 1960s, about 60 percent of families in eastern Kentucky lived below the poverty line. Today that percentage has fallen to around 25 percent, but that is still about twice as high as the national average and 9 percentage points higher than the rest of Kentucky. In fiscal year 2016, the Appalachian Regional Commission has designated 26 of the 31 counties in eastern Kentucky as distressed.3\n\nThe sources of eastern Kentucky's difficulties are familiar to all of you. Over the past decade or so, eastern Kentucky has lost more than 13,000 jobs; about half of those were jobs in coal mining. The decline in employment has affected the regional economy in a number of ways. Coal miners earn nearly double the average annual income in eastern Kentucky: about $73,000 per year compared to $36,000 per year. So the loss of those jobs has meant a sizable drop in local spending power. In addition, tax revenues derived from the coal industry have fallen sharply as the level of coal production has fallen. For example, the coal severance tax in Kentucky has dropped 40 percent in just the past three years. The weakened economy has exacerbated some social issues in the region. Eastern Kentucky has experienced the pain of the country's opioid epidemic. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, over the period 2000 to 2014, the age-adjusted death rate from drug overdoses more than doubled, with opioids being the main driver of these deaths.4 According to this sad metric, in 2014, Kentucky's death rate from this cause was the fourth highest among the 50 states.\n\nThe economic challenges in eastern Kentucky are also reflected in population trends. While the rest of Kentucky has gained population since 1980, population in eastern Kentucky has been fairly flat and has even begun to decline over the past five years as the coal industry has contracted. Deaths are now outpacing births, and net migration in eastern Kentucky has shifted from an inflow of around 1,300 people a year on average from 1995 to 2011 to an outflow of about 1,100 people a year on average since then.5\n\nFactors Supporting Regional Transformation\n\nEastern Kentucky is not alone in facing economic challenges, many of which arise from the transformation being driven by technological change and globalization. In the Fourth Federal Reserve District, regions that have been dependent on one particular industry like heavy manufacturing or oil have fared less well over time than those that have been able to diversify their industrial bases and adapt to the changing economy. Research and analysis by Federal Reserve staff and others have identified a number of specific factors that support regional economic transitions. The three I will discuss today are: leadership and collaboration, a skilled workforce, and infrastructure.\n\nEffective leadership can make a big difference in how regional economies navigate transitions. The Boston Fed examined small and mid-sized cities that lost manufacturing employment and found that \"resurgent cities,\" meaning those that successfully reinvigorated their economies, exhibited a high degree of leadership and collaboration among key institutions and individuals, including nonprofits, private citizens, corporations, and government.6 But the researchers also found that to have an effect on economic outcomes, leadership and collaboration must be part of long-lasting campaigns. There are no shortcuts or easy fixes.\n\nFortunately, we are seeing some encouraging signs of leadership and collaboration in eastern Kentucky. This summit is a great example of a broad cross-section of funders coming together to support economic transitions. The Kentucky Philanthropy Initiative is aligned with the Appalachia Funders Network and the Appalachian Regional Commission, both of which are active partners of the Cleveland Fed, as well as the Richmond and Atlanta Feds, whose Districts encompass parts of central Appalachia. In fact, Federal Reserve staff members participate in four workgroups operated by the Appalachia Funders Network related to health, food systems, strengthening community capacity, and energy and natural resources. Our staff members are actively engaged with our regional partners to aid in data analysis when possible and to foster leadership connections and information sharing.\n\nLeadership and collaboration also affect the success of employers in recruiting newly trained workers into their industries. Cleveland Fed analysts undertook case studies of five sector-based initiatives across the Fourth District.7 These sectors were health care in western Pennsylvania, information technology (IT) in northeastern Ohio, advanced manufacturing in central Ohio, marine mechanics in northwestern Ohio, and coal mining in eastern Kentucky. Four of these five initiatives provide direct training to workers, while the IT initiative is focused on increasing and enhancing the pipeline of IT talent through deep employer engagement with educational institutions at all levels. The analysts found that successful programs involve employers who are actively and substantively engaged: they provide advice on curricula, directly interact with students, and tend to come from the highest ranks of their organizations so that they are free to speak on behalf of the employers. The case studies also showed that relationships and trust among employers and partners are important drivers of success. Trust is necessary because, in many cases, the employers are competitors; sustained relationships among the many partners are important because they give the initiatives time to evolve and grow.\n\nMany of you are probably familiar with an initiative called Shaping Our Appalachian Region, or SOAR. This effort bears many of the leadership and collaboration qualities that are critical to supporting economic transitions.8 Since its inception in 2013, SOAR has embarked on building a set of working committees that allow individuals and institutions to join together to steer the course of economic revitalization in the region. The leadership and collaboration displayed by SOAR are straight out of the resurgent cities' playbook: the leaders involved in SOAR recognize that it is in their own best interest to support economic rebirth and that collaboration is essential because the process of economic transition is necessarily complex. By providing an easy-to-access venue for eastern Kentucky's organizations, businesses, civic leaders, and private citizens to come together and plan for a stronger economic future, SOAR also provides the essential foundation to effect change. One concrete example of success is the new associate's degree program in broadband technology at Big Sandy Community and Technical College. This is the first such program in Kentucky and only the third in the country. According to the college's president, the program came about in large part because of the coordinated work of SOAR, Kentucky public officials, and One East Kentucky, a nine-county regional organization comprising private businesses and local chambers of commerce.9\n\nOne of the areas SOAR is targeting is workforce development, and wisely so. Just as investments in physical capital, such as plants, equipment, and software, can make businesses more productive, so can investments in human capital — educational and training programs — that allow people to become and remain productive members of the modern labor force.\n\nWhen it comes to the economic well-being of entire regions, many studies have documented the importance of investments in human capital. For example, Cleveland Fed researchers found that over a 75-year period, education levels were consistently one of the most reliable indicators for each state's per capita income growth10 and that counties with higher levels of high school graduates tend to have lower poverty rates and higher levels of labor force participation.11 A study by a Philadelphia Fed researcher found that resilient regions, that is, regions that have been able to avoid persistent declines in population over the long run, tend to have a more educated population and a more diverse industry mix.12\n\nThe benefits of investing in human capital are also evident at the individual level. For individuals, better education is correlated with lower levels of unemployment and higher wages. For example, at the national level, the current unemployment rate for those with a college degree is 2.5 percent, compared to 5.0 percent for those with a high school diploma, and 6.3 percent for those who didn't graduate from high school. The difference in wages between those with a college degree and those without, the so-called skill premium, has widened substantially over time, more than doubling since the 1970s. And over a lifetime, in present value terms, a college graduate can expect to earn nearly twice as much as a high school graduate.13\n\nMost studies have tended to focus on the benefits of a college education because that's where the data are more readily available. But other approaches to workforce development are also needed. Technological change and globalization have been changing the nature of the jobs available in the U.S. Those workers who have been displaced from their current occupations, for example, coal miners and assembly line workers, often need to retrain for the modern economy. Apprenticeships, certificate programs, and on-the-job training can all potentially play an important role in getting people back into productive jobs.\n\nThe Registered Apprenticeship program is administered by the Employment and Training Administration's Office of Apprenticeship within the U.S. Department of Labor, in conjunction with State Apprenticeship Agencies. The apprenticeship programs offer structured on-the-job training combined with related technical instruction tailored to industry needs in a variety of occupations, including electricians, plumbers, truck drivers, and child care workers. One study of the program covering 10 states, including Kentucky, found that the program has been highly effective in generating higher incomes for participants in a cost-effective way.14 In the ninth year after enrollment, the average person who had participated in the program was earning almost $6,000 more in annual salary than similar nonparticipants, and the difference in lifetime earnings amounted to about $98,000. These differences were even greater for those who completed the apprenticeship programs. For Kentucky, data limitations precluded looking at earnings in the ninth year after enrollment, but in the sixth year after enrollment, the average participant in Kentucky was earning over $5,700 more per year than the average nonparticipant. The study also concluded that the estimated social benefits of the program exceeded the social costs.15 In sum, the study's evidence suggested that effective apprenticeships not only lead to higher earnings, but also help people stay employed longer.\n\nWhile it is important to help people already in the labor force transition to other occupations in high demand, it is also important to start training people still in school so that they can develop the skills for the jobs of the future and to make sure that those providing that education and training understand what the jobs in demand will be. The Allegheny Conference on Community Development commissioned an in-depth analysis of the supply and demand for labor in the Pittsburgh region over the next decade.16 The resulting report made a number of recommendations to help prepare employers, current and future workers, educators, and civic leaders for the coming changes. One initiative would create a digital career awareness hub for students and teachers in kindergarten through high school to better match curriculum to the skill sets in demand in the future. Another would create a digital jobs database to make it easier to match those with particular skills to employers currently needing those skills. A further recommendation is to focus resources on high-growth \"opportunity occupations,\" positions that pay higher than the median wage but don't require a bachelor's degree. This diverse group of occupations includes certain jobs in health care, transportation, and bookkeeping. Research by the Federal Reserve suggests that even in opportunity occupations, employers are demanding higher levels of skills than they did in the past, so aligning skill development with these types of jobs will need to be a priority.17 And it's important to note that not all the necessary skills are technical ones.\n\nThe Cleveland Fed's case studies of sector-based training programs that I mentioned earlier found that even if a jobseeker meets the technical skill requirements for a position, lacking the necessary \"soft skills\" can be a significant barrier to employment. By their very nature, soft skills, such as the ability to work in teams and effective communication, are difficult to measure, but studies are now examining the role of characteristics like persistence and other personality traits as they relate to labor market outcomes.18 The ACT WorkKeys test attempts to measure foundational and \"soft skills,\" and Kentucky is using it as a metric to help evaluate whether a community has the infrastructure and workforce sought by employers.\n\nAmong Kentucky's most successful retraining efforts is the Hiring Our Miners Everyday, or H.O.M.E., program. Housed within the Eastern Kentucky Concentrated Employment Program , H.O.M.E. is funded by an emergency grant from the U.S. Department of Labor and, as its name implies, helps miners and their families affected by the decline in the coal industry. H.O.M.E. appreciates that displaced miners are far from unskilled; rather they need the opportunity to hone their skills for different industries. For example, the H.O.M.E. program puts out-of-work miners through a course to prepare them for work as electrical utility linemen, a job that not only pays well, but also provides much-needed fiber optic lines to rural areas. As a result of this program, eastern Kentucky may be able to keep a share of its skilled workforce in the region, thereby helping the local economy to grow. H.O.M.E. is also an example of community leadership and collaboration in action, as it brings together a wide range of entities and interlocking relationships, from the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce to Hazard Community and Technical College. An important next step will be for the partners to undertake a focused evaluation of the program so that we can all learn which specific strategies work and why they work, and which strategies are less effective and therefore less deserving of continued investment.\n\nThe final factor I'll discuss today that's been found to help in revitalizing distressed communities is investment in infrastructure. In fact, infrastructure is a critical component of economies of all sizes. The Appalachian Development Highway System, started in 1965, is a key piece of eastern Kentucky's infrastructure. This system includes 3,000-plus miles of highways across 13 states and was designed for the express purpose of linking otherwise isolated and distressed areas of Appalachia to the Interstate Highway System. Several studies have documented that economic activity is higher in places connected by the highway.19\n\nOf course, in 2016, the regional infrastructure needs of vibrant businesses and households have expanded to include not only the physical highway but also the digital highway. Broadband internet access has become a necessity in our connected world. A recent report issued by Cornell University found that nonmetropolitan counties that have had a high rate of broadband adoption have also experienced higher growth in median household income and lower rates of job loss than similarly situated counties that have had low broadband adoption.20 A 2013 federal government report on broadband access and adoption found that adoption rates vary by household income levels: fewer than half of households with incomes below $25,000 a year use broadband at home, compared with over 90 percent of households with annual incomes exceeding $100,000.21 There is also wide disparity in broadband access, especially access to high-speed broadband, between rural and urban areas, putting the growth prospects of rural areas at a disadvantage. Eastern Kentucky stands to benefit from KentuckyWired, a statewide effort to bring broadband access to underserved areas in the state.\n\nI note that the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) provides a significant opportunity to boost programs like this aimed at closing the digital divide. Recent revisions to the CRA rules recognize that a reliable communications infrastructure, such as broadband internet service, can help to revitalize or stabilize underserved nonmetropolitan, middle-income areas. So depository institutions will now receive credit for investing in this infrastructure for the purposes of meeting the CRA requirement of serving the needs of low- and moderate-income communities.22\n\nConclusion\n\nLet me conclude by noting that the economy has made significant strides in coming back from the Great Recession. The unemployment rates in both the nation and in eastern Kentucky are down about 5 percentage points since their respective peaks during the recession. Accommodative monetary policy has provided important support to the economy on this cyclical journey, helping to promote improving labor markets. But we need to recognize that the labor market outcomes for people in eastern Kentucky are below the national average and there continue to be longer-run challenges in regions like eastern Kentucky that are undergoing economic transformation. Technological advances and globalization are changing the nature of available jobs and the skill sets needed to perform those jobs. To raise our shared standard of living and to make us more competitive in the global economy, the U.S. needs to ensure that people can enter and remain productive members of the transforming economy.\n\nYou may have heard that, last week, I and several other Federal Reserve System leaders met with representatives from the Center for Popular Democracy's Fed Up Campaign in a public forum held before the Fed's annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. It was a productive exchange of views about how to solve some of the labor market challenges still afflicting certain communities and demographic groups. Like the Fed Up Campaign, I believe these are important challenges that the country needs to address, but unlike the Fed Up Campaign, I do not believe that at this point in the business cycle, the current very low level of interest rates is an effective solution to these longer-run issues. But the good news is that the programs I discussed today and many of the other efforts underway can make a real difference to the people and communities in transition. To be sure, these programs are but a small part of the overall strategy needed to support economic transitions. Laying the foundation for sustained economic growth is neither a quick nor an easy task. It involves many different players working together with perseverance. I commend this audience for undertaking this effort. As members of the Kentucky Philanthropy Initiative and related charities, you provide leadership and foster collaboration, key ingredients to the revitalization and resiliency of our regions.\n\nLike the KPI, the Federal Reserve takes seriously its role as a convener. Bringing together people to share their different perspectives and experiences can ultimately lead to more effective economic policies. I have spoken many times about how the diversity of views expressed around the FOMC table helps the Fed make better monetary policy. I believe the same is true for public policies aimed at addressing the challenges faced in community development. KPI performs an invaluable service by pulling together people and groups to support grant making and to promote public-private partnerships targeting the region's persistent challenges. The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland looks forward to our continued collaboration with you in those efforts."

I started coming to Australia about 30 years ago with my husband, who grew up in Canberra. I have to admit, I have not yet acquired a taste for Vegemite — my tastes run more toward lamingtons and Anzac biscuits — but Australians are so welcoming that it is always a pleasure to be Down Under.\n\nAs an economist and policymaker, I appreciate hearing the perspectives of market and business economists. Just as the different views expressed by my colleagues around the monetary policy table help to inform my own policy views, the insights of economists like you help to shape my own economic outlook. The chance to hear perspectives from this side of the Pacific is particularly welcome at this time because we live in a global economy. Today, I will focus my remarks on the U.S. economy and monetary policy. To help put the discussion into context, I will start with a brief overview of the Federal Reserve System. I should note that the views I'll present today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nFederal Reserve Structure and Governance\n\nThe Federal Reserve System, established by Congress in 1913, is a decentralized central bank. It is independent within the government but not independent from the government. The structure is one of balance. Congress designed the Federal Reserve System to alleviate concerns that it would become dominated by financial interests in New York or political interests in Washington. The design includes representation from the rest of the nation, balancing public-sector and private-sector interests, and Wall Street and Main Street concerns.\n\nThe Federal Reserve System has 12 regional Reserve Banks and a seven-member Board of Governors in Washington that oversees those Banks. The governors, who serve the public, are appointed by the president of the United States and confirmed by the Senate, the upper house of Congress. Governors serve staggered 14-year terms, which span several terms of the president and members of Congress. The length of the term is intended to insulate the governors from short-term political influence and allows them to take a longer-run perspective when setting monetary and financial regulatory policy. The chairman and vice chairman of the Board of Governors are chosen by the president and confirmed by the Senate from among the sitting governors for four-year terms. They can be reappointed until their terms as governors expire.\n\nThe 12 Reserve Banks also operate in the public interest. They are distributed around the country in locations that were the centers of economic activity back when the Fed was established.1 Each Reserve Bank has a nine-member board of directors who are chosen in a nonpolitical process. Three directors represent banks and six are nonbankers who represent business, agricultural, industrial, and public interests in the Districts they serve. The nonbank directors are responsible for choosing the Bank's president, who is subject to approval by the Fed's Board of Governors. This structure may seem pretty complicated, but it actually works quite well. Before the Fed was established, there were two earlier attempts at central banks in the U.S. Each lasted only 20 years. In contrast, the Federal Reserve recently marked its 100th anniversary.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, was established in 1934 and is the body within the Federal Reserve System responsible for setting monetary policy. The FOMC holds eight regularly scheduled meetings a year in Washington. This 12-member Committee is made up of the seven members of the Board of Governors, the president of the New York Fed, and four other Reserve Bank presidents who serve on a rotating basis. As president of the Cleveland Fed, I vote every other year, as does the Chicago Fed president. The other presidents vote every third year. I note, though, that presidents who happen not to be voting members at the moment still participate in FOMC meetings. Thus, by design, the discussions at our meetings contain a mosaic of economic information and analysis from all parts of the country. This information helps inform our setting of national monetary policy in pursuit of the goals given to us by the U.S. Congress. These monetary policy goals, often called the Fed's dual mandate, are price stability and maximum employment.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\n\nOur last FOMC meeting was held in mid-June and our next meeting will be two weeks from now. As is always the case, during this intermeeting period, Fed policymakers are evaluating economic developments and assessing the outlook. Of course, the anticipated consequences of the recent decision by U.K. voters to exit the European Union will need to be part of that assessment. This is a developing story, and how it plays out will ultimately determine its implications for the global economy and monetary policy. For the U.S. economy, while the risks and uncertainty surrounding the outlook have increased in the wake of the U.K. vote, FOMC members will be taking the time up to our July meeting to continue to evaluate whether conditions in the aftermath of the decision and other economic and financial developments will necessitate a material change in the modal outlook.\n\nIn thinking about the economic outlook, I try to stay focused on underlying fundamentals because they determine the outlook for the economy over the medium run, the time horizon over which monetary policy can affect the economy. In my view, the underlying fundamentals supporting the U.S. economic expansion remain sound. These include accommodative monetary policy, household balance sheets that have improved greatly since the recession, continued progress in the labor market, a more resilient banking system, and low oil prices. There are risks around all forecasts, but my modal forecast has been that over the next two years the U.S. economy will continue to expand at a pace slightly above its longer-run trend, which I estimate to be about 2 percent; that the unemployment rate will remain slightly under its longer-run level, which I estimate to be about 5 percent; and that inflation will continue to gradually return to the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target. Of course, even in the best of times, without the increased uncertainty of our current situation, there is some variation in growth and other economic indicators over time. The trick is to extract the signal about where the economy is headed from economic and financial market information that can often be quite noisy.\n\nWe've seen this kind of variability in the quarterly measures of U.S. GDP growth. Growth in the first quarter of the year slowed, although less so than originally estimated. Incoming information suggests that we are seeing a rebound of growth in the second quarter. This is very similar to the pattern we saw in 2014 and 2015. Consumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of output in the U.S., has accelerated in recent months. The continued improvement in household balance sheets, growth in personal income, low borrowing rates, and relatively low oil prices have all buoyed consumer spending. In the U.S., the drop in gasoline prices by almost $1 per gallon between 2014 and 2015 saved the average household about $700. Although gasoline prices have moved up in the past couple of months, the U.S. Energy Information Administration now forecasts that the average price of gasoline will be down again this year, resulting in another $200 in cost savings for the average household. Some of those savings have been spent. For example, we've seen high levels of auto sales for the past two years. Some households likely saved part of the windfall instead of spending it, or used it to pay down debt. Either way, stronger household balance sheets will help support future consumption spending.\n\nThe U.S. housing sector has been gradually recovering for some time. In the aftermath of the housing crash, house prices in the U.S. began rising again in mid-2011, and for the past two years, they have been increasing at a 5 to 6 percent annual rate. At the aggregate level, homeowners lost an unprecedented $7 trillion in real estate equity during the housing crash, but the increases in house prices have allowed homeowners to recover nearly all of that. Sales of existing homes, which make up the bulk of home sales in the U.S., are now back near the levels seen before the housing bubble run-up in the early to mid-2000s. I am using the pre-bubble level as my benchmark because we shouldn't want to see the housing market return to bubble proportions. Other parts of the housing sector haven't yet fully recovered. Construction and sales of new homes have been rising at a gradual pace, but they are not back up to their pre-bubble levels. Starts remain below the levels consistent with projections of household formation over the longer run, and in some markets, the supply of housing hasn't kept up with demand. In addition, the type of housing being built has shifted. Over the past five years, increases in multifamily housing starts have significantly outpaced increases in single-family starts. This may reflect a shift in preferences toward more urban living, but it likely also reflects the desire on the part of some people who lived through the crisis to rent rather than own. Mortgage rates are low but households are being careful in not taking on more mortgage debt than they can handle, and banks are lending to those with good credit quality. My assessment of conditions is that the recovery in housing should continue at a moderate pace.\n\nIn contrast to housing, business fixed investment remains weak. While the sharp drop in oil prices since mid-2014 benefited consumers and many businesses, firms in the drilling and mining sector, their suppliers, and regions whose economies depend on the energy sector have been hurt. We have seen the effects in parts of the Cleveland Fed District where steel production has been down and firms tied to energy have had to cut jobs and reduce investment. But even outside of the energy sector, business investment has been soft despite generally accommodative financial conditions. Manufacturers have been investing but mainly to maintain current operations rather than to expand. Part of the softness in investment reflects weakness in demand outside of the U.S., which has hurt U.S. exports.\n\nIndeed, firms exposed to U.S. trade have had to operate in a very challenging environment. The nominal value of the U.S. dollar has appreciated about 19 percent on a broad trade-weighted basis since mid-2014. This has placed a significant drag on manufacturing output and export growth. But the slowdown in the rate of appreciation in recent months was starting to diminish the drag on growth from net exports.\n\nOf course, global growth, commodity price changes, and currency fluctuations are not necessarily independent events. For example, a portion of the more than 50 percent decline in oil prices since mid-2014 likely reflects expectations of weaker growth in China and other countries, although supply factors have likely played a greater role. The appreciation of the U.S. dollar since mid-2014 has reflected expectations that real growth in the U.S. will continue to be stronger than growth abroad, as well as projected real interest rate differentials between the U.S. and other economies. We have to be careful not to think of these shocks as independent events and merely sum their effects. We live in an interconnected global economy. Changes in prices and currency values are one way economies reach a new equilibrium after a shock.\n\nWhile I would expect investment to begin to pick up as overall economic growth expands, the weakness in investment and the associated slow pace of productivity growth pose a risk for the longer-run growth of the U.S. economy. Structural productivity growth is a key determinant of the longer-run growth of output and increases in living standards. And investment in capital, including human capital, is a key determinant of productivity growth. In the U.S., labor productivity growth has risen at only a half of a percent annual rate over the past five years. Part of this weakness is cyclical: weak investment during the recession and early part of the expansion contributed to slow productivity growth over this five-year period. But the weakness in investment and the slow productivity growth have persisted in the U.S. and in several other countries. Productivity growth is very difficult to forecast, so the softness may reverse itself, or it may be longer lasting and reflect a structural issue. If it's the latter, then the longer-run growth rate of the U.S. economy may be lower than the 2 percent growth I've been assuming.\n\nAs this overview suggests, some parts of the U.S. economy have fared better than others. But overall, economic growth has proven to be resilient and at a pace slightly above trend. The pace has been sufficient to generate significant progress in labor markets.\n\nSince the trough in early 2010, the U.S. labor market has added more than 14 million jobs, which is about 10 percent of employment, and the unemployment rate has fallen more than 5 percentage points from its peak of 10 percent in late 2009. Over the past two years, there have also been significant improvements in other gauges of the under-utilization of labor, such as measures tracking the number of part-time workers who would rather work full-time and the number of people who have only been looking for work sporadically or have been discouraged from looking at all because they don't think they will find a job. Increasingly, we are hearing from businesses that they are having trouble finding qualified workers. Early on, such reports were concentrated in high-skilled occupations but now they are expanding to include lower-skilled jobs in a broader set of industries.\n\nThere has been some month-to-month variation in recent employment reports for the U.S. Payroll growth slowed considerably in May, raising the question of whether we were at the start of a reversal from the considerable progress that's been made in labor markets, or whether the weak reading was the type of transitory change we typically see during expansions. Hiring rebounded in June, alleviating that concern.\n\nBased on my read of the available data, I believe the U.S. labor market remains sound and that we'll continue to see further improvements in the job market, although the pace of improvement will necessarily slow given the progress that's already been made. It's important to put monthly jobs reports into context. One thing we have learned is that we shouldn't take too much signal from one or two monthly reports. Payroll growth has slowed several times during this expansion, only to pick up again. In addition, we should expect to see some slowdown in the pace of job growth as the economy nears full employment. Over the past three months U.S. firms added an average of 147,000 jobs per month. That pace exceeds the 75,000 to 120,000 per month range of trend employment growth estimates from various models that take into account the aging of the population and other demographic factors affecting labor force participation. So it is enough to put further downward pressure on the unemployment rate.\n\nOther incoming data remain consistent with an improving labor market. Claims for unemployment insurance are low. The rates of job openings and hiring are high. The quit rate is also high, suggesting that workers are confident enough to be looking for better jobs. The unemployment rate is low, and while the labor force participation rate has varied from month to month, averaging through the recent variability we see that the level of the participation rate is consistent with estimates of its longer-run downward trend. Another positive is that there are signs in the data and from anecdotal reports that wages may be accelerating.\n\nAll of this suggests to me that labor market progress will continue. At the same time, I do not want to underestimate the difficulty that many people have had finding work during the recession and slow recovery and that many continue to have, or the persistent differences in the employment situation faced by different demographic groups in the U.S. The deep recession and slow recovery have exposed and exacerbated longer-run workforce development issues affecting U.S. labor markets. Technological advances and globalization are changing the nature of available jobs and the skill sets needed to perform those jobs. I believe that government programs and private-public partnerships, including educational assistance, retraining programs, and apprenticeships, can be effective in addressing these long-run labor force challenges and should be brought to bear. On the other hand, I do not believe that monetary policy would be effective in addressing these longer-run problems. So from the standpoint of what monetary policy can do, I believe the economy is basically at maximum employment, one part of the Fed's dual mandate.\n\nThe other part of the Fed's dual mandate is price stability. Inflation has been running below the Fed's goal of 2 percent for quite some time. Low inflation partly reflects the effects of earlier declines in the price of oil and other commodities, which began in mid-2014, as well as the appreciation of the dollar, which has held down the prices of nonpetroleum imports into the U.S.2\n\nThe most recent inflation data have been encouraging and in accord with the pattern anticipated by the FOMC. Inflation measures have gradually risen as the effects of previous declines in oil prices and dollar appreciation have begun to fade. Headline PCE and CPI inflation, as measured by the year-over-year changes in the underlying indices, have moved up from the very low levels recorded last year and have been stable around 1 percent in recent months. The core inflation measures, which omit food and energy prices because they tend to be volatile, have also been moving up and are above the headline numbers. Another gauge of underlying inflation, the Cleveland Fed's median CPI inflation rate, rose to over 2.5 percent in May, its highest level in over seven years.3\n\nStable inflation expectations are an important component of inflation dynamics. Even in the face of sizable declines in energy prices, inflation expectations have been relatively stable in my view. At this point I expect them to remain reasonably well anchored, but I am monitoring readings carefully. There are various measures of inflation expectations. Survey-based measures have tended to be more stable than those based on market data. Inflation compensation, as distinct from expectations, is the difference in yields between nominal U.S. Treasury securities and Treasury inflation-protected securities. Inflation compensation has fallen by more than the survey measures of expectations, but various models suggest that the movement more likely reflects changes in liquidity premia and inflation risk premia rather than changes in inflation expectations. Over a period of heightened market volatility and safe-haven flows into U.S. Treasury securities, I take less of a signal about inflation expectations from the market-based measure of inflation compensation than from the survey measures. The Cleveland Fed's model of inflation expectations provides somewhat of a compromise by incorporating survey measures, as well as market data on nominal Treasury yields and inflation swaps. Its measure of 5-year inflation, 5 years from now has been stable, at about 1.9 percent, in recent months.4\n\nGiven these readings on inflation and inflation expectations, so long as the real side of the economy continues to perform as expected, I anticipate that inflation will continue to gradually move back to our goal of 2 percent over the next couple of years.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nIn setting monetary policy, the FOMC assesses both realized and expected progress on our statutory longer-run goals of price stability and maximum employment. That assessment encompasses a wide range of economic information — the official economic statistical releases and financial market indicators, as well as the information FOMC participants garner by speaking with contacts in our regions.\n\nAt its June meeting, the FOMC decided to maintain the target range of the federal funds rate at ¼ to ½ percent. The FOMC indicated that with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, it anticipates further improvements in the economy. This was reflected in the Summary of Economic Projections also released at the June meeting. The median projection among the FOMC participants shows growth at about 2 percent over the next three years, consistent with the median estimate of longer-run trend growth; the unemployment rate coming down a bit from current levels and remaining under the median longer-run estimate of 4.8 percent through 2018; and inflation gradually moving up to 2 percent by the end of 2018.\n\nIn June, the FOMC also indicated that economic developments will likely warrant only gradual increases in the fed funds rate. Of course, the timing of those rate increases and the overall slope of that gradual path will depend on how the economy, the economic outlook, and the risks evolve.\n\nIndeed, in the June projections, the median fed funds rate path of appropriate policy was somewhat shallower than in the last set of projections in March — partly reflecting somewhat slower growth projected for this year, and partly reflecting a lower estimate of the fed funds rate over the longer run.\n\nI supported the decision not to change rates in June. My support did not reflect a fundamental change to my outlook. The progress being made on our policy goals and the outlook suggest that a gradual upward path of interest rates continued to be appropriate. A gradual path means that monetary policy will remain accommodative for some time to come, providing support to the economy and insurance against downside risks. As I said, I believe that the progress in labor markets has been good and will continue, and I view the inflation data as supportive of a gradual return to target. Now, some might argue that in an abundance of caution, we should wait for clarity on these issues, and I agree that there are risks to acting too soon. But there are also risks to forestalling rate increases for too long when we are continuing to make cumulative progress on our policy goals. Waiting too long increases risks to financial stability and raises the chance that we would have to move more aggressively in the future, which poses its own set of risks to the outlook. I believe waiting too long also jeopardizes our future ability to use the nontraditional monetary policy tools that the Fed developed to deal with the effects of the global financial crisis and deep recession. If we fail to gracefully navigate back toward a more normal policy stance at the appropriate time, then I believe there is a non-negligible chance that these tools will essentially be off the table because the public will have deemed them as ultimately ineffective. This is a risk to the outlook should we ever find ourselves in a situation of needing such tools in the future. Of course, such a risk is hard to measure and is not one we typically consider. But we live in atypical times, and we need to take the whole set of risks into account when assessing appropriate policy.\n\nSo why, then, did I think it appropriate not to raise rates in June? The reason was timing. There was considerable uncertainty about the outcome of the upcoming U.K. referendum on membership in the European Union. The vote was being held a week after the June FOMC meeting. It was clear there was going to be volatility in financial markets surrounding the vote. If the vote favored exit, there was the potential of disruption in markets. Given that I do not think U.S. monetary policy is behind the curve yet, I saw little cost in waiting to take the next step.\n\nAfter the U.K. Referendum\n\nIt is an understatement to say that market volatility increased on the outcome of the U.K. referendum. We are now in a world of heightened economic and political uncertainty, and I expect we will be living with uncertainty for a while as the U.K. and Europe establish the terms of their new relationship.\n\nWhen a shock like this hits financial markets, the first task of central bankers is to ensure that there is sufficient liquidity and funding to allow markets to continue to function in an orderly way in the midst of extreme volatility, and to assure the public that we are prepared to act as necessary. The Bank of England, the finance ministers and central bank governors of the G7 countries, and several other individual central banks, including the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, and the Federal Reserve, put out statements indicating that they stand ready to use established liquidity tools to support market functioning.5 Central banks are monitoring the situation for possible contagion across financial markets. The considerable efforts undertaken by policymakers in response to the global financial crisis to increase the resiliency of the financial system, including higher capital and liquidity requirements, mean that financial institutions are now in considerably better shape to withstand short-run volatility while continuing to extend credit to households and businesses. Despite the volatility, markets have generally been functioning in an orderly manner. Investors have been moving funds to safe-haven assets, which has led to lower yields on U.S. Treasuries and appreciation of the U.S. dollar and Japanese yen against the U.K. pound. Reflecting concerns about where U.K. property values may settle, some commercial real estate funds in the U.K. have suspended redemptions. Central banks are continuing to monitor financial market developments closely.\n\nUltimately, global economies will adjust to the new trading and labor relationships negotiated between the U.K. and Europe. Economists continue to evaluate what the magnitude of the effects on the global economy will be. This will depend on how the situation evolves, so the evaluation will take some time to fully develop. In the U.S., in determining whether a material change in our medium-run economic outlook is needed, monetary policymakers are assessing the consequences of the U.K. referendum in the context of other economic and financial developments. While the U.K. represents about 4 percent of world output and global trade, London is one of the major financial centers of the world. About 4 percent of U.S. exports go to the U.K., which is a relatively small share, but the financial ties between our two countries are larger. Barring any major disruption in financial and banking markets, one of the main mechanisms through which the exit decision could affect the U.S. economy is through dollar appreciation, which, depending on its persistence and magnitude, could dampen U.S. export growth and cause a delay in the return of inflation to 2 percent. Slower growth outside of the U.S. would also lower demand for U.S. exports. But it is important to remember that exports make up only about 12 percent of U.S. output; so whatever the reduction in export growth, it would mean a smaller reduction in overall GDP growth.\n\nHeightened and persistent uncertainty is another factor that can affect the economy. When the exit decision was announced, investors moved away from risk assets. Higher credit spreads and lower equity prices, coupled with continued uncertainty, could put firms and households in a wait-and-see mode, reducing economic activity for a time. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has highlighted the dampening effect uncertainty could have on economic performance in the U.K. and steps have been taken there to ease credit conditions. These include reducing the countercyclical capital requirements for banks and encouraging banks to continue lending to households and businesses.6\n\nAs I said, it is too soon to judge the full magnitude of such effects. However, despite the uncertainty, between now and our meeting later this month, FOMC policymakers will continue to evaluate the full set of economic and financial developments to judge whether the medium-run U.S. economic outlook has been meaningfully affected and whether that changes our assessment of appropriate U.S. monetary policy going forward. Monetary policymakers cannot let the lack of economic clarity distract us from our important mission. We must continue to use the best available models, analysis, and judgment to assess the situation. As an FOMC member, I will remain focused on and committed to setting monetary policy to promote the Federal Reserve's longer-run goals of price stability and maximum employment for the benefit of the public."

Since the 2008 global financial crisis, economists and policymakers all over the world have been evaluating the factors that led to the crisis, assessing what could have been done to prevent, or at least limit, the damage, and considering what can and should be done to reduce the probability and impact of future disruptions to financial stability. To its credit and understanding the importance of the financial system to a vital economy, Australia began undertaking thoughtful, periodic reviews of its financial system and regulatory structure well before the crisis. Based on the recommendations coming out of these inquiries, Australian policymakers implemented changes to address the evolving nature of the financial services landscape.\n\nI appreciate the opportunity to learn more about the financial stability efforts underway here and to provide a perspective from the other side of the Pacific. Today, I will focus my remarks on the connections between monetary policy and financial stability. To help put the discussion into context, I will start with a brief overview of the U.S. financial system regulatory structure as it pertains to financial stability. I should note that the views I’ll present today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe U.S. Financial System Regulatory Structure and Financial Stability\n\nIt is probably an understatement to say that the financial system regulatory structure in the U.S. is complex. In part, its complexity reflects the wide array of institutions that provide financial services, helping to support an $18 trillion economy. Banks, a category that includes commercial banks, savings and loans, and credit unions, provide only about a third of the credit in the U.S. Other providers include insurance companies; mutual funds; pension funds; government-sponsored enterprises, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which issue mortgage-backed securities; and other non banks including broker-dealers, finance companies, and mortgage real estate investment trusts.1\n\nThese diverse financial institutions are able to provide valuable credit, risk-management, and liquidity services to businesses and households because they are designed to take risks and are highly leveraged compared with nonfinancial businesses. But this risk-taking and leverage raise the possibility of systemic problems that could threaten the functioning of the financial system, hurt real economic activity, and impose significant economic costs.\n\nThe 2008 financial crisis exposed gaps in the regulatory and supervisory architecture in the U.S., which contributed to a buildup in financial imbalances and systemic risk. In response to the crisis, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was signed into law in 2010. Provisions in the act aim to foster financial stability in two ways: first, by lowering the probability of a financial crisis, and second, by reducing the costs imposed on the rest of the economy when a shock hits the financial system. Under Dodd-Frank, the Federal Reserve and other financial regulatory agencies in the U.S. were directed to augment their traditional microprudential approach, which promotes the safety and soundness of individual institutions, with a macroprudential approach in which examiners and supervisors take a horizontal view of risk across institutions rather than looking at only one institution at a time. Although there is still more to be done, U.S. regulators continue to make progress in developing tools to implement the macroprudential approach and to monitor the risks over the business and financial cycles.\n\nIn the U.S., the application of these tools is complicated by the complexity of the regulatory structure itself. At the federal level, there are multiple financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the National Credit Union Association, the U.S. Treasury, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency. There are financial system regulators at the state level as well. In many cases, the regulatory authority of these agencies is defined by type of institution rather than by instrument.\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act created the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) to promote coordination and information sharing across these financial system regulators. The 10 voting members of the FSOC include the heads of the nine federal regulatory entities I just mentioned, and an independent member with insurance expertise, who is appointed by the president of the U.S. An important power of the FSOC is its ability to designate nonbanks as systemically important, bringing them under more banking-type supervision and regulation. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has the responsibility for supervising systemically important financial institutions, including these FSOC-designated nonbank financial companies, large bank holding companies, and the U.S. operations of certain foreign banking organizations.\n\nThe complexity of the financial system makes monitoring risks more complicated. The Office of Financial Research, established under Dodd-Frank, is collecting data to aid in this task. The Federal Reserve has also developed a framework for systematically tracking risks, which is helping us to better identify changes in conditions over time. Financial stability surveillance is receiving regular attention at meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the body within the Federal Reserve that is responsible for setting monetary policy.2 One might ask why that’s the case given that financial stability is not an explicit part of the FOMC’s monetary policy mandate. It is because the goals of monetary policy and financial stability are interconnected.\n\nThe Nexus Between Monetary Policy and Financial Stability\n\nIn my view, a central bank should care about financial stability to the extent that it affects the health of the real economy. Volatility or minor disruptions in financial markets that represent the ebb and flow of a dynamic economy but do not threaten the health of the economy are not something the monetary policy authority should respond to. Indeed, to the extent that the word “stability” gives the impression that the financial system is static, we may want to adopt the language used in the United Kingdom and speak about financial system resiliency, that is, the financial system’s ability to continue to provide the core financial services of intermediation, risk management, and payments in the face of the inevitable shocks that will hit a dynamic economy.3\n\nMonetary policy mainly works through its ability to affect current and expected future interest rates; however, in certain circumstances, it also has the ability to affect risk-taking by investors and financial institutions, and thereby is linked to financial stability.4 I believe that, in general, the goals of monetary policy and financial stability are complementary. For example, price stability helps businesses, households, and financial institutions make better decisions, thereby fostering the stability of the financial system. And a stable financial system allows for more effective transmission of monetary policy throughout the economy. I view this complementarity as similar to the complementarity between the two monetary policy goals that the U.S. Congress has given to the FOMC, namely, price stability and maximum employment.\n\nBut during the financial crisis we learned that financial imbalances can build up even in a low-inflation environment, so that while price stability may promote financial stability, it is not a sufficient condition. We also learned that financial instability can arise from nonbanks and from institutions that are solvent and not necessarily highly leveraged.5\n\nA large body of research has aided our understanding about how systemic risk can build up and propagate through the economy. Well before the financial crisis, Kiyotaki and Moore (1997) did seminal work on the important role collateral plays in lending markets. In their model, because borrowers cannot be forced to repay, all lending is collateralized. When the economy is performing well, the value of the collateral increases, which supports further borrowing and higher output. But when a negative shock hits the economy and output declines, collateral values also fall, which means borrowing falls, which depresses output even further. Thus, the collateral constraint is a mechanism that amplifies and propagates the effects of temporary shocks on the economy.\n\nBrunnermeier and Sannikov (2014) build on the Kiyotaki and Moore model. In their model, an economic boom increases bank capital levels high enough so that credit is amply available to borrowers. This lowers the volatility of both output and asset prices. The lower volatility induces banks to increase their leverage and lend even more, so much so that the system is now vulnerable to a negative shock. Gorton and Ordoñez (2014) examine how private market activities generate endogenous accumulations of and subsequent collapses in leverage. These models illustrate that systemic risk is endogenous, determined by the choices of the model’s decision makers, and varies across the cycle.\n\nDuring the financial crisis, we saw that when financial markets are not functioning well, the transmission of monetary policy to the economy can be disrupted. In those circumstances, the actions taken to implement monetary policy can also affect financial stability. The FOMC has acknowledged that nonconventional monetary policy, including large-scale asset purchases and the extended period of very low interest rates, could pose potential risks to financial stability by affecting market functioning and by spurring risk-taking in a search for yield.6 Empirical work is beginning to document this effect. For example, Jiménez, Ongena, Peydró, and Saurina (2014) use data on 23 million bank loans from the Spanish credit registry and find that a lower overnight policy rate induces low-capitalized banks to lend more to ex ante riskier firms and to require less collateral compared to high-capitalized banks, direct evidence of monetary policy’s effect on risk-taking.7\n\nThus, while I believe that, in most circumstances, the goals of monetary policy and financial stability are complementary, we need to recognize that, at times, actions taken to foster financial stability and those taken to promote our monetary policy goals might be in conflict, at least in the short run. In the U.K., the Financial Services Act recognizes this potential tradeoff and explicitly says that the Financial Policy Committee (FPC) is not authorized to act in a way that it feels is “likely to have a significant adverse effect on the capacity of the financial sector to contribute to the growth of the U.K. economy in the medium or long term.”8\n\nIn deciding whether to take action against a growing imbalance, policymakers need to balance the expected improvement in future economic conditions against the potential cost of unduly limiting credit extension. Too high a resiliency standard will thwart risk-taking and innovation, which will undermine longer-run economic growth. In setting the standard, we need to come to some common understanding about the amount of growth and prosperity we are willing to give up in order to lower the risk to financial stability. In the U.S., people who are 80 years old have lived through two major financial crises (the Great Depression and the 2008 crisis). Is that too many? Would we rather lower the probability of such an event to one every 1,000 years? What would we be willing to give up to do that?\n\nThat may be a premature question at this point. There are likely things that can be done and that are being done to lower the risk to financial stability without much cost in terms of longer-run growth. If we think of there being a risk-return frontier relating financial stability risk to the economic return that a well-functioning financial system can provide, then it isn’t hard to imagine that we were operating at a point well interior to that frontier in the run-up to the crisis, and that the improvements being made in our financial regulatory and supervisory regime are moving us toward the frontier without sacrificing growth.\n\nMacroprudential Tools\n\nTo foster the resiliency of the financial system, regulators in the U.S. and throughout the world are developing macroprudential tools aimed at lowering the probability that instability will arise and to limit the damage when financial shocks do arise. Some tools focus on building up the structural resiliency of the financial system throughout the business cycle. In my view, these structural resiliency tools are the most promising. They include the Basel III risk-based capital requirements, minimum liquidity requirements, central clearing for derivatives, and bank stress tests. Living-will resolution plans and the Orderly Liquidation Authority, which is housed at the FDIC, are intended to make it easier for regulators and policymakers to allow large complex financial institutions to fail.\n\nIn addition to structural tools, there are countercyclical tools that aim to mitigate the systemic risk that can build up over the business cycle. These include the countercyclical capital buffer and the capital conservation buffer.9 Other possible cyclical tools, not yet established in the U.S. but used in other countries, include loan-to-value ratio limits and debt-to-income ratio limits that vary over the cycle and which have been targeted to particular sectors like housing credit or household credit.10\n\nThe performance of the set of macroprudential tools is largely untested. Cross-country studies find mixed results, with the effectiveness of the tools varying with economic circumstances and the types of shocks hitting the financial sector.11 In the U.S., the need to coordinate countercyclical macroprudential policy actions across multiple regulators adds a complication to effectively using such tools in a timely way.\n\nCurrently, policymakers in the U.K. are putting one of the countercyclical tools to the test. The uncertainty arising from U.K. voters’ decision to exit the European Union has the potential to dampen economic performance in the U.K. In response, policymakers there have taken steps to ease credit conditions. One such step, taken by the Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee (FPC), is a reduction in the countercyclical capital buffer rate for banks to zero percent from half of a percent of banks’ U.K. exposures, with the expectation that the zero percent rate will be maintained until at least June 2017.12 This is a reduction in regulatory capital buffers by 5.7 billion pounds, which the FPC estimates will raise banks’ capacity to lend by as much as 150 billion pounds, or the equivalent of about $260 billion AUD, or about $190 billion USD. Usually, when one thinks about the use of the countercyclical tools it is to mitigate building financial stability risk by tightening credit conditions, but here is an example of the use of a macroprudential tool to ease credit conditions in support of monetary policy goals — an illustration of the nexus between monetary policy and financial stability policy.\n\nLessons from Monetary Policy for Financial Stability Policy\n\nAnother connection between the two stems from hard-won lessons learned from years of monetary policy-setting, lessons that can now be productively applied to financial stability policy-setting. Let me discuss two of these lessons. First, to the extent possible, policymakers should take a systematic approach in applying financial stability policy rather than relying on discretion. The financial crisis underscored the important role of incentives in financial markets — not only the incentives of financial institutions but also those of regulators and policymakers. Time-inconsistency problems and moral hazard issues are important factors that need to be considered when designing a framework for implementing financial stability policy. These types of problems argue for taking a systematic approach to such policymaking.\n\nThe benefits of systematic monetary policy are well established. When monetary policymakers respond in a systematic fashion to incoming information, the public will have a better sense of how policymakers are likely to react to economic developments — whether those developments are anticipated or unanticipated — so their policy expectations will better align with those of policymakers. This alignment helps the public make better financial and economic decisions, thereby making monetary policy more effective.\n\nAn additional benefit of a systematic approach is that it provides a mechanism through which policymakers can commit to policies aimed at promoting policy goals over the longer run. Being systematic can help alleviate time-inconsistency problems in monetary policy, whereby policymakers may favor the short run over the long run. Note that by systematic policy I do not mean that monetary policy will be set mechanically by a policy rule or that policymakers need to be prescient about the types of shocks that will hit the economy. Rather, I mean that policy will react in a systematic fashion to economic developments that change the economic outlook.\n\nA systematic approach to financial stability policy is perhaps even more important than in the case of monetary policy because of the important role played by incentives. The crisis shined a bright light on significant moral hazard problems that exist in financial markets. A financial stability policymaker that is systematic in how it applies its tools to promote stability will likely help tame some of the moral hazard problems and also some of the time-inconsistency problems to which the regulators themselves are subject.\n\nAn important tool in this regard is the resolution of insolvent financial institutions. Without a credible resolution method, during the crisis in the face of serious distress at a large financial firm, governments faced a dilemma: either rescue the firm and create future moral hazard problems or let the firm fail and risk causing a cascade of other failures. The fact that policymakers had to make these decisions in the heat of the moment using their best judgment based on limited information didn’t help. Without a credible resolution method, it is reasonable to expect that even well-intentioned policymakers will be biased toward bailouts. A resolution method that can be applied systematically can help alleviate this problem. The living-will resolution plans and Orderly Liquidation Authority in the U.S. are promising, but still untested, tools in a process that will allow large firms to fail. This, in turn, provides incentives for these large, systemically important institutions to reorganize themselves in a way that reduces the risk they pose to the financial system.\n\nAs I mentioned, the Federal Reserve has become more systematic in monitoring risks across the financial system. Coupling that monitoring with the application of a resiliency standard across the entire financial services landscape, including the so-called shadow banking system that was less-heavily regulated in the past, would limit regulatory arbitrage. As the financial crisis made clear, taking an action that pushes risk from one set of institutions to another doesn’t eliminate the risk, it just moves it around, potentially to a part of the financial system where the risk is more difficult to monitor and control.13\n\nI acknowledge that this broad application of the resiliency standard across the financial system may be particularly difficult in the U.S. with its complex regulatory structure. Still, we can devise ways to make the macroprudential tools more systematic and less discretionary. Regulators could agree in advance on the contingencies under which the cyclical macroprudential tools would be invoked, rather than waiting until the risks escalated before starting the process to coordinate action. For example, we can write down a formula for a countercyclical buffer, and we can define an explicit trigger for contingent convertible bonds. Knowing that such policies will be systematically applied and what will trigger them may induce financial market participants to limit the buildup of risks in the first place.\n\nAnother lesson we’ve learned from setting monetary policy — or perhaps, we are still learning it — is the importance of transparency and clear communication. In my view, to be effective, macroprudential policy actions must be communicated in a clear way to avoid creating a conflict with or causing confusion over actions taken to foster monetary policy goals. Transparency and clear communication are hallmarks of best-practice monetary policymaking. Clear communication helps align the public’s policy expectations, which makes monetary policy more effective. Transparency is necessary so that the public and elected officials have the ability to hold monetary policymakers accountable for their decisions. The Federal Reserve has been given independence in setting monetary policy, which has been well documented as yielding more effective policy and better economic outcomes. But accountability must go hand-in-hand with independence. So the Federal Reserve regularly communicates the basis for its policy decisions.\n\nA parallel can be drawn with financial stability policy. Although, in some cases, prudential supervisory information should be kept private, as a general principle, I think financial stability policymakers should strive for greater transparency and more disclosure. Similarly, they should require more disclosure from financial firms so that creditors and other market participants can exert market discipline.\n\nOf course, clear communication is easier said than done. Three aspects make this even harder for financial stability policy than for monetary policy. First, the framework and tools of financial stability policy are new. It will take considerable effort on the part of the financial stability policymakers to explain the tools they are using and the rationale for their policy decisions. However, such communication is necessary so that the public understands when an action is being taken because of concerns about financial stability rather than concerns about monetary policy goals. This would be particularly true when the monetary policy authority is also responsible for taking financial stability actions, and if monetary policy were the tool used to address the financial stability concerns. It is worth considering whether separating decisions about financial stability from decisions about monetary policy within the central bank, perhaps by having separate committees as in the U.K., could aid communication and decision-making.14\n\nA second complication in effective communication of financial stability policy is timing. If effective monetary policy means taking away the punch bowl just as the party gets going, then effective financial stability policy might mean taking away the punch bowl before the guests have even arrived because the seeds of financial instability are sown much earlier and action must be taken earlier as well. If the need for monetary policy to be forward looking is a difficult concept for the public to grasp, the need for financial stability policy to act well before there are clear signs of instability may be even more difficult to explain.\n\nYet a third complication in effective communication is the complexity of the financial regulatory regime itself.15 In my view, a sometimes overlooked lesson from the crisis is that regulatory complexity can complicate supervision, risk monitoring, compliance, and enforcement. Given the scope and ever-changing nature of the financial system, regulatory complexity is, to a certain extent, unavoidable. But the tradeoffs should be recognized. For example, it is reasonable to require banks to hold higher levels of capital against higher-risk assets, but a system of risk weights that is overly granular and complex would be counterproductive. In practice, too much complexity would make it harder for regulators to assess compliance and to determine whether institutions were engaging in some practices merely as a way to hide risk and lower their capital requirements. If regulators have made the rules so complex that they cannot assess compliance, then, in practice, there are no consequences for firms that fail to meet the standards. Complexity also makes it difficult to monitor the monitors. It might be worth exploring whether we would be better off with a much simpler macro- and microprudential supervisory structure, one that is easier to implement and simpler to govern and that is approximately right across various economic models and states of the world even if it is never optimal in any particular model or state.\n\nOf course, we aren’t in that simpler regime. So the question is, given the current financial structure in the U.S., how should policy respond to emerging financial stability risks and what role should monetary policy play?\n\nMonetary Policy and Financial Stability Risks\n\nI do not believe financial stability should be added to the Fed’s statutory monetary policy goals of price stability and maximum employment. But U.S. monetary policymakers need to remain cognizant of the linkages between financial stability and our monetary policy goals. In my view, the first line of defense against financial instability involves the tools that will make the structure of the financial system less prone to crisis. These structural resiliency tools include higher capital standards (including a minimum non-risk-based leverage ratio, as well as risk-based capital standards), liquidity standards, stress tests, living wills, and effective resolution methods for systemically important bank and nonbank financial institutions. Much work has been done to develop these structural resiliency tools, and I believe the system is in a better position to handle shocks now than it was before the financial crisis.\n\nCountercyclical macroprudential tools, such as limits on loan-to-value ratios in particular markets, are worth further study, but at this point, I am not convinced that we have enough knowledge and experience with them to use them effectively in the U.S. That consideration leads me to think that we should set standards for the structural resiliency tools somewhat higher than they would be if we had more confidence in the countercyclical tools.\n\nWhat about using monetary policy to combat heightened financial stability risks? As I’ve discussed, monetary policy and financial stability goals and actions are interrelated. Very loose monetary policy increases the likelihood that financial instabilities will develop, thereby increasing the likelihood that macroprudential policy tools will be needed. Tight macroprudential policy can tighten financial conditions more generally, thereby increasing the likelihood that a monetary policy response will be needed.\n\nThat said, in my view, U.S monetary policy should remain focused on promoting price stability and maximum employment, and financial stability should not be added as a third objective for monetary policy. First, it isn’t clear that monetary policy would be very effective against emerging financial stability risks. While interest rates affect the fundamental value of assets, it is not clear that they affect the speculative or bubble portion; the impact may depend on the underlying nature of the financial imbalance.16 Second, monetary policy tends to be a blunt instrument, so any benefits of using it to stem financial imbalances, mispricing of assets, or excessive leverage need to be weighed against the economic costs in terms of price stability and employment. Svensson (2016) brings some metrics to the question and concludes that the costs outweigh the benefits.17\n\nWhile I don’t believe financial stability should be part of the Fed’s monetary policy mandate, monetary policymakers need to be aware of the linkages between our monetary policy actions and financial stability. In the case of the housing market, which precipitated the last crisis, policymakers underestimated the breadth and depth of the negative impact this would have on the rest of the economy and financial system. To the extent that we misjudged the impact, there is a larger potential gain to carefully monitoring financial market conditions, implementing the structural macroprudential tools, and being open to taking offsetting action should imbalances develop.18\n\nIf our macroprudential tools proved to be inadequate and financial stability risks continued to grow, I believe monetary policy should be on the table as a possible defense. However, in this case, the blurring between financial stability goals and monetary policy goals would be high: if we assessed the risks to financial stability to be sufficiently great, achieving our dual mandate monetary policy goals would also be in jeopardy. Which brings me back to my original point: in most cases, the goals of price stability, maximum employment, and financial stability are complementary.\n\nConclusion\n\nLet me conclude by noting that in his 2015 presidential address to the American Finance Association, Luigi Zingales (2015) posed the question, “Does Finance Benefit Society?” While academics, and, I believe, central bankers, typically say “yes,” a recent survey indicates that the average American is much less certain.19 I am hopeful that the considerable efforts underway across the globe will change that. I believe it is our responsibility to ensure that we create and maintain a financial system that the public views as being beneficial, and one that truly is."

I will focus my remarks today on the other side of the pond — in particular, the U.S. economy and monetary policy. But as you know, we live in a global world, and so we are monitoring very closely what is happening on this side of the pond and assessing the implications for the economic outlook and monetary policy on my side of the pond. Before I begin, I should note that the views I'll present today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\n\nThe consequences of last week's decision by U.K. voters to exit the European Union are on everyone's mind. This is a developing story, and how it plays out will ultimately determine its implications for the global economy and monetary policy. For the U.S. economy, while the risks and uncertainty surrounding the outlook have increased, it is too early to judge whether conditions in the aftermath of the decision will necessitate a material change in the modal outlook. In structuring my remarks today, I think it would be helpful to first discuss my views on the U.S. economy prior to the vote. These were the views I carried into the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting two weeks ago and that helped inform the economic projections I submitted as part of the FOMC's latest Summary of Economic Projections (SEP). I will then discuss the potential ramifications of the U.K.'s exit decision for the U.S. economic outlook.\n\nIn thinking about the economic outlook, I try to stay focused on underlying fundamentals because they determine the outlook for the economy over the medium run, the time horizon over which monetary policy can affect the economy. In my view, the underlying fundamentals supporting the U.S. economic expansion remain sound. These include accommodative monetary policy, household balance sheets that have improved greatly since the recession, continued progress in the labor market, a more resilient banking system, and low oil prices. There are risks around all forecasts, but my modal forecast has been that over the next two years the U.S. economy will continue to expand at a pace slightly above its longer-run trend, which I estimate to be about 2 percent; that the unemployment rate will remain slightly under its longer-run level, which I estimate to be about 5 percent; and that inflation will continue to gradually return to the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target. Of course, even in the best of times, without the increased uncertainty of our current situation, there is some variation in growth and other economic indicators over time. The trick is to extract the signal about where the economy is headed from economic and financial market information that can often be quite noisy.\n\nWe've seen this kind of variability in the quarterly measures of U.S. GDP growth. Growth in the first quarter of the year slowed, although less so than originally estimated. Incoming information suggests that we are seeing a rebound of growth in the second quarter. This is very similar to the pattern we saw in 2014 and 2015. Consumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of output in the U.S., has accelerated in recent months. The continued improvement in household balance sheets, growth in personal income, low borrowing rates, and relatively low oil prices have all buoyed consumer spending. In the U.S., the drop in gasoline prices by almost $1 per gallon between 2014 and 2015 saved the average household about $700. Although gasoline prices have moved up in the past couple of months, the U.S. Energy Information Administration now forecasts that the average price of gasoline will be down again this year, resulting in another $200 in cost savings for the average household. Some of those savings have been spent. For example, we've seen high levels of auto sales for the past two years. Some households likely saved part of the windfall instead of spending it, or used it to pay down debt. Either way, stronger household balance sheets will help support future consumption spending.\n\nThe U.S. housing sector has been gradually recovering for some time. In the aftermath of the housing crash, house prices in the U.S. began rising again in mid-2011, and for the past two years, they have been increasing at a 5 to 6 percent annual rate. At the aggregate level, homeowners lost an unprecedented $7 trillion in real estate equity during the housing crash, but the increases in house prices have allowed homeowners to recover nearly all of that. Sales of existing homes, which make up the bulk of home sales in the U.S., are now back near the levels seen before the housing bubble run-up in the early to mid-2000s. I am using the pre-bubble level as my benchmark because we shouldn't want to see the housing market return to bubble proportions. Other parts of the housing sector haven't yet fully recovered. Construction and sales of new homes have been rising at a gradual pace, but they are not back up to their pre-bubble levels. Starts remain below the levels consistent with projections of household formation over the longer run, and in some markets, the supply of housing hasn't kept up with demand. In addition, the type of housing being built has shifted. Over the past five years, increases in multifamily housing starts have significantly outpaced increases in single-family starts. This may reflect a shift in preferences toward more urban living, but it likely also reflects the desire on the part of some people who lived through the crisis to rent rather than own. Mortgage rates are low but households are being careful in not taking on more mortgage debt than they can handle, and banks are lending to those with good credit quality. My assessment of conditions is that the recovery in housing should continue at a moderate pace.\n\nIn contrast to housing, business fixed investment remains weak. While the sharp drop in oil prices since mid-2014 benefited consumers and many businesses, firms in the drilling and mining sector, their suppliers, and regions whose economies depend on the energy sector have been hurt. We have seen the effects in parts of the Cleveland Fed District where steel production has been down and firms tied to energy have had to cut jobs and reduce investment. Business contacts in the steel industry have told us they've been encouraged by the firming in oil and other commodity prices since the start of the year, but they remain uncertain about the sustainability of those increases. Other contacts in the energy sector have told us that the price increases have spurred moving forward on some investment projects that had been put on hold. But even outside of the energy sector, business investment has been soft despite generally accommodative financial conditions. Manufacturers have been investing but mainly to maintain current operations rather than to expand. Some manufacturers in the Cleveland District have told us that businesses' reluctance to expand capacity reflects concern about the overall longer-run direction of the economy rather than concerns about the economy in the near term or their own firms' performance. Part of the softness in investment reflects weakness in demand outside of the U.S., which has hurt U.S. exports.\n\nIndeed, firms exposed to U.S. trade have had to operate in a very challenging environment. From mid-2014 until last week, the nominal value of the U.S. dollar has appreciated about 18 percent on a broad trade-weighted basis. This has placed a significant drag on manufacturing output and export growth. But the slowdown in the rate of appreciation in recent months was starting to diminish the drag on growth from net exports. In the first quarter, net exports made a slightly positive contribution to U.S. output growth; in contrast, they subtracted about a half of a percentage point from growth last year.\n\nOf course, global growth, commodity price changes, and currency fluctuations are not necessarily independent events. For example, a portion of the more than 50 percent decline in oil prices since mid-2014 likely reflects expectations of weaker growth in China and other countries, although supply factors have likely played a greater role. The appreciation of the U.S. dollar since mid-2014 has reflected expectations that real growth in the U.S. will continue to be stronger than growth abroad, as well as projected real interest rate differentials between the U.S. and other economies. We have to be careful not to think of these shocks as independent events and merely sum their effects. We live in an interconnected global economy. Changes in prices and currency values are one way economies reach a new equilibrium after a shock.\n\nWhile I would expect investment to begin to pick up as overall economic growth expands, the weakness in investment and the associated slow pace of productivity growth pose a risk for the longer-run growth of the U.S. economy. Structural productivity growth is a key determinant of the longer-run growth of output and increases in living standards. And investment in capital, including human capital, is a key determinant of productivity growth. Labor productivity growth has risen at only a half of a percent annual rate over the past five years. Part of this weakness is cyclical: weak investment during the recession and early part of the expansion contributed to slow productivity growth over this period. But the weakness in investment and productivity has persisted. Productivity growth is very difficult to forecast, so the softness may reverse itself, or it may be longer lasting and reflect a structural issue. If it's the latter, then the longer-run growth rate of the U.S. economy may be lower than the 2 percent growth I've been assuming.\n\nAs this overview suggests, some parts of the U.S. economy have fared better than others. But overall, economic growth has proven to be resilient and at a pace slightly above trend. The pace has been sufficient to generate significant progress in labor markets.\n\nSince the trough in early 2010, the U.S. labor market has added more than 14 million jobs, which is about 10 percent of employment, and the unemployment rate has fallen more than 5 percentage points from its peak of 10 percent in late 2009. Over the past two years, there have also been significant improvements in other gauges of the under-utilization of labor, such as measures tracking the number of part-time workers who would rather work full-time and the number of people who have only been looking for work sporadically or have been discouraged from looking at all because they don't think they will find a job. Increasingly, we are hearing from businesses that they are having trouble finding qualified workers. Early on, such reports were concentrated in high-skilled occupations in information technology, health care, and specialized construction. Now, the reports are expanding to include lower-skilled jobs and less-specialized occupations in a broader set of industries.\n\nSo when the U.S. labor market report for May was released early last month, it garnered considerable attention. Just when we were beginning to see signs of a pickup in growth in the second quarter, we received news that firms added just 38,000 jobs to their payrolls in May. Part of the weakness reflected the effects of a strike by workers at Verizon Communications. But even adjusting for that, which accounted for about 35,000 jobs, the pace was a considerable step down from the 200,000-plus jobs per month the U.S. economy was adding last year and early this year. The question is: was this the start of a reversal from the considerable progress that's been made in labor markets, or was this the type of transitory change we typically see during expansions?\n\nMy read of the available data puts me in the second camp: I believe the U.S. labor market remains sound and that we'll continue to see further improvements in the job market, although the pace of improvement will necessarily slow given the progress that's already been made. It's important to put the May jobs report into context. One thing we have learned is that we shouldn't take too much signal from one or two monthly reports. Payroll growth has slowed several times during this expansion, only to pick up again. We will see how payrolls behaved in June when the report is released next Friday.\n\nIn addition, we should expect to see some slowdown in the pace of job growth as the economy nears full employment. The bigger surprise may have been the very strong job numbers early this year. Adjusting for the Verizon strike, over the past three months firms added an average of 127,000 jobs per month. That pace exceeds the 75,000 to 120,000 per month range of trend employment growth estimates from various models that take into account the aging of the population and other demographic factors affecting labor force participation. So it is enough to put further downward pressure on the unemployment rate.\n\nOther incoming data remain consistent with an improving labor market. Claims for unemployment insurance are low. The rates of job openings and hiring are high. The quit rate is also high, suggesting that workers are confident enough to be looking for better jobs. The unemployment rate is low. Of course, just as I discount taking a strong signal from weak May payrolls, I don't read May's sharp drop in the unemployment rate to 4.7 percent as indicating a significant tightening in labor market conditions. The drop reflected not only a decline in the number of unemployed people but also an outsized decline in the labor force participation rate. The participation rate varies from month to month, but averaging over the past several months, the level of the participation rate is consistent with estimates of its longer-run downward trend. Another positive is that there are signs in the data and from anecdotal reports that wages may be accelerating.\n\nAll of this suggests to me that labor market progress will continue. At the same time, I do not want to underestimate the difficulty that many people have had finding work during the recession and slow recovery and that many continue to have, or the persistent differences in the employment situation faced by different demographic groups in the U.S. There are serious longer-run workforce development issues affecting U.S. labor markets, and the deep recession and slow recovery have exposed and exacerbated these problems. Technological advances and globalization are changing the nature of available jobs and the skill sets needed to perform those jobs. As a country, the U.S. needs to ensure that people can enter and remain productive members of the modern labor force. This will raise our shared standard of living and make us more competitive in the global economy. I believe that government programs and private-public partnerships, including educational assistance, retraining programs, and apprenticeships, can be effective in addressing these long-run labor force challenges and should be brought to bear. On the other hand, I do not believe that monetary policy would be effective in addressing these longer-run problems. So from the standpoint of what monetary policy can do, I believe the economy is basically at maximum employment, one part of the Fed's dual mandate.\n\nThe other part of the Fed's dual mandate is price stability. Inflation has been running below the Fed's goal of 2 percent for quite some time. Low inflation partly reflects the effects of earlier declines in the price of oil and other commodities, which began in mid-2014, as well as the appreciation of the dollar, which has held down the prices of nonpetroleum imports into the U.S. According to dynamic simulations of the Federal Reserve Board staff's SIGMA model, a 10 percent rise in the real value of the dollar affects core inflation via import prices fairly quickly, resulting in a drop of about 0.5 percent in core inflation a year after the shock, which partially reverses over the subsequent year. A shock to the value of the dollar also tends to reduce GDP with a lag, and the model indicates that this would put additional downward pressure on inflation.1\n\nThe most recent inflation data have been encouraging and in accord with the pattern anticipated by the FOMC. Inflation measures have gradually risen as the effects of previous declines in oil prices and dollar appreciation have begun to fade. Headline PCE and CPI inflation, as measured by the year-over-year changes in the underlying indices, have moved up from the very low levels recorded last year and have been stable at a little more than 1 percent in recent months. The core inflation measures, which omit food and energy prices because they tend to be volatile, have also been moving up and are above the headline numbers. Another gauge of underlying inflation, the Cleveland Fed's median CPI inflation rate, rose to over 2.5 percent in May, its highest level in over seven years.2\n\nStable inflation expectations are an important component of inflation dynamics. Even in the face of sizable declines in energy prices, inflation expectations have been relatively stable in my view. At this point I expect them to remain reasonably well anchored, but I am monitoring readings carefully. There are various measures of inflation expectations. Survey-based measures have tended to be more stable than those based on market data. Inflation compensation, as distinct from expectations, is the difference in yields between nominal U.S. Treasury securities and Treasury inflation-protected securities. Inflation compensation has fallen by more than the survey measures of expectations, but various models suggest that the movement more likely reflects changes in liquidity premia and inflation risk premia rather than changes in inflation expectations. Over a period of heightened market volatility and safe-haven flows into U.S. Treasury securities, I take less of a signal about inflation expectations from the market-based measure of inflation compensation than from the survey measures. The Cleveland Fed's model of inflation expectations provides somewhat of a compromise by incorporating survey measures, as well as market data on nominal Treasury yields and inflation swaps. Its measure of 5-year inflation, 5 years from now has been stable, at about 1.9 percent, in recent months.3\n\nGiven these readings on inflation and inflation expectations, so long as the real side of the economy continues to perform as expected, I anticipate that inflation will continue to gradually move back to our goal of 2 percent over the next couple of years.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nIn setting monetary policy, the FOMC assesses both realized and expected progress on our statutory longer-run goals of price stability and maximum employment. That assessment encompasses a wide range of economic information — the official economic statistical releases and financial market indicators, as well as the information FOMC participants garner by speaking with contacts in our regions.\n\nAt its June meeting two weeks ago, the FOMC decided to maintain the target range of the federal funds rate at ¼ to ½ percent. The FOMC indicated that with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, it anticipates further improvements in the economy. This was reflected in the Summary of Economic Projections also released at the June meeting. The median projection among the FOMC participants shows growth at about 2 percent over the next three years, consistent with the median estimate of longer-run trend growth; the unemployment rate coming down a bit from current levels and remaining under the median longer-run estimate of 4.8 percent through 2018; and inflation gradually moving up to 2 percent by the end of 2018.\n\nIn June, the FOMC also indicated that economic developments will likely warrant only gradual increases in the fed funds rate. Of course, the timing of those rate increases and the overall slope of that gradual path will depend on how the economy, the economic outlook, and the risks evolve.\n\nIndeed, in the June projections, the median fed funds rate path of appropriate policy was somewhat shallower than in the last set of projections in March — partly reflecting somewhat slower growth projected for this year, and partly reflecting a lower estimate of the fed funds rate over the longer run.\n\nI supported the decision not to change rates in June. My reason did not reflect a fundamental change to my outlook. The progress being made on our policy goals and the outlook suggest that a gradual upward path of interest rates continued to be appropriate. A gradual path means that monetary policy will remain accommodative for some time to come, providing support to the economy and insurance against downside risks. As I said, I do not think we are at the start of a significant reversal in labor markets, and I view the inflation data as supportive of a gradual return to target. Now, some might argue that in an abundance of caution, we should wait for clarity on these issues, and I agree that there are risks to acting too soon. But there are also risks to forestalling rate increases for too long when we are continuing to make cumulative progress on our policy goals. Waiting too long increases risks to financial stability and raises the chance that we would have to move more aggressively in the future, which poses its own set of risks to the outlook. I believe waiting too long also jeopardizes our future ability to use the nontraditional monetary policy tools that the Fed developed to deal with the effects of the global financial crisis and deep recession. If we fail to gracefully navigate back toward a more normal policy stance at the appropriate time, then I believe there is a non-negligible chance that these tools will essentially be off the table because the public will have deemed them as ultimately ineffective. This is a risk to the outlook should we ever find ourselves in a situation of needing such tools in the future. Of course, such a risk is hard to measure and is not one we typically consider. But we live in atypical times, and we need to take the whole set of risks into account when assessing appropriate policy.\n\nSo why, then, did I think it appropriate not to raise rates in June? The reason was timing. There was considerable uncertainty about the outcome of the upcoming U.K. referendum on membership in the European Union. The vote was being held a week after the June FOMC meeting. It was clear there was going to be volatility in financial markets surrounding the vote. If the vote favored exit, there was the potential for disruption in markets. Given that I do not think U.S. monetary policy is behind the curve yet, I saw little cost in waiting to take the next step.\n\nAfter the U.K. Referendum\n\nIt is an understatement to say that market volatility increased on the outcome of the U.K. referendum. We are now in a world of heightened economic and political uncertainty, and I expect we will be living with uncertainty for a while as the U.K. and Europe establish the terms of their new relationship.\n\nWhen a shock like this hits financial markets, the first task of central bankers is to ensure that there is sufficient liquidity and funding to allow markets to continue to function in an orderly way in the midst of extreme volatility, and to assure the public that we are prepared to act as necessary. The Bank of England, the finance ministers and central bank governors of the G7 countries, and several other individual central banks including the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, and the Federal Reserve, put out statements last Friday indicating that they stand ready to use established liquidity tools to support market functioning.4 Central banks are monitoring the situation for possible contagion across financial markets. Despite the volatility, markets have been functioning in an orderly manner. The considerable efforts undertaken in the U.K., Europe, the U.S., and other countries in response to the global financial crisis to increase the resiliency of the financial system, including higher capital and liquidity requirements, mean financial institutions are now in considerably better shape to withstand short-run volatility while continuing to extend credit to households and businesses.\n\nUltimately, global economies will adjust to the new trading and labor relationships negotiated between the U.K. and Europe. It is too early to judge what the magnitude of the effects on the global economy will be and, for the U.S. economy, whether there will be a material change in the medium-run outlook. It will depend on how the situation evolves, so the assessment will take some time to fully develop. While the U.K. represents about 4 percent of world output and global trade, London is one of the major financial centers of the world. About 4 percent of U.S. exports go to the U.K., which is a relatively small share, but the financial ties between our two countries are larger. Barring any major disruption in financial and banking markets, one of the main mechanisms through which the exit decision could affect the U.S. economy is through dollar appreciation, which, depending on its persistence and magnitude, could dampen U.S. export growth and cause a delay in the return of inflation to 2 percent. Slower growth outside of the U.S. would also lower demand for U.S. exports. But it is important to remember that exports make up only about 12 percent of U.S. output, so whatever the reduction in export growth, it would mean a smaller reduction in overall GDP growth.\n\nHeightened and persistent uncertainty is another factor that can affect the economy. When the exit decision was announced, investors moved away from risk assets. Higher credit spreads and lower equity prices, coupled with continued uncertainty, could put firms and households in a wait-and-see mode, reducing economic activity for a time. In his speech yesterday, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney highlighted the dampening effect uncertainty could have on economic performance in the U.K. and indicated possible responses to it.5\n\nAs I said, it is too soon to judge the full magnitude of such effects. At this point, we need to continue to monitor developments. For example, some of the tightening in financial conditions after the announcement of the vote's outcome has been reversed in recent days. As we see how things play out, we will have a better sense of whether the medium-run U.S. economic outlook has been meaningfully affected and whether that changes our assessment of appropriate U.S. monetary policy going forward. Monetary policymakers cannot let the lack of economic clarity distract us from our important mission. We must continue to use the best available models, analysis, and judgment to assess the situation. As an FOMC member, I will remain focused on and committed to setting monetary policy to promote the Federal Reserve's longer-run goals of price stability and maximum employment for the benefit of the public."

            "href": "https://www.clevelandfed.org/collections/speeches/sp-20160604-five-points",
            "content": "I thank Stefan Ingves and Anders Vredin for inviting me to participate in this conference on the central bank’s mandate. It seems very fitting that such a discussion should take place in Sweden, as the Riksbank is considered to be the oldest central bank in the world, only a couple of years shy of 350 years old. The Federal Reserve, which recently marked its 100th anniversary, is quite a youngster by comparison, although the Fed has endured considerably longer than the first two attempts at central banks in the U.S., each of which lasted only 20 years.\n\nSince the 2008 global financial crisis and the Great Recession that followed, economists and policymakers have been evaluating the factors that led to the crisis, assessing what could have been done to prevent, or at least limit, the damage, and considering what can and should be done to reduce the probability and impact of future disruptions to financial stability. That this is a very broad topic can easily be seen by looking at the agendas of this and previous years’ conferences organized by the Riksbank. Today I will focus my remarks on the nexus between monetary policy and financial stability, and I’ll arrange my comments around five main points. Before I continue, I should mention that these are my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nPoint 1: Financial stability matters to central banks because the goals of monetary policy and financial stability are interconnected.\n\nCentral banks care about financial stability. Financial institutions are able to provide valuable credit, risk-management, and liquidity services to businesses and households because they are designed to take risks and are highly leveraged compared with nonfinancial businesses. But this risk-taking and leverage raise the possibility of systemic problems that could threaten the functioning of the financial system, hurt real economic activity, and impose significant economic costs. In fact, the Federal Reserve was established in 1913 after a series of financial panics to help promote a more stable financial system and avoid costly bank runs.\n\nIn my view, a central bank should care about financial stability to the extent that it affects the health of the real economy. Volatility or minor disruptions in financial markets that represent the ebb and flow of a dynamic economy but do not threaten the health of the economy are not something the monetary policy authority should respond to. Indeed, to the extent that the word “stability” gives the impression that the financial system is static, we may want to adopt the language used in the United Kingdom and speak about financial system resiliency, that is, the ability of the financial system to continue to provide the core financial services of intermediation, risk management, and payments in the face of the inevitable shocks that will hit a dynamic economy.1\n\nMonetary policy mainly works through its ability to affect current and expected future interest rates; however, in certain circumstances, it also has the ability to affect risk-taking by investors and financial institutions, and thereby is linked to financial stability.2 I believe that, in general, the goals of monetary policy and financial stability are complementary. For example, price stability helps businesses, households, and financial institutions make better decisions, thereby fostering the stability of the financial system. And a stable financial system allows for more effective transmission of monetary policy throughout the economy. I view this complementarity as similar to the complementarity between the two monetary policy goals that the U.S. Congress has given to the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), namely, price stability and maximum employment.\n\nBut during the financial crisis we learned that financial imbalances can build up even in a low-inflation environment, so that while price stability may promote financial stability, it is not a sufficient condition. We also learned that financial instability can arise from nonbanks and from institutions that are solvent and not necessarily highly leveraged.3\n\nA large body of research has aided our understanding about how systemic risk can build up and propagate through the economy. Well before the financial crisis, Kiyotaki and Moore (1997) did seminal work on the important role collateral plays in lending markets. In their model, because borrowers cannot be forced to repay, all lending is collateralized. When the economy is performing well, the value of the collateral increases, which supports further borrowing and higher output. But when a negative shock hits the economy and output declines, collateral values also fall, which means borrowing falls, which depresses output even further. Thus, the collateral constraint is a mechanism that amplifies and propagates the effects of temporary shocks on the economy.\n\nBrunnermeier and Sannikov (2014) build on the Kiyotaki and Moore model. In their model, an economic boom increases bank capital levels high enough so that credit is amply available to borrowers. This lowers the volatility of both output and asset prices. The lower volatility induces banks to increase their leverage and lend even more, so much so that the system is now vulnerable to a negative shock. Gorton and Ordoñez (2014) examine how private market activities generate endogenous accumulations of and subsequent collapses in leverage. These models illustrate that systemic risk is endogenous, determined by the choices of the model’s decision makers, and varies across the cycle.\n\nDuring the financial crisis, we saw that when financial markets are not functioning well, the transmission of monetary policy to the economy can be disrupted. In those circumstances, the actions taken to implement monetary policy can also affect financial stability. The FOMC has acknowledged that nonconventional monetary policy, including large-scale asset purchases and the extended period of very low interest rates, could pose potential risks to financial stability by affecting market functioning and by spurring risk-taking in a search for yield.4 Empirical work is beginning to document this effect. For example, Jiménez, Ongena, Peydró, and Saurina (2014) use data on 23 million bank loans from the Spanish credit registry and find that a lower overnight policy rate induces low-capitalized banks to lend more to ex ante riskier firms and to require less collateral compared to high-capitalized banks, direct evidence of monetary policy’s effect on risk-taking.5\n\nThus, while I believe that, in most circumstances, the goals of monetary policy and financial stability are complementary, we need to recognize that, at times, actions taken to foster financial stability and those taken to promote our monetary policy goals might be in conflict, at least in the short run. In the U.K., the Financial Services Act recognizes this potential tradeoff and explicitly says that the Financial Policy Committee is not authorized to act in a way that it feels is “likely to have a significant adverse effect on the capacity of the financial sector to contribute to the growth of the U.K. economy in the medium or long term.”6\n\nIn deciding whether to take action against a growing imbalance, policymakers need to balance the expected improvement in future economic conditions against the potential cost of unduly limiting credit extension. Too high a resilience standard will thwart risk-taking and innovation, which will undermine longer-run economic growth. In setting the standard, we need to come to some common understanding about the amount of growth and prosperity we are willing to give up in order to lower the risk to financial stability. In the U.S., people who are 80 years old have lived through two major financial crises (the Great Depression and the 2008 crisis). Is that too many? Would we rather lower the probability of such an event to one every 1,000 years? What would we be willing to give up to do that?\n\nThat may be a premature question at this point. There are likely things that can be done and that are being done to lower the risk to financial stability without much cost in terms of longer-run growth. If we think of there being a risk-return frontier relating financial stability risk to the economic return that a well-functioning financial system can provide, then it isn’t hard to imagine that we were operating at a point well interior to that frontier in the run-up to the crisis, and that the improvements being made in our financial regulatory and supervisory regime are moving us toward the frontier without sacrificing growth. This brings me to my second point.\n\nPoint 2: To foster the resiliency of the financial system, macroprudential tools are being developed to lower the probability that instability arises and to limit the damage when financial shocks arise.\n\nIn the U.S., the regulatory reforms engendered in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act aim to foster financial stability in two ways: first, by lowering the probability of a financial crisis, and second, by reducing the costs imposed on the rest of the economy when a shock hits the financial system. Under Dodd-Frank, the Federal Reserve and other financial regulatory agencies in the U.S. were directed to augment their traditional microprudential approach, which promotes the safety and soundness of individual institutions, with a macroprudential approach in which examiners and supervisors take a horizontal view of risk across institutions rather than looking at only one institution at a time.\n\nAlthough there is still more to be done, regulators continue to make progress in developing tools to implement the macroprudential approach and to monitor the risks over the business and financial cycles. Some tools focus on building up the structural resiliency of the financial system throughout the business cycle. In my view, these structural resiliency tools are the most promising. They include the Basel III risk-based capital requirements, minimum liquidity requirements, central clearing for derivatives, and bank stress tests. Living-will resolution plans and the Orderly Liquidation Authority, which is housed at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), are intended to make it easier for regulators and policymakers to allow large complex financial institutions to fail.\n\nIn addition to structural tools, there are countercyclical tools that aim to mitigate the systemic risk that can build up over the business cycle. These include the countercyclical capital buffer and the capital conservation buffer.7 Other possible cyclical tools, not yet established in the U.S. but used in other countries, include loan-to-value ratio limits and debt-to-income ratio limits that vary over the cycle and which have been targeted to particular sectors like housing credit or household credit.8\n\nThe performance of the set of macroprudential tools is largely untested. Cross-country studies find mixed results, with the effectiveness of the tools varying with economic circumstances and the types of shocks hitting the financial sector.9\n\nIn the U.S., the application of these countercyclical tools is complicated by the complexity of the regulatory structure. There are multiple financial regulators in the U.S., including the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the National Credit Union Association, the U.S. Treasury, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency. In many cases, the regulatory authority of these agencies is defined by type of institution rather than by instrument. While the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), created by the Dodd-Frank Act, promotes coordination and information sharing across these financial system regulators, the need to coordinate countercyclical macroprudential policy actions across multiple regulators in the U.S. adds a complication to effectively using such tools in a timely way.\n\nThe complex financial system also makes monitoring risks more complicated. The Office of Financial Research, established under Dodd-Frank, is collecting data to aid in this task. The Federal Reserve has also developed a framework for systematically tracking risks, and financial stability surveillance is receiving regular attention in FOMC meetings.10 This regular and systematic analysis is helping us to better identify changes in conditions over time. This brings me to my next point: the importance of taking a systematic approach to financial stability.\n\nPoint 3: To the extent possible, policymakers should take a systematic approach in applying financial stability policy rather than relying on discretion.\n\nThe financial crisis underscored the important role of incentives in financial markets — not only the incentives of financial institutions but also those of regulators and policymakers. Time-inconsistency problems and moral hazard issues are important factors that need to be considered when designing a framework for implementing financial stability policy. These types of problems argue for taking a systematic approach in applying financial stability policy rather than relying on discretion.\n\nThe benefits of systematic monetary policy are well established. When monetary policymakers respond in a systematic fashion to incoming information, the public will have a better sense of how policymakers are likely to react to economic developments — whether those developments are anticipated or unanticipated — so their policy expectations will better align with those of policymakers. This alignment helps the public make better financial and economic decisions, thereby making monetary policy more effective.\n\nAn additional benefit of a systematic approach is that it provides a mechanism through which policymakers can commit to policies aimed at promoting policy goals over the longer run. Being systematic can help alleviate time-inconsistency problems in monetary policy, whereby policymakers may favor the short run over the long run. Note that by systematic policy I do not mean that monetary policy will be set mechanically by a policy rule or that policymakers need to be prescient about the types of shocks that will hit the economy. Rather, I mean that policy will react in a systematic fashion to economic developments that change the economic outlook.\n\nA systematic approach to financial stability policy is perhaps even more important than in the case of monetary policy because of the important role played by incentives. The crisis shined a bright light on significant moral hazard problems that exist in financial markets. A financial stability policymaker that is systematic in how it applies its tools to promote stability will likely help tame some of the moral hazard problems and also some of the time-inconsistency problems to which the regulators themselves are subject.\n\nAn important tool in this regard is the resolution of insolvent financial institutions. Without a credible resolution method, during the crisis in the face of serious distress at a large financial firm, governments faced a dilemma: either rescue the firm and create future moral hazard problems or let the firm fail and risk causing a cascade of other failures. The fact that policymakers had to make these decisions in the heat of the moment using their best judgment based on limited information didn’t help. Without a credible resolution method, it is reasonable to expect that even well-intentioned policymakers will be biased toward bailouts. A resolution method that can be applied systematically can help alleviate this problem. The living-will resolution plans and Orderly Liquidation Authority in the U.S. are promising, but still untested, tools in a process that will allow large firms to fail. This, in turn, provides incentives for these large, systemically important institutions to reorganize themselves in a way that reduces the risk they pose to the financial system.\n\nAs I mentioned, the Federal Reserve has become more systematic in monitoring risks across the financial system. Coupling that monitoring with the application of a resiliency standard across the entire financial services landscape, including the so-called shadow banking system that was less-heavily regulated in the past, would limit regulatory arbitrage. As the financial crisis made clear, taking an action that pushes risk from one set of institutions to another doesn’t eliminate the risk, it just moves it around, potentially to a part of the financial system where the risk is more difficult to monitor and control.11\n\nI acknowledge that this broad application of the resiliency standard across the financial system may be particularly difficult in the U.S. with its complex regulatory structure. Still, we can devise ways to make the macroprudential tools more systematic and less discretionary. Regulators could agree in advance on the contingencies under which the cyclical macroprudential tools would be invoked, rather than waiting until the risks escalated before starting the process to coordinate action. For example, we can write down a formula for a countercyclical buffer, and we can define an explicit trigger for contingent convertible bonds. Knowing that such policies will be systematically applied and what will trigger them may induce financial market participants to limit the buildup of risks in the first place. This underscores the importance of communication, my fourth point.\n\nPoint 4: Macroprudential policy actions must be communicated in a clear way to avoid creating a conflict with or causing confusion over actions taken to foster monetary policy goals.\n\nTransparency and clear communication are hallmarks of best-practice monetary policymaking and the same should be true for financial stability policymaking. Clear communication helps align the public’s policy expectations, which makes monetary policy more effective. Transparency is necessary so that the public and elected officials have the ability to hold monetary policymakers accountable for their decisions. The Federal Reserve has been given independence in setting monetary policy, which has been well documented as yielding more effective policy and better economic outcomes. But accountability must go hand-in-hand with independence. So the Federal Reserve regularly communicates the basis for its policy decisions.\n\nA parallel can be drawn with financial stability policy. Although, in some cases, prudential supervisory information should be kept private, as a general principle, I think financial stability policymakers should strive for greater transparency and more disclosure. Similarly, they should require more disclosure from financial firms so that creditors and other market participants can exert market discipline.\n\nOf course, clear communication is easier said than done. Three aspects make this even harder for financial stability policy than for monetary policy. First, the framework and tools of financial stability policy are new. It will take considerable effort on the part of the financial stability policymakers to explain the tools they are using and the rationale for their policy decisions. However, such communication is necessary so that the public understands when an action is being taken because of concerns about financial stability rather than concerns about monetary policy goals. This would be particularly true when the monetary policy authority is also responsible for taking financial stability actions, and if monetary policy were the tool used to address the financial stability concerns. It is worth considering whether separating decisions about financial stability from decisions about monetary policy within the central bank, perhaps by having separate committees as in the U.K., could aid communication and decision-making.12\n\nA second complication for effective communication of financial stability policy is timing. If effective monetary policy means taking away the punch bowl just as the party gets going, then effective financial stability policy might mean taking away the punch bowl before the guests have even arrived because the seeds of financial instability are sown much earlier and action must be taken earlier as well. If the need for monetary policy to be forward looking is a difficult concept for the public to grasp, the need for financial stability policy to act well before there are clear signs of instability may be even more difficult to explain.\n\nYet a third complication to effective communication is the complexity of the financial regulatory regime itself.13 In my view, a sometimes overlooked lesson from the crisis is that regulatory complexity can complicate supervision, risk monitoring, compliance, and enforcement. Given the scope and ever-changing nature of the financial system, regulatory complexity is, to a certain extent, unavoidable. But the tradeoffs should be recognized. For example, it is reasonable to require banks to hold higher levels of capital against higher-risk assets, but a system of risk weights that is overly granular and complex would be counterproductive. In practice, too much complexity would make it harder for regulators to assess compliance and to determine whether institutions were engaging in some practices merely as a way to hide risk and lower their capital requirements. If regulators have made the rules so complex that they cannot assess compliance, then, in practice, there are no consequences for firms that fail to meet the standards. Complexity also makes it difficult to monitor the monitors. It might be worth exploring whether we would be better off with a much simpler macro- and microprudential supervisory structure, one that is easier to implement and simpler to govern and that is approximately right across various economic models and states of the world even if it is never optimal in any particular model or state.\n\nOf course, we aren’t in that simpler regime. So the question is, given our current financial structure, how should policy respond to emerging financial stability risks and what role should monetary policy play? This question is the focus of my final point.\n\nPoint 5: Financial stability should not be added as another goal for monetary policy, but monetary policymakers need to remain cognizant of the linkages between financial stability and monetary policy goals.\n\nIn my view, the first line of defense against financial instability involves the tools that will make the structure of the financial system less prone to crisis. These structural resiliency tools include higher capital standards (including a minimum non-risk-based leverage ratio, as well as risk-based capital standards), liquidity standards, stress tests, living wills, and effective resolution methods for systemically important bank and nonbank financial institutions. Much work has been done to develop these structural resiliency tools, and I believe the system is in a better position to handle shocks now than it was before the financial crisis.\n\nCountercyclical macroprudential tools, such as limits on loan-to-value ratios in particular markets, are worth further study, but at this point, I am not convinced that we have enough knowledge and experience with them to use them effectively in the U.S. That consideration leads me to think that we should set standards for the structural resiliency tools somewhat higher than they would be if we had more confidence in the countercyclical tools.\n\nWhat about using monetary policy? As I’ve discussed, monetary policy and financial stability goals and actions are interrelated. Very loose monetary policy increases the likelihood that financial instabilities will develop, thereby increasing the likelihood that macroprudential policy tools will be needed. Tight macroprudential policy can tighten financial conditions more generally, thereby increasing the likelihood that a monetary policy response will be needed.\n\nIn my view, monetary policy should remain focused on promoting price stability and maximum employment; financial stability should not be added as a third objective for monetary policy. First, it isn’t clear that monetary policy would be very effective against emerging financial stability risks. While interest rates affect the fundamental value of assets, it is not clear that they affect the speculative or bubble portion; the impact may depend on the underlying nature of the financial imbalance.14 Second, monetary policy tends to be a blunt instrument, so any benefits of using it to stem financial imbalances, mispricing of assets, or excessive leverage need to be weighed against the economic costs in terms of price stability and employment. Svensson (2016) brings some metrics to the question and concludes that the costs outweigh the benefits.15\n\nWhile I don’t believe financial stability should be part of the monetary policy mandate, I do think that when we are making monetary policy decisions, we need to be cognizant of the linkages between our monetary policy actions and financial stability. In the case of the housing market, which precipitated the last crisis, policymakers underestimated the breadth and depth of the negative impact this would have on the rest of the economy and financial system. To the extent that we misjudged the impact, there is a larger potential gain to carefully monitoring financial market conditions, implementing the structural macroprudential tools, and being open to taking offsetting action should imbalances develop.16\n\nIf our macroprudential tools proved to be inadequate and financial stability risks continued to grow, I believe monetary policy should be on the table as a possible defense. However, in this case, the blurring between financial stability goals and monetary policy goals would be high: if we assessed the risks to financial stability to be sufficiently great, achieving our dual mandate monetary policy goals would also be in jeopardy. Which brings me back to my original point: in most cases, the goals of price stability, maximum employment, and financial stability are complementary.\n\nConclusion\n\nLet me conclude by noting that in his 2015 presidential address to the American Finance Association, Luigi Zingales (2015) posed the question, “Does Finance Benefit Society?” While academics, and, I believe, central bankers, typically say “yes,” a recent survey indicates that the average American is much less certain.17 I am hopeful that the considerable efforts underway across the globe will change that. I believe it is our responsibility to ensure that we create and maintain a financial system that is seen by the public as being beneficial, and one that truly is."

            "content": "I thank Keith Kuester and Jürgen von Hagen for inviting me to participate in the Konstanz Seminar on Monetary Theory and Monetary Policy. I am happy to be here for a number of reasons. First, I remember very fondly hiring Keith when I was research director at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. Keith was a very productive addition to our department. While I was sad to see him eventually return to Germany, I was very thankful we were able to learn from Keith during his time with us. And hopefully, he was able to learn a little bit from his Fed colleagues as well.\n\nA second reason I am happy to be here is that it is a great honor to contribute to a forum that for more than four decades has fostered a fruitful dialogue between academic researchers and policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic. In the published proceedings of the first conference held in 1970, the seminar’s founder, Karl Brunner, provided the insight that “theory without application to our environment is useless and policy discussion or judgments not based on analysis are dangerous.”1 I believe that Professor Brunner would be very gratified by the discussions over the past two days, which have better joined monetary theory and monetary policy.\n\nToday, I’d like to spend some time talking about inflation. But before I do, I should mention that these are my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nIt seems clear to me that if there is one topic that would benefit from better understanding the interplay of theory and policy, it is inflation. For a monetary policymaker, price stability is the Holy Grail — price stability is the one thing that monetary policy can ensure over the longer run, and monetary policy is the only tool that can ensure price stability over the longer run. The benefits of price stability for the economy are clear.2 Stable prices mean businesses and households don’t have to spend time trying to protect the purchasing power of their money; they can make long-term plans and commitments without having to deal with the uncertainty about the value of their money. When the price level is stable, any price changes reflect changes in the supplies of certain goods or services relative to others and this information is helpful to businesses and consumers when they have to allocate their scarce resources. Price stability also promotes other goals like financial stability and confidence in the economy, thereby supporting growth and maximum employment, the other part of the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate.\n\nWhile price stability and monetary policy are intimately linked, setting monetary policy to achieve price stability is not trivial. It requires being able to measure inflation so that we’ll know how far we are from the goal. It requires being able to forecast inflation because monetary policy affects the economy with a lag that varies over time and with economic circumstances. It requires understanding the determinants of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. And it also requires having the wherewithal to make decisions under uncertainty. Given the importance of understanding inflation for monetary policy, one could get pretty discouraged about the state of our knowledge — I admit that sometimes such thoughts come to me, usually late at night. But instead of turning nihilistic, I think it’s better to keep pushing the envelope of our knowledge outward, as central bank and academic researchers are doing, and to learn to deal with the uncertainty as best we can. Before I discuss some of the advances being made and some open issues, let me review recent inflation developments.\n\nRecent Inflation Developments\n\nMany central banks conduct monetary policy with a goal of achieving an explicit inflation target. Such an explicit target provides transparency to the public and helps anchor expectations about inflation. When businesses and consumers have confidence that the central bank is committed to its goal over the longer run and will defend the target, they are more likely to look through temporary changes in inflation. Although it was discussed at various times over the years, the Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) established its explicit inflation target relatively recently, in January 2012, when it issued its statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy. The FOMC’s inflation goal is 2 percent, as measured by the year-over-year change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE inflation. As indicated in its annual reaffirmation of this goal in January of this year, the FOMC views this goal as symmetric. That is, the FOMC would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above the objective, and also if it were running persistently below its objective. By helping Fed policymakers set appropriate monetary policy, the explicit 2 percent inflation target promotes not only price stability but also maximum employment.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has not always been successful at achieving price stability. There have been misses on both sides. During the Great Depression in the 1930s, the U.S. experienced deflation. In the aftermath of the oil price shocks in the 1970s, inflation surged and remained high until then-Fed Chairman Paul Volcker began to tighten monetary policy to bring inflation down, at the cost of a deep recession in the early 1980s. These periods point out the importance of a central bank remaining focused on its price stability goal, because when attention wanders, there are severe costs to consumers and businesses.\n\nRelative to the Fed’s 2 percent goal, inflation has been low for quite some time, and while the most recent data are encouraging and consistent with the FOMC’s view that inflation will gradually move back to target over time, a reading of FOMC statements since the Great Recession clearly shows that inflation has been a focus of the Committee. As shown in Figure 1, low inflation has been a phenomenon not only in the U.S. In recent years, inflation has also run well below the United Kingdom’s 2 percent inflation target, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI), and the European Central Bank’s inflation target of below, but close to, 2 percent, as measured by the changes in the harmonized index of consumer prices (HICP). By each central bank’s respective target index, last year, inflation was 0.20 percent in the U.K., 0.25 percent in the Euro area, and 0.66 percent in the U.S.\n\nA couple of common factors have contributed to the low inflation rates in these countries in recent years. First, in the aftermath of the financial crisis and during the slow recovery from the Great Recession, global demand was weak. Indeed, over the 2009-2011 period, one puzzle for policymakers was actually not why inflation was low, but rather, why it wasn’t lower.3 More recently, inflation has been kept down by the decline in energy and other commodity prices, and in the U.S., a rise in the value of the dollar, which puts downward pressure on the prices of imports into the U.S. According to dynamic simulations of the Board of Governors staff’s SIGMA model, a 10 percent rise in the real value of the dollar affects core inflation via import prices fairly quickly, resulting in a drop of about 0.5 percent in core inflation a year after the shock, which partially reverses over the subsequent year. A shock to the value of the dollar also tends to reduce GDP with a lag, and the model indicates that this would put additional downward pressure on inflation.4\n\nOf course, growth, commodity price changes, and currency fluctuations are not necessarily independent events. For example, a portion of the over 60 percent decline in oil prices since mid-2014 likely reflects expectations of weaker growth in China and other countries, although supply factors likely play a greater role. Similarly, since mid-2014 the U.S. dollar has appreciated almost 20 percent, reflecting expectations that real growth in the U.S. will continue to be stronger than growth abroad, as well as projected interest rate differentials between the U.S. and other economies. So we have to be careful about thinking of these shocks as independent and just summing their effects.\n\nIn trying to assess current and projected inflation, economists often look at measures of underlying inflation to get a sense of the trend. Some of these measures, like core inflation, shown in Figure 2, delete food and energy prices because they tend to be volatile. Other measures, like the Cleveland Fed’s median consumer price index, or the Dallas Fed’s trimmed-mean PCE inflation rate (shown in Figure 3), are constructed to reduce the influence of those components that have shown outsized changes; the particular components can vary from month to month.\n\nEconomists also use various models to get a sense of the underlying trend in inflation. Figure 4 shows estimates of trend inflation for the U.S., Euro area, and U.K. based on an autoregressive model that allows continuous time variation in coefficients and the variance of shocks to inflation.5 Based on this model, as actual inflation rates have declined, estimated trend inflation has also declined modestly in each location. The Cleveland Fed staff has estimated several different models of trend inflation for the U.S., and they also exhibit declines in the trend over the past decade, suggesting that the result is not model specific.6\n\nOf course, the estimates do not mean that the change in trend is a permanent one, with inflation mired below target. In fact, in the U.S., as oil prices and the dollar have shown some stability of late, the headline and underlying measures of inflation have moved higher, in accordance with the pattern anticipated by the FOMC. As of the first quarter of this year, the year-over-year change in the headline PCE price index has risen to 1 percent from 0.2 percent in the first quarter of last year. Core PCE inflation was 1.7 percent in the first quarter, compared to 1.3 percent a year ago, and core CPI inflation was 2.3 percent compared with 1.7 percent a year ago. The 12-month change in the Cleveland Fed’s median CPI inflation rate averaged 2.4 percent in the first quarter, and it, too, has been rising over the past year.\n\nInflation expectations are an important determinant of inflation dynamics.7 There are a variety of ways to measure inflation expectations. Some measures are based on surveys of households or of professional economic forecasters; others are derived from transactions in financial markets. In my view, looking across measures, inflation expectations over the past few years have been relatively stable, even in the face of sizable declines in energy prices. This stability is most readily apparent in the survey measures of longer-term inflation expectations of professional forecasters, as seen in Figure 5. But it is also seen in survey measures of household expectations, depicted in Figure 6. Although these are measures of longer-term inflation expectations, analysis suggests household inflation expectations are sensitive to large changes in energy prices, and so the slight move down in the U.S. since mid-2014 may reflect the sharp decline in oil prices.8\n\nTo augment the survey measures, economists have also developed models to derive inflation expectations from financial market data. In the U.S., the 10-year breakeven inflation rate is measured by the difference between the yield on 10-year Treasuries and the yield on 10-year Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS). The U.S. Treasury began issuing TIPS in 1997 to allow investors to take out some insurance against unanticipated changes in CPI inflation. Theoretically, inflation swaps offer a similar way for investors to protect themselves. Inflation compensation based on swaps is another measure commonly used as an indicator of inflation expectations. These market-based measures can be volatile. Figure 7 shows five-year inflation compensation five years ahead — the so-called five-year, five-year forward measure. I am smoothing through some of the volatility and showing monthly data. As you can see, over the past two years, the measures have declined a bit in the U.S. and in the Euro area.\n\nOne needs to remember that there are differences between inflation compensation and inflation expectations. In particular, the inflation compensation measures reflect not only investors’ expectations about inflation but also the amount they are willing to pay in order to protect themselves from inflation risk. In addition, the TIPS market is less liquid than the Treasury market, so there is a liquidity premium in inflation breakeven and compensation rates. We should expect the inflation risk premium and the liquidity premium to vary over time, so one needs to use a model to extract a measure of inflation expectations from inflation compensation. These models can produce very different estimates of the components depending on circumstances. For example, Figure 8 shows the inflation risk premia based on models maintained by the Cleveland Fed staff and the San Francisco Fed staff.9 You’ll note that even the signs can differ: in the most recent period, the San Francisco Fed model is estimating a negative risk premium while the Cleveland Fed model is estimating a positive risk premium. So the inflation expectations derived from these models can be quite different, as shown in Figure 9. In addition, at times, demand for Treasuries can increase significantly as investors seek safe haven flows for their money. This can make it even harder to infer inflation expectations from changes in inflation compensation. Finally, in the U.S., changes in the inflation compensation measures also seem to be correlated with changes in energy prices, a correlation that suggests they may not be reliable indicators of long-term inflation expectations.\n\nJon Faust and Jonathan Wright argue that market-based inflation compensation measures are too volatile to be plausible estimates of longer-term inflation expectations, and they show that the data reject the hypothesis that today’s five-year, five-year forward inflation compensation is a rational expectation of inflation in the long-run.10\n\nGiven the measurement challenges and the volatility we saw in financial markets last summer and at the turn of the year, I think we need to be somewhat cautious when inferring a signal about changes in inflation expectations from these market measures. Nonetheless, I also think it is worth monitoring all of the available indicators of inflation expectations because of the important role expectations play in inflation dynamics.\n\nInflation Models and Forecasts\n\nThe factors I’ve discussed — demand growth, oil and other relative price shocks, and inflation expectations — are factors that appear in the expectations-augmented Phillips curve, a statistical relationship that economists use in forecasting inflation (Figure 10). While the original version of the Phillips curve related changes in inflation to changes in unemployment, the newer version stresses the importance of inflation expectations in inflation dynamics and puts less emphasis on measures of economic activity. It generally provides better inflation forecasts than the traditional Phillips curve.\n\nIn the expectations-augmented Phillips curve, economic activity is represented by a measure of slack — usually either the unemployment gap, which is the deviation of the unemployment rate from its longer-run natural rate, or the output gap, which is the deviation of output from its longer-run trend or potential level. A body of research has found that the estimate of the slope coefficient on slack in the expectations-augmented Phillips curve has diminished and that inflation expectations are a more important driver of inflation dynamics. In terms of forecasting ability, the model’s under-prediction of inflation in the early stages of the recovery in 2009-2011 renewed questions about the reliability of the Phillips curve in forecasting inflation. This generated a considerable amount of investigation aimed at resolving the puzzle of the missing disinflation. Analysis by economists at the ECB indicates that including food and energy prices in the Phillips curve for core inflation can explain the missing disinflation in the Euro area between 2009 and 2011.11 This points out that how the Phillips curve is specified and the measures one uses for inflation expectations and economic slack are likely to affect its forecasting ability — which doesn’t offer much solace if one wants to use the model in real time.\n\nMore than that, we need to acknowledge that the measures of slack in the Phillips curve relationship are imprecise because they depend on unobservables like the natural rate of unemployment and the level of potential GDP. The slack measures also get revised over time. In fact, economists have been revising down their estimates of potential growth almost every year since the Great Recession started. For example, in 2008, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that potential growth between 2008 and 2013 would average 2.5 percent, well above its current estimate of 1.3 percent for that same time period. Revisions also plague certain inflation measures, like PCE inflation in the U.S., which complicates making monetary policy in real time. For example, in early 2002, FOMC policymakers were concerned about a drop in inflation. Ultimately, much of this drop was revised away. In a number of papers, Athanasios Orphanides has laid out a convincing case that mismeasurement of slack and other unobservables like the natural rate of interest led to monetary policy mistakes that contributed to the Great Inflation of the 1970s. He argues that these mismeasured concepts continue to unduly influence monetary policy today.12\n\nThe New Keynesian Phillips curve is an alternative to the statistical Phillips curve I have been discussing. It is a component of the dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model, the workhorse model in wide use at central banks. The model assumes that firms have some pricing power, i.e., there is imperfect competition, and a firm will set its price in order to maximize its profit. But the model also assumes that prices are sticky, i.e., the firms can adjust their prices only infrequently and not with every shock that hits the economy. These distortions mean that when the economy is hit by a shock, the level of output can differ from the efficient level that would prevail in the absence of sticky prices and with perfect competition. They also mean that monetary policy can affect real activity in the short run, even though it has a neutral effect on real activity in the long run, and that the main driver of inflation dynamics in the short run is the expected markup over marginal cost that firms charge to their customers. This expected markup will vary over time and economic circumstances.13\n\nOne implication of the New Keynesian Phillips curve is that the usual measures of economic slack play a role in inflation dynamics only to the extent that they help predict future changes in marginal costs, which does not seem to be the case. However, there is a different concept of slack that appears in the New Keynesian Phillips curve. The relevant measure of slack is the difference between the efficient level of output and the prevailing level of output in the economy with its sticky prices and imperfect competition. Inflation, then, is related to expected inflation and this gap. In the absence of shocks that affect the firms’ desired markups of price over marginal cost, monetary policy should seek to minimize this gap, which would be equivalent to stabilizing inflation. The nature of the shock hitting the economy will determine whether the efficient level of output will change and whether monetary policy will want to respond to it.\n\nWhile I’ve pointed out some difficulties with using statistical Phillips curves to forecast inflation, it’s also important to recognize limitations of the New Keynesian Phillips curve in capturing inflation dynamics. For example, the theory does not predict that there would be a lot of persistence in inflation beyond that associated with marginal cost, but in the U.S., the data suggest there is considerable persistence. Thus, to forecast inflation, the model needs to be augmented with lagged values of inflation or output, or by allowing the expected longer-run value of inflation to move slowly over time.\n\nWork continues on enhancing our forecasting models because forecasts of inflation are particularly important for monetary policymaking. The fact that it takes considerable time for policy actions to be transmitted through all parts of the economy requires monetary policymakers to be forward looking. Central bankers in the U.S., U.K., and Euro zone are projecting that inflation will rise gradually toward their respective inflation targets over the next couple of years. We should keep in mind that the confidence bands around these forecasts are fairly wide, reflecting model uncertainty, the fact that the economy is constantly being buffeted by shocks, and that the data can be revised over time.14\n\nFigure 11 illustrates the confidence intervals around forecasts of the Bank of England and ECB staff. In the Bank of England’s projection, the middle band is a 70 percent confidence interval; for the ECB staff forecast it’s a 57.5 percent confidence band – in both cases the width one year out is a little over ±1 percentage point.\n\nUnlike these central banks, in the U.S., the FOMC does not publish a consensus forecast or a staff forecast. Instead, four times a year, the FOMC summarizes the individual projections of each Committee participant. The median projection of headline PCE inflation published in March indicates that inflation is projected to rise from 0.5 percent in 2015 to 1.2 percent this year and about 2 percent in 2017 and 2018. The FOMC does not produce error bands around these projections, although this is being discussed.15 The Committee does publish a summary table of the average historical errors of projections from 1996 through 2015 made by various private and government forecasters. For inflation, these errors are around ?1 percentage point one or two years out. We can apply these errors to the median FOMC projection to get an approximate, symmetric 70 percent confidence interval. As seen in Figure 12, although the dispersion across FOMC participants often gets some attention, it is actually quite narrow compared with the confidence bands around forecasts of inflation.\n\nThe precision of the forecasts, or lack thereof, needs to be kept in mind when setting monetary policy. We must be forward looking, which means we must rely on models to forecast inflation, but there is no one model that forecasts with much accuracy. The best we can do in this situation is to recognize that there is uncertainty around our forecasts. I am in favor of the FOMC providing some type of error band around its projections. Not only will it help the public understand some of the risks around our forecast, but it will also be a helpful reminder to policymakers that we constantly live with uncertainty. This shouldn’t paralyze us. Instead we should cope with it by looking at the outcomes from multiple models and alternative simulations, using techniques like model averaging, and by continually evaluating the forecasts from the models against incoming data. The FOMC has been expanding the models it routinely examines as a part of the policymaking process — these include the Board of Governors staff’s large-scale FRB/US model and two smaller-scale DSGE models called EDO and SIGMA, as well as various models maintained and utilized at the Federal Reserve Banks. Researchers are now building model archives to aid in the systematic comparison of empirical results and policy implications across a large set of economic models as an aid to policy analysis. One such archive, The Macroeconomic Model Data Base (MMB), headed by Volker Wieland of Goethe University Frankfurt, currently includes 61 models.16 Given the state of our knowledge, this seems to be a promising approach to ensuring that policy actions are robust across the span of plausible models of economic dynamics and economic circumstances.\n\nOf course, in addition to model averaging, it is also important for central bank and academic researchers to continue to push the envelope of our knowledge. Let me finish by discussing research on inflation expectations, an area that I view as critical to advancing our understanding of inflation dynamics, measurement, and forecasting.\n\nInflation Expectations Research\n\nDespite the central role inflation expectations play in our theories of inflation dynamics and monetary policy transmission, there is still much we don’t know about how such expectations are formed or even whose expectations matter for forecasting inflation and setting monetary policy. It took many years to bring inflation expectations down, so keeping inflation expectations anchored at a central bank’s target is a high priority. If inflation runs below or above the targeted inflation rate for some period of time, will it cause longer-term inflation expectations to become unanchored and the public to lose confidence in the central bank? Does it matter how far inflation is from target, or how long it’s been away from the target to trigger such a response? Without a better understanding of how people form their expectations about inflation, it is difficult to answer these questions or to have a good sense of what might cause inflation expectations to become unanchored from the central bank’s target.\n\nTo see that this is not straightforward, one can look at the experience in Japan. As shown in Figure 13, in Japan, after a long period of being stuck near zero, actual inflation ran below zero from 2009 through mid-2013. Even so, measures of inflation expectations were relatively stable between 1.5 and 2 percent, well above actual inflation for a number of years.17 This presents a conundrum because the theory suggests that changes in inflation expectations should lead changes in underlying inflation.\n\nInflation expectations may also be an important piece of the puzzle explaining the missing disinflation in the 2009-2011 period (Figure 14). Although the theory is based on firms’ pricing behavior, in the U.S. we don’t have consistent measures of firms’ inflation expectations. Olivier Coibion and Yuriy Gorodnichenko (2015) find that there is a tighter link between the inflation prediction from an estimated Phillips curve and actual inflation when inflation expectations are measured by household expectations than when they are measured by the expectations of professional forecasters.18 The authors are conducting a survey of firms’ inflation expectations in New Zealand and are already getting some interesting results that suggest that firms’ inflation expectations behave more like the inflation expectations of households than of professional forecasters. In particular, the inflation expectations of firms, like those of households, are considerably higher than those of professional forecasters, and the dispersion across firms is similar to that for households and much wider than that observed across professional forecasters. Firm and household inflation expectations both rose significantly starting in 2009, reflecting the rise in oil prices. Coibion and Gorodnichenko suggest that the fact that disinflationary pressures were absent across countries during the 2009-2011 period lends some support to the idea that a common factor like oil prices, which rose over the period, may have been at work.\n\nA better understanding of firms’ expectations about future inflation may bring us better insight into how firms set prices and may help reconcile some discrepancies between our models and real-world pricing behavior. For example, based on the data on individual prices that are used to construct aggregate price indices like the CPI, Mark Bils and Peter Klenow find that firms appear to change prices more frequently than predicted by standard models that have been calibrated to match various features of the macroeconomic business cycle.19 This is a troubling finding in that it suggests a disconnect between the micro data and the New Keynesian macro models that are often used to inform monetary policy analysis.\n\nSimon Gilchrist and Egon Zakrajsek are investigating the effect of financial constraints on firms’ pricing behavior. They find that product price inflation varies depending on the ease with which firms can access external finance. Firms with such access can compensate for reduced demand for their products by cutting prices, whereas firms that cannot get such funding need to raise prices to keep revenue from falling too much. Thus, in the wake of a downturn in demand that is accompanied by financial shocks that reduce firms’ access to credit and liquidity, we’d expect to see a drop in output and an increase in markups and, therefore, inflation.20 This is another factor that helps resolve the disinflation puzzle in the aftermath of the Great Recession. These types of results point to the need to further develop DSGE models that seriously incorporate financial markets and the possibility of financial stress, borrower defaults, and financial institution failures. These models need to be fairly complex. By their nature, financial crises involve nonlinearities, potentially multiple equilibria, and financial frictions that limit arbitrage. But there could be a high payoff in terms of furthering our knowledge of inflation dynamics.\n\nBorağan Aruoba and Frank Schorfheide incorporate nonlinearities into a DSGE model so that they can analyze inflation dynamics at and during exit from the zero lower bound on interest rates.21 This model has multiple equilibria and the authors examine the two steady states — one in which inflation is at its target and the other in which the nominal interest rate is zero and inflation is negative. Thus, inflation expectations would reflect the public’s expectations about the average inflation rate in each regime as well as their expectations about the probability of switching regimes. Welfare is considerably lower in the deflationary steady state than in the targeted-inflation steady state.\n\nIn a world with multiple equilibria, as in this model, one can think of a central bank’s monetary policy as choosing one of the equilibrium paths, which can have very different welfare implications. In the model, the economy can hit the zero lower bound either because of an adverse transitory shock or series of shocks within the targeted-inflation regime, or because the economy has switched to the deflationary regime. Since inflation and interest rates can be low in either regime, knowing which regime the economy is actually in is difficult. This presents a challenge to the central bank, since the optimal monetary policy in each regime differs. Based on their analysis of the inflation and interest rate experiences in the U.S., Euro area, and Japan, the authors suggest that Japan switched into the deflation regime, while it is unlikely that the Euro area did, and the U.S. case is more ambiguous.22\n\nThis type of model can help inform our thinking about the level of the central bank’s inflation target. Our recent experience of the Great Recession has led some economists to suggest that central banks should be targeting a higher inflation rate in normal economic times so that when the economy is hit by sizable shocks there will be more room for conventional expansionary monetary policy.23 Aruoba and Schorfheide use their model to analyze how output, inflation, and interest rates would have evolved under two different scenarios: first, if the U.S. had picked an inflation target of 4 percent in 1984, and second, if the U.S. were to shift to a 4 percent inflation target now. In the first scenario, after 2009 interest rates do not reach zero, inflation returns quickly to the 4 percent target, output recovers more quickly than under the baseline lower-inflation-target regime, and consumption is higher. However, the authors conclude that the overall benefits of the policy are not clear because there may be costs to adjusting prices to the higher inflation target as well as higher costs of holding cash and other liquid assets at a higher inflation rate. In addition, the benefits depend on the probability of hitting the zero lower bound in the first place.\n\nIn the second scenario, the deflation risk is reduced but there is little change in the trajectory of output; thus, there is little real benefit to making such a change. Moreover, other factors that are not modeled suggest that changing the inflation target would be ineffectual and even counterproductive. To the extent that it takes time for the central bank to earn credibility for its inflation target and time for household and business expectations to become anchored at the target, changing the target would have little effect in the short run and be detrimental in the longer run if it undercut credibility and unanchored expectations.\n\nThe multiple equilibrium nature of nonlinear DSGE models, like the one built by Aruoba and Schorfheide, suggests that one potentially fruitful area of research is to marry the literature on learning in macroeconomics with the emerging empirical literature on how agents form their expectations. Do people form their expectations based on their own price experience? Do they listen to experts or form expectations based on past inflation rates? Do they have their own theories about what determines future inflation? The concept of rational expectations — that agents’ expectations are consistent with the economic model — was a major advance in macroeconomic theory and is the benchmark assumption in all modern macroeconomic models. Yet it is a strong assumption in that it requires all agents to know the model and its parameters and to know that other agents are rational as well. A literature developed over the past two decades has incorporated various models of learning into macroeconomic models.24 Some of the research finds that expectations eventually converge to rational expectations, but the economic dynamics in such models can differ from those in the benchmark rational expectations model. In addition to exploring the implications of different models of learning — e.g., recursive learning or Bayesian learning — some economists are taking the models to the laboratory to conduct experiments to investigate economic dynamics.25\n\nThe learning literature gives us a way to study how the economy might shift from one equilibrium to another.26 Depending on how learning is modeled, such a shift might be gradual or it could be more abrupt, which has implications for economic stability and appropriate policy. Learning models help put some structure on the notion of “anchored” inflation expectations. They potentially point us to factors that might affect the degree to which inflation expectations are anchored to the central bank’s inflation target as well as the role central bank communications and credibility play in individuals’ formation of inflation expectations.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn my remarks today, I have pointed out several open questions about inflation. But rather than being discouraged by what we still don’t know, I am encouraged by the promising avenues being pursued to advance our knowledge about inflation dynamics and inflation expectations. I urge researchers to continue this pursuit because price stability is clearly a goal worth pursuing and good policymaking is dependent on the research that informs it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

            "content": "Good afternoon and thank you for that very kind introduction. I also thank the Cleveland Association for Business Economics, CFA Society Cleveland, and the Northern Ohio chapter of the Risk Management Association for inviting me to speak today. The very first speech I gave in Cleveland as president of the Cleveland Fed was at your organizations' invitation. As they say, you never forget your first, and so it is with great pleasure that I am back with you today. Another reason I'm happy to be here is that I believe an important responsibility of Federal Reserve policymakers is to share their economic perspectives with the public. Congress has wisely given the Fed independence in making monetary policy decisions in pursuit of our statutory goals of price stability and maximum employment. I say \"wisely\" because a body of research and practical experience both here and abroad show that when central banks formulate monetary policy free from short-run political interference, the policy is more effective and yields better economic outcomes. But to preserve that independence, the central bank must be held accountable for its policy decisions. And a key component of that accountability involves policymakers providing information to the public on their evaluation of economic conditions, their outlook for the economy, and the rationale for their decisions.\n\nAt its March meeting, three weeks ago, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at ¼ to ½ percent. The FOMC also released a new set of economic projections, something that it does four times a year. Today, I plan to discuss my outlook for the national and regional economy and monetary policy. Of course, these are my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\n\nDespite the gyrations in financial markets at the start of the year, the underlying fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain sound. I expect the economy to grow at a moderate pace of 2.25 to 2.5 percent this year, slightly above its longer-run trend and sufficient to generate further job gains and a further reduction in the unemployment rate this year. I anticipate that inflation will continue to move gradually up toward our target of 2 percent over time. In my view, it will be appropriate for monetary policymakers to continue to gradually reduce the level of accommodation this year.\n\nIn putting together my forecast for the March FOMC meeting, I incorporated the new information we had received since the December FOMC projections. Although we publish our forecasts four times a year, let me assure you that policymakers are constantly assessing incoming information for its implications for the outlook and risks around the outlook. This information includes the official statistical releases and the reports we garner from talking to our boards of directors, advisory councils, and other contacts in our regions. It is important that our policy be \"data-dependent,\" meaning that policy should depend on how economic and financial conditions evolve, to the extent that those conditions have implications for the medium-run outlook and risks around the outlook.\n\nThe focus is on the medium run because that's the time horizon over which monetary policy affects the economy. But we live in a high-frequency world. Measures of stock market volatility, like the VIX, attest to that. The market gyrations at the end of last year and the beginning of this year were notable. The declines in global equity markets partly reflected market participants' reassessment of the outlook for global growth, as well as their views on how effective policy actions taken abroad will be. Over the past month or so, we've seen some stability return to financial markets. Volatility has declined, stock prices have risen, and credit risk spreads on corporate bonds have narrowed. As a result, on balance, financial conditions are only slightly more restrictive than they were in December.\n\nWhile less volatile than financial market indicators can be, economic data can also vary quite a bit from month to month. \"Data-dependent\" policymaking does not mean that policy will react to every short-run change in the data – that would be a mistake. One of the challenges for monetary policymakers is making low-frequency policy in a high-frequency world. We need to extract the signal about where the economy is headed from economic and financial market information that can often be noisy.\n\nMy own forecasts tend to have some consistency over time because I try to stay focused on underlying fundamentals and the medium-run outlook. That said, I have made some changes to my outlook since December. Most of the changes have to do with my longer-run projections. The moderate growth of around 2 percent that we've seen during the expansion has been sufficient to generate a significant fall in the unemployment rate, while inflation has remained low. Taking that evidence on board, I slightly moved down my estimates of longer-run growth, the longer-run unemployment rate, and the longer-run fed funds rate, reducing each by 25 basis points. I now project longer-run growth at 2 percent, the longer-run unemployment rate at 5 percent, and the longer-run fed funds rate at 3.25 percent.\n\nEconomic Growth\n\nIn terms of the forecast, as I've mentioned, I anticipate that growth will pick up to a 2.25 to 2.5 percent range this year. That is slightly lower than my last forecast and reflects both the weakness we saw in the fourth quarter, which suggests that the economy entered 2016 with a little less momentum, and slightly tighter financial conditions, which partly reflect somewhat slower growth abroad. So far, the information we have suggests that growth in the first quarter will remain near the fourth quarter's pace of around 1.5 percent, but there is still more information coming in.\n\nConsumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of output, has been one of the economy's strengths, although it too has shown month-to-month volatility that we need to smooth through. Consumer spending has been buoyed by continued improvement in household balance sheets; growth in personal income, reflecting the progress in labor markets; and lower oil prices, as well as highly accommodative monetary policy that has kept borrowing rates low. The drop in gasoline prices from $3.36 per gallon in 2014 to $2.42 per gallon in 2015 saved the average household about $700. The U.S. Energy Information Administration now forecasts that gasoline prices will average $1.89 per gallon this year, which would mean another $400 in cost savings for the average household. I believe we are seeing a positive effect on spending from lower gasoline prices. Auto sales were particularly strong over the past year, hitting a new record of nearly 17.5 million; many of these were SUVs and other larger vehicles. Instead of spending it, some households may be choosing to save some of the windfall from lower gas prices – we've seen the savings rate rise. Or they may be using it to pay down debt. Either way, the improvement in balance sheets will help support future consumption.\n\nThe housing sector has also shown steady improvement, and I expect that to continue. Total sales of new and existing homes have been rising slowly over the past few years. Existing home sales have made considerable progress in approaching the average level seen before the run-up during the housing bubble, while new home sales still have some ways to go to reach that milestone. Housing starts have been moving up but are still below the levels consistent with projections of household formation over the longer run, and in some markets, the supply of housing hasn't kept up with demand. So there is some chance we will see an acceleration in construction this year. Mortgage rates are low, but households are being appropriately careful in not taking on more mortgage debt than they can handle, and banks are lending to those with good credit quality. House prices have been rising at a 5 to 6 percent pace, on a national level. This has allowed households to rebuild some of the housing equity they lost during the housing bust, another factor that will support consumer spending going forward.\n\nWhile residential investment has been improving, business fixed investment remains weak. The sharp drop in oil prices since mid-2014 has benefitted consumers but has weighed heavily on firms in the drilling and mining sector, on their suppliers, and on regions whose economies depend on the energy sector. Firms tied to the sector have responded by cutting jobs and reducing investment. Some firms may face bankruptcy or will need to merge. In the face of low oil prices, I expect this sector to feel continued pressure.\n\nManufacturers and other firms exposed to U.S. trade have also had to operate in a very challenging environment. The dollar has appreciated around 20 percent since mid-2014. This appreciation has been a considerable drag on U.S. export growth and on manufacturing output. We can expect the dollar to remain strong because real growth in the U.S. is expected to exceed growth abroad, and interest rates in the U.S. are expected to be higher than those in our major trading partners for some time to come. However, the rate of appreciation of the dollar has slowed, so the direct effect on U.S. net exports will likely lessen over time. Indeed, after last year's deceleration in manufacturing output, several surveys suggest that manufacturing activity may be stabilizing. These include the national survey conducted by the Institute for Supply Management, as well as the regional surveys conducted by the Dallas, New York, Philadelphia, and Richmond Federal Reserve Banks.\n\nAs this review suggests, some parts of the economy are doing better than others. But the message I take from U.S. economic performance is that despite financial market volatility, despite the pain inflicted on the energy sector from falling oil prices, and despite the relatively weak growth abroad, the U.S. economy has proven to be remarkably resilient.\n\nLabor Markets\n\nStrong evidence of this resiliency is seen in labor markets. The unemployment rate is now half of what it was at its peak of 10 percent in October 2009. Over the past two years, we've also seen significant improvement in other measures of the under-utilization of labor. The share of workers who are working part-time but who would prefer to work full-time has declined significantly, as has the number of people who have only been looking for work sporadically or who have been discouraged from looking at all because they don't think they'll find a job. Since its low point last September, the labor force participation rate has risen by over half of a percentage point and is now at a level consistent with estimates of its longer-run trend.1\n\nPayroll job growth has averaged more than 200,000 jobs per month over the past two years. And while there have been ups and downs in the monthly reports – as there always are – I think it is notable that even as output growth slowed during the fourth quarter of last year, firms continued to add workers to their payrolls at a very good pace. The data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, show that some dynamism is returning to the labor market.2 The rate of job openings is stronger than during the previous expansion, and both the hiring and quit rates have risen to levels suggesting that firms are looking to hire and workers are confident enough to be looking for better jobs.\n\nWage acceleration typically lags the improvement in labor markets, and this time is no different. Average hourly earnings have only slowly accelerated over the past few years, and the employment cost index, which measures total compensation, has risen at about 2 percent a year over the past three years. Some of the anecdotal reports suggest that wage pressures may be building. We have heard for some time from employers in our region that it has been hard to find workers with the necessary skills in certain higher-skilled occupations, including information technology, health care, and specialized construction. Firms have had to increase wages and benefits and offer and sweeten retention packages for these types of workers. But we are now hearing increasingly from firms across the service sector that they are having difficulty finding workers in lower-skilled and less-specialized occupations, like bank tellers and retail staff. As labor markets continue to tighten, I expect to see wages accelerate somewhat.\n\nI do not want to underestimate the difficulty that many workers have had during the recession and slow recovery, and that many continue to have. For example, those who have lost jobs in the mining, oil, and gas sectors in Appalachia and eastern Ohio have been slow to find new work because the economies in those areas are not well-diversified. I believe there are longer-run workforce development issues affecting U.S. labor markets, and the deep recession and slow recovery have exposed and exacerbated these problems. As a country, we need to ensure that people can enter and remain productive members of the labor force to raise our standard of living and make us more competitive in the global economy. The question is how to do that. I do not believe monetary policy would be effective in addressing these longer-run problems. More than that, trying to rely on it to do so is counterproductive because it takes the focus off of programs and policies that can help to prepare and sustain workers in the modern workforce. So from the standpoint of what monetary policy can do, the totality of the evidence suggests to me that the economy is basically at the Fed's mandated monetary policy goal of maximum employment. However, I do believe that government policy and programs, such as educational assistance and retraining programs, have a role to play in addressing these long-run labor force challenges and it should be brought to bear.\n\nRegional Growth and Labor Markets\n\nAn important role of Federal Reserve Bank presidents is gathering information from our regions to help inform national monetary policy. For example, the anecdotal information on wages that I just mentioned has been particularly useful. Let me spend a few minutes on economic developments in the Fourth Federal Reserve District, which comprises all of Ohio, western Pennsylvania, eastern Kentucky, and the northern panhandle of West Virginia. Our regional economy is quite diverse, but the path of economic expansion here has been similar to the nation's, with some sectors performing better than others and with longer-run economic challenges evident. The outlook for our regional economy is similar to that of the nation.\n\nThe energy sector in our region continues to feel the effects of the sharp decline in oil prices since mid-2014, as well as the longer-term shift away from coal as a source of energy. The region had seen a sharp increase in production and employment in the oil and gas extraction sector as new technologies were brought to bear. But while natural gas production remains at historic highs, the sharp drop in oil prices since mid-2014 has resulted in a significant slowdown in natural gas and oil exploration in the Marcellus and Utica shale regions, which include the part of our District in northern Ohio and western Pennsylvania. Suppliers and other service providers to the industry and those employed in the industry have also experienced the slowdown.3\n\nRegional firms with international exposure, such as steel producers, also continue to struggle in the wake of dollar appreciation and lower commodity prices that reflect weak global demand. Like the nation as a whole, the region's economy has diversified over time, with jobs shifting from manufacturing to the service sector. Still, manufacturing remains a relatively important sector in our region, accounting for 15 percent of private-sector jobs in Ohio compared to about 10 percent in the U.S. While manufacturers with ties to energy and steel production have faced challenges, the weakness in that segment has been offset by production increases at manufacturers supplying the construction industry, and by the auto industry, which represents a significant share of manufacturing in Ohio and Kentucky. Over the past few years, District auto plants have produced about 17 percent of the nation's autos and light trucks, so as auto sales have risen to record levels, regional production has risen as well. Our contacts in the District's auto sector remain optimistic even though the record sales pace seems likely to level off.\n\nLike the rest of the nation, our region has seen considerable improvement in labor markets. In Ohio, the unemployment rate has fallen sharply from a peak of 11 percent in December 2009 to 4.9 percent in February, about the national average. Since the start of the expansion, jobs in Ohio have been growing at an annual pace of 1.2 percent. Admittedly, this is slower than the nation's 1.4 percent pace. However, Ohio's job growth has been well above the pace we saw during the previous expansion, when employment in Ohio was essentially flat. When I last spoke before your organizations in September 2014, employment in Ohio had not quite made it back to its pre-recession peak. There is no denying that it was a long time in coming, but Ohio payroll employment has finally regained its pre-recession peak.\n\nThe longer-run challenges facing national labor markets also affect the regional economy. In addition, population growth in our region has been slower than in other parts of the country. Ohio's population has been growing at less than 0.4 percent a year over the past 5 years, about half as fast as in the nation as a whole, and considerably slower than in the southern and western parts of the country. This is an additional factor that will need to be considered when assessing the future outlook for regional labor markets and the overall economic health of the region.\n\nInflation\n\nIn addition to maximum employment, price stability is the other part of the Fed's dual mandate. Inflation has been running below the Fed's goal of 2 percent for quite some time. Low inflation partly reflects the effects of earlier declines in the price of oil and other commodities since mid-2014, as well as the appreciation of the dollar, which has held down the prices of nonpetroleum imports into the U.S. But the most recent data have been somewhat encouraging and in accord with the pattern anticipated by the FOMC. As oil prices and the dollar have shown some stability of late, the headline and underlying measures of inflation have moved higher. And these moves are not just one month's data. Headline and core inflation, as measured by the year-over-year changes in the underlying indices, have been moving up over the past year. Headline PCE inflation has risen to 1 percent from 0.2 percent at the start of last year, and core PCE inflation is 1.7 percent, compared to 1.3 percent a year ago. Core CPI inflation is now above 2 percent. The Cleveland Fed's median CPI inflation rate is 2.4 percent and it, too, has been rising over the past year.\n\nStable inflation expectations are an important component of inflation dynamics. In my view, inflation expectations have been relatively stable, even in the face of sizable declines in energy prices. Market-based inflation compensation, which measures the difference in yields between nominal Treasury securities and Treasury inflation-protected securities, has fallen by more than the survey measures of inflation expectations. But movements in inflation compensation have been highly correlated with changes in oil prices, and in this period of heightened market volatility and flight-to-quality flows into U.S. Treasury securities, I take less of a signal about inflation expectations from the market-based measure of inflation compensation. Various models suggest that the movements in inflation compensation more likely reflect changes in liquidity premia and inflation risk premia rather than changes in expectations.4\n\nBased on the evidence at hand, if the real side of the economy continues to perform consistent with my projections, I expect inflation to remain low this year but to gradually move back to our goal of 2 percent over the next couple of years. And I will continue to monitor all of the measures of inflation and inflation expectations to assess whether this forecast is on track.\n\nRisks to the Forecast\n\nOf course, we have to recognize that the economy rarely evolves exactly as expected. The world is a dynamic place and the economy is hit by shocks, both positive and negative. So any economic forecast is surrounded by fairly wide confidence bands, and mine is no exception. I see risks on both the downside and the upside around my forecast. If the dollar were to appreciate more than I've assumed, perhaps because of weaker growth abroad, or if there were a significant further decline in oil prices rather than a stabilization, then growth and inflation could be lower than in my baseline forecast. The actions taken by several foreign central banks to increase monetary accommodation to further support their economies may help to mitigate some of this risk.\n\nBecause inflation has been undershooting our goal for some time, many people have quite reasonably been focusing on the downside risks to inflation. But it is also good to keep in mind that, according to analysis by the Cleveland Fed staff, over the last 15 years historical forecast errors from several highly regarded inflation forecasting models have skewed to the upside; that is, the models have tended to underestimate actual inflation.5 While the steep declines in oil prices have kept inflation low, in the current environment, low oil prices also pose an upside risk to inflation over the medium run. They may spur stronger-than-expected consumer spending, and this, combined with accommodative monetary policy, could lead to a faster increase in inflation than forecasted.\n\nThe intense volatility in financial markets that we saw at the end of last year and the beginning of this year has subsided. But were it to intensify and be sustained, this could lead to a broader pullback in risk appetites among investors, businesses, and consumers, which could dampen the U.S. economy. I note, though, that even during the recent turbulence we did not see this. Focusing too much on signals from market volatility is also a risk, as messages from the market can turn around quickly. It could be that if markets remain relatively stable, businesses may begin to feel more secure and investment spending may pick up more than expected. The resiliency of the U.S. economy throughout turbulent times is worth remembering as we aim to set monetary policy that will promote our longer-run goals of maximum employment and price stability.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nGiven actual and expected economic performance, the risks around the outlook, and the progress toward our policy goals, my assessment at this time is that it will be appropriate to continue to gradually reduce the degree of accommodation this year. Gradual normalization means that monetary policy will remain accommodative for some time to come, providing support to the economy and insurance against downside risks. I think that's appropriate given some of the forces still affecting our economy – for example, slow growth abroad, appreciation of the dollar, somewhat more restrictive financial conditions, and the continued rebalancing of supply and demand in the energy sector.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, at our March meeting the FOMC maintained the target range for the federal funds rate at ¼ to ½ percent. I did not dissent from that decision. Even though I expect it will be appropriate to continue on the path of normalization this year, I recognized that the data we had on the first quarter were limited. I agreed that a reasonable case could be made to wait until more information could be gathered and assessed to see if they confirm that the economy is evolving as anticipated – namely, resumption of the moderate growth trajectory, with continued improvement in labor markets and inflation on track for a gradual return to 2 percent.\n\nI do not think the FOMC is behind the curve, but while there are risks to moving too soon, there are also risks to waiting too long to take the next steps on the normalization path given the lags with which monetary policy affects the economy. We live with uncertainty and one could always make the case that we should wait to act until we gather more information. But waiting until every piece of data lines up in the correct way means waiting too long and risks having to move rates up more aggressively in the future, with negative impacts on our economy. Similarly, forestalling rate increases for too long in light of financial market volatility that doesn't affect the outlook may simply produce more volatility in the future if we find ourselves having to increase rates more aggressively than anticipated to achieve our goals.\n\nOf course, the actual path the fed funds rate will follow will depend on economic developments and how they affect the outlook. As we've seen over this expansion, things can take unexpected turns, and we want policy to appropriately react to changes in the medium-run outlook. The policy path I foresee as appropriate today is slightly more gradual than the path I foresaw in December, partly because of the slight downward revision to my growth forecast but mainly because I now estimate a lower longer-run equilibrium interest rate. But these are small changes. As indicated in the March Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP, the other FOMC participants also currently anticipate that it will be appropriate for the funds rate to move up gradually over time, with the median path across participants now slightly shallower than in December. The change in the path provides an excellent illustration of how our policy is data dependent. The important point I'd like to leave you with is that the economy has shown considerable resiliency, and in my view, the outlook and risks around the outlook will likely support gradual reductions in the degree of accommodation this year."

            "content": "Good afternoon. I thank Ellen Zentner and the New York Association for Business Economics for the invitation to speak to you today. I believe that one of the important responsibilities of a Federal Reserve policymaker is to share his or her economic perspectives with the public. Congress has wisely given the Fed independence in making monetary policy decisions in pursuit of our statutory goals of price stability and maximum employment. I say \"wisely\" because a body of research and practical experience both here and abroad show that when central banks formulate monetary policy free from short-run political interference, the policy is more effective and yields better economic outcomes. But to preserve that independence, the central bank must be held accountable for its policy decisions. And a key component of that accountability involves policymakers providing information to the public on their evaluation of economic conditions, their outlook for the economy, and the rationale for their decisions.\n\nAt its March meeting, about two weeks ago, the Federal Open Market Committee made one of those decisions: it decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at ¼ to ½ percent. The FOMC also released a new set of economic projections, something that it does four times a year. Today, I plan to discuss my outlook for the economy and monetary policy. In doing so, I realize I am going against the teachings of Laozi, the 6th century BC Chinese philosopher, who said, \"Those who have knowledge, don't predict, and those who predict, don't have knowledge.\" However, I take my inspiration from a more modern thinker, Henri Poincaré, the 19th century French mathematician, who said, \"It is far better to foresee even without certainty than not to foresee at all.\" Before I discuss what I foresee, I should remind you that the views I'll present are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\n\nDespite the gyrations in financial markets at the start of the year, the underlying fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain sound. I expect the economy to grow at a moderate pace of 2.25 to 2.5 percent this year, slightly above its longer-run trend and sufficient to generate further job gains and a further reduction in the unemployment rate this year. I anticipate that inflation will continue to move gradually up toward our target of 2 percent over time. In my view, it will be appropriate for monetary policymakers to continue to gradually reduce the level of accommodation this year.\n\nIn putting together my forecast for the March FOMC meeting, I incorporated the new information we had received since the December FOMC projections. I know that many people in this room have to forecast at a much higher frequency than four times a year. Let me assure you that policymakers are also constantly assessing incoming information for its implications for the outlook and risks around the outlook. This information includes the official statistical releases and the reports we garner from talking to our boards of directors, advisory councils, and other contacts in our regions. It is important that our policy be \"data-dependent,\" meaning that policy should depend on how economic and financial conditions evolve, to the extent that those conditions have implications for the medium-run outlook and risks around the outlook.\n\nThe focus is on the medium-run outlook because that's the time horizon over which monetary policy affects the economy. But we live in a high-frequency world. Measures of stock market volatility, like the VIX, attest to that. The market gyrations at the end of last year and the beginning of this year were notable. The declines in global equity markets partly reflected market participants' reassessment of the outlook for global growth, as well as their views on how effective policy actions taken abroad will be. Over the past month or so, we've seen some stability return to financial markets. Volatility has declined, stock prices have risen, and credit risk spreads on corporate bonds have narrowed. As a result, on balance, financial conditions are only slightly more restrictive than they were in December.\n\nWhile less volatile than financial market indicators can be, economic data can also vary quite a bit from month to month. \"Data-dependent\" policymaking does not mean that policy will react to every short-run change in the data – that would be a mistake. One of the challenges for monetary policymakers is making low-frequency policy in a high-frequency world. We need to extract the signal about where the economy is headed from economic and financial market information that can often be noisy.\n\nMy own forecasts tend to have some consistency over time because I try to stay focused on underlying fundamentals and the medium-run outlook. That said, I have made some changes to my outlook since December. Most of the changes have to do with my longer-run projections. In particular, the cumulative evidence since I last adjusted my longer-run projections has led me to slightly move down my estimates of longer-run growth, the longer-run unemployment rate, and the longer-run fed funds rate, each by 25 basis points. My longer-run growth and unemployment rate estimates had been on the high side of FOMC projections. Of course, it's important to remember that because of the considerable uncertainty around estimates of potential growth, the natural rate of unemployment, and the equilibrium real interest rate, the differences across FOMC participants' longer-run estimates are not statistically significant, nor are the 25-basis-point reductions I made to my own estimates. Nonetheless, I wanted to recognize that the moderate growth of around 2 percent that we've seen during the expansion has been sufficient to generate a significant fall in the unemployment rate, while inflation has remained low. That combination of moderate growth, continued improvement in labor markets, and low inflation persuaded me that it was time to take the evidence on board and to move my estimates of the longer-run values down a bit. I now project longer-run growth at 2 percent, the longer-run unemployment rate at 5 percent, and the longer-run fed funds rate at 3.25 percent.\n\nEconomic Growth\n\nIn terms of the forecast, as I've mentioned, I anticipate that growth will pick up to a 2.25 to 2.5 percent range this year. That is slightly lower than my last forecast and reflects both the weakness we saw in the fourth quarter, which suggests that the economy entered 2016 with a little less momentum, and slightly tighter financial conditions, which partly reflect somewhat slower growth abroad. So far, the information we have suggests that growth in the first quarter will remain near the fourth quarter's pace of around 1.5 percent, but there is still more information coming in.\n\nConsumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of output, has been one of the economy's strengths, although it too has shown month-to-month volatility that we need to smooth through. Consumer spending has been buoyed by continued improvement in household balance sheets; growth in personal income, reflecting the progress in labor markets; and lower oil prices, as well as highly accommodative monetary policy that has kept borrowing rates low. The drop in gasoline prices from $3.36 per gallon in 2014 to $2.42 per gallon in 2015 saved the average household about $700. The U.S. Energy Information Administration now forecasts that gasoline prices will average $1.89 per gallon this year, which would mean another $400 in cost savings for the average household. I believe we are seeing a positive effect on spending from lower gasoline prices. Auto sales were particularly strong over the past year, hitting a new record of 17.5 million; many of these were SUVs and other larger vehicles. Instead of spending it, some households may be choosing to save some of the windfall from lower gas prices – we've seen the savings rate rise. Or they may be using it to pay down debt. Either way, the improvement in balance sheets will help support future consumption.\n\nThe housing sector has also shown steady improvement, and I expect that to continue. Total sales of new and existing homes have been rising slowly over the past few years. Existing home sales have made considerable progress in approaching the average level seen before the run-up during the housing bubble, while new home sales still have some ways to go to reach that milestone. Housing starts have been moving up but are still below the levels consistent with projections of household formation over the longer run, and in some markets, the supply of housing hasn't kept up with demand. So there is some chance we will see an acceleration in construction this year. Mortgage rates are low, but households are being appropriately careful in not taking on more mortgage debt than they can handle, and banks are lending to those with good credit quality. House prices have been rising at a 5 to 6 percent pace, on a national level. This has allowed households to rebuild some of the housing equity they lost during the housing bust, another factor that will support consumer spending going forward.\n\nWhile residential investment has been improving, business fixed investment remains weak.

In the face of low oil prices, I expect this sector to feel continued pressure.\n\nManufacturers and other firms exposed to U.S. trade have also had to operate in a very challenging environment. The dollar has appreciated around 20 percent since mid-2014. This appreciation has been a considerable drag on U.S. export growth and on manufacturing output. We can expect the dollar to remain strong because real growth in the U.S. is expected to exceed growth abroad, and interest rates in the U.S. are expected to be higher than those in our major trading partners for some time to come.

The unemployment rate is now about half of what it was at its peak of 10 percent in October 2009. Over the past two years, we've also seen significant improvement in other measures of the under-utilization of labor.

As oil prices and the dollar have shown some stability of late, the headline and underlying measures of inflation have moved higher. And these moves are not just one month's data. Headline and core inflation, as measured by the year-over-year changes in the underlying indices, have been moving up over the past year. Headline PCE inflation has risen to 1 percent from 0.2 percent at the start of last year, and core PCE inflation is 1.7 percent, compared to 1.3 percent a year ago. Core CPI inflation is now above 2 percent. The Cleveland Fed's median CPI inflation rate is 2.4 percent and it, too, has been rising over the past year.\n\nStable inflation expectations are an important component of inflation dynamics. In my view, inflation expectations have been relatively stable, even in the face of sizable declines in energy prices. Market-based inflation compensation, which measures the difference in yields between nominal Treasury securities and Treasury inflation-protected securities, has fallen by more than the survey measures of inflation expectations. But movements in inflation compensation have been highly correlated with changes in oil prices, and in this period of heightened market volatility and flight-to-quality flows into U.S. Treasury securities, I take less of a signal about inflation expectations from the market-based measure of inflation compensation. Various models suggest that the movements in inflation compensation more likely reflect changes in liquidity premia and inflation risk premia rather than changes in inflation expectations.3\n\nBased on the evidence at hand, if the real side of the economy continues to perform consistent with my projections, I expect inflation to remain low this year but to gradually move back to our goal of 2 percent over the next couple of years. And I will continue to monitor all of the measures of inflation and inflation expectations to assess whether this forecast is on track.\n\nRisks to the Forecast\n\nOf course, we have to recognize that the economy rarely evolves exactly as expected. The world is a dynamic place and the economy is hit by shocks, both positive and negative. So any economic forecast is surrounded by fairly wide confidence bands, and mine is no exception. I see risks on both the downside and the upside around my forecast. If the dollar were to appreciate more than I've assumed, perhaps because of weaker growth abroad, or if there were a significant further decline in oil prices rather than a stabilization, then growth and inflation could be lower than in my baseline forecast. The actions taken by several foreign central banks to increase monetary accommodation to further support their economies may help to mitigate some of this risk.\n\nBecause inflation has been undershooting our goal for some time, many people have quite reasonably been focusing on the downside risks to inflation. But it is also good to keep in mind that, according to analysis by the Cleveland Fed staff, over the last 15 years historical forecast errors from several highly regarded inflation forecasting models have skewed to the upside; that is, the models have tended to underestimate actual inflation.4 While the steep declines in oil prices have kept inflation low, in the current environment, low oil prices also pose an upside risk to inflation over the medium run. They may spur stronger-than-expected consumer spending, and this, combined with accommodative monetary policy, could lead to a faster increase in inflation than forecasted.\n\nThe intense volatility in financial markets that we saw at the end of last year and the beginning of this year has subsided. But were it to intensify and be sustained, this could lead to a broader pullback in risk appetites among investors, businesses, and consumers, which could dampen the U.S. economy. I note, though, that even during the recent turbulence we did not see this. Focusing too much on signals from market volatility is also a risk, as messages from the market can turn around quickly. It could be that if markets remain relatively stable, businesses may begin to feel more secure and investment spending may pick up more than expected. The resiliency of the U.S. economy throughout turbulent times is worth remembering as we aim to set monetary policy that will promote our longer-run goals of maximum employment and price stability.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nGiven actual and expected economic performance, the risks around the outlook, and the progress toward our policy goals, my assessment at this time is that it will be appropriate to continue to gradually reduce the degree of accommodation this year. Gradual normalization means that monetary policy will remain accommodative for some time to come, providing support to the economy and insurance against downside risks. I think that's appropriate given some of the forces still affecting our economy – for example, slow growth abroad, appreciation of the dollar, somewhat more restrictive financial conditions, and the continued rebalancing of supply and demand in the energy sector.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, at our March meeting the FOMC maintained the target range for the federal funds rate at ¼ to ½ percent. I did not dissent from that decision. Even though I expect it will be appropriate to continue on the path of normalization this year, I recognized that the data we had on the first quarter were limited. I agreed that a reasonable case could be made to wait until more information could be gathered and assessed to see if they confirm that the economy is evolving as anticipated – namely, resumption of the moderate growth trajectory, with continued improvement in labor markets and inflation on track for a gradual return to 2 percent.\n\nI do not think the FOMC is behind the curve, but while there are risks to moving too soon, there are also risks to waiting too long to take the next steps on the normalization path given the lags with which monetary policy affects the economy. We live with uncertainty and one could always make the case that we should wait to act until we gather more information. But waiting until every piece of data lines up in the correct way means waiting too long and risks having to move rates up more aggressively in the future, with negative impacts on our economy. Similarly, forestalling rate increases for too long in light of financial market volatility that doesn't affect the outlook may simply produce more volatility in the future if we find ourselves having to increase rates more aggressively than anticipated to achieve our goals.\n\nOf course, the actual path the fed funds rate will follow will depend on economic developments and how they affect the outlook. As we've seen over this expansion, things can take unexpected turns, and we want policy to appropriately react to changes in the medium-run outlook. The policy path I foresee as appropriate today is slightly more gradual than the path I foresaw in December, partly because of the slight downward revision to my growth forecast but mainly because I now estimate a lower longer-run equilibrium interest rate. But these are small changes. The important point is that the economy has shown considerable resiliency, and in my view, the outlook and risks around the outlook will likely support gradual reductions in the degree of accommodation this year.\n\nThe FOMC's Summary of Economic Projections\n\nAs indicated in the March Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP, the other FOMC participants also currently anticipate that it will be appropriate for the funds rate to move up gradually over time, with the median path across participants now slightly shallower than in December. A lot of media commentary has focused on this somewhat flatter policy path. To my mind, this change in the path is an excellent illustration of how our policy is data dependent. There were slight reductions in the participants' economic projections between December and March, reflecting incoming economic information including weak fourth quarter U.S. growth, lower estimates of global growth, volatility in financial markets, and somewhat tighter financial conditions. Each participant took these developments into account when revising his or her projections and the policy path the participant thought was appropriate to achieving those outcomes. Because there is uncertainty around each participant's projections of growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation, there is also uncertainty around the appropriate policy path. Thus, no one should read the median path in the SEP as a promised policy path. Policy is not on a pre-set course; the actual path of the fed funds rate will depend on the economic outlook and risks around the outlook. But the median policy path and changes in that path over time help to illuminate participants' reaction functions – how participants believe policy should systematically respond to changes in economic conditions that affect the outlook.\n\nI believe the discipline of forecasting how the economy might evolve over the medium run and the uncertainty around the forecast is an essential part of the framework for setting monetary policy. It provides a useful methodology for avoiding too much focus on short-run changes in the economic data or volatility in the markets. It allows us to do low-frequency policymaking in a high-frequency world. It forces us to consider how changes in the economic and financial data may or may not change the medium-run outlook, the risks around the outlook, and the appropriate policy path. It is the construct through which our policymaking can be made systematic, yet responsive to the evolution of economic conditions. The outcome of this process – the projections of economic outcomes and the policy paths thought appropriate to achieve those outcomes – is summarized in our SEP four times a year, allowing the public to better understand how the assessments of the economy and monetary policy are evolving. I view this as essential transparency, which is why I believe the SEP continues to be an important part of FOMC communications."

            "content": "I thank David Kotok and his colleagues at the Global Interdependence Center for giving me the opportunity to speak with you this morning about economic developments and monetary policy. I am very happy to be here — and not just because I left single–digit temperatures in Cleveland. No, it's because at each GIC program I've attended over the years — and there have been many — I've always walked away with some new insight or perspective with which to view the economy and policy. The GIC's Central Banking Series is an important forum for discussing economic matters of global interest, and I am privileged to say that today's talk is my second in the series. Last March, at the GIC's program with the Banque de France, I spoke about the journey from extraordinary monetary policy back to ordinary monetary policy. Today, I will update you on the progress that's been made on that journey and my outlook for the economy and monetary policy. As always, the views I'll present today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nRecent Monetary Policy Actions and Communications: Steps on the Normalization Path\n\nAt its January meeting, the FOMC decided to maintain the target range of the federal funds rate at one quarter to one half of a percent. I supported this decision because I believe that policy, for the time being, is well–calibrated to the economic outlook and the risks around that outlook. The current target range had been set in December when the FOMC implemented its first change in the policy rate in 7 years and the first rate increase in 91⁄2 years. I supported that decision as well. December's increase in the rate from essentially zero recognized the considerable progress the economy has made since the Great Recession, which officially ended more than six years ago, as well as the FOMC's outlook that the economy will improve further, supported by monetary policy that continues to be quite accommodative. The rate increase in December was a step on the path toward more normal policy, a journey that arguably began in October 2014 when the FOMC ended its third large–scale asset purchase program, also known as quantitative easing, or QE3.\n\nThe Committee has indicated that, in setting policy, it assesses both realized and expected progress toward the FOMC's statutory objectives of maximum employment and price stability. The policy decisions in December and January represented the outcomes of such an assessment, which encompasses a wide range of economic information — the official economic statistical releases and financial market indicators, as well as the information I and other FOMC participants garner by speaking with contacts in our regions. When the FOMC says its decisions are \"data–dependent,\" I view this as shorthand for this more comprehensive process of parsing economic and financial information to evaluate current economic conditions, and then determining what that information implies about the medium–run economic outlook and the risks around that outlook. The medium run is the relevant time horizon for monetary policy because it takes time for monetary policy to have an effect throughout the economy.\n\nI don't view this \"data–dependent\" approach to policymaking as something new. Instead, I view it as a step on the journey back from extraordinary to more ordinary monetary policymaking. You will recall that one of the policy tools the FOMC used during the recession and early part of the recovery was explicit forward guidance. That guidance changed over time. It began as qualitative guidance offered in December 2008 when the FOMC indicated that weak economic conditions were likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the fed funds rate for \"some time.\" This changed to calendar–date guidance in August 2011 when the FOMC said that it anticipated an exceptionally low fed funds rate at least through mid–2013. Guidance based on economic thresholds was offered in December 2012 when the Committee said that it anticipated that the 0–to–1⁄4 percent target range for the fed funds rate would be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remained above 6 1⁄2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead was projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer–run goal, and longer–term inflation expectations continued to be well anchored. A year later, in December 2013, the FOMC blended state–contingent forward guidance with an element of calendar–date forward guidance, indicating the information it would consider in determining how long to maintain highly accommodative monetary policy as well as an assessment that it would likely be \"well past the time that the unemployment rate declines below 6 1⁄2 percent, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer–run goal.\"\n\nIn March 2014, the FOMC abandoned quantitative thresholds and moved toward the type of forward guidance we have today, which links the path of policy to the Committee's assessment of both realized and expected progress toward its dual–mandate objectives. The guidance continued to provide a time element by indicating it was likely that liftoff would not occur for \"a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends.\"\n\nAfter the purchase program ended, using it as a benchmark for guidance became less salient. In January 2015, the FOMC replaced this benchmark and simply said it judged it could be patient in beginning to normalize policy. In March, the FOMC fine–tuned this by stating the two criteria it would use to assess when it would be appropriate to make the first fed funds rate increase. These criteria were further improvement in the labor market and reasonable confidence that inflation would move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term. Since December's liftoff, the Committee has continued to indicate that the path of policy will depend on progress toward our goals, and that while the actual path policy takes will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data, the Committee's current assessment is that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate.\n\nThis evolution in the FOMC's forward rate guidance represents a return to more normal times. While explicit forward guidance was used as a policy tool during the recession and early in the recovery, in more normal times, away from the zero lower bound, I believe forward guidance should be viewed more as a communications device. But this step back from explicit guidance poses a challenge for the FOMC for at least two reasons. First, market participants tend to like more explicit statements and less uncertainty. Yet, it's appropriate for monetary policy to respond to economic developments, whether foreseen or not. Second, while before the Great Recession, the public had a pretty good sense of how monetary policy would respond to economic developments, there is likely less clarity about the Fed's so–called reaction function now. After the great inflation of the 1970s, the FOMC became more predictable and systematic in how it reacted to changes in economic activity and inflation.1 As a result, explicit forward guidance was rarely used. But the Great Recession required the Fed to behave in a way quite distinct from its past behavior, and consequently, there is less understanding about how policymakers are likely to react to incoming economic information than there was earlier.\n\nThus, in my view, an important goal of FOMC communications is to explain the rationale of our decisions to the public so they will have a sense of how policy is likely to change, in response not only to expected changes in economic conditions but also to unforeseen changes in conditions. I believe that the FOMC statements have been evolving along these lines, although there are likely further steps we could take to provide more information about the conditions we systematically assess in calibrating the stance of policy to the economy's actual and anticipated progress toward our dual–mandate goals. In addition to the policy statement, I believe the FOMC's Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) can be helpful in illuminating the FOMC's reaction function.\n\nFOMC policymakers provide funds rate projections in the SEP that represent their views of appropriate policy — the renowned dot plot — as well as projections of economic growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation that are conditional on their policy path. It's important to note that the policy paths in the SEP are not policy forecasts, unlike interest rate projections in private–sector forecasts. Nonetheless, because there is uncertainty around the outlook, there is also uncertainty around the FOMC's policy path. If the economy's evolution turns out to be different from what we currently anticipate, our policy path may well have to deviate from our current expectation. The policy paths in the SEP should be expected to change over time as the outlook changes. I don't view this as problematic — we want policy to respond appropriately to changes in the outlook. Thus, the actual path normalization takes could very well turn out to be either less gradual or more gradual than what we anticipate it to be today.\n\nThe last SEP projections were released in December; the next set of projections will be released at our March FOMC meeting. The evolution of the dot plot in the SEP over meetings to come will provide the public with information on how participants think monetary policy should appropriately respond to changes in the outlook that reflect economic developments. I think the SEP will be particularly helpful in March given the global economic and financial developments we've seen since our last set of projections.\n\nThe FOMC's policy statement in January made it clear that the Committee is closely monitoring these developments and is assessing their implications for the labor market and inflation, and for the balance of risks to the outlook. I certainly will use the time between now and the March meeting to continue to gather information from contacts in the Fourth Federal Reserve District about economic developments affecting businesses, customers, and households; to look at the details of the official economic statistical releases and financial market indicators; and to consider the results from the economic models and forecasts developed by the Cleveland Fed's staff as well as those of other economists. I will walk into the March FOMC meeting with my own assessment of the medium–run outlook for the U.S. economy and risks around the outlook, but I will want to hear the views of others around the table who may or may not share my views based on their own analysis. By design, the discussions at FOMC meetings contain a mosaic of economic information and analysis from all parts of the country. This regional information, along with national data and analysis, plays an important role in setting national monetary policy. The economic developments we've seen since the beginning of the year will be part of the discussion, so let's turn to those now.\n\nThe Economy\n\nAccording to the first estimate, real GDP growth slowed considerably in the fourth quarter of last year, to an annualized growth rate of only 0.7 percent, down from an average pace of about 3 percent in the second and third quarters. A decline in net exports and a reduced pace of inventory investment were the main drags on growth last quarter, but nonresidential investment also declined. In contrast, consumer spending and residential investment held up well. So, one question is whether the softness seen last quarter will persist. Another question is whether the recent financial market volatility and decline in oil prices are signaling a material change in the medium–run outlook.\n\nThe declines in global equity markets since the beginning of the year partly reflect market participants' reassessment of the outlook for growth in China and their views on whether policy actions undertaken by Chinese policymakers will be effective in fostering growth there. China is undergoing a longer–run structural transition from an economy driven by trade to one more dependent on domestic consumption growth, and these kinds of structural changes can be challenging and long lasting. Over the past couple of decades, we have seen some of those challenges play out on a much smaller scale at the regional level in the U.S. as industrial states have transitioned from manufacturing–based economies to more diversified economies.\n\nAs it relates to U.S. growth, the direct trade ties between the U.S. economy and China are not very strong: Exports to China represent 7 to 8 percent of total U.S. exports and total U.S. exports are about 12 to 13 percent of U.S. GDP. So the direct effect of trade with China on U.S. output is small. Of course, some U.S. industries and regions of the country are more exposed to international developments via trade than others, and because many emerging economies are considerably more dependent on trade with China, the implications of developments in China for the global economy need to be considered.\n\nIn addition to the decline in stock prices, we have seen another sharp decline in oil prices since the beginning of the year. In part, this reflects the same reassessment of global growth prospects affecting the stock market. But supply–side factors are also very important. Worldwide oil inventories remain high and oil production has not been as responsive as one might have thought, given the declines in oil prices seen over the past 18 months. This means that oil prices are likely to remain lower for longer than previously anticipated, as it is taking longer for supply to rebalance with demand.\n\nAt this point, I see the market volatility and sharp drop in oil prices as posing risks to the forecast, but I believe it is premature to conclude they necessitate a material change in my modal economic outlook. While there is a possibility that a steeper, more persistent drop in equity markets could lead to a broader and more persistent pullback in risk–taking and credit extension, with spillovers to the broader economy, so far we have not seen this. Solid labor market indicators, including strong payroll growth, and healthy growth in real disposable income suggest that underlying U.S. economic fundamentals remain sound. I continue to monitor developments, but until I see further evidence to the contrary, my current expectation is that the U.S. economy will work through this episode of market turbulence and the soft patch of economic data to regain its footing for moderate growth, even as the energy and manufacturing sectors remain challenged.\n\nConsistent with this view, January's advance retail sales report suggests that consumer spending, which makes up about two–thirds of output, started the year on a strong note, rebounding from a somewhat softer reading in December. Sales gains were broad–based, including those of motor vehicles, which have been particularly strong over the past year. The relative strength in the consumer sector shouldn't be too much of a surprise because it is based on sound economic fundamentals. Consumer spending has been buoyed by continued improvement in household balance sheets, growth in personal income, which reflects the progress in labor markets, and lower oil prices.\n\nAmidst highly volatile markets, stock prices were little changed, on net, in 2015, and are down since the start of this year. But the cumulative increase in stock prices since the financial crisis ended is still significant. Similarly, house prices have been rising at a 5 to 6 percent pace over the past couple of years, allowing households to rebuild their housing equity. Housing has been slowly recovering for some time. Housing starts remain below the levels consistent with projections of household formation over the longer run. Mortgage rates are low but households are being careful in not taking on more mortgage debt than they can handle, and banks are lending to those with good credit quality. These factors are supportive of housing continuing to make a positive contribution to growth and of households continuing to build their housing equity.\n\nIn the aggregate, households lost $13 trillion in net worth during the Great Recession, but the deleveraging that households undertook, coupled with the cumulative increase in stock and house prices over the expansion, means that households have recovered that loss and have added an additional nearly $18 trillion in net worth to their balance sheets.\n\nBank balance sheets have also improved considerably, and lending, which supports economic growth, is rising. The proportion of loans that are nonperforming, delinquency rates, and default rates have all been declining and, outside of the real estate portfolio, are back to pre–crisis levels. At the same time, capital ratios and loan–loss reserves are rising, so that banks generally are in a considerably better position to handle future losses should they arise. Although risk premia have increased, especially on higher–yield bonds, credit for higher–quality borrowers remains available to support growth.\n\nThe fact that consumer lending is rising is an indication that, in general, consumers are feeling pretty positive about their earnings prospects. This is a very reasonable view, reflecting the cumulative progress that has been made in the labor market.\n\nIt is good to remember how far we have come. Over the past six years, the unemployment rate has been more than halved, falling from a high of 10 percent in October 2009 to 4.9 percent in January. Other measures of underutilization of labor have also improved significantly over the past few years, although they are not quite back to pre–recession levels. These measures include the long–term unemployment rate, as well as the unemployment rate that includes discouraged workers and part–time workers who would rather work full–time. Nonfarm payrolls are now more than 4 3⁄4 million above their previous peak before the Great Recession. Last year, the economy added about 2 3⁄4 million jobs, an average pace of nearly 230,000 per month. Solid labor market performance continued into this year. Firms added 151,000 jobs in January. While this was somewhat fewer than the average monthly increase last year, it is considerably more than the 75,000 to 120,000 jobs per month that economists currently estimate would be enough to keep the unemployment rate constant. I continue to expect that growth this year will be sufficient to generate some further improvement in labor markets. I wouldn't be surprised if the pace of job gains slowed somewhat, based on demographics and the stage of the business cycle, but the gains should be strong enough to put additional downward pressure on the unemployment rate and support broader acceleration in wages.\n\nI do not want to underplay the significant longer–run challenges the country faces in the labor market. Unemployment rates among minorities have been chronically higher than those for whites. The structural transition of our economy from one based on traditional manufacturing to one encompassing high–tech manufacturing and services has also created demand for different skill sets, thereby requiring workers to increase their human capital.2 The difference in wages between those with a college degree and those without, the so–called skill premium, has widened substantially over time, more than doubling since the 1970s.3 This skill premium is inducing people to increase their skills, often taking on student debt to do so. Enrollments in college are near historic highs, but non–completion rates are also quite high.4 So while the proportion of 25–year–olds with college degrees has moved up from 25 to 30 percent over the past 15 years, by this metric, the U.S. is now ranked only 12th among developed nations.5\n\nThese developments pose difficult challenges. As a country, we need to ensure that people can enter and remain productive members of the modern labor force, to raise our standards of living and to make us more competitive in the global economy. The question is how to do that. I do not believe monetary policy would be effective in addressing these longer–run problems and leaning on it to try to do so can be counterproductive. It takes the focus off of programs and policies that are better suited to addressing these issues. From the standpoint of what monetary policy can do, in my view the totality of evidence suggests that the economy is at or very nearly at the Fed's mandated monetary policy goal of maximum employment. However, I do believe there is a role for government policy and that it should be brought to bear on these challenges. There is evidence of positive externalities from education. Less–educated workers appear to benefit in the form of higher wages from working in areas populated with more–educated workers.6 And cities with more highly educated populations experience lower unemployment rates, higher productivity growth, and higher growth in entrepreneurship than what would have been predicted by considering only the educational levels of individuals.7 The positive externalities suggest we are under–investing in education from society's viewpoint and that appropriately constructed government policies and programs can be a valuable investment for the country to undertake.\n\nIn addition to improved balance sheets and earning prospects, lower oil prices are a third factor that will continue to support consumer spending in the U.S., even as it continues to weigh heavily on the U.S. energy and manufacturing sectors. The drop in gasoline prices from $3.36 per gallon in 2014 to $2.42 per gallon in 2015 saved the average household about $700. The U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasts that gasoline prices will average $1.98 per gallon this year, which would mean another $300 in cost savings for the average household. Households may be choosing to spend some of this gain — we've seen this already in high sales of SUVs and other larger vehicles — or they may be choosing to save some of this gain — we've seen the savings rate rise — and these savings will help support future consumption.\n\nOf course, there is a downside to the lower energy prices, too, for both growth and inflation. The drop in oil and other commodity prices has weighed heavily on firms in the drilling and mining sector, and on their suppliers, and these firms have responded by cutting jobs and reducing investment. Some firms may face bankruptcy or will need to merge. I expect firms in these sectors to face continued pressure. Manufacturers and other firms exposed to U.S. trade have also had to operate in a very challenging environment. The dollar has appreciated more than 20 percent since mid–2014, reflecting the expectation that real growth in the U.S. will continue to be stronger than growth abroad, as well as projected interest rate differentials between the U.S. and foreign economies. A stronger dollar means better terms of trade for U.S. consumers and businesses, which is a positive for a growing economy in the longer run. But in the near term, this appreciation has been a considerable drag on U.S. export growth. Should economic growth in our trading partners weaken, this would put further strains on U.S. exports. I expect that net exports will be a negative influence on real GDP growth for some time to come.\n\nThe latest round of oil price declines means headline inflation will remain lower for longer than I previously thought. Inflation has been running below the Fed's 2 percent goal for quite some time. Headline inflation, measured by the year–over–year change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, was 0.6 percent in December, and core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, which tend to be volatile, was 1.4 percent. Low inflation partly reflects the effects of declines in oil prices and other commodity prices since mid–2014, as well as the appreciation of the dollar, which has held down the prices of nonpetroleum imports into the U.S.\n\nWhile headline inflation is likely to remain low in the near term, I still think a reasonable forecast is that inflation will gradually return to 2 percent over the medium run. I can point to a couple of things to support this view. First, measures of underlying inflation, like the core, the trimmed mean, and the Cleveland Fed's median CPI, are higher than headline inflation. They have remained relatively stable despite the continuing sharp drop in the prices of oil and other commodities and the appreciation of the dollar we've seen over the past 18 months.\n\nIn my view, longer–run inflation expectations, an important factor in the inflation forecast, have also been relatively stable, even in the face of sizable declines in energy prices, which, according to analysis by the Cleveland Fed staff, account for much of the movement in longer–run inflation expectations.8 I take less of a signal from the downward moves in market–based measures of inflation compensation, because estimates suggest that these more likely reflect changes in liquidity premia and inflation risk premia rather than changes in inflation expectations.\n\nOil prices cannot continue to decline indefinitely, nor can the dollar continue to appreciate forever. At some point, both will regain some stability and the effect of previous changes on inflation will dissipate. In fact, we saw those dynamics play out toward the end of last year when oil prices and the value of the dollar had begun to stabilize, and the underlying inflation measures began to firm. When oil prices and the dollar both regain some stability, and with inflation expectations remaining stable and economic growth continuing, it is reasonable to expect that inflation will move back slowly to 2 percent; it just might take a bit longer now, given the most recent decline in oil prices.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nOf course, going forward, it will be important to continue to monitor inflation developments, in particular inflation expectations, as well as economic developments both here and abroad. We want to set the path of policy based on an outlook informed by economic developments, a path that will best achieve our longer–run objectives of maximum employment and price stability. Given my outlook that the economy will work through this rough patch and resume a trajectory of moderate growth, with continued improvement in labor markets and a gradual return of inflation to 2 percent, I believe the appropriate policy path will involve gradual reductions over time in the extraordinary level of accommodation that was necessary to address the Great Recession. Even as policy gradually normalizes, it will likely need to remain accommodative for some time to come, given some of the forces still impacting our economy — for example, slow growth abroad, dollar appreciation, more restrictive financial conditions, and the continued rebalancing of supply and demand in the energy sector.\n\nThe actual path the fed funds rate will follow will depend on economic developments and how they affect the outlook. As we've seen, things can take unexpected turns. Our economic forecasting models are, by necessity, simplifications. The economy is dynamic and can be hit by various shocks that might lead to changes in the medium–run outlook for employment and inflation to which policy would want to respond in a systematic fashion in order to promote maximum employment and price stability.\n\nIt is good to remember that confidence bands around economic forecasts tend to be wide. I wish we were able to forecast with more precision — economists are working on it — but unfortunately the state of the science, or perhaps I should say the state of the art, isn't there yet. For example, averaging across several models, the 70 percent confidence interval around a forecast of CPI inflation one year out is about plus or minus 1 percentage point; the confidence band around a forecast of short–term interest rates one year out is of similar magnitude. When the FOMC releases its projections, some observers tend to focus on the dispersion across FOMC participants. But this dispersion is actually pretty modest compared to the uncertainty around the projections.\n\nBut just because we cannot forecast the future with as much precision as we'd like does not mean the exercise is without value. The discipline of forecasting how the economy might evolve over the medium run and assessing the uncertainty around the forecast is an essential part of the framework for setting monetary policy. It provides a useful methodology to help policymakers avoid focusing too much on short–run changes in the economic data or volatility in the markets. It forces one to consider how those changes in the economic and financial data may or may not change the medium–run outlook, the risks around the outlook, and the appropriate policy path. It is the construct through which our policymaking can be made systematic, yet responsive to changes in economic conditions. The outcome of this process is communicated in our Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), which is why I view the SEP as an important part of FOMC communications, one that will continue to serve us well as we continue on the journey toward more normal monetary policy."

            "content": "Thank you for the invitation to present some remarks and to participate in what I am sure will be an interesting question and answer session to follow. I say \"interesting\" because over the 18 months in which I've served as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, I find that whenever I present remarks, I learn a lot from the questions posed by the audience – most likely, more than they learn from me. I view the exchange of ideas with the public as one of a Fed president's duties, but it has also turned out to be one of its pleasures.\n\nAnother pleasure of mine is serving on the Federal Open Market Committee's Subcommittee on Communications. The Federal Reserve has worked over many years to improve its communications with the public and to increase transparency. This work is gratifying but it is also challenging. One of the challenges is trying to explain policy decisions and the rationale behind those decisions, which can be quite complex. In a world in which every word of the FOMC is scrutinized, those of us on the Committee try to be very careful with our language. But at times, this can make us seem somewhat inscrutable. So today I would like to give you my own interpretation of four expressions that have become part of the lexicon of monetary policymakers. These phrases are: data dependent, gradual normalization, well underway, and symmetric inflation goal. Before proceeding, let me emphasize that this is not intended to be an exhaustive list of the lingo monetary policymakers use; if I tried to do that, we would be here all night and never get to the Q&A portion of the program. Let me also emphasize that these are my views and interpretations, and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the FOMC.\n\nData Dependent\n\nThe FOMC has described its monetary policy decisions as being \"data dependent.\" At its January meeting held last week, the FOMC decided to maintain the target range of the federal funds rate at one quarter to one half of a percent. This target was set in December when the FOMC implemented its first change in the policy rate in 7 years and the first rate increase in 9-1/2 years. December's increase in the rate from essentially zero recognized the considerable progress the economy has made since the Great Recession, which officially ended more than six years ago, and the FOMC's outlook that the economy will improve further, supported by monetary policy that continues to be quite accommodative.\n\nThe Committee has indicated that, in setting policy, it assesses both realized and expected progress toward the FOMC's statutory objectives of maximum employment and price stability. The decision to maintain the target range in January, just as the decision to raise it in December, represents the outcome of such an assessment. This assessment encompasses a wide range of economic information – the official economic statistical releases and financial market indicators, as well as the information I and other FOMC participants garner by speaking with contacts in our regions. When the FOMC says its decisions are \"data-dependent,\" I view this as shorthand for this more comprehensive process of parsing economic and financial information to evaluate current economic conditions, and then assessing what that information implies about the economic outlook and the risks around that outlook.\n\nI supported the decision of no change in the fed funds rate target in January because I believe that policy, for the time being, is well-calibrated to the economic outlook and the risks around that outlook.\n\nIt is important to note that \"data dependent\" policymaking does not mean that policy will react to every short-run change in the data. For example, volatility in financial markets or a change in a short-run data report is not a rationale for making a monetary policy decision. Instead, an assessment has to be made of what the incoming data and financial market developments are telling us about underlying economic conditions and the medium-run outlook. The relevant time horizon for monetary policy is the medium run because it takes time for monetary policy to have an effect throughout the economy.\n\nA case in point is the economic and financial developments we've seen since the beginning of the year. According to the first estimate, real GDP growth slowed considerably in the fourth quarter of last year, to an annualized growth rate of only 0.7 percent, down from an average pace of about 3 percent in the second and third quarters. A decline in net exports and a reduced pace of inventory investment were the main drags on growth last quarter, but nonresidential investment also declined. In contrast, consumer spending and residential investment held up well. So, the question is: how long will the softness seen last quarter persist?\n\nWe also have to evaluate what the recent market volatility might imply about medium-run growth. The declines in global equity markets since the beginning of the year partly reflect market participants' reassessment of the outlook for growth in China and their views on how effective policy actions undertaken by Chinese policymakers will be in fostering growth there. China is undergoing a longer-run structural transition from an economy driven by trade to one more dependent on domestic consumption growth, and these kinds of structural changes can be challenging and long lasting. Over the past couple of decades, we have seen some of those challenges play out on a much smaller scale at the regional level in the U.S. as industrial states have transitioned from manufacturing-based economies to more diversified goods- and services-based economies.\n\nAs it relates to U.S. growth, the direct trade ties between the U.S. economy and China are not very strong: exports to China represent 7 to 8 percent of total U.S. exports and total U.S. exports are about 12 to 13 percent of U.S. GDP. So the direct effect of trade with China on U.S. output is small. Of course, some U.S. industries are more exposed to international developments via trade and changes in the value of the dollar than others, and because many emerging economies are considerably more dependent on trade with China, the implications of developments in China for the global economy need to be considered.\n\nIn addition to the decline in stock prices, we have seen another sharp decline in oil prices since the beginning of the year. In part, this reflects the same reassessment of global growth prospects affecting the stock market. But supply-side factors are also very important. Worldwide oil inventories remain high and oil production has not been as responsive as one might have thought given the declines in oil prices seen over the past 18 months. This means that oil prices are likely to remain lower for longer than previously anticipated, as it is taking longer for supply to rebalance with demand.\n\nHow should a data-dependent policymaker incorporate these recent developments into the medium-run outlook? At this point, I view them as posing some risk to the outlook, but I believe it is premature to materially change my modal outlook. The drop in oil prices means that the U.S. energy and manufacturing sectors will continue to experience considerable pressure. However, lower energy prices will provide an offsetting benefit for U.S. households and for those in other oil-importing countries. Households may choose to spend some of this gain – we've seen this already in high sales of SUVs and other larger vehicles – or they may choose to save some of this gain – we've seen the savings rate rise – and these savings will help support future consumption. While there is a possibility that a steeper, more persistent drop in equity markets could lead to a broader and more persistent pullback in risk-taking, which would negatively affect the outlook, so far we have not seen this.\n\nI continue to monitor global economic and financial developments and assess their implications for the outlook and risks to the outlook. At this point, solid labor market indicators, including strong payroll growth, and healthy growth in real disposable income, suggest that underlying U.S. economic fundamentals remain sound. Until we see further evidence to the contrary, my expectation is that the U.S. economy will work through the latest episode of market turbulence and soft patch to regain its footing for moderate growth, even as the energy and manufacturing sectors remain challenged. I continue to expect that growth this year will be sufficient to generate some further improvement in labor markets. I wouldn't be surprised if the pace of job gains slowed somewhat, but the gains should be strong enough to put additional downward pressure on the unemployment rate.\n\nThe latest round of oil price declines means headline inflation will remain lower for longer than I previously thought. But I still think a reasonable forecast is that inflation will gradually return to 2 percent over the medium run. I can point to a couple of things to support this view. First, measures of underlying inflation, like the core, the trimmed mean, and the Cleveland Fed's median CPI, are higher than headline inflation. They have remained relatively stable despite the continuing sharp drop in oil prices we've seen over the past 18 months and the appreciation of the dollar, which puts downward pressure on the price of U.S. imports. In my view, longer-run inflation expectations, an important factor in the inflation forecast, have been relatively stable, even in the face of sizable declines in energy prices. I take less of a signal from the downward moves in market-based measures of inflation compensation, because estimates suggest that these moves more likely reflect changes in liquidity premia and inflation risk premia rather than changes in inflation expectations.\n\nOil prices cannot continue to decline indefinitely, nor can the dollar continue to appreciate forever. At some point, both will regain some stability and the effect of previous changes on inflation will dissipate. As that happens, with inflation expectations remaining stable and economic growth continuing, it is reasonable to expect that inflation will move back slowly to 2 percent; it just might take a bit longer now given the most recent decline in oil prices.\n\nOf course, going forward, it will be important to monitor inflation developments, in particular inflation expectations, as well as economic developments both here and abroad. As we've seen, things can take unexpected turns. We want to set the path of policy based on an outlook informed by economic developments, a path that will best achieve our objectives of maximum employment and price stability. While the actual path the fed funds rate follows will depend on the economic outlook, and thus, will be data dependent, my current view is that economic conditions will evolve in a way that will warrant rates moving up gradually over time to more normal levels. And this brings me to the second term in the monetary policymakers' lexicon: gradual normalization.\n\nGradual Normalization\n\nI expect monetary policy to remain accommodative for some time to come. But given my outlook of moderate growth, continued improvement in labor markets, and a gradual return of inflation to 2 percent, I believe the appropriate policy path will involve gradual reductions in the extraordinary level of accommodation that was necessary to address the Great Recession and its aftermath.\n\nThe FOMC's Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP, which includes a dot plot of each FOMC participant's fed funds rate projection, gives a good sense of the meaning of \"gradual normalization.\" In March, we will have a new set of FOMC projections. The December projections showed that the majority of FOMC participants believe it will be appropriate for the level of the fed funds rate to move up over time, but at a pace that means over the next couple of years the funds rate will be below the level most participants expect to prevail over the longer run. According to the December projections, across participants, this longer-run level ranges from 3 to 4 percent, with a median projection of 3.5 percent. So one meaning of gradual is that the level of the policy rate is expected to be relatively low for some time.\n\nAnother way to see that this pace is gradual is to compare it to past tightening cycles, when economic conditions and the outlook differed from those today. The median path in the December SEP is about half the pace of tightening the Committee undertook in the 2004-2006 period, the period of \"measured pace\" increases. It is even more gradual when compared to the 1994 tightening cycle when the fed funds rate target rose by 300 basis points over 13 months.\n\nA third way to view this as gradual is to compare it to prescriptions from some simple monetary policy rules. As I've said elsewhere,1 I believe in a systematic approach to monetary policy, but I don't believe we are at the state of knowledge where we can choose a single policy rule to set policy because no rule works well enough across a variety of economic models and in a variety of economic circumstances. Still, I find it useful to look at the outcomes of a variety of such rules as a gauge. The median policy path in the December SEP is more gradual than the policy path that would be prescribed by many, although not all, simple policy rules. For example, suppose the economy evolved in the way described by the median economic projections from the December SEP. Then the simple Taylor 1993 rule would project the fed funds rate rising by over 3 percentage points by the end of 2017, while the median appropriate policy path in the December SEP is considerably more gradual, with the funds rate rising by about 2 percentage points by the end of 2017.2 In other words, according to FOMC participants, in order to achieve the median economic projections in the SEP, a more gradual path than the one described by a simple Taylor rule will be appropriate.\n\nThus, it is anticipated that even as policy gradually normalizes, it will likely need to remain accommodative for some time to come given some of the forces still impacting our economy – for example, slow growth abroad, dollar appreciation, more restrictive financial conditions, and the continued rebalancing of supply and demand in the energy sector.\n\nWe use the word \"normalization,\" but in the aftermath of the Great Recession, there is some uncertainty about what the \"normal\" level of interest rates is. If productivity growth remains low and the potential growth rate of the economy over the longer run has moved lower, as many economists estimate it has, then the longer-run level of the fed funds rate consistent with price stability and maximum employment – the so-called neutral rate – would also be lower than it was in earlier periods. But estimates of long-run growth are imprecise and subject to revision, so this means there is considerable uncertainty around this neutral fed funds rate as well. A gradual approach to normalization will not only allow us to be responsive to economic developments but also allow us to recalibrate policy over time as some of the uncertainties surrounding the longer-term level of interest rates, the economy's potential growth rate, and the longer-run unemployment rate are resolved.\n\nWhile I've been using the median fed funds projection in the December SEP as a benchmark, it is important to keep in mind that these projections are not a commitment because in order to best achieve our goals of maximum employment and price stability, policy should be expected to react in a systematic fashion to material changes in the outlook. Our economic forecasting models are, by necessity, simplifications. The economy is dynamic and can be hit by various shocks that might lead to changes in the medium-run outlook for employment and inflation to which policy would want to respond. Confidence bands around economic forecasts tend to be wide. For example, averaging across several models, the 70 percent confidence interval around a forecast of CPI inflation one year out is about plus or minus 1 percentage point; the confidence band around a forecast of short-term interest rates one year out is of similar magnitude.\n\nUnlike private-sector forecasters, FOMC policymakers provide funds rate projections in the SEP that represent their views of appropriate policy rather than a policy forecast. But because there is uncertainty around the outlook, there is also uncertainty around the FOMC's policy path. If the economy's evolution turns out to be different from what we currently anticipate, our policy path may well have to deviate from what our current expectation is. The policy paths in the SEP will change over time as the outlook changes. I don't view this as problematic – we want policy to respond appropriately to changes in the outlook. Thus, the actual path normalization takes could very well turn out to be either less or more gradual than what we anticipate it to be today. The evolution of the FOMC's dot plot in the SEP over meetings to come will provide the public with information on how participants think monetary policy should appropriately respond to changes in the outlook. As I mentioned, our next SEP will be released in March.\n\nWell Underway\n\nAnother aspect of current monetary policy involves the Fed's balance-sheet strategy. The Fed took some extraordinary policy actions in the wake of the financial crisis and Great Recession. Some of those actions involved purchasing longer-term Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities to exert downward pressure on long-term interest rates. As a result of those purchases, banks and other depository institutions now hold at the Fed over $2 trillion in reserves in excess of regulatory requirements, and the Fed holds about $4.5 trillion in assets on its balance sheet, nearly five times as much as before the financial crisis. Currently, the Fed is maintaining the size of its balance sheet by reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities into agency mortgage-backed securities and by rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. The FOMC has said it anticipates doing this until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well underway. One might reasonably ask what \"well underway\" means. The FOMC hasn't given a precise definition.\n\nIn my view, \"well underway\" refers to the state of the economy and not a particular length of time after the initial rate increase. This is consistent with the FOMC's policy normalization principles, which indicate that the decision about when to cease or begin phasing out reinvestments will depend on how economic and financial conditions and the economic outlook evolve.3 As demonstrated in December, the Fed has the tools to raise the fed funds rate to the target range even though the balance sheet is very large. So from a policy implementation perspective, there isn't a compelling reason to end reinvestments quickly. But consistent with the normalization principles, I would like the balance sheet to eventually return to a more normal size and composition; the first step in that process is ending reinvestments. We don't know precisely how the economy will evolve; this argues against deciding to end reinvestments after some particular period of time has elapsed. Instead, because some policy accommodation is provided via the balance sheet, it would seem better to base the decision about reinvestments on economic conditions and the outlook, just as we do with the funds rate path. Indeed, the economic conditions and outlook that would support reducing the degree of monetary accommodation by gradually raising the fed funds rate would also tend to support slowly reducing the size of the balance sheet, which would result when reinvestments end. Thus, in my view, the level of the fed funds rate might be used as a guide to when to end reinvestments – in this case, both our fed funds rate path and our balance-sheet policy would be data dependent. I would be comfortable ending reinvestments after we have a few more funds rate increases under our belt, perhaps when the funds rate has reached 1 percent or so. This is my interpretation of \"well underway,\" but as Chair Yellen indicated in her December press briefing, the FOMC has not given further guidance on this.4\n\nThe final phrase in the monetary policymakers' lexicon I'd like to discuss is the FOMC's \"symmetric inflation goal.\"\n\nSymmetric Inflation Goal\n\nThe FOMC's statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy serves to clarify the FOMC's framework for making monetary policy decisions.5 I view the statement as a very important part of the Committee's communications arsenal. This statement makes explicit the FOMC's numerical goal for inflation over the longer run. This goal is 2 percent inflation, as measured by the year-over-year change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE inflation. Since first being issued in January 2012, the statement has been reaffirmed at the Committee's annual organizational meetings each January.\n\nGiven that it lays out the FOMC's decision-making framework, I view the statement on long-run goals as somewhat constitutional in nature, but periodically, the FOMC and its Subcommittee on Communications appropriately consider whether there are any changes that might be beneficial in clarifying the framework.\n\nOne such change was made this January when the FOMC clarified that the 2 percent inflation target is symmetric. As indicated in the statement, the Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or persistently below the goal. Persistent one-side misses can be of concern because in many models of the inflation process, current and past deviations from the target are informative about future inflation. Another factor affecting the outlook for inflation is inflation expectations. Persistent misses on either side of the goal can be of concern because they might ultimately cause inflation expectations to become unanchored, thereby undermining the achievement of the Fed's longer-run inflation objective.\n\nThese concerns may or may not rise to the level of necessitating a policy action. The FOMC has to balance a number of considerations in setting policy to promote its dual mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability. As we've discussed, policy action is tied to the medium-run outlook. If the one-sided misses have changed the outlook for inflation and employment materially, then policy might need to respond in order to foster attainment of our goals. In other cases, even if inflation were running above or below the target, no policy response might be called for because the outlook continued to be for inflation to return to 2 percent over time and for the economy to be at full employment.\n\nAn example is the period in late 2006 and early 2007. The minutes of the December 2006 FOMC meeting indicate that the economy was expected to expand at a moderate pace and all FOMC participants were concerned about inflation.6 Nearly all participants felt that the core measures of inflation were \"uncomfortably high.\" Part of the increase in both headline and core inflation reflected earlier rises in energy and other commodity prices. The FOMC continued to forecast that core inflation would move lower over time as the effects of higher energy and commodity prices passed through and growth moderated. They expressed concern that if inflation didn't moderate as expected, there would be significant costs if inflation expectations drifted up. But on balance, these concerns did not elicit a change in the fed funds rate, although there was one dissent in favor of raising rates in light of the inflation outlook. Similarly, in meetings in early 2007, the Committee was concerned about inflation but the forecast was for inflation to moderate and there was no policy response.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Great Recession and our experience with low inflation, I have not heard many people say that they believe that the Fed interprets its inflation target as a ceiling, and is only concerned about misses on the upside. Nonetheless, I do think the change the Committee made in January to clarify the symmetric nature of the inflation target was a positive step toward improved transparency and communications.\n\nAnd I hope that my remarks today helped to clarify for you my own interpretation of four catch-phrases in the monetary policymaker's lexicon: data dependent, gradual normalization, well underway, and symmetric inflation goal. Thank you for your attention."

            "content": "I thank the National Association for Business Economics for organizing this session and giving me the opportunity to discuss the outlook for the U.S. economy and monetary policy. The views I’ll present today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the FOMC.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\n\nAt its December meeting held about two weeks ago, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point, bringing the range to one quarter of a percent to one half of a percent. Much public attention was focused on this decision, which was the first change in the policy rate in 7 years and the first rate increase in 9-1/2 years. The increase in the rate from essentially zero recognizes the considerable progress the economy has made since the Great Recession, which officially ended more than six years ago. It also reflects the FOMC’s outlook that the economy will improve further, supported by monetary policy that continues to be quite accommodative even after the December increase.\n\nThe decision in December was based on an assessment of both realized and expected progress toward the FOMC’s congressionally mandated objectives of maximum employment and price stability. To make such an assessment, the Committee looks at a wide range of economic information – the official economic statistical releases and financial market indicators, as well as the information I and other FOMC participants garner by speaking with business contacts in our regions. When the FOMC says its decisions are “data-dependent,” I view this as shorthand for this more comprehensive process of parsing economic and financial information to determine current economic conditions, and then assessing what that information implies about the economic outlook and the risks around that outlook. Thus, “data dependent” policymaking does not mean that policy will react to every short-run change in the data, but rather that policy will react to changes in the medium-run outlook with respect to the Committee’s monetary policy goals as informed by changes in economic conditions.\n\nSo let’s discuss the outlook. Supported by extraordinary monetary policy action, economic fundamentals have strengthened, and in the face of various shocks, the economy has been resilient enough to sustain a moderate pace of growth over the past six years. Of course, over this expansion, the pattern of growth has not been smooth. It has varied over time and over sectors. The same was true last year, yet U.S. growth is estimated to have increased at an average pace of about 2-1/4 percent over the first three quarters of 2015.\n\nConsumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of output, has been an important driver of growth – indeed, motor vehicle sales have been particularly strong. Growth in personal income, reflecting progress in the labor market, and continued improvement in household balance sheets have supported this spending. Although stock prices changed little, on net, in 2015, the cumulative increase in stock prices since the financial crisis ended is significant. Households lost $13 trillion in net worth during the Great Recession, but now thanks to the cumulative increase in stock and house prices, households have recovered that loss and have added another $18 trillion in net worth to their balance sheets.\n\nLower energy prices have also boosted households’ purchasing power. While, on net, lower oil prices will be a positive for U.S. economic growth over the medium run, in the near term, the drop in oil prices has been a drag on investment in the domestic energy sector and its suppliers. Investment in drilling and mining equipment is likely to continue to decline for a few more quarters, but outside of energy-related sectors, business investment in equipment and intellectual property continues to grow moderately.\n\nManufacturing, aside from motor vehicles, has been one of the soft spots in the economy. Lower oil prices have led to a pullback in manufacturing related to the energy sector. The appreciation in the value of the U.S. dollar over the past year has also weighed on firms with international exposure. Dollar appreciation reflects both the expectation that economic growth in the U.S. will continue to be stronger than growth abroad, as well as projected interest rate differentials between the U.S. and foreign economies. A stronger dollar means better terms of trade for U.S. consumers and businesses, which is a positive for a growing economy in the longer run. But in the near term, slower growth in our trading partners and the dollar appreciation are drags on U.S. export growth, and I expect net exports to be a negative influence on real GDP growth for somewhat longer. However, I expect both drags to lessen over time and to be outweighed by growth in other sectors, including consumer spending, as well as housing, which has picked up over the past year. Fiscal policy will also make a modestly positive contribution to growth.\n\nI anticipate that growth over the fourth quarter of last year and through this year will be at an above-trend pace in the 2.5 to 2.75 percent range. My estimate of longer-run growth is 2.25 percent, which is at the upper end of the 1.8 percent to 2.3 percent range among FOMC participants. Many factors, including trend labor force participation, structural productivity growth, and technological innovation, affect the nation’s longer-run growth potential. There is considerable uncertainty around estimates of potential growth, and economists have been revising down their estimates of potential growth almost every year since the Great Recession started. The implication is that even though the economy has been growing at a relatively moderate pace over the expansion, that pace has been sufficient to generate significant cumulative improvements in the labor market.\n\nIt is good to remember how far we have come. Over the past six years, the unemployment rate has been halved, falling from a high of 10 percent in October 2009 to 5 percent in November 2015. Nonfarm payrolls are now about 4-1/2 million above their previous peak before the Great Recession. More than 2 million jobs were added over the first 11 months of last year, an average of over 200,000 jobs per month. This amount is considerably stronger than the 75,000 to 120,000 jobs per month range that economists currently estimate would be enough to keep the unemployment rate constant.\n\nA broad array of other labor market indicators have improved significantly over the past few years, although they are not quite back to pre-recession levels. These measures include the long-term unemployment rate, as well as the unemployment rate that includes discouraged workers and part-time workers who would rather work full-time. Despite the improvement in labor markets, so far we have not seen a broad-based acceleration in wages. But signs point to firming, and as labor markets continue to improve, I expect to see some broader acceleration in compensation.\n\nAlthough there continue to be some longer-run challenges facing the labor market, in my view, the totality of evidence suggests that the economy is at or very nearly at the Fed’s mandated monetary policy goal of maximum employment. With economic growth resuming at an above-trend pace, I expect to see further improvement in the labor market.\n\nIn addition to maximum employment, the other part of the Fed’s dual mandate is price stability. Inflation has been below the Fed’s 2 percent goal for some time. Headline inflation, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, was about 0.4 percent over the 12 months ending in November. Excluding food and energy prices, which tend to be volatile, so-called core inflation has been running at about 1.3 percent. Low inflation partly reflects the transitory effects of the sharp decline in oil and other commodity prices since mid-2014, as well as the appreciation of the dollar, which has held down the prices of nonpetroleum imports into the U.S.\n\nRecent readings on several measures of underlying inflation like the core, trimmed mean, and median CPI have been moving higher. For example, the year-over-year change in the Cleveland Fed’s median CPI measure moved up from 2.2 percent at the beginning of 2015 to 2.5 percent in September, October, and November. There is considerable uncertainty around any inflation forecast, but analysis by the Cleveland staff and others suggests that core measures of inflation can improve forecasts of headline inflation at least over some time horizons; in some cases, the improvement is statistically significant.\n\nInflation expectations are an important factor shaping the inflation outlook. As Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen noted in her December press conference, in the Committee’s view, longer-run inflation expectations remain well-anchored. I agree with this assessment. The movements in survey-based measures of inflation expectations have been small, and the low levels of market-based measures of inflation compensation likely reflect liquidity effects, changes in inflation risk premiums, and the sharp move in oil prices.\n\nI expect headline PCE inflation to remain low in the near term, but as the expansion continues and as the effects of the declines in energy and other commodity prices and the appreciation of the dollar wane, I am reasonably confident that inflation will gradually return to our 2 percent goal over the medium run.\n\nOf course, there are risks around any economic forecast, and mine is no exception. I see the risks as balanced and not overly large. On the downside, the dollar could appreciate more than I’ve built into my forecast, perhaps reflecting the divergent paths for economic growth and monetary policy abroad relative to the U.S., or oil prices could continue to decline rather than stabilize. Both of these could dampen growth in the trade and industrial sectors and put more downward pressure on inflation than in my baseline forecast. On the upside, lower oil prices may buoy consumer spending more than I anticipate, and accommodative monetary policy combined with an improving economy may lead to more-than-anticipated upward pressure on inflation over the medium run. Although many analysts have been focusing on downside inflation risks, analysis by the Cleveland staff shows that over the last 15 years historical forecast errors from several highly regarded inflation forecasting models have skewed to the upside; that is, the models have underestimated actual inflation.1\n\nMy economic outlook is dependent on appropriate monetary policy, so let me turn to that now.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nIt is well accepted that monetary policy needs to be forward looking. Because monetary policy affects the economy with a lag, it was clear that rates would need to begin moving up from zero before our monetary policy goals had been fully met. Since March, the FOMC has said that two criteria would need to be satisfied before it would be appropriate to raise the federal funds rate from zero: further improvement in the labor market and reasonable confidence that inflation would move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term. In December, the Committee judged that these two criteria had been met and raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points. It implemented this change by raising the interest rate it pays on reserve balances that banks and other depository institutions hold at the Fed, supported by overnight and term reverse repurchase agreements, which are available to a broader array of counterparties.\n\nI fully supported the FOMC’s December action: Based on the economic outlook, I thought it was prudent to take the first step on the path of gradual normalization of interest rates.\n\nMore important for macroeconomic performance than the initial rate increase is the expected future path of policy because expectations about the future policy path can affect today’s economic decisions. The actual path the fed funds rate will follow will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming information, but according to the FOMC’s current assessment of the outlook, monetary policy is expected to remain accommodative for some time to come, with rates expected to move up only gradually to more normal levels.\n\nOf course, in the aftermath of the Great Recession there is some uncertainty about what that “normal” level of interest rates is. If the potential growth rate of the economy over the longer run has moved lower, as many economists estimate it has, that means the longer-run level of the fed funds rate consistent with price stability and maximum employment would also be lower than it was in earlier periods. But estimates of long-run growth are imprecise and subject to revision, so this means there is considerable uncertainty around this neutral fed funds rate as well.\n\nOne benefit of a gradual approach to normalization is that it will allow us to recalibrate policy over time as some of the uncertainties surrounding the longer-term level of interest rates, the economy’s potential growth rate, and the longer-run unemployment rate are resolved. At the same time, starting on the gradual normalization path now helps ensure that policy doesn’t lag too far behind the economy. Were that to happen, it might require raising rates more steeply in order to promote attainment of our monetary policy goals over the medium run. Starting on the gradual normalization path also helps to mitigate any potential for building risks to financial stability stemming from excessive leverage or from investors taking on risks they are ill-equipped to manage in a search for yield\n\nIn addition to some of the uncertainty around the longer-run steady state of the economy, it bears remembering that our economic forecasting models are, by necessity, simplifications. The economy is dynamic and can be hit by various shocks that might lead to changes in the medium-run outlook for employment and inflation to which policy would want to respond. Indeed, the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections, aka the SEP, provides information on average historical errors across a range of forecasts and these show that the confidence bands around forecasts tend to be wide. For example, the 70 percent confidence interval around a forecast of CPI inflation one year out is about plus or minus 1 percentage point. Note that because there is uncertainty around the outlook, there is also uncertainty around the FOMC’s policy path. If the economy’s evolution turns out to be different from what we currently anticipate, our policy path may well have to deviate from what our current expectation is. I don’t view this as problematic – we want policy to respond appropriately to changes in the outlook.\n\nI believe the SEP and its dot plot of each FOMC participant’s fed funds rate projection give a good sense of the participants’ current assessment of the appropriate path of policy going forward. As can be seen in the December projections, the majority of FOMC participants believe it will be appropriate over the next couple of years for the level of the fed funds rate to lie below the level of the longer-run federal funds rate. Across participants, this longer-run level ranges from 3 to 4 percent, with a median projection of 3.5 percent. The evolution of the FOMC’s dot plot over meetings to come will provide the public with information on how participants think monetary policy should appropriately respond to changes in the outlook. Thus, I view the SEP as having an important role to play in monetary policy communications.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, the economy has made substantial progress toward the Fed’s goals of maximum employment and price stability – enough progress that in December the FOMC moved its target federal funds rate up by 25 basis points from essentially zero, where it had stood for 7 years. Even with this increase, monetary policy is expected to remain accommodative for some time to come and will continue to support the expansion. I believe this first step on a gradual path toward more normal policy should be viewed as welcome news. It is an indication of monetary policymakers’ confidence that the economic progress we have seen in recent years will continue."

            "content": "Good morning. As the central bank of the United States, the Federal Reserve has a strong interest in fostering a well-functioning payment system. In my brief time this morning, I will answer three broad questions about the collaborative initiatives being led by the Federal Reserve working with private-sector stakeholders. These initiatives are aimed at improving the U.S. payment system’s speed, efficiency, access, and security. As always, the views I’ll present today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe first question one might ask is, “Why is there a need to improve the U.S. payment system?” There has been a lot of talk of late about the need to improve the infrastructure of the U.S. Mostly this has referred to things like highways, bridges, railroads, aviation, and water treatment, all of which play an important role in fostering economic growth and development. I think we should also consider the U.S. payment system a critical part of the infrastructure of this country. A modern payment system is not a luxury. It is a necessary part of a vibrant economy.\n\nThe current payment system in the U.S. is meeting the immediate need of moving payments from payer to payee. It is good to remember that the current system is supporting an $18 trillion economy. In 2012, over 120 billion non-cash, non-wire-transfer payments, valued at almost $175 trillion, were made in the U.S.1 There is a long history of payment-system innovation in this country, including the move from paper check to check imaging and electronic presentment, as well as the advent of Internet and mobile banking. Nonetheless, the payments landscape has been rapidly changing over recent years, and the U.S. payment system is at a crossroads. It is a fragmented patchwork of payment vehicles and providers, often lacking interoperability with one another or the ability to combine invoice information with a payment. The complexity of the payment system, involving incumbent providers, new entrants, and end users, makes it harder to coordinate payment innovations. Thus, even as the payment system has grown in complexity, it has not kept up with the evolving expectations and demands of end-user businesses and consumers. Nor has it kept up with developments in other countries that have taken steps to modernize their payment systems.\n\nMuch of the change in the payment system landscape has been driven by the rapid evolution of technology. Higher-speed computers and mobile devices have enabled the rapid development of e-commerce, which has changed the nature of both retail and business-to-business commerce. Consumers and businesses are demanding faster payments, both domestic payments and cross-border payments. Indeed, maybe the best indication that consumers and businesses want faster payments is that they are willing to pay for speed. According to analysis commissioned by the Federal Reserve, about a third of consumers and three-quarters of businesses are willing to pay a fee for payments that offer faster availability to the payee.2 In addition to meeting customer demand, a modernized payment system could have an added societal benefit of bringing the unbanked and underbanked into the financial mainstream. It could also help low-income households, small businesses, and others who need to closely manage their finances to gain faster access to their funds.\n\nAssessing these trends, the Federal Reserve and a diverse set of industry stakeholders have come to agree that the U.S. payment system needs to evolve further and faster to support the changing nature of commerce, keep pace with the global economy, meet the changing needs of end users, and address new and ongoing threats to safety and security. An improved payment system will contribute to public confidence, economic growth, and global competitiveness.\n\nGiven that we see a need to modernize the payment system, a second question comes to mind: “What approach is the Federal Reserve taking to facilitate the move to a faster, more efficient, ubiquitous, and secure payment system?” Earlier this year, the Federal Reserve Board and Reserve Banks published a paper entitled “Strategies for Improving the U.S. Payment System.”3 This paper communicates our desired outcomes for the payment system and outlines the strategies and tactics that the Federal Reserve is pursuing, in collaboration with stakeholders, to help the country achieve these outcomes. As indicated in the “Strategies” paper, there was a lot of work that preceded the current initiative. In 2002 and in 2012, the Fed undertook gap and opportunity assessments of the payments environment, seeking and receiving considerable input from the public on where the payment system was lagging and where it could be improved. That work laid the foundation for the current initiative, which seeks to achieve five outcomes: (1) a payment system that offers a safe and faster electronic solution for making a variety of personal and business payments, which is ubiquitous and available on demand; (2) a payment system that is secure and resilient, and so one in which the public can be highly confident; (3) a payment system that is efficient and offers better value to consumers and businesses; (4) a payment system that offers a more convenient, cost-effective, and timely way to make cross-border payments; and (5) a payment system that has been improved via a collaborative process involving a broad array of payment participants.\n\nThe collaborative approach the Fed is pursuing follows on from the comprehensive stakeholder engagement we undertook in 2012 to assess the payments landscape. Most of those who commented on the consultative paper that summarized the Fed’s findings strongly supported the Fed’s continuing to serve as a convener of payment-system stakeholders and as a catalyst for collaboration.5 Comprehensive improvement of the system for making payments end-to-end will require a comprehensive approach based on collaboration among and actions from a diverse set of payment stakeholders, including traditional and nontraditional payment providers, technology companies, the government, and end users.\n\nI should note that the approach the Fed is taking to support and guide these various parties to work together on strategies to improve the payment system differs somewhat from the approach taken in other countries, some of which have officially mandated changes to speed the adoption of more efficient payments. For example, the Faster Payments Service launched in the United Kingdom in 2008 was implemented by the private sector by request of the government.6 The New Payments Platform currently being built in Australia, with expected launch date in mid-2017, was an industry-based solution proposed after the Reserve Bank of Australia, that country’s central bank, undertook a strategic review of payment innovation and published strategic objectives it expected the payment system to meet.7 The Fed does not have the power to mandate a solution, nor could we implement meaningful payment improvement on our own. We recognize that many payment innovations have come from the industry. So the Fed is taking a leadership role as a catalyst to spur a private-sector solution that will align private-sector interests with those of the public. This is consistent with the Fed’s responsibility to foster a well-functioning payment system for the public benefit. We believe our collective and collaborative approach to payment-system improvement will increase the probability of successful outcomes by encouraging ubiquitous access and widespread adoption of new payment-system capabilities. Note that the Fed’s approach does not preempt or compete with other efforts already being undertaken by the industry, one of which is The Clearing House’s multiyear project to build a real-time payment system for all U.S. financial institutions.8 And it does not mean that the Fed will halt efforts to improve the efficiency of the payment services we ourselves are providing. In fact, we are acting to speed up settlements on our National Settlement Service, promoting greater use of same-day ACH capabilities, and considering other enhancements to our services that will have a positive impact in the near term.\n\nThis brings me to the third and final question you may be asking yourselves: “What’s been accomplished so far on the payment system improvement initiative?” I am happy to report that since the “Strategies” paper was published earlier this year, there has been considerable progress. First, we have appointed some able leaders of the efforts. Gordon Werkema, who presented at the conference yesterday, is our Payments Strategy Director, overseeing the initiative. We have also established two task forces that will work toward proposed solutions to the goals outlined in the “Strategies” paper: One task force is focused on faster payments and the other on the security of payments. Our Faster Payments Strategy Leader, Sean Rodriguez, chairs the Faster Payments Task Force, and our Payments Security Strategy Leader, Todd Aadland, chairs the Secure Payments Task Force. These three leaders have worked tirelessly to build up wide task-force memberships representing the diverse stakeholders with an interest in the payment system. At last count, the Faster Payments Task Force has 328 members, and the Secure Payments Task Force has 180 members. I would encourage you to take a look at the breadth and depth of the current task-force memberships on our web page FedPaymentsImprovement.org. You’ll see that there are representatives of financial institutions of all sizes, payments networks, trade associations, technology companies, business end users and consumers, and a small number of government officials. You’ll also notice that members of The Clearing House, likely several people in this room, serve on each task force. These task forces have chosen steering committees and have set up a framework for ensuring that task-force decisions and work products have broad support across members; work streams are now underway.\n\nThe Faster Payments Task Force has completed and gathered public comment on a draft set of criteria that will be used to assess whether proposed alternative approaches will be effective in delivering a safe and ubiquitous faster-payments capability. These criteria fall into six categories: ubiquity, efficiency, safety, speed, legal considerations, and governance. The criteria are not meant to be a set of minimum requirements. Many of the criteria may involve a tradeoff, for example, speed vs. safety. The criteria are intended to differentiate the effectiveness of solution proposals across many dimensions. The effort is on track to finalize these criteria in coming months. Work is also progressing on defining a process for encouraging the best ideas on faster payments to come forward and for assessing proposals against the effectiveness criteria.\n\nThe Secure Payments Task Force has also begun its work, focusing not only on the security of the future faster payment system, but also on the security of the current payment system. It has provided input to the Faster Payments Task Force on the effectiveness criteria pertaining to security against which a faster payment solution should be assessed. These include identity management, authentication, and ways to secure sensitive information as it travels through the payment system. Regarding the current payment system, the Secure Payments Task Force is considering better methods to share and analyze fraud and cyber-threat information. Another role of the task force is advising the Fed on ways we could improve security in the payments areas in which we are already involved, including determining priorities for developing and setting payment-security standards in these areas, and identifying issues related to payment-system security and resiliency that would benefit from additional research. Work is currently underway to determine high-priority areas for which work groups will be formed in the next few months.\n\nI hope that you can see from this brief overview that in just a short period of time a lot has been accomplished. But we all recognize that there is still much more to do. The Federal Reserve is committed to facilitating these collaborative efforts with payment stakeholders on behalf of the public, because at the end of the day, the promise of a ubiquitous, faster, secure payment system is worth it."

            "content": "Chris, thank you for that kind introduction and for your service as chair of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s Board of Directors. And thanks to the City Club for the opportunity to speak today to so many of Cleveland’s business leaders. Since coming to Cleveland last year, I have made it a point to learn more about the city’s many important institutions, and the City Club of Cleveland is certainly a leader among them. It is an honor for me to be included in your list of very distinguished speakers. For more than 100 years, the City Club has fostered the free and open exchange of ideas. It sees value in bringing together people with diverse viewpoints for a civil discussion of a wide variety of topics. The City Club’s commitment to free speech in promoting a well-informed community is praiseworthy public service.\n\nAlthough it might not be apparent, the City Club and the Federal Reserve have several things in common. Like the City Club, the Federal Reserve System is over 100 years old, and it, too, is committed to public service. At meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee, the body within the Fed that is charged with setting monetary policy, my colleagues and I engage in a free and open exchange of views. In our case, the topics covered aren’t as wide ranging as those discussed at the City Club; we focus on the economy and monetary policy. By design, the discussions at our meetings contain a mosaic of economic information and analysis from all parts of the country. I believe this ability to share what are sometimes diverse views on the state of the economy and policy is one of the strengths of the Federal Reserve System. It allows us to work toward a better-informed consensus on monetary policy to promote the Fed’s congressionally mandated goals of price stability and maximum employment.\n\nLike the City Club, the Fed sees value in a well-informed public, and we feel an obligation to explain our policy decisions so that the public and its elected representatives can hold us accountable for those decisions. So today, before we move on to the question and answer portion of the program, which is a highlight of any speaking engagement at the City Club, I would like to offer my perspectives on the economy and monetary policy. As I just mentioned, while the Committee comes to a consensus policy decision, there can be a diversity of views around the FOMC table, so I want to note that the views I’ll present today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\n\nIt may not come as news to you that at its October meeting, the FOMC decided to maintain the target for our policy rate – the federal funds rate – at essentially zero. The Committee reached this decision based on an assessment of both realized and expected progress toward our objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. To make such an assessment, the Committee looks at a wide range of economic information – the official economic statistical releases and financial market indicators, as well as the information I and other FOMC participants garner by speaking with business contacts in our regions, including members of our Boards of Directors and advisory groups. When the FOMC says its decisions are “data-dependent,” this is really shorthand for this more comprehensive process of parsing economic and financial information, and assessing what it implies about the current state of the economy, the economic outlook, and the risks around that outlook. The FOMC will be doing this same type of analysis at our next meeting in mid-December. We will be looking at all the incoming information between now and then to see if it supports the FOMC’s expectation that the economy will continue to grow at a pace sufficient to generate some further improvement in labor markets and a gradual return of inflation to our target of 2 percent over the medium run.\n\nGrowth\n\nThere is no denying that the U.S. economy has come a long way since the darkest days of the global financial crisis and the Great Recession,which officially ended more than six years ago. Supported by extraordinary monetary policy action, economic fundamentals have strengthened, and in the face of various shocks, the economy has been resilient enough to sustain a moderate pace of growth over the past six years.\n\nOf course, over this expansion, the pattern of growth has not been smooth. It has varied over time and over sectors, and 2015 was no exception. We began this year with a slowdown in output growth to less than 1 percent at an annual rate. The slowdown mainly reflected temporary factors, including severe winter weather and labor disputes at West Coast ports. As those temporary factors abated, we saw growth rebound sharply to almost 4 percent in the second quarter, only to fall back to 1.5 percent in the third quarter. That slowdown largely reflected a sharp pullback in the rate at which firms were adding to their inventories from an unsustainably strong pace in the first half of the year. A better gauge of growth in demand is final sales adjusted for inflation. These grew at a solid 3.0 percent in the third quarter, suggesting that the economy still has solid underlying momentum.\n\nThe driver of growth this year has been consumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of output. And when I say “driver,” you can take that literally. Consumers have been purchasing vehicles, especially light trucks, in very high volumes, higher than before the recession. Consumer spending on other durable goods and services has also been growing at a solid pace. Growth in personal income and continued improvement in household balance sheets have supported this spending. At a national level, house prices have recovered to levels seen before the crisis, adding to the wealth of homeowners, and we’ve seen a gradual pickup in housing activity, including sales and construction. Fewer households are underwater on their mortgages and mortgage delinquencies are down. Although stock prices are little changed, on net, so far this year, the cumulative increase in stock prices since the crisis is significant. Households lost $13 trillion in net worth over the Great Recession, but now thanks to the cumulative increase in stock and house prices, households have recovered that loss and have added another $18 trillion in net worth to their balance sheets.\n\nLower energy prices have also boosted household purchasing power. Oil prices are down about $40 per barrel from a year ago and gasoline is currently running about $2.30 per gallon, 80 cents lower than a year ago. The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates that the drop in gasoline prices this year has saved the average household about $700, and it is projecting that expenditures on home heating oil will be 25 percent lower this winter than last.\n\nWhile, on net, lower oil prices will be a positive for U.S. economic growth over the medium run, in the near term, the drop in oil prices has been a drag on investment in the domestic energy sector and its suppliers. This is affecting growth in certain regions of the country, including parts of eastern Ohio. Investment in drilling and mining equipment is likely to continue to decline for a few more quarters, but outside of energy-related sectors, business investment in equipment and intellectual property continues to grow moderately.\n\nManufacturing, aside from motor vehicles, has been one of the soft spots in the economy. Lower oil prices have led to a pullback in manufacturing related to the energy sector. The appreciation in the value of the U.S. dollar over the past year has also weighed on firms with international exposure. Dollar appreciation reflects the expectation that economic growth in the U.S. will continue to be stronger than growth abroad. A stronger dollar means better terms of trade for U.S. consumers and businesses, which is a positive for a growing economy in the longer run. But in the near term, slower growth in our trading partners and the dollar appreciation are drags on U.S. export growth, and I expect net exports to be a negative influence on real GDP growth for somewhat longer. The good news is that recent changes in the value of the dollar and oil prices haven’t been as sharp, so I expect both drags to lessen over time and to be outweighed by growth in other sectors, including consumer spending and housing.\n\nYou may recall that in August there was an episode of significant volatility in financial markets and a tightening in credit conditions: stock prices fell and credit spreads rose. These financial market developments appeared to have been touched off by concerns about the prospects for growth in China and other emerging market economies. Since then, volatility has subsided and equity markets have stabilized. As the FOMC indicated in its October statement, some of the downside risks related to global economic and financial developments have diminished. But the possibility of a sharper-than-anticipated decline in global growth remains a risk to the outlook, and we will continue to monitor for signs of spillovers to the U.S. economy.\n\nOne question is whether the softening we saw in U.S. growth in the third quarter is signaling a more persistent slowdown in momentum that changes the medium-run outlook, which is the relevant time horizon for monetary policy. My answer is no. The resiliency of the economy through the episode in August, as well as the strength in final sales in the third quarter, suggests to me that there continues to be positive economic momentum. I anticipate that after the weak third quarter, growth will pick up over the rest of this year and next, to an above-trend pace in the 2.5 to 2.75 percent range. I recently revised down my estimate of longer-run growth to 2.25 percent, a quarter of a percentage point lower than my previous estimate. My revision reflects the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ recent downward revisions to past productivity growth.\n\nMany factors, including trend labor force participation, structural productivity growth, and technological innovation, affect the nation’s longer-run growth potential, and there is considerable uncertainty around estimates of potential growth. In fact, it is noteworthy that economists have been revising down their estimates of potential growth almost every year since the Great Recession started. For example, in 2008, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that potential growth between 2008 and 2013 would average 2.5 percent, well above its current estimate of 1.5 percent for that same time period. Similarly, over time, FOMC participants have lowered their projections for longer-run growth. The FOMC began releasing these longer-run projections in January 2009. At that time, the central tendency of the participants’ projections of longer-run GDP growth was 2.5 to 2.7 percent. In the projections released in September, the central tendency was down to 1.8 to 2.2 percent.\n\nThe implication is that even though the economy has been growing at a relatively moderate pace over the expansion, that pace has been sufficient to generate significant cumulative improvements in the labor market.\n\nLabor Markets\n\nIt is good to remember how far we have come. Over the past six years, the unemployment rate has been halved, falling from a high of 10 percent in October 2009 to 5.0 percent this October. It’s down over half of a percentage point since the end of last year. Nonfarm payrolls are now more than 4 million above their previous peak before the Great Recession. More than 2 million jobs have been added this year, and these have been full-time jobs. Last Friday, we learned that following softer gains in August and September, firms added a very robust 271,000 jobs in October. So far this year, payroll gains have averaged a little more than 200,000 jobs per month. As we often say, we shouldn’t read too much into one month’s number given the month-to-month variation in these readings and the fact that there are still revisions to come. That was true of the softer numbers in August and September, but it’s just as true of the outsized gain in October, which I doubt will be repeated in November. It’s better to smooth through the volatility: over the past three months, firms added an average of 187,000 jobs per month. This is somewhat slower than the pace seen earlier in the year, but given the cumulative gains that have been made on the job front and the level of employment growth that is consistent with full employment over the longer run, we should be expecting payroll job growth to slow.\n\nEconomists currently estimate that monthly payroll growth in the 75,000 to 120,000 range would be enough to keep the unemployment rate constant. This is lower than in the past because labor force participation rates have been trending down with the aging of the population and the increase in college enrollments. But notice that this means that even the softer average monthly gain of 145,000 in August and September is enough to put downward pressure on the unemployment rate.\n\nA broad array of other labor market indicators have improved significantly over the past few years, although they are not quite back to pre-recession levels. These measures include the long-term unemployment rate, as well as the unemployment rate that includes discouraged workers and part-time workers who would rather work full-time. Despite the improvement in labor markets, so far we have not seen broad-based acceleration in wages. But signs point to firming. Average hourly earnings growth strengthened in October. We have heard from business contacts in our region that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find qualified workers in specific occupations and industries, including construction, IT, and specialized manufacturing. In fact, our construction contacts report that the primary downside risk they face is a shortage of labor, not potentially higher interest rates. There are similar indications from other parts of the country; firms report having to raise wages to attract and retain workers in these occupations. The recent contract deal at General Motors includes salary increases in the 3 to 4 percent range and higher entry-level wages. As labor markets continue to improve, I expect to see some broader acceleration in compensation.\n\nIn my view, the totality of evidence suggests that the economy is at or very nearly at the Fed’s mandated monetary policy goal of maximum employment, and with growth resuming at an above-trend pace, I expect to see further improvement. This isn’t to say that there aren’t longer-term challenges facing the labor market. Workforce development is a key issue. As a country, we want to ensure that people can enter and remain productive members of the labor force, to raise our standards of living and to make us more competitive in the global economy. Monetary policy is not the tool for addressing this important issue, but the Federal Reserve, through its role in promoting community development, is certainly committed to helping identify effective policies and best practices for strengthening and increasing access to education and training. In fact, this past June, the Cleveland, Philadelphia, and Richmond Feds hosted a policy summit that brought together practitioners, researchers, and policymakers working on these issues.\n\nRegional Growth and Labor Markets\n\nAs I mentioned, an important role of a Federal Reserve Bank President is gathering information from Main Street to help inform monetary policy. So let me spend a few minutes on economic developments in the Fourth Federal Reserve District, which encompasses all of Ohio, western Pennsylvania, eastern Kentucky, and the northern panhandle of West Virginia. While our region is quite diverse, the path of economic expansion here has been similar to the nation’s. Regional firms with international exposure, such as the steel industry, continue to struggle. Shale gas production levels remain high but growth in drilling activity has slowed considerably. Auto and auto parts manufacturing represents a significant share of manufacturing in Ohio and Kentucky, and the strength we’ve seen in this sector has helped to offset some of the weaker manufacturing segments.\n\nLike the nation, our region has also seen considerable improvement in labor markets. In Ohio, the unemployment rate has fallen sharply from a peak of 11 percent in December 2009 to 4.5 percent in September, below the national average. Firms have been adding jobs, but at a slower pace than in the nation. Over the past year, the pace of job growth in Ohio has been only half that of the U.S. as a whole. And while U.S. employment is now 3 percent above its pre-recession peak, employment in Ohio is not quite back to that benchmark.\n\nThis slower job growth in the state relative to the nation is not a new phenomenon – it’s been happening since the mid-1990s. It partly reflects the slower population growth and older population in Ohio, as well as Ohio’s higher share of jobs in manufacturing, a sector that has been experiencing a long-run decline in employment. Manufacturing accounts for about 15 percent of private-sector jobs in Ohio, compared to about 10 percent in the U.S. Those shares are down about 7 percentage points since the mid-1990s. As the regional economy becomes less reliant on old-style manufacturing, and more reliant on higher-skilled manufacturing and service-sector jobs in fields such as education and health care, it faces the challenge of ensuring that its population can gain the necessary skills to enter and remain productive members of the modern labor force. So workforce development is a challenge here, just as it is for the nation as a whole.\n\nInflation\n\nIn addition to maximum employment, the other part of the Fed’s dual mandate is price stability. Inflation has been below the Fed’s 2 percent goal for some time. Headline inflation has been running at about a quarter percent so far this year (as measured by the year-over-year percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures). Excluding food and energy prices, which tend to be volatile, so-called core inflation has been running about 1.3 percent. Low inflation partly reflects the transitory effects of the sharp drop in energy prices, as well as the appreciation of the dollar, which makes non-petroleum imports cheaper in the U.S.\n\nIncoming data are consistent with the inflation dynamics that the FOMC has been expecting. As changes in oil prices and the value of the dollar have tempered, the downward pressure on inflation has started to wane. Recent readings on underlying inflation, including the core, trimmed mean, and median CPI measures, have moved up. For example, the year-over-year change in the Cleveland Fed’s median CPI measure rose to 2.5 percent in September. There is considerable uncertainty around any inflation forecast, but analysis by Cleveland staff and others suggests that core measures of inflation can improve forecasts of headline inflation at least over some time horizons; in some cases, the improvement is statistically significant.\n\nInflation expectations are an important factor shaping the inflation outlook, and in my view, inflation expectations remain well-anchored. Survey-based measures of inflation expectations of both consumers and professional forecasters have been stable despite the low readings of actual inflation. These survey measures have historically done well at capturing longer-run trends in inflation and they have been shown to help in forecasting inflation.1 Inflation compensation, measured by the spread between yields on Treasury securities and Treasury inflation-protected securities, so-called TIPS, has moved down a bit, but analysis suggests that this likely reflects liquidity effects and changes in inflation risk premiums more so than changes in inflation expectations. Cleveland Fed staff analysis also suggests that the fall in inflation compensation may be reflecting the sharp drop in energy prices since last year, which might reverse as movements in oil prices moderate.2\n\nI expect inflation to remain low in the near term, but the firming in the core measures, the stability in inflation expectations, the economy’s expected return to above-trend growth, and continued improvement in labor markets are all factors making me reasonably confident that inflation will gradually return to our 2 percent goal over the medium run.\n\nOf course, my economic outlook is dependent on appropriate monetary policy, so let me turn to that now.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nIt is well accepted that monetary policy needs to be forward looking. Because monetary policy affects the economy with a lag, rates will need to begin to move up from their very low level before we have fully reached our goals. The FOMC anticipates that two criteria need to be satisfied before it will be appropriate to raise the federal funds rate: some further improvement in the labor market and reasonable confidence that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term.\n\nIn deciding whether these conditions have been met and whether it is appropriate to raise the target range for the fed funds rate, the FOMC has to balance a number of considerations. My colleagues and I are all committed to promoting the goals of price stability and maximum employment, but we may have different views about realized and anticipated progress toward those goals and about the potential costs and benefits to changes in policy. Given the current stage of the business and policy cycles, I find this diversity neither surprising nor troubling.\n\nIn September and October, the FOMC’s consensus expectation was that labor market conditions will continue to improve and that inflation will return to target over time, but the Committee decided that it was prudent to await further evidence supporting this expectation before lifting off from zero.\n\nMy own assessment is that with the economic progress we’ve made and that I expect to continue, the economy can handle an increase in the fed funds rate. In my view, if economic information continues to come in consistent with the outlook, then there will be a strong case that the conditions for liftoff have been met and it would be prudent for monetary policy to take a step back from the emergency measure of zero interest rates. A small increase in interest rates from zero is not tight monetary policy. And while I would expect some reaction in financial markets to the first move in interest rates in over six years, I wouldn’t expect financial conditions to tighten enough to affect the medium-term outlook.\n\nMore important for macroeconomic performance is the expected path of policy beyond liftoff because expectations about the future path of policy can affect today’s economic decisions. Decisions about the path will depend on incoming information on the economy’s performance, but according to the FOMC’s current assessment of the economic outlook, even after the first rate increase, monetary policy is expected to remain very accommodative for some time to come, with rates expected to move up only gradually to more normal levels.\n\nOf course, in the aftermath of the Great Recession there is some uncertainty about what that “normal” level of interest rates is. If the potential growth rate of the economy over the longer run has moved lower, as many economists estimate, that means the longer-run level of the fed funds rate consistent with price stability and maximum employment is also lower than it was in earlier periods. But estimates of long-run growth are imprecise and subject to revision, so this means there is considerable uncertainty around this neutral fed funds rate as well.\n\nOne benefit of a gradual approach to normalization is that it will allow us to recalibrate policy over time as some of the uncertainties surrounding the longer-term level of interest rates, the economy’s potential growth rate, and the longer-run unemployment rate are resolved. But uncertainty about the longer-run destination is not an argument to delay taking the first step. In fact, in my view, given the economic outlook, starting the process to normalize interest rates will help ensure that we can, indeed, take a gradual approach. Delay risks having to move rates up more steeply in order to promote attainment of our goals over time.\n\nAnother cost of postponing liftoff too long is the potential for building risks to financial stability stemming from excessive leverage or from investors taking on risks they are ill-equipped to manage in a search for yield. The FOMC continues to carefully monitor financial markets for signs of these types of emerging problems. However, we need to acknowledge that leading up to the financial crisis, some of the vulnerabilities of the financial system were not fully recognized by policymakers. Although we have made significant strides since then, there likely remain some gaps in our ability to assess the risks in every part of the financial system. The longer interest rates are maintained at zero in an economy that is getting back to normal, the higher the potential risk to financial stability. This potential cost is one that needs to be considered when determining appropriate policy.\n\nI believe the extraordinary monetary policy actions taken by the FOMC in response to the financial crisis and Great Recession were effective in easing monetary and financial conditions; they kept the Great Recession from turning into another Great Depression. I’d like to ensure that these actions remain a part of the monetary policymakers’ toolkit, available for use if such an unfortunate situation arises again in the future. But, ultimately, how history judges those extraordinary actions will depend on our demonstrating that there is a way out. The time to start that demonstration is quickly approaching.\n\nIn summary, the economy has made considerable progress over the expansion and my medium-run outlook is for above-trend growth, continued improvement in labor markets, and inflation gradually returning to our 2 percent target over the medium run. If incoming economic information continues to support this forecast, then in my view it will be time to take the first step in the policy normalization process. As I’m sure the learned audience at the City Club knows, Jean-Paul Sartre was a famous French philosopher and author. His play “No Exit” is a celebrated contribution to the existentialist literature; it should not be a guidebook for monetary policymakers."

            "content": "I thank President Rosengren and the Boston Fed for the opportunity to participate in this year’s economic conference. This conference series has been a source of valuable discussions and insights over many years, and I’m happy to note that this year’s conference marks number 59 in the series, a remarkable track record. I’m even happier to say that I, myself, haven’t yet reached that milestone – although it does remain a goal of mine!\n\nA discussant’s task is never an easy one. Sometimes it is difficult because of the simple fact that there just isn’t that much in the paper to talk about. Other times it is difficult because the paper is filled with so much interesting material that it inspires a plethora of new thoughts and ideas. In this case, Paul Tucker’s paper definitely falls into the latter camp. If you have not yet had the chance to read the paper, I encourage you to do so. And if you have read the paper, I encourage you to read it again, because more is revealed on each reading.\n\nIn my brief time this morning, I will be able to touch on only some of the important issues that Paul’s paper addresses. My main point is that the principles of sound monetary policymaking can be productively applied to financial stability policymaking. As always, the views I’ll present today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nPaul was asked to address the larger question of whether the objective functions for microprudential supervision and macroprudential supervision differ, and if so, how any conflicts should be resolved. I agree with his conclusion that the two types of supervision need not be in conflict so long as they are situated within a well-designed financial stability framework, or what Paul calls a regime. I would take this a step further and suggest that micro- and macroprudential supervision should work together. As Paul acknowledges, building such a framework is not trivial. But it is the responsibility of public officials to do so, since the costs imposed on society for failing to do so are very large. The difficulty derives not only from the fact that the global financial system is very complex, which means a lot of intellectual ability needs to be brought to the problem, but also because the framework involves institutions. As underscored by the work of Nobel Prize winner Douglass North and others, institutions matter.1 And those institutions necessarily find themselves having to operate within a political economy that needs to be taken into account.\n\nOver the past 50 years, research and practice have increased our understanding of some basic principles that underlie an effective monetary policymaking framework. These include starting with well-articulated and achievable goals, designing features that foster a credible commitment to those goals, and incorporating a mechanism for holding accountable the institution responsible for promoting those goals. In my view, more systematic, less discretionary policymaking, transparency, and clear communication are important features of sound monetary policymaking. I believe that financial stability policymaking can benefit from these same principles and features.\n\nObjectives\n\nThe first principle of effective monetary policymaking is having a well-articulated objective that is achievable with the available tools. Paul starts there too. I particularly like that he articulates the goal of financial stability in terms of the resilience of the financial system. In the U.K., the Financial Services Act 2012 formally established the Financial Policy Committee (FPC) within the Bank of England and charged it to act “to remove or reduce, systemic risks with a view to protecting and enhancing the resilience of the U.K. financial system.”2 In contrast, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 doesn’t mention resilience, but U.S. policymakers might want to consider changing our rhetoric from financial stability to financial resilience. “Stability” gives the impression of being static. But the economy and financial markets are dynamic; they will be hit by shocks and they will respond to those shocks. There will be ups and downs. The goal should not be to thwart all volatility in markets, but rather to limit tail risks. We need to be thinking in terms of the resilience of the financial system to those shocks. As Paul says, “The system must be sufficiently resilient to continue providing the core financial services of payments, credit, and insurance in the face of big shocks.” Another way we might think about the objective is that it chooses a maximum tolerable expected loss from a financial crisis, where the expected loss reflects both the probability of a financial crisis and the cost imposed on the rest of the economy when a crisis-sized shock hits the financial system. Different prudential tools will work on one and/or the other of these two components.\n\nLet me set aside an important issue that Paul addresses in his paper, namely, who should set the resilience standard. Regardless of where that responsibility lies, it is important that the objective be articulated so that the public and its elected representatives understand that there are tradeoffs. Financial systems are able to provide valuable credit, risk-management, and liquidity services to businesses and households because they comprise institutions designed to take on risk and leverage. Even with an optimally designed financial resilience regime, there could be a tradeoff between the average level of economic growth over the longer run and the desired degree of resilience, because risk-taking and risk management are at the heart of the financial system. Indeed, in the U.K., the Financial Services Act recognizes this potential tradeoff and indicates that the act does not authorize the FPC to act in a way that the committee feels is “likely to have a significant adverse effect on the capacity of the financial sector to contribute to the growth of the U.K. economy in the medium or long term.”3\n\nToo high a resilience standard will thwart risk-taking and innovation, which will undermine longer-run economic growth.4 In setting the standard, we need to come to some common understanding about the amount of growth and prosperity we are willing to give up in order to lower the risk to financial stability. In the U.S., people who are 80 years old have lived through two major financial crises (the Depression and the 2008-2009 financial crisis and Great Recession). Is that too many? Would we rather lower the probability of such an event to one every 1,000 years? What would we be willing to give up to do that?\n\nOf course, there may be things we can do to improve the framework that will lower the risk to financial stability without much cost in terms of longer-run growth. If we think of there being a frontier relating the risk to financial stability to the economic return that a well-functioning financial system can provide, then it isn’t hard to imagine that we were operating at a point well off that frontier in the run-up to the crisis, and that improvements in the financial resilience regime could move us onto the frontier without sacrificing growth. However, once we reach that point, we’ll have to make a choice about how much growth we are willing to give up in good times to limit the likelihood of a future financial crisis.\n\nRegardless of which institution chooses the standard of resilience, and therefore the tradeoff between economic growth and the level of systemic risk, the standard will need to be well communicated to get political and public buy-in. That’s going to be a difficult task if you happen to be someone living during the once-in-a-thousand years event, how comforting is it to know that that was a design choice?\n\nSystematic Financial Stability Policymaking and Incentives\n\nNow let’s turn to some of the features that should be included in the regime set up to meet the resilience standard. Paul suggests that one of the key components of a well-designed financial stability regime is dynamic macroprudential policy that is applied systematically. I agree that a systematic approach will be beneficial to financial stability policymaking, just as it is to monetary policymaking.\n\nThe benefit of taking a systematic approach to monetary policy is well established. When monetary policymakers respond in a systematic fashion to incoming information, the public will have a better sense of how policymakers are likely to react to economic developments whether those developments are anticipated or unanticipated so their policy expectations will better align with those of policymakers. This alignment helps households, firms, and financial market participants make better saving, borrowing, investment, employment, and transaction decisions, thereby making monetary policy more effective.\n\nAn additional benefit of a systematic approach is that it provides a mechanism through which policymakers can commit to policies aimed at promoting policy goals over the longer run. That is, being systematic can help alleviate time-inconsistency problems. Note that by systematic policy I do not necessarily mean that monetary policy be set mechanically by a policy rule. Nor do I require the policymaker to be prescient about the shocks that will hit the economy if these were predictable, they would not be “shocks.”\n\nBeing systematic about financial stability policy is perhaps even more important than in the case of monetary policy because of the important role played by incentives those of both private actors and regulators and asymmetric information. The crisis shined a bright light on significant moral hazard problems that exist in financial markets. A financial stability policymaker that is systematic in how it applies its tools to promote attainment of the resilience standard will likely help tame some of the moral hazard problems. For example, systematically applying the resilience standard across the entire financial services landscape will limit regulatory arbitrage one of the unintended consequences of regulating just a portion of the financial system. Applying the resilience standard to all parts of the financial system, while allowing the type of supervision to appropriately vary by the nature of the systemic risk associated with each part, is one component of Paul’s financial stability regime.\n\nRegulators themselves are also subject to incentive problems. Ed Kane, a professor at Boston College, has written extensively on this subject.5 Misaligned incentives need not stem from regulatory capture, which has received some recent attention. Time-inconsistency problems could lead regulators to favor the short run over the long run. Adherence to a systematic approach in applying financial stability policy tools could serve as a commitment device for regulators to focus on long-run goals, but it’s important to have the right tools in order to align regulatory incentives. An important tool in this regard is financial institution resolution. Although, as Paul points out, an improved resolution method for large, complex financial institutions is not a panacea, in my view it is a large positive step. The lack of a credible resolution method meant that during the crisis, in the face of serious distress at a large financial firm, governments faced a dilemma: either rescue the firm and create future moral hazard problems or let the firm fail and risk causing a cascade of other failures. The fact that policymakers had to make these decisions in the heat of the moment using their best judgment based on limited information didn’t help. Without a credible resolution method, it is reasonable to expect that even well-intentioned policymakers will be biased toward bailouts. A resolution method that can be applied systematically can help alleviate this problem.\n\nTransparency, Clear Communication, Independence, and Simplification\n\nA second hallmark of effective monetary policymaking is transparency and clear communication. Of course, clear communication is not without challenges. In the late 1980s and 1990s, the public had a pretty good sense of how the FOMC’s policy would respond to economic developments because after the great inflation of the 1970s, the FOMC became more predictable and systematic in how it reacted to changes in economic activity and inflation.6 The Great Recession required the Fed to behave in a way quite distinct from its past behavior, so the public’s understanding about how policymakers are likely to react to incoming economic information needs to be reestablished.\n\nIn addition to policy effectiveness, transparency in monetary policy is necessary so that the public and elected officials have the ability to hold policymakers accountable for their decisions. The Fed, like many other central banks, has been given independence in setting monetary policy, and this independence has been well documented as yielding more effective policy and better economic outcomes. But accountability must go hand-in-hand with independence. A central bank cannot expect to remain independent from the political process unless it is transparent about the basis for its policy decisions.\n\nA parallel can be drawn with financial stability policy. In the aftermath of the financial crisis, the framework and tools of financial stability policy are still being developed. It will take considerable effort on the part of the financial stability policymaker to explain the tools it will be using and the rationale for its policy decisions. This is likely to be even more challenging than it is for monetary policy because the financial system is complex, with various types of institutions and multiple regulators. In addition, regulators are likely to have more private information on which to base their policy decisions, making it more difficult for the public and elected officials to assess whether the decisions are appropriate ones. Here, I am in full agreement with Paul that while there are some arguments for keeping prudential supervisory information private, I think financial stability policymakers should strive for greater transparency and more disclosure. Similarly, they should require more disclosure from financial firms so that creditors and other market participants can exert market discipline.\n\nThere are good arguments for giving financial stability policymakers a large degree of independence from the political process. If effective monetary policy means taking away the punch bowl just as the party gets going, then effective financial stability policy might mean taking away the punch bowl before the guests have even arrived because the risks to financial stability build up over time and action likely needs to be taken earlier in order to be effective. Contributing to the need for early action is the challenge of having to coordinate policy action across multiple regulatory bodies. If the need for monetary policy to be forward looking is a difficult concept for the public to grasp, the need for financial stability policy to act well before there are clear signs of instability may be even more difficult to explain. In thinking about the design of the financial stability regime, it might behoove policymakers to consider whether it would be better for central banks to keep their monetary policy and financial stability policy discussions separate so as to avoid jeopardizing the independence of monetary policy. Note, however, that in a situation in which financial stability risks are high and growing, the blurring of the line between financial stability goals and monetary policy goals would be high: if we assessed the risks to financial stability to be sufficiently great, achieving our monetary policy goals would be in jeopardy as well.\n\nAnother aspect of regulatory policy that likely makes it hard to explain and hard to monitor is its complexity. Andrew Haldane and Vasileios Madouros have argued that the complexity of the financial landscape does not call for a complex financial regulatory structure, but just the opposite.7 In my view, a sometimes overlooked lesson from the crisis is that regulatory complexity can complicate supervision, risk monitoring, compliance, and enforcement. Given the scope and ever-changing nature of the financial system, regulatory complexity is, to a certain extent, unavoidable. But the tradeoffs should be recognized. For example, it is reasonable to require higher levels of capital to be held against higher-risk assets, but a system of risk weights that is overly granular and complex would be counterproductive. In practice, too much complexity would make it harder for regulators to assess compliance and to determine whether institutions were engaging in some practices merely as a way to hide risk and lower their capital requirements. If regulators have made the rules so complex that they cannot assess compliance, then in practice there are no consequences for firms that fail to meet the standards. Complexity also makes it difficult to monitor the monitors.\n\nBecause the world is very complex, our models are simplifications with many embedded assumptions. A policy that is optimal in one model need not be optimal in another, yet we don’t know which model is the correct representation of the world. Here, we might take another lesson from monetary policy in which a research agenda has documented some of the benefits of policy rules that are robust across various models. Some recent work in economic theory has also shown that simple dynamic contracts can perform approximately as well as optimal contracts, independent of the underlying process for returns.8 Although more work would need to be done, this suggests it is worth exploring whether we would be better off with a much simpler macro- and microprudential supervisory structure that is easier to implement and simpler to govern, one that is approximately right across various models and states of the world even if it is never optimal in any particular model or state.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn his presidential address to the American Finance Association earlier this year, Luigi Zingales asked an important question: “Does finance benefit society?” He pointed out the dissonance between the view of academics, who typically say “yes,” and that of the average American, who is much less certain.9 Luigi argues that academia has an important role to play in ensuring that finance will benefit society. I agree. Academic research can help detect those aspects of financial system design and practices that are beneficial to society and those that are harmful. But major responsibility lies with financial system policymakers, supervisors, and regulators to create a system that is seen by the American public as being beneficial and that truly is. I thank Paul for providing many thoughtful ideas in support of this endeavor."

            "content": "Good afternoon. I thank the Columbus Metropolitan Club for the opportunity to speak with so many of Ohio’s business leaders. I see several Cleveland Fed directors in the audience. I want to thank them and all the attendees for taking time out of your busy schedules to be here today. As the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, I place a high premium on the information I gather from business people like you who are willing to share what you are seeing as you navigate through the ebbs and flows of economic waters. Your insights are enormously helpful to me as I formulate my views on the economy, views that I express when I go to Washington to participate in meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the body within the Fed that sets monetary policy for the nation. More than 100 years ago, Congress designed the Federal Reserve as a decentralized central bank, with 12 Reserve Banks across the country, overseen by the Board of Governors in Washington. The Federal Reserve System’s structure helps ensure that Main Street perspectives are considered around the FOMC table. It is a true strength of the System, and one worth preserving.\n\nBefore we move on to the question and answer part of today’s program, I would like to open with a brief discussion of my economic outlook and monetary policy. As always, the views I’ll present are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\n\nIt has now been over six years since the official start of the economic expansion. Supported by extraordinary monetary policy accommodation, the U.S. economy has made significant progress since the darkest days of the global financial crisis and Great Recession. Underlying economic fundamentals have strengthened, resulting in an economy that has been able to sustain growth at a moderate pace over the past five years.\n\nWe began 2015 with a slowdown in output growth. Much of this year’s slowdown reflected temporary factors, including the harsh winter weather and the labor disputes at ports on the West Coast. Measurement issues also likely played a role. For the past six years or so, output has tended to grow less in the first quarter than in other quarters, and government statisticians are taking steps to improve the methods used to seasonally adjust the numbers.\n\nThe recent monthly economic data, as well as information gleaned from my business contacts, suggest we are seeing a rebound in spending in the second quarter. Although yesterday’s report on retail sales in June was weaker than analysts expected, it came after strong May sales. Consumer spending, which represents about two-thirds of output, picked up in the second quarter, supported by growth in personal income and continued improvement in household balance sheets. Based on projections from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the drop in gasoline prices is estimated to be saving the average household about $700 this year. Perhaps not surprisingly, consumer sentiment is very good, at levels not seen since before the financial crisis and Great Recession.\n\nBusiness sentiment also remains solid, but industrial activity has been weak in recent months. The drop in oil prices compared to a year ago has led to reduced investment and some dislocation in parts of the domestic energy sector, and this is affecting growth in certain regions of the country, including parts of eastern Ohio. But the U.S. is still a net importer of oil, and so the benefits of lower energy prices in terms of consumer, business, and local government spending will ultimately result in a net positive for the U.S. economy.\n\nAnother factor weighing on firms exposed to international trade is the appreciation in the value of the U.S. dollar since last summer. A stronger dollar means better terms of trade for U.S. consumers and businesses, which is a positive for a growing economy in the longer run. But in the near term, dollar appreciation is putting a drag on U.S. export growth. The recent stabilization in energy prices and slowdown in dollar appreciation mean that both drags should lessen over time.\n\nOn balance, I expect that after a weak first quarter, growth will pick up to an above-trend pace over the rest of this year and next, in the 2.75 to 3 percent range. I want to acknowledge there are risks around this forecast. I’ve incorporated a slowing in the pace of growth abroad, including China, but the magnitude of the slowdown remains uncertain. I’m also assuming that the situation in Greece will have a limited impact on the U.S. economy because our direct exposure via trade and banking is limited, Greek debt is held mainly by the public sector rather than private-sector investors, and the European Central Bank has tools to contain spillovers to broader financial markets. The Greek situation remains unresolved, but we had some positive news earlier this week and the risk of a very bad outcome with sizable effects on the global economy is not high enough to change my modal outlook for the U.S. economy of moderate above-trend growth, which will support continued positive developments in labor markets.\n\nOver the past year, the economy has created an average of 245,000 jobs per month, and nonfarm payrolls are now 3-1/2 million above their previous peak before the recession. The unemployment rate is 5.3 percent, down sharply from its peak of 10 percent in 2009, and down three-quarters of a percentage point over the past year. A broad array of other labor market indicators have improved significantly over the past few years, including the long-term unemployment rate and the unemployment rate that includes discouraged workers and part-time workers who would rather work full-time. In addition, we are now beginning to see signs that wage growth is picking up. Year-over-year gains in the Employment Cost Index, a comprehensive measure of wages and benefits, rose from under 2 percent in the first quarter of last year to over 2-1/2 percent in the first quarter of this year. The delay in wage growth shouldn’t be a surprise. Typically, wages tend to accelerate only after we’ve seen sustained improvements in the labor market. Some analysis we’ve done at the Cleveland Fed shows that in the last three expansions, job gains in industries that pay above-average hourly earnings contributed more to total private-sector job gains as the expansions continued on.1\n\nIn my view, the totality of evidence suggests that the economy is at or nearly at the Fed’s mandated monetary policy goal of maximum employment. This isn’t to say that there aren’t longer-term challenges facing the labor market. Workforce development is a key issue. As a country, we want to ensure that people can enter and remain productive members of the labor force, to raise our standards of living and to make us more competitive in the global economy. However, monetary policy is not the tool for addressing this important issue. It is better served by policies focused on strengthening and increasing access to education and training.\n\nHere in Ohio, we have also seen improvements in labor markets since the recession, but there are longer-run challenges as well. The state’s unemployment rate has fallen sharply, from a peak of 11 percent in December 2009 to 5.2 percent in May, which is half of a percentage point lower than a year ago. Firms have been adding jobs. It is true that the pace of job growth in Ohio is slower than in the nation. Over the past year, jobs have been growing somewhat less than 1-1/2 percent in Ohio, compared to over 2 percent in the U.S. as a whole. And while U.S. employment is now 2-1/2 percent higher than its pre-recession peak, employment in Ohio has not quite reached that milestone.\n\nHow should we interpret this performance? It helps to put this into context. First, the pace of job growth in the state is now well above the pace we saw during the last expansion, when employment in Ohio was flat. Second, job growth in the state has been slower than the national pace since the mid-1990s – this is not a new phenomenon related to the Great Recession. It partly reflects slower population growth in Ohio and Ohio’s higher share of jobs in manufacturing, a sector that has been experiencing a long-run decline in employment. Manufacturing accounts for about 15 percent of private-sector jobs in Ohio, compared to about 10 percent in the U.S. Those shares are down about 7 percentage points since the mid-1990s.\n\nWithin this bigger context, we can characterize the improvement in Ohio labor markets over this expansion as being pretty good but, at the same time, recognize that there are longer-run challenges as manufacturing continues to transform itself into a sector with higher-productivity production processes requiring higher-skilled workers.\n\nThe Columbus metro area is generally faring better than other regions in the state. As you know, Columbus benefits greatly from a highly educated workforce and a diversified industry base. This has contributed to broader gains in employment across multiple sectors in the Columbus area and puts the Columbus economy in a stronger position for sustainable growth.\n\nIn addition to maximum employment, the other part of the Fed’s dual mandate is price stability. Inflation has been below the Fed’s 2 percent goal for some time. Headline inflation has been running at about a quarter percent so far this year (as measured by the year-over-year percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures). Excluding food and energy prices, which tend to be volatile, so-called core inflation has been running about 1-1/4 percent. Low inflation partly reflects the sharp drop in energy prices, as well as the appreciation of the dollar, which makes non-petroleum imports cheaper in the U.S. These downward pressures are starting to wane as oil prices and the value of the dollar have started to stabilize. Would I like to see higher inflation numbers? The answer is yes. Am I reasonably confident that inflation will move gradually back to the Fed’s 2 percent objective over time? The answer is also yes. Supporting this view are above-trend economic growth, continued positive developments in labor markets, and the stability in measures of inflation expectations and some of the alternative measures of inflation, like the Cleveland Fed’s median CPI and the Dallas Fed’s trimmed mean PCE inflation. Of course, my economic outlook is dependent on appropriate monetary policy, so let me turn to that now.\n\nMonetary Policy: Timing Isn’t Everything\n\nAs the FOMC has said, in determining the appropriate path of monetary policy, we assess both realized and expected progress toward our dual mandate goals of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. So policy is not on a pre-set course; it depends on our read of what incoming data and economic information mean for our economic outlook and the risks around that outlook.\n\nIt is well accepted that monetary policy needs to be forward looking. Because monetary policy affects the economy with a lag, rates will need to begin to move up from their very low level before we have fully reached our goals. Moreover, with rates having been at zero for a sustained period, there is the potential for increased risks to financial stability from excessive leverage or from investors taking on risks they are ill-equipped to manage in a search for yield. The FOMC continues to carefully monitor financial markets for signs of these types of emerging problems, and so far so good.\n\nThe FOMC anticipates that two criteria need to be satisfied before it will be appropriate to raise the federal funds rate: further improvement in the labor market and reasonable confidence that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term.\n\nAccording to the FOMC’s June economic projections, 15 of 17 participants anticipate that it will be appropriate to begin to move interest rates up sometime this year. My own assessment is that the economy can handle an increase in the fed funds rate. A small increase in interest rates from zero is not tight monetary policy, and with the economic progress we’ve made and that I expect to continue, monetary policy can take a step back from the emergency measure of zero interest rates.\n\nBut I understand that others might like to see more confirming evidence before commencing a rate increase. My colleagues and I on the FOMC are all committed to promoting our dual mandate goals of price stability and maximum employment, but we may have different views about realized and anticipated progress toward those goals and about the potential costs and benefits to changes in policy with respect to achieving those goals.\n\nWhile financial market participants are particularly focused on the timing of the first rate increase, when it comes to monetary policy, timing isn’t everything. The FOMC meets eight times a year, and the difference in lifting off from a zero interest rate a meeting or two earlier or later is not significant. More important for macroeconomic performance is the expected path of policy beyond liftoff because expectations about the future path of policy can affect today’s economic decisions. According to the FOMC’s current assessment, even after the first rate increase, monetary policy is expected to remain very accommodative for some time to come, with rates expected to move up only gradually to more normal levels and with the decisions about that path depending on incoming information on the economy’s performance. One benefit of the gradual approach is that it will allow us to recalibrate policy over time as some of the uncertainties surrounding the underlying economy in the post-crisis world, like the potential growth rate, are resolved.\n\nJust like the timing of liftoff, the path of policy after liftoff will depend on how economic developments unfold. There is always uncertainty around projections of growth, unemployment, and inflation. If incoming economic information materially changes our outlook, we will adjust the funds rate up or down, as appropriate. But while our policy path is not pre-determined because the future is not pre-determined, one thing is certain: the Federal Reserve is committed to setting monetary policy to promote our congressionally mandated goals of maximum employment and stable prices."

            "content": "Good afternoon. It is an honor to be the closing speaker at this year’s Policy Summit. For almost 15 years, the Policy Summit has provided an important forum for collaboration between researchers and community development practitioners. Although researchers and practitioners bring different perspectives, they share a common goal: to strengthen communities by improving the opportunities for all people to productively engage in our economy. Research informed by the people who are actually on the ground, working in communities and running the programs, can help identify which strategies, programs, and policies are likely to be most effective. I hope that over the past two days, you’ve had the opportunity to meet someone who has brought a different perspective to the table, whether you are an economist, a nonprofit leader, a policymaker, or someone who puts policy into practice. I know I have and I thank you all for being here and for the effort and dedication to the important work you do.\n\nI also want to thank Paul Kaboth, Theresa Singleton, and Sandy Tormoen, the Community Development officers at, respectively, the Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland, Philadelphia, and Richmond, as well as their staffs, for putting together such an interesting program. This Policy Summit is just one of the important ways in which the Federal Reserve Banks work together on behalf of the public. The 12 Reserve Banks are part of the Federal Reserve System, which was established by Congress more than 100 years ago. We like to say that the Federal Reserve is a decentralized central bank, which is independent within the government but not independent from the government. The structure is one of balance. Congress designed the Federal Reserve System to alleviate concerns that the central bank would become dominated by financial interests in New York or political interests in Washington. The Fed’s decentralized structure helps ensure that policy decisions take into account a diversity of information and views, reflecting our roots on Main Streets and communities across the country.\n\nAs the closing speaker, perhaps my greatest responsibility is to keep my remarks relatively short. Unfortunately, I am not going to meet that goal today because I want to take the opportunity to discuss the important role human capital plays in driving the economic outcomes of individuals and communities. As always, the views I’ll present are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nCommunity Development Work at the Fed\n\nThe Federal Reserve has had an interest in community development issues for a long time. In 1977, Congress passed the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) to help address concerns about the deterioration in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods throughout the U.S. Many people blamed urban decline on limited credit availability and illegal practices such as redlining.\n\nThe CRA reaffirmed that insured depository institutions must serve the communities in which they are chartered to do business, helping to ensure equitable access to credit for all individuals and neighborhoods.1 The Federal Reserve and other federal financial supervisory agencies were charged with implementing the act. In 1981, the Fed created its Community Affairs function to provide technical training and support to depository institutions to help bolster compliance with the CRA.\n\nFrom this targeted beginning, the Federal Reserve’s work in the area of community development has evolved and expanded, much as the nature of community development in general has changed over time. As people in this room know, access to credit is but one factor – albeit an important one – in determining the economic vitality of households and neighborhoods. A glance at the agenda for this Policy Summit conveys the wide range of interconnected issues that community development now encompasses, from health and transportation policy, to housing and education policy, to workforce development. While the focus may have changed over time, one thing that hasn’t changed is the Federal Reserve’s commitment to helping to identify effective policies and best practices for promoting economic progress in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. In addition to its research, the Fed plays an important role as a “convener.” Bringing together people to share their different perspectives and experiences can ultimately lead to more effective economic policies. I have spoken elsewhere about how the diversity of views expressed around the FOMC table helps the Fed make better monetary policy. I believe the same is true for public policies aimed at addressing the challenges faced in community development.\n\nWe can all be pleased that the economy has greatly improved since the depths of the Great Recession. Employment is up and unemployment rates are down. But not all households or communities have experienced the same amount of improvement; some of the challenges are long-standing ones that the recent recession and slow recovery exacerbated. According to a 2014 Federal Reserve survey of economic well-being, 65 percent of respondents reported that their families are either “doing okay” or “living comfortably” financially. Yet economic challenges persist for sizable parts of the population.2 Forty-seven percent of respondents said they could not cover a $400 emergency expense using cash or its functional equivalent or would have to sell something or borrow to cover it. Just under a quarter of respondents said they or a household family member had experienced some type of financial hardship in the previous year. And, not surprisingly, feelings about economic well-being vary with household income. For lower-income households, those making less than $40,000 per year and who make up about one-third of the respondents, more than half reported they are finding it difficult to get by or are just getting by financially.\n\nI am sure it is not news to you, community development professionals, that problems linger and effective solutions remain elusive. However, one thing is clear: human capital – education and skills that make people more productive and able to contribute to the economy – is one of the fundamental factors that determine economic outcomes of communities and individuals.\n\nThe Value of Human Capital\n\nMany studies have documented the importance to economic well-being of investments in human capital. For example, Cleveland Fed researchers found that over a 75-year-period, education levels were consistently one of the most reliable indicators for each state’s per capita income growth3 and that counties with higher levels of high school graduates tend to have lower poverty rates and higher levels of labor force participation.4 A study by a Philadelphia Fed researcher found that resilient regions, that is, regions that have been able to avoid persistent declines in population over the long run, tend to have a more educated population and a more diverse industry mix.5\n\nThe benefits of investing in human capital are also evident at the individual level. Better education is correlated with higher wages and lower levels of unemployment. For example, the current unemployment rate for those with a college degree is 2.6 percent, compared to 5.4 percent for those with a high school diploma, and 8.0 percent for those who didn’t graduate from high school. The difference in wages between those with a college degree and those without, the so-called skill premium, has widened substantially over time, more than doubling since the 1970s. Median hourly wages for those with a bachelor’s degree are now about 80 percent higher than for high school graduates.6 And over a lifetime, in present value terms, a college graduate can expect to earn nearly twice as much as a high school graduate.7 Other research shows that the skill premium has grown even more for those with a post-graduate degree, even controlling for changing demographics. Those with a graduate degree now earn about 30 percent more than those with a four-year college degree.8\n\nThe rising skill premium since the 1970s reflects the fact that over much of the period, real wages (that is, wages adjusted for inflation) rose for skilled workers while they fell for unskilled workers. Several factors could have led to the rising trend in the skill premium. Globalization, which has led to increased trade between the U.S. and countries with lower-skill, lower-wage workers, is one possible explanation. Demand from the U.S. for the products produced by lower-wage workers abroad would put downward pressure on the wages of lower-skill workers producing similar goods in the U.S. And demand from abroad for goods produced by high-skill workers in the U.S. would put upward pressure on their wages. While this is an interesting theory, there is not much empirical support for trade being a major driver of the skill premium.9\n\nInstead, there appears to be considerably more evidence that technological change has increased the demand for skilled workers relative to unskilled workers. This is consistent with the fact that even industries often viewed as less skill-intensive have increased their demand for skilled labor. The manufacturing plant of the 1970s has transformed itself into a high-tech operation, requiring workers who can operate computerized machinery and even robots.\n\nThe idea that the rising skill premium is driven by technological change also seems consistent with research showing that mathematical achievement is a fairly good predictor of future earnings.10 As discussed in a recent Cleveland Fed Economic Commentary, even among high school dropouts, those who completed geometry or algebra II earn about $1.50 more per hour in the workforce than those who completed fewer math courses. Math attainment in high school also helps predict admission to and success in college. Some Cleveland Fed economists help run a Math Corps program at Cleveland State University. This program for middle and high school students aims to build confidence and mastery in young people’s mathematical abilities. It appears to be working, as Math Corps students are more likely to score higher on standardized tests and more likely to graduate from high school than their peers.11\n\nA refinement of the idea that technological change has driven the widening skill premium is the polarization hypothesis.12 Data suggest that since 2000, jobs have become “polarized,” meaning that while high-skill and low-skill occupations have seen job growth, medium-skill occupations have experienced job losses. Some jobs involve work that is very routinized, work that involves repeated actions and set rules. Other jobs involve work that is less routine, requiring flexibility. Another dimension along which jobs vary is the extent to which they require cognitive skills versus physical skills. Computers can handle tasks usually found in routinized cognitive jobs, e.g., bookkeeping and other clerical tasks. Computers are less suited to replace workers in occupations that require abstract thinking, high levels of cognition, and higher levels of education. But they are also less able to take on non-routine manual work. Academic and Federal Reserve labor-market researchers have found that since 2000, there has been a decline in employment in the routine cognitive and routine manual job categories – jobs that are considered medium-skill jobs – compared to job gains in non-routine cognitive and non-routine manual occupations – high-skill and low-skill jobs, respectively.13 This shift in the distribution of jobs helps to explain the wider gap in wages for highly skilled vs. lower skilled workers, and the increasing return to gaining the education required to obtain those skills.\n\nThe increase in the return to education over the past 35 years has spurred more people to get their degrees – for example, the percent of the U.S. labor force that is college-educated has more than doubled since the 1970s. But because demand for these higher-skill workers continues to grow, the skill premium has continued to rise even as the supply of skilled workers has risen.14\n\nWhile much of the research has focused on college vs. high school, this partly reflects the availability of data. Some of the skills required to meet the demand of jobs in today’s economy can be acquired in settings other than four-year colleges. Also note that some of the cognitive skills needed are not necessarily acquired by studying only math and science. The critical thinking and judgment acquired by studying the social sciences and humanities is very valuable in the modern workplace. And, of course, not every high school graduate earns less than the average college graduate – wages vary quite a bit within an educational level. Indeed, recent research by Cleveland Fed staff shows that across 100 metro areas in the nation, the top 30 percent of earners aged 18-35 without a college degree earned more than a quarter of the workers in this age group who have a bachelor’s degree.15\n\nStill, the earnings prospects of less-educated workers seem to depend on subsequent training and also on location. The locational aspect is being investigated in forthcoming research led by the Philadelphia Fed in collaboration with the Cleveland and Atlanta Feds. Other researchers have provided evidence that less-educated workers benefit in the form of higher wages from working in areas populated with more-educated workers. Such knowledge spillovers mean that the return to communities from education can be higher than the return any one person gains by becoming more educated.16 Evidence of human capital spillovers is also provided by another study that finds that cities with more highly educated populations experience lower unemployment rates, higher productivity growth, and higher growth in entrepreneurship than what would have been predicted by considering only individuals’ educational levels.17 Thus, education appears to be a valuable investment not only for the individual but also for the communities in which people live.\n\nEducational Attainment\n\nIt is important to note that the statistics I’ve quoted on the skill premium and the social return to education are based on people who actually obtain their degrees. While enrollments in college are near historic highs, non-completion rates are also quite high. According to data from the National Center for Education Statistics, only about 55 percent of students who start college earn bachelor’s degrees within five years.18\n\nSeveral factors are likely at play. First, some people aren’t prepared for college when they enter. Research is increasingly pointing to the fact that the foundation has to be laid very early in life – at the pre-school level. When children fall behind early on, it is often difficult to catch up.19 Research is also shedding light on which type of early childhood education programs work and the ways in which they can affect economic outcomes later in life. One study found that a main way in which the influential Perry Preschool Program, which predates Head Start, affected longer-run outcomes was by affecting the social skills of the participants, e.g., lowering aggressive and anti-social behaviors.20 Home environment also matters. Research by a Cleveland Fed economist shows that home environment, as measured by the number of books at home, has a significant impact on achievement in elementary school.21\n\nA second factor affecting college enrollment and completion rates is that college has become increasingly expensive over time. The average cost of tuition and fees at four-year institutions is now over $14,000 a year, and has more than doubled since 2000.22 Subsidies for higher education fell during the Great Recession, shifting costs to students. According to data compiled by the New York Fed, more people are borrowing to go to school: The share of 25 year olds with student debt rose from 27 percent in 2004 to about 45 percent in 2013. And the average debt per borrower has increased from about $15,000 in 2004 to $27,000 in 2014.23 Some students do not have the financial wherewithal to start or to complete their degrees. According to the Fed survey of economic well-being that I mentioned earlier, of those respondents who didn’t attend or complete college, 30 percent reported that they didn’t attend college because it was too expensive, while 24 percent of those who started college said they didn’t complete their degree for this reason. In some cases, family obligations take precedence over education. Forty-three percent of women and 32 percent of men said they didn’t finish because of family obligations. This gender gap was even larger among younger respondents.24\n\nA third factor affecting enrollment and completion rates is that some people may have a personal preference to enter the workforce after high school rather than to go to college. But that choice might really reflect a person’s view that he or she is unprepared to succeed in college or that the return to a college education does not justify the tuition expense or the burden of student loan debt. In other words, while, on average, the return to investing in education is positive, for some individuals it is not, especially if they have to take on high levels of debt. Research by the Richmond Fed, which models college choice, illustrates that uncertainty about whether you’ll complete college or whether you’ll get a good-paying job after graduating will offset some of the positive effects of a rising skill premium on your decision to enroll in college. The effect of uncertainty is larger for lower-income people who need to borrow to go to college, since they’ll need to earn more post-college to make the investment pay off.25\n\nThis work, as well as the other research on educational attainment, suggests to me that college enrollments and completion rates could be increased by programs that help prepare students to enter college and programs that help ensure that financial support is available to students who have the desire and qualifications to earn a college degree. Student loan programs should encourage students to choose colleges or other types of educational programs that maximize the return on the student’s investment in human capital.\n\nPeople who prefer not to attend college will also have to build their human capital to be productive members of the modern workforce. Apprenticeships, certificate programs, and on-the-job training can all potentially play an important role. The U.S. spends a significant amount of money on education. In 2011, total spending on public primary and secondary education was over $600 billion, more than $12,000 per public-school student.26 That same year, private industry spent more than $156 billion on employee learning and development programs.27 But at a time when funding is scarce and the needs are plentiful, rigorous evaluation of the effectiveness of educational and training programs is needed, and there is an active research agenda in this area. I’d like to conclude my remarks with a few examples of such efforts.\n\nSome Examples of Program Evaluation Efforts\n\nIt is impossible to evaluate the effectiveness of a program without the data to do it. In Maryland, the Jacob France Institute at the University of Baltimore keeps a repository of wage and labor market data to track program participants over several years and to coordinate with on-the-ground agencies in designing longer-run programs.28 Similar centers around the country are collecting information as part of new federal workforce investment rules. Data collection and program evaluation are important aspects of the U.S. Department of Education’s Promise Neighborhoods program, which aims to improve the educational outcomes of children in distressed neighborhoods by improving the neighborhoods themselves.\n\nIn addition to data collection efforts, there is ongoing work to identify the most effective programs for hard-to-employ individuals. A Cleveland-based organization, Towards Employment, is leading NEO WorkAdvance, a collaborative effort of more than 13 Northeast Ohio workforce and economic development organizations that are partnering with employers to identify hiring and training needs in manufacturing and health care, two industries significant in the Northeast Ohio region.29 The program is designed to rigorously evaluate what helps unemployed and low-wage working adults succeed in the workplace in general and, in particular, in these two sectors.\n\nOther work is also underway to evaluate job training programs focused on particular industrial sectors. One Cincinnati agency, Partners for a Competitive Workforce, is a leader in tracking its results and sharing information with researchers.30 Research could help identify whether certain sectors, like health care or high-tech manufacturing where qualified workers are in short supply, are more amenable to these kinds of programs or whether such programs can be replicated across multiple industries. Such knowledge could help inform policies that provide incentives to industry to develop meaningful training programs for both new and continuing employees.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, some of the early childhood education research suggests that the future success of disadvantaged individuals can be improved by strengthening their social skills. Studies are underway to examine the role of characteristics like persistence and other personality traits as they relate to labor market outcomes,31 and the Commonwealth of Kentucky is using the ACT WorkKeys test, which attempts to measure these “soft skills,” as part of its evaluation metrics for qualifying certain communities as having the infrastructure and workforce sought by employers. By their very nature, soft skills are difficult to measure, but furthering our understanding of the extent to which these types of skills improve future success and the ways in which they might be taught may help people successfully enter and remain in the workforce.\n\nThese are but a few examples of agencies undertaking initiatives to critically evaluate educational and workforce development programs. Improving our knowledge about which programs are effective and what makes them so will help ensure that we design the best programs to help the most people and that our investment in these programs is money well spent. This Policy Summit and other similar conferences have an important role to play by bringing together the program designers, community development practitioners, and researchers who will lead the way in developing effective methods to raise the human capital levels in our nation. I encourage you all to keep working toward this very important goal."

            "content": "Good afternoon. It is hard for me to convey how honored I am to present the lunch keynote address at this year’s Financial Intermediation Research Society (FIRS) conference. At the risk of dating myself, I am proud to say that I was a founding member of the society, and it’s been a great pleasure to see how FIRS has developed and spread its wings to all parts of the globe. I thank George Pennacchi, president of the society, Vish Viswanathan, president-elect and this year’s program chair, and Allen Berger, my friend and co-author, for the opportunity to speak today. It’s been wonderful catching up with old friends and meeting new scholars who are pushing the envelope of financial intermediation research.\n\nIn his presidential address to the American Finance Association earlier this year, Luigi Zingales asked an important question: “Does finance benefit society?” He pointed out the dissonance between the view of academics, who typically say “yes,” and that of the average American, who is much less certain.1 Zingales argues that academia has an important role to play in ensuring that finance will benefit society. I agree. Academic research can help detect those aspects of financial system design and practices that are beneficial to society and those that are harmful, and Zingales calls for academics to get more involved in policy issues. Today, I’m going to focus on one aspect of policy – the design and practice of financial system regulation after the financial crisis – and the role research has played in informing that regulation. I’ll also discuss an area that needs further research: the interplay between monetary policy and financial stability policy. Before proceeding, I note that the views I’ll present are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Post-Crisis Supervision and Regulation Framework: A Micro- and Macroprudential Approach\n\nI do not need to tell this audience that financial institutions are able to provide valuable credit, risk-management, and liquidity services to businesses and households because they are designed to take risks and are highly leveraged compared with nonfinancial businesses. But this risk-taking and leverage raise the possibility of systemic problems that could threaten the functioning of the financial system, hurt real economic activity, and impose significant economic costs. The 2008 financial crisis exposed gaps in the regulatory and supervisory architecture, which contributed to a build-up in financial imbalances and systemic risk.\n\nThere are many lessons to be learned from the crisis and its aftermath. The crisis drove home the notion that incentives matter and regulation itself creates incentives. Finance and economic researchers do not need to be told this. Well-designed regulations create incentives that promote financial stability. But sometimes regulations, no matter how well intentioned, can create counterproductive incentives and unintended consequences. At least some part of the strong growth in financial intermediation that occurred outside of the regulated banking system was driven by the desire to avoid regulation. One strong lesson from the crisis is that when setting up regulatory systems, policymakers need to understand the incentives created by the regulatory system itself, incentives that influence the behavior of all market participants: the financial intermediaries and their investors and customers, and also the regulators. Of course, this was recognized in the finance literature well before the recent crisis. In fact, Ed Kane, who presented the lunch keynote address at the very first FIRS Conference, in 2004, has written extensively on the incentives of regulators.2\n\nThe crisis also taught us that we need to avoid designing regulations that attempt to work against market forces. Such regulations will be much more likely to fail or to distort incentives and create unintended consequences. Instead, the regulatory system should attempt to harness market discipline to promote financial stability.\n\nThe financial crisis underscored the need for a new approach to financial system supervision and regulation. The regulatory reforms engendered in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, signed into law in 2010, aim to foster financial stability in two ways: first, by lowering the probability of a financial crisis, and second, by reducing the costs imposed on the rest of the economy when a shock hits the financial system. Under Dodd-Frank, the Federal Reserve and other financial regulatory agencies were directed to augment their traditional microprudential approach, which promotes the safety and soundness of individual institutions, with a macroprudential approach in which examiners and supervisors take a horizontal view of risk across institutions rather than looking at only one institution at a time. Such a macroprudential approach had been suggested by Crocket (2000), Borio (2003), and others at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) well before the recent crisis, so there was a relatively large body of work to draw on. Indeed, according to Clement (2010), records at the BIS indicate the term “macroprudential” was first used in an international context in 1979 in a meeting of the Cooke Committee, which was the precursor to the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.\n\nAlthough there is still more to be done, regulators continue to make progress in developing tools to implement the macroprudential approach to promoting financial stability and to improve the monitoring of risks over the business and financial cycles. In general, the macroprudential tools can be classified into two categories: structural tools and cyclical tools.\n\nThe structural tools aim to build the resiliency of the financial system throughout the business cycle. These tools include the Basel III risk-based capital requirements, minimum liquidity requirements, central clearing for derivatives, and living will resolution plans.\n\nIn contrast, the cyclical tools are aimed at mitigating the systemic risk that can build up over the business cycle. These tools include the bank stress tests, the countercyclical capital buffer, and the capital conservation buffer. The countercyclical capital buffer allows regulators to increase risk-based capital requirements when credit growth is judged to be excessive and leading to rising systemic risk. The capital conservation buffer ensures that banks raise capital above regulatory minimums in good times so that when they cover losses in bad times, their capital ratio will stay at or above the regulatory minimum. Other possible cyclical tools, not yet established in the U.S. but used in other countries, include loan-to-value ratio limits and debt-to-income ratio limits that vary over the cycle and which have been targeted to particular sectors like housing credit or household credit.3\n\nWhile the structural and cyclical tools show promise, as yet, their performance is largely untested. For example, a study by economists at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) examining the effectiveness of macroprudential tools in reducing systemic risk in 49 countries found mixed results (Lim, Columba, Costa, Kongsamut, Otani, Saiyid, Wezel, and Wu, 2011). The authors concluded that many of the most frequently used tools were effective in reducing the pro-cyclicality of credit and leverage, but the effectiveness depended on the type of shock hitting the financial sector.\n\nResearch Has Informed the Post-Crisis Supervision and Regulation Framework\n\nLegislated regulatory reforms and the work being done by financial regulators to implement those reforms have been informed by a body of academic research over many decades. Many of the people in this room have made significant contributions to this research agenda. Academic research has greatly aided our understanding of how systemic risks can build up and propagate throughout the economy, and this understanding has put a firmer foundation under the regulatory reforms being undertaken. Indeed, well before the crisis, academic research on banking panics pointed to the importance of supplementing microprudential regulation with what we now call macroprudential regulation. The seminal work of Diamond and Dybvig (1983) explicitly modeled a financial crisis in which bank failures had macroeconomic consequences. Gorton (1985) distinguished runs on one bank from banking panics, which entail runs on many banks or the entire banking system.\n\nA large body of research has explored the problems imposed on the financial system from fire sales of assets. While one firm might benefit from the ability to sell assets in response to a negative shock, if the shock hits the potential buyers of these assets at the same time, asset prices can decline sharply, which will affect the prices of similar assets held by other firms. In their Journal of Economic Perspectives paper, Shleifer and Vishny (2011) discuss the role of fire sales in the recent financial crisis. Their model of fire sales (Shleifer and Vishny, 1992) was developed well before the recent crisis and built on Kiyotaki and Moore’s seminal work on the important role collateral plays in lending markets.\n\nIn Kiyotaki and Moore’s (1997) model, because borrowers cannot be forced to repay, all lending is collateralized. When the economy is performing well, the value of the collateral increases, which supports further borrowing and higher output. But when a negative shock hits the economy and output declines, collateral values also fall, which means borrowing falls, which depresses output even further. Thus, the collateral constraint is a mechanism that amplifies and propagates the effects of temporary shocks on the economy. Brunnermeier and Sannikov (2014) build on the Kiyotaki and Moore model. In their model, an economic boom increases bank capital levels high enough so that credit is amply available to borrowers. This lowers the volatility of both output and asset prices. The lower volatility induces banks to increase their leverage and lend even more, so much so that the system is now vulnerable to a negative shock. These models illustrate that systemic risk is endogenous, determined by the choices of the model’s decision makers, and that systemic risk varies across the cycle.\n\nThe research also points out an important aspect of financial crises that, in my view, needs further study: the dynamics of distress in financial markets. In order to determine the appropriate response, regulators and supervisors need to be able to detect whether an institution’s problems stem from temporary liquidity problems or broader solvency concerns. If the former, then the lender of last resort can be used to address the issue, as the institution would have sound, albeit illiquid, collateral to post for the loan. But the demarcation between illiquidity and insolvency is fluid. A temporary liquidity problem at one institution, if not adequately addressed, can morph into a solvency problem, which can then propagate to other institutions. Thus, it is imperative that supervisors stay attentive to the risks that might be developing at individual institutions, as well as across institutions, before those risks become a systemic issue. So, microprudential supervision continues to have an important role to play.\n\nImplementing Supervision and Regulation Informed by Research\n\nWhile academic research has informed us about the benefits of augmenting microprudential with macroprudential supervision, it is up to the supervisors and regulators to actually implement this new framework as directed by the legislation. Let me discuss some of the recent efforts.\n\nThe Federal Reserve and other federal banking agencies in the U.S. are taking a tiered approach to banking supervision and regulation, which finds support in the literature (e.g., Brunnermeier, Crockett, Goodhart, Persaud, and Shin, 2009). This approach recognizes that the risk a banking organization poses to the financial system is likely to vary according to the bank’s size, range of activities, interconnectedness both domestically and globally, complexity, and the extent to which there is a lack of readily available substitutes for the services it provides; oversight is then tailored appropriately. Doing so helps to reduce the potential costs some banks might face if made to comply with rules that don’t further the goal of a healthy and resilient financial system. It also frees up the bandwidth of examiners and supervisors so they can focus more of their attention on where the risks actually lie.4\n\nTwo important focuses of post-crisis regulation and supervision are capital and liquidity. There is close to a consensus in the literature that high leverage was a major contributor to the severity of the financial crisis. Greenlaw, Hatzius, Kashyap, and Shin (2008) show that the concentration of losses in the leveraged financial sector exacerbated the negative effects of the crisis. They argue that leveraged financial institutions suffering from a shortage of capital were not in a position to take advantage of the central bank’s liquidity injections meant to encourage balance-sheet expansion. Rather, these institutions contracted lending in order to be in a position to rebuild their capital levels, and this lengthened the time to recovery. Acharya and Schnabl (2009) argue that mechanisms meant to transfer assets off their balance sheets to other investors, like securitization, actually worked to increase the banks’ effective leverage and raised systemic risk. Admati and Hellwig (2013) have been impassioned advocates for requiring significantly higher levels of bank capital, in particular, in the form of equity capital.\n\nThe Basel III international capital reforms do raise the minimum requirements for both the quantity and quality of capital held by banks, although not to the levels Admati and Hellwig prefer. For all banking organizations, the U.S. rules raise the minimum ratio of tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from 4 percent to 6 percent and impose a minimum leverage ratio of tier 1 capital to total assets of 4 percent. Common equity must now be the predominate form of tier 1 capital.5 In addition, large, internationally active banking organizations are subject to a new minimum supplementary leverage ratio that takes into account off-balance-sheet exposures, including credit derivatives, repo-style transactions, and lines of credit.\n\nWhile the U.S. has required banks to meet a minimum leverage ratio requirement for some time, the Basel III reforms introduced this requirement in an international context. I see a lot of benefit to complementing the risk-based capital requirements with a non-risk-based leverage ratio requirement. It is simpler and more transparent and should serve as a further backstop against excessive leverage.\n\nIn my view, another lesson from the crisis is that regulatory complexity can complicate supervision, risk monitoring, compliance, and enforcement. Given the scope and ever-changing nature of the financial system, regulatory complexity is to a certain extent unavoidable. But the tradeoffs should be recognized. It is reasonable to require higher levels of capital to be held against higher-risk assets, but a system of risk weights that is overly granular and complex would be counterproductive. In practice, too much complexity would make it harder for regulators to assess compliance and to determine whether institutions were engaging in some practices merely as a way to hide risk and lower their capital requirements.\n\nIn addition to higher capital requirements, large banking organizations are now subject to minimum liquidity requirements. The earliest research on financial intermediation recognized that, by the design of their assets and liabilities, banks are subject to runs. Deposit insurance and access to the lender of last resort were meant to address the issue in a bank-centric financial system. But financial markets have evolved. The financial crisis showed that runs can occur not just at traditional banking institutions but in many parts of the financial system where short-term financing is used to fund longer-term assets, including money market funds and repo markets. Tirole (2011) reviews and models the role illiquidity played in the crisis and what he calls illiquidity’s friends: market freezes, fire sales, contagion, and, ultimately, insolvencies and bailouts. Much of the academic research points to the role of the lender of last resort in addressing liquidity problems. Liquidity regulation has a role to play, too, by helping to lower the probability of a systemic event and making one more manageable should it occur.\n\nInternational banking agencies through the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision have developed two quantitative liquidity standards: the liquidity coverage requirement (LCR) and the net stable funding ratio (NSFR). Under the U.S. rule implementing the LCR, the largest banking organizations must hold a buffer of high-quality liquid assets sufficient to cover net cash outflows during a 30-day stress scenario.6 The revised and final NSFR was released by the Basel Committee last October. The NSFR is meant to be a complement to the LCR by looking at the bank’s funding profile beyond the 30-day window.\n\nAnother important aspect of the new regulatory approach involves horizontal reviews of banking organizations, which augment the examinations of individual institutions. An example is the annual cross-firm evaluation of capital that the Fed performs at the largest institutions (those with $50 billion or more in consolidated assets). One part of this assessment is the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), which evaluates the bank holding company’s capital adequacy, the process by which the holding company ensures its capital adequacy, and its planned capital distributions, including dividend payments and stock buy-backs. Another part of the assessment is the Dodd-Frank Act stress test (DFAST), a forward-looking component that evaluates whether capital is sufficient to absorb losses under a stress scenario. These assessments of bank capital allow regulators to evaluate not only individual firms but also the resiliency of the group of institutions during times of stress.\n\nMany of the regulatory reforms I’ve been discussing foster financial stability by aiming to lower the probability that a financial crisis will develop. But the crisis made clear that it was also important to reduce the costs imposed on the rest of the economy when a shock hits the financial system. Dodd-Frank has taken steps in that direction. The act requires a systemically important financial institution to provide a resolution plan or living will detailing how, were the firm to fail, it could be wound down in an orderly way under the bankruptcy code without imposing severe adverse consequences on the financial system and the rest of the U.S. economy. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Fed have provided guidance to financial companies on their submitted plans, asking them to address issues that are impediments to resolution under the bankruptcy code, such as funding and liquidity, counterparty risk, global cooperation, and the interconnectedness and complexity of their organizational and legal structures.7\n\nWhen an orderly resolution by bankruptcy is not possible, the Dodd-Frank Act’s Title II provisions establish an orderly liquidation authority (OLA) to resolve troubled nonbank financial companies, including bank holding companies, securities broker-dealers, and other nonbank financial firms. This authority resides in the FDIC, the agency also responsible for resolving failed banks. Among other powers, the authority includes the ability to establish a bridge financial company, to terminate certain financial contracts, and to convert debt to equity. If a failing firm is taken into receivership by the FDIC under this authority, the act compels the FDIC to ensure that shareholders and creditors bear losses and that the management responsible for the losses is replaced.\n\nJackson and Skeel (2010) and Jackson (2010), among others, have made the case that a modified bankruptcy code could work even for large, complex financial firms and that it might work better than Dodd-Frank’s orderly liquidation authority because, for one thing, it is less discretionary.8 However, because systemically important institutions operate globally, U.S. laws would need to be harmonized with those of other countries. Of course, global operations are also a challenge for resolution under the orderly liquidation authority.\n\nThere continues to be active discussion among academics and policymakers because effective resolution remains a key task in promoting financial stability. Ironically, we will have a more stable financial system if we build a system that allows insolvent institutions to fail and involves less regulatory intervention to prevent closure of these firms. When managers and creditors do not expect to be bailed out ex post, they will have increased incentives to monitor the risks their institutions are taking and to take adequate precautions to avoid failure.\n\nIt is too soon to know how well the new orderly liquidation authority will work in practice, and whether it represents a credible resolution mechanism so that no institution is treated as too big to fail and the moral hazard issues engendered by too big to fail are solved. If too big to fail remains a problem, it seems reasonable to ask whether breaking up the institutions would solve it. My answer is “no.” To evaluate such a potential solution, it is important to know why banks have gotten so large. A body of research suggests that some institutions have grown in size, not to game the system, but for reasons of efficiency.9 More research is needed to calibrate these efficiency benefits against the potential systemic risks posed by large, complex institutions. However, to the extent that market forces and efficiencies encourage banks to grow larger, I remain skeptical that breaking up the banks, however well intentioned, will be effective. Indeed, if the scale economies are large, size restrictions would create great incentives for firms to try to evade the restrictions by moving activities outside of the more regulated sector without necessarily reducing systemic risk. That is, the risk would migrate elsewhere but would not be eliminated. I believe a better approach is to couple a credible resolution method with the imposition of more stringent requirements on institutions that impose more systemic risk on the financial system. This approach, which is a goal of Dodd-Frank, would spur institutions to internalize some of the externalities of taking on risk.\n\nUp to now I have focused mainly on regulation, but to promote financial stability, we need continued vigilance in monitoring the buildup of risks in the financial system. Better monitoring will be aided by data being collected by the Office of Financial Research (OFR) and by metrics being developed by academic and central bank economists, such as the Cleveland Fed’s financial stress index, which summarizes movements in a number of financial variables associated with stress.10 It is important to remember, however, that many of these metrics quantify correlations in the data rather than telling us something about the structure of the underlying financial markets or what has caused the movement in the metric and whether it requires a policy response. Moreover, integrating such metrics into day-to-day supervision remains a challenge.11\n\nFinancial stability surveillance is also receiving regular attention in Federal Open Market Committee meetings. Federal Reserve staff are using a framework, described in Adrian, Covitz, and Liang (2013), that tracks a standard set of financial system vulnerabilities, including the pricing of risk, leverage, maturity and liquidity transformation, and interconnectedness and complexity, across four broad areas of the financial system: asset markets, the banking sector, shadow banks, and the nonfinancial sector. This regular and systematic analysis is already helping us to better identify changes in conditions over time. But more research is needed to determine what such changes signal about financial stability. Of course, an even bigger question is how policy should respond to signs of emerging financial stability risks and, in particular, how financial stability concerns should be incorporated into monetary policymaking.\n\nThe Nexus Between Monetary Policy and Financial Stability Policy\n\nRecent experience has renewed the discussion of how central banks should respond to emerging systemic risk. We saw that financial imbalances can build up even in a low-inflation environment. While price stability may promote financial stability, it is not a sufficient condition. We also saw that when financial markets are not functioning well, the transmission of monetary policy to the economy can be disrupted. In addition, the FOMC has recognized that nonconventional monetary policy, including large-scale asset purchases and the extended period of essentially zero interest rates, could pose potential risks to financial stability by affecting market functioning and spurring risk-taking in a search for yield.12\n\nBefore the crisis, the conventional approach generally taken by the Fed was to use monetary policy to respond to asset price movements – whether driven by fundamentals or not – only to the extent that those movements contained information about inflation and output growth. Monetary policy would not try to limit the size of imbalances as they developed, but would opt to mop up the consequences of a correction after the fact. But others argued for a more activist approach, with monetary policy being used to try to stem developing imbalances before they caused harm to the real economy. White (2009) characterized these approaches as using monetary policy to clean up the mess after a bubble bursts versus using it to lean against a bubble that appears to be forming.\n\nIn deciding whether or not to take action against a growing imbalance, policymakers need to balance the expected improvement in future economic conditions against the potential cost of unduly limiting credit extension. If policymakers decide to intervene, the next question is, what tools should they use? Should macroprudential tools be used for financial stability concerns, with monetary policy focused only on its macroeconomic objectives of price stability and maximum employment? Even in this case, there will be interactions between the two types of policy – very loose monetary policy increases the likelihood that financial instabilities will develop, thereby increasing the likelihood macroprudential policy tools will be needed. Tight macroprudential policy could tighten financial conditions more generally, necessitating a monetary policy response.\n\nA necessary ingredient in gaining insights into the interactions between monetary and macroprudential policy is the development of structural general equilibrium models that seriously incorporate financial markets and the possibility of financial stress, borrower defaults, and financial institution failures. These models need to be fairly complex. While I earlier argued that simpler regulations may have benefits, the models in which we evaluate such regulations and policies, by necessity, need to be complex. Before the financial crisis we may have convinced ourselves that we could rely on representative agent models, linearized around a steady state, with one interest rate. But the nature of the financial crisis pointed out the inadequacies of these models for understanding the impact of severe financial stress on the real economy. By their nature, financial crises involve nonlinearities, potentially multiple equilibria, and financial frictions that limit arbitrage. So our models need to include these features. In addition, macroprudential tools focus on the allocation of credit in the economy and work through redistribution. To study the effects of such tools, our models need to include heterogeneous agents with different rates of risk tolerance and time preference, and multiple interest rates.13 Of course, monetary policy also entails some redistributions of income and wealth, and understanding the dynamics of the effects of monetary policy also requires the use of more complex models.14\n\nAn ongoing research agenda in academia and central banks aims to build models useful for such policy analysis. I don’t have time to review the growing literature in this area, but Adrian and Liang (2014) provide a very useful summary. It is important that research continues to expand our understanding of the interactions between financial markets and the real economy and our ability to monitor developments in each.\n\nIn the meantime, policymakers need to acknowledge that in the lead-up to the financial crisis, some of the vulnerabilities of the financial system were not fully recognized. Despite our best attempts, there likely remain gaps in our ability to assess the risks in every part of the financial system. This is not an argument that we should use monetary policy as the main tool to address financial stability concerns. Given the state of our knowledge, I would opt to use the macroprudential tools as the first line of defense, since they can be more targeted to the markets and institutions where the risks are emerging. However, I do think that when we are making policy decisions, we should be cognizant of the linkages between our nonconventional monetary policy of an extended period of essentially zero interest rates and financial stability. And I encourage the researchers in this room and everywhere to continue pushing out the frontier of our knowledge with some urgency, since the world is not going to stop and wait. I recommend the same sense of urgency to central bankers and financial system supervisors, as we work to implement the new supervision and regulation framework.\n\nA Final Thought on How Research Should Inform Legislation\n\nLet me leave you with one final thought. The complexity of balancing monetary policy with financial stability considerations does not absolve policymakers from having to clearly explain the rationale for their decisions. If anything, it makes clear communication and transparency even more imperative, so that policy can be more effective and so that the public has the information it needs to hold the central bank accountable.\n\nCongress has set the Fed’s goals but it has also given the Fed independence in making monetary policy decisions in pursuit of those goals. That is, monetary policy decisions do not have to be approved by the president or Congress. This is consistent with a large body of research showing that when central banks formulate monetary policy free from government interference and are held accountable for their decisions, better economic outcomes result. I believe that allowing political considerations to influence monetary policy decisions would be a tremendous mistake because it would ultimately lead to poorer economic performance. The research on this point is clear: the Federal Reserve’s independence in setting monetary policy is worth preserving."

            "content": "Good morning. I thank the conference organizers at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and the Journal of Economics and Business, in particular, Paul Calem, Julapa Jagtiani, Bill Lang, and Ken Kopecky, for inviting me to participate in this conference on regulating consumer credit. It is a particular pleasure for me to be back at my old haunt, having grown up at the Philly Fed, and seeing the many people I count not only as my friends but also as my teachers, because I’ve learned so much from you over the years. I also want to acknowledge my long association with the Journal of Economics and Business, and the opportunity Ken Kopecky gave me to serve as an associate editor of the journal and as the editor of a special issue associated with the Federal Reserve System’s March 2007 conference on financing community development.\n\nIt may not surprise you that many of the topics contained in that special issue are still being researched today, including subprime mortgages, foreclosures, predatory lending practices, and consumer literacy. Indeed, some of these very topics are covered in this conference. I don’t think we should take this as signaling a lack of progress. Instead, I view it as recognition that consumer credit markets are a vital part of the modern economy, that the issues pertaining to these markets, including regulation, are intricate ones, and that the data and models being used to study these important markets are becoming more sophisticated and informative. Conferences like this one help us identify what we know and what we don’t know – a necessary step on the road to more effective regulation and policymaking. Today I will offer my perspectives on the research agenda on consumer credit and household finance. As always, the views I’ll present are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nHousehold Finance Before, During, and After the Financial Crisis\n\nSince I am in Philadelphia, I can’t help but begin by quoting one of Philadelphia’s favorite sons, Ben Franklin. Ben was not stingy with advice, and among the many pieces of wisdom he provided in his Poor Richard’s Almanac was the warning: “...he that goes a borrowing, goes a sorrowing.”1 Yet U.S. households appear to have ignored this warning. Since the 1960s, household debt, including mortgages and consumer credit and other liabilities, has accounted for about 25 to 30 percent of total credit market debt outstanding.2 Consumer loans excluding mortgages have varied between 10 and 20 percent of commercial bank credit.3\n\nIn the aftermath of the global financial crisis, it is easy to forget the important benefits that access to such credit can mean for households and the economy at large. Well-functioning credit markets provide an efficient mechanism for allocating risk and moving funds from savers to borrowers. Credit allows households to consume and invest in goods and services that are currently unaffordable but which are affordable based on their future income, and to manage the risks associated with loss of income. This access to credit allows households to participate in the modern economy. Mortgages allow people to purchase houses, a goal of many families. Auto loans give buyers the means to search for jobs and get to work. Student loans allow people to fund their educations, raising the level of their human capital and the productivity of the workforce. So credit allows people to increase their own well-being and contribute to the country’s economic growth.\n\nOver time, financial innovations, regulatory changes, and technological advances have all led to increased access to credit by households, some of whom found it difficult to borrow in earlier times. For example, the development of the secondary mortgage market and securitization brought new sources of funds to the market. Permitting banks to branch nationwide lowered noninterest expenses and loan losses. And the development of credit scoring models lowered transactions costs and allowed lenders to better assess and monitor the riskiness of potential borrowers.\n\nHowever, as the financial crisis underscored, not all financial innovations and credit extensions are beneficial to households or to the broader economy, especially when the risks they entail aren’t fully appreciated. While household debt-to-income ratios had been trending up since the 1960s, the rate of increase rose dramatically in the period leading up to the financial crisis, from about 100 percent in 2000 to over 130 percent in 2007. Over the same period, residential mortgage debt outstanding more than doubled, from $4.8 trillion to over $10.6 trillion, and consumer debt excluding mortgages rose by nearly $1 trillion, from $1.7 trillion to $2.6 trillion."

            "content": "Good afternoon. I would like to start by thanking Charlie Steindel and the Forecasters Club of New York for their invitation to speak today. It is a particular pleasure for me to address your group: first, because I have known Charlie for many years – we both grew up as economists in the Federal Reserve System – but also because I know I won’t have to explain to you what a difficult task economic forecasting can be, even in the best of times. Still, forecasting is something economists and policymakers must do, so today I will discuss my outlook for the economy and monetary policy. As always, the views I’ll present are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\n\nThe economic expansion began nearly six years ago. While volatility in the monthly data can often obscure underlying trends – and today is no exception – it is important to recognize the significant economic progress the country has made since the darkest days of the global financial crisis and Great Recession. That progress, though slow in coming, has been significantly supported by extraordinary monetary policy accommodation. Underlying economic fundamentals have improved, resulting in an economy that is better able to sustain growth through the inevitable transitory shocks and typical sectoral ups and downs.\n\nFor example, the harsh winter weather took its toll on first-quarter growth this year, just as it did last year. A number of recent data releases have come in below expectations. But my sense in speaking with business contacts is that the economy has resiliency. I expect the slowdown to be temporary and do not view it as pointing to something more fundamental.\n\nMy view reflects the fact that a number of the so-called headwinds have waned. Those headwinds held back growth earlier in the recovery, made the economy more vulnerable to negative shocks, and dampened the transmission of very accommodative monetary policy to the broader economy.\n\nThe Great Recession wreaked havoc on household and business balance sheets. But balance sheets have improved substantially over the expansion. Households have reduced debt levels relative to disposable income from a peak of 130 percent before the recession to about 100 percent today. Very low interest rates mean that households are spending less to service their debt. And thanks to higher prices of equities and houses, households have more than made up the $10 trillion in net worth destroyed in 2008. U.S. businesses are also in better financial condition after deleveraging. They are positioned to expand investment and hiring, and they are doing both.\n\nThe headwind from government spending is also abating. Government spending declined over 2010 to 2013, but began to rise again last year. With tax revenues recovering, state and local governments have been adding to their payrolls and increasing expenditures. The drag from federal government spending has lessened over time, although it is unlikely that such spending will contribute to growth this year.\n\nThe banking sector is regaining its health, with higher capital levels and lower loan delinquencies. Bankers are working through the new regulatory requirements and augmenting systems to better monitor and evaluate risks in their portfolios. Loans to consumers and businesses are now rising and delinquencies and write-offs are at low levels.\n\nAs the headwinds continue to diminish, we now also have a tailwind in the form of lower oil prices. For an oil-importing country like the U.S., lower energy prices will be a net positive. No doubt, the drop in oil prices has led to reduced investment and dislocation in parts of the domestic energy and energy-related sectors. This is already affecting growth, especially in certain regions of the country. But lower energy prices will eventually show up as a positive for consumer, business, and local government spending.\n\nDespite the positives, as is always the case, not all sectors will contribute equally to growth. Residential construction is unlikely to come back strongly this year, but easing of mortgage credit conditions will help support continued moderate improvement in the housing sector.\n\nI also expect net exports to be a drag on U.S. growth this year. The strength of the U.S. economy relative to that of many of our trading partners, as well as interest rate and inflation differentials, has contributed to about a 12 percent appreciation in the broad value of the dollar over the past year. While a stronger dollar means better terms of trade for U.S. consumers and businesses, which is a positive for a growing economy in the longer run, in the near term it can be a drag on U.S. export growth. Accommodative monetary policy actions have brightened the outlook for European economies, but growth and inflation are likely to remain low in the Eurozone for a while longer. Whether the drag from the trade sector will be larger or smaller than I’ve assumed is one of the risks to the forecast.\n\nOn balance, I expect that after a weak first quarter, U.S. economic growth will strengthen, averaging about 3 percent over the remainder of this year and next. This is somewhat above my estimate of 2.5 percent longer-run growth. The above-trend growth I am projecting will support continued improvement in labor markets, one of the factors that will figure into the FOMC’s assessment of the appropriate timing of liftoff.\n\nNotwithstanding the slower job growth reported for March, the economy has seen significant improvement in labor market conditions. Over the past year, average monthly payroll job growth strengthened to about 260,000 jobs, and nonfarm payrolls are now about 2.8 million above their pre-recession peak. I certainly would have liked to have seen more than 126,000 jobs added in March. At the same time, I believe it is premature to read anything about a significant new trend from this number. The FOMC has said that its policy is “data dependent.” But being “data dependent” does not mean reacting to every change in the data. Economic data can be volatile from one month to another. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which publishes the employment report, the confidence interval for the monthly change in payroll employment is on the order of plus or minus 105,000. But we shouldn’t ignore monthly data reports either. My preference is to look at the broader trends in the data and at a number of indicators to get a better sense of developments.\n\nThese other labor market indicators suggest that the weakness in payroll jobs in March is likely temporary. Let me point out a few of these. According to the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) published by the BLS, the rate of job openings is at a cyclical high, and both the hiring and separation rates are up substantially since the end of the recession, meaning that employers are looking to hire, and workers are confident enough to start looking for better jobs.\n\nThe unemployment rate is 5.5 percent, down sharply from its peak of 10 percent in 2009, more than a percentage point below its level last March, and near the range many economists view as its longer-run level. I continue to view the unemployment rate as a useful indicator of labor market conditions. Some people feel its sharp decline is overstating the improvement in labor markets because of the confounding effect of cyclical declines in labor force participation. However, research, including some by my staff at the Cleveland Fed, finds that a large part of the decline we have seen in labor force participation since 2007 reflects a longer-run structural trend driven by factors like changes in demographics.1 Moreover, there have been significant declines in the broader measures of the unemployment rate, such as those that include discouraged workers and those that include people working part-time who would prefer to work full-time, although these have not yet reached their pre-recession levels.\n\nI expect progress to continue, and in my view, taken together, labor market indicators point to an economy that is nearing the Fed’s goal of full employment. Stronger labor markets have led to stronger growth in disposable income. While wage growth remains subdued, it typically lags improvement in labor market conditions. In fact, some analysis we’ve done at the Cleveland Fed shows that in the last three expansions, job gains in industries that pay above-average hourly earnings contributed more to total private-sector job gains as the expansions continued.2 After the Great Recession, it took some time for job gains to materialize. But our analysis indicates that at the national level, since the start of the expansion through 2014, for every job added in industries paying below-average hourly earnings, about 1.3 jobs have been added in industries paying above-average hourly earnings. As employment continues to grow, I anticipate that wages will accelerate and provide additional support for consumer spending.\n\nI also anticipate that inflation will gradually return to the Fed’s 2 percent objective over time, and I continue to monitor inflation developments closely. The sharp decline in oil prices is showing up in much lower headline inflation numbers, and the appreciation of the dollar has put downward pressure on the prices of non-petroleum imports. I expect further declines in inflation in the near term, but those should prove transitory as oil prices stabilize. The FOMC has indicated that, in addition to further improvement in labor markets, a second factor in assessing the appropriate timing of policy liftoff will be reasonable confidence that inflation will move back to our 2 percent objective over the medium term. I am reasonably confident that inflation will gradually return to the Fed’s goal by late 2016 supported by above-trend economic growth.\n\nI base this view on a couple of factors. First, while there has been some pass-through of declines in oil prices and import prices to core measures of inflation that remove volatile food and energy prices, the pass-through has been relatively modest. Core PCE inflation is about 1.4 percent, but the Cleveland Fed’s median CPI measure has remained near 2.25 percent for the past year, and Cleveland staff research has found that this measure has some predictive power for headline inflation over the medium term.3 In addition, inflation expectations are an important factor in forecasting inflation, and in my view, inflation expectations remain well-anchored. The survey-based measures of inflation expectations of both consumers and professional forecasters have been fairly stable. These survey measures have historically done well at capturing longer-run trends in inflation and they have been shown to help in forecasting inflation.4\n\nI am not inclined to take much of a signal about inflation expectations from the recent movements in inflation compensation measured by the spread between yields on Treasury securities and Treasury inflation-protected securities, so-called TIPS. These market-based measures have been affected by flight-to-quality flows into Treasuries from abroad, and the recent changes in inflation compensation likely reflect liquidity effects and changes in inflation risk premiums more so than changes in inflation expectations. The fall in inflation compensation late last year also seems to be closely correlated with the drop in energy prices. Cleveland staff analysis has found that while typical moves in energy prices explain little of the variation in longer-term inflation expectations, the sharp drop in energy prices since last June can account for all of the decline in the Cleveland Fed’s expected inflation measure, which incorporates market data on inflation swaps and Treasury yields, as well as survey information from professional forecasters.5\n\nAs I am sure the professional forecasters in this room know, forecasting inflation with any precision is very difficult. The confidence bands around the forecasts tend to be wide. For example, historical average projection errors across a range of private-sector and government forecasts indicate that the 70 percent confidence interval around a forecast of CPI inflation one year out is about plus or minus 1 percentage point. So when I say I am “reasonably confident” that inflation will return to target by late 2016, it is within that context – I am not requiring higher-than-normal precision around the forecast. I see quite a bit of difference between the situation in Europe, where inflation has been falling and growth has been weak, and the situation in the U.S., where an oil-price shock is driving down headline inflation rates and the economy has been strengthening. We have been climbing out of a very deep recession and have experienced a negative oil-price shock. In that environment, it does not surprise me that inflation has been slow to return to our 2 percent goal. So long as inflation expectations remain anchored and the economy remains on track to return to trend growth or above, as I expect it to, then I am comfortable with it taking some time for inflation to return to our 2 percent objective.\n\nOf course, my projections for the economy are dependent on appropriate monetary policy. So let me turn to that now.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nThe financial crisis and the ensuing deep recession required an aggressive policy response. To support its goals of price stability and full employment, the FOMC has kept the federal funds rate at essentially zero since the end of 2008. It pursued further policy accommodation by conducting large-scale asset-purchase programs to exert downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and by providing more explicit forward guidance on the anticipated future path of interest rates. This extraordinarily accommodative monetary policy has provided important support to the economy, helping to promote stronger labor markets and the pickup in growth that underlies my projection that inflation will gradually return to our goal over time.\n\nBecause monetary policy affects the economy with a lag, policy needs to be forward looking and rates will need to begin to move up from their very low level before we have fully reached our goals. With the fed funds rate at zero, even after the first rate increases, policy will remain very accommodative for some time to come and will continue to promote attainment of our goals. While financial market participants are particularly focused on the timing of the first rate increase, more important for macroeconomic performance is the expected path of policy beyond liftoff because expectations about the future path of policy can affect today’s economic decisions.\n\nThe FOMC’s March Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) indicates that most participants anticipate that it will be appropriate to begin raising rates sometime this year and that the path thereafter will be a gradual one. As shown in the SEP, there is some diversity of views about the appropriate path of policy. Such diversity should not be surprising. It does not reflect different views about our commitment to promote our dual mandate goals of price stability and full employment, but rather different views about realized and anticipated progress toward those goals and about the potential costs and benefits to changes in policy with respect to achieving those goals.\n\nThe economy has reached the point where these evaluations are not easy to make. But this situation should be celebrated because while it does mean policy decisions have become somewhat more complicated, it also reflects the significant economic progress that has been made since the end of the recession.\n\nI supported the changes the FOMC made in its communications in March, which made the June meeting and subsequent meetings viable options for liftoff. There has been cumulative improvement in the economy and our monetary policy stance and communications should reflect that. Over the next couple of months, incoming information on the economy – including the two monthly employment reports we will receive before we meet in June – will help us evaluate whether the softness in the first quarter is indeed transitory, as I currently anticipate, or whether it could be more enduring. If it turns out that the incoming information shows that growth is regaining momentum after the first-quarter slowdown and more broadly supports my forecast, I would be comfortable with liftoff relatively soon.\n\nLet me explain my reasoning, which is based on my assessment that the potential returns to delaying action will soon be outweighed by the potential returns to beginning the normalization process.\n\nFirst, although the Committee has been appropriately cautious, the improvement in underlying economic fundamentals consistent with my outlook indicates that the expansion would not be adversely affected by a gradual increase in the policy rate from zero. Liftoff means a reduction in the degree of extraordinary policy accommodation; it doesn’t mean tight policy. Headwinds are diminishing and above-trend growth is projected over the medium run. In this environment, the equilibrium real interest rate will be rising and the policy rate should rise with it.\n\nSecond, the FOMC has been communicating for some time that we anticipate it will be appropriate for policy normalization to take a gradual path. One benefit of the gradual approach is that it allows for a recalibration of policy over time as some of the uncertainties surrounding the equilibrium interest rate, potential growth rate, and longer-run unemployment rate in the post-crisis world are resolved. I would like our policy actions to be consistent with our communications, and in my view, given the economic outlook, starting the normalization process relatively soon will help ensure that we can, indeed, take a gradual approach. A delay that’s too long might risk having to move rates up more steeply in order to promote attainment of our goals over time.\n\nThird, although not an issue now, too long a delay could also eventually pose risks to financial stability. Holding short rates at zero too long might spur excessive leverage or encourage investors to take on risks they are ill-equipped to manage in a search for yield. The FOMC is carefully monitoring financial markets for any signs of adverse consequences of very low interest rates, and so far, there does not appear to be a threat to financial stability. However, we need to acknowledge that leading up to the financial crisis, some of the vulnerabilities of the financial system were not fully recognized by policymakers. And although we have made significant strides since then, there likely remain gaps in our ability to assess the risks in every part of the financial system. This is not an argument that we should use monetary policy as the main tool to address financial stability concerns. As I’ve said elsewhere, given the state of our knowledge, I would opt to use the macroprudential tools as the first line of defense, since they can be more targeted to the markets and institutions where the risks are emerging.6 However, I do think we should be cognizant of the linkages between nonconventional monetary policy and financial stability when we are making policy decisions.\n\nData-Dependent Monetary Policymaking\n\nThis is my current thinking on appropriate policy, but let me emphasize again that it is dependent on whether economic developments are consistent with my forecast. Let me finish my remarks with some thoughts about data-dependent monetary policymaking. As the FOMC has said, policy is not on a pre-set path. Indeed, as I already mentioned, the SEP gives some information on the diversity of views among FOMC participants about the appropriate path of policy. But that diversity understates the degree of uncertainty about the future path because around each participant’s policy path, there is a confidence band, which reflects the fact that shocks will hit the economy and the policymaker will want to respond to some of those shocks.\n\nIn determining the appropriate timing for liftoff and the path thereafter, the FOMC will be assessing incoming information and evaluating how that information affects the economic outlook and progress toward our goals of maximum employment and price stability. If incoming economic information materially changes our outlook, we will adjust the funds rate up or down, as appropriate. Our policy path is not pre-determined because the future is not pre-determined.\n\nBut “data-dependent” does not mean “non-systematic.” Policymakers should strive to respond in a systematic fashion to incoming information because to the extent that households and businesses understand how policymakers are likely to react to economic developments – whether those developments are anticipated or unanticipated – their policy expectations will better align with those of policymakers. This alignment helps households and firms make better saving, borrowing, investment, and employment decisions, thereby making monetary policy more effective.\n\nIn the late 1980s and 1990s, the public had a pretty good sense of how the FOMC’s policy would respond to economic developments, the so-called reaction function. They were able to get a handle on the FOMC’s reaction function because after the great inflation of the 1970s, the FOMC became more predictable and systematic in how it reacted to changes in economic activity and inflation.7 Because the Great Recession required the Fed to behave in a way quite distinct from its past behavior, there is less understanding about how policymakers are likely to react to incoming economic information than there was earlier.\n\nAs our economy returns to more normal territory and the Fed begins the process of normalizing policy, clear communications that enhance the public’s understanding of the rationale behind the FOMC’s policy decisions will have an important role to play. Stepping back from the explicit forward guidance the FOMC found necessary to use as part of its nonconventional policy tools and moving back to conveying a better sense of the FOMC’s policy reaction function should be viewed as a positive step. It is further evidence that our journey back to a more normal economic and policy-setting environment is well underway."

            "content": "Good morning. It is a privilege to join you at this event organized by the Global Interdependence Center and the Banque de France. I am proud to say that I have had an association with the GIC for many years. I have always valued the insights I’ve gleaned from attending GIC events, and I am very grateful that David Kotok, John Silvia, and their colleagues have invited me to participate in today’s program, which is part of the GIC’s Central Banking Series.\n\nToday’s topic, “New Policies for the Post-Crisis Era,” is quite timely. Although policymakers in the United States and Europe face distinct economic environments, we face similar challenges in determining the most effective policies in those environments. I plan to share a few thoughts about monetary policy on my side of the pond. In particular, I want to discuss some of the FOMC’s plans for policy normalization. But to put that into context, it is important to understand how we got to this point, so I will start with a review of some of the monetary policy actions the Fed took to address the financial crisis and Great Recession. As always, the views I’ll present today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nU.S. Monetary Policy in Extraordinary Times: Interest Rates, Asset Purchases, and Forward Guidance\n\nIn response to the financial crisis and deep recession, the Federal Reserve took some unprecedented policy actions. The Fed’s policy body, the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, has run an extraordinarily accommodative monetary policy to promote our goals of price stability and maximum employment. The FOMC has kept its policy rate – the federal funds rate – at essentially zero since the end of 2008 and it has used forward guidance to communicate the anticipated future path of policy. In addition, to exert downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, it purchased large volumes of longer maturity Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by the housing-related U.S. government-sponsored enterprises, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae.\n\nThis extraordinarily accommodative monetary policy has provided important support to the U.S. economy, helping to promote stronger labor markets and the pickup in growth that underlies my projection of a gradual return of inflation to our 2 percent goal over time. But it has also presented some challenges for the FOMC in returning to a more normal policy-setting framework. To understand those challenges, it helps to review some of the major policy developments since the crisis.\n\nSome of the Federal Reserve’s policy actions were aimed at addressing the stresses that emerged in financial markets in 2007 and 2008. Other policy actions were focused on easing monetary conditions to promote the Fed’s dual mandate goals of price stability and maximum employment.\n\nThe Fed’s first action in August 2007 was to cut the primary credit rate – the rate that banks pay to borrow from the Fed’s discount window – by 50 basis points, to 5.75 percent. This action was taken to encourage liquidity-constrained institutions to borrow from the Fed.\n\nThe following month, the Fed began lowering the fed funds rate target, starting from 5.25 percent before the September 2007 rate-cut and ending at essentially zero in December 2008. This was an unprecedented step into a new monetary policy regime. The fed funds rate has been effectively at the zero lower bound ever since.\n\nDuring this period the Fed also responded to the crisis by implementing a number of unprecedented lending and liquidity programs, but in the interest of time, I won’t review them here.1\n\nThe Fed’s actions helped to stabilize financial markets. However, the real economy had suffered a lot of damage. The U.S. unemployment rate rose from about 5 percent before the recession to its peak of 10 percent in October 2009. Over the course of the recession, core inflation fell from around 2 percent to about 1 percent. Ordinarily, such conditions would warrant further reductions in the policy rate. But with the fed funds rate at its zero lower bound, the Fed engaged in nontraditional policies to support the economy. In particular, between December 2008 and October 2014, to put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, the Fed purchased large volumes of longer maturity U.S. Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities.2\n\nLarge-scale asset purchases are thought to affect longer-term interest rates via a couple of channels. The first channel relies on segmented markets. When financial markets are segmented either because arbitrage is disrupted (as it was during the financial crisis) or because certain market participants prefer particular types of assets, then assets are not perfect substitutes. In such a situation, when the central bank reduces the supply of longer-term assets by purchasing a large volume, the prices of those assets should rise and the term premium on the assets should fall. As investors begin to replace those assets with others, their prices will rise too, so there can be a transmission to assets beyond those being purchased by the central bank.\n\nA second channel through which large-scale asset purchases are thought to affect longer-term interest rates is via a signaling channel. The purchases signal that the central bank intends to pursue a more accommodative policy stance than the public currently expects. Thus, the purchases can be viewed as a form of commitment for policy forward guidance, another policy tool that the Federal Reserve has used during the unusual economic circumstances of the past six years.\n\nThe formulation of the Fed’s forward guidance on the future path of interest rates has changed over time, from qualitative guidance, to calendar dates, to economic thresholds, and to a blend of state-contingent and date-based guidance.3 In extraordinary economic times, like those we’ve experienced in recent years, forward guidance is more than a communications device. It is a tool of monetary policy that has the potential to increase the degree of monetary policy accommodation, especially when interest rates are essentially at their zero lower bound. By reducing uncertainty about the future path of policy, forward guidance can help lower interest rates by reducing the premiums investors demand to compensate them for interest-rate uncertainty.\n\nIn addition, in theory, if the central bank indicates that the future path of short-term interest rates will be low for a long time – perhaps lower and for longer than would have been consistent with the central bank’s past behavior – this can also put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, thereby spurring current economic activity. According to the theory, if people believe that the central bank is committed to keeping rates very low, they will expect higher economic activity and higher inflation in the future. When households, businesses, and market participants are assured of better economic prospects in the future, they should be more willing to make investments in capital and labor today rather than delaying them, and this will help the current economy.4\n\nThere has been considerable study of the effectiveness of these extraordinary policy tools, especially the Fed’s large-scale asset purchase programs. Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer recently reviewed the empirical evidence on how effective the Fed’s purchase programs have been in lowering longer-term interest rates, and discussed the results of a recent Board of Governors staff study on the effectiveness of the purchase programs along with forward guidance on the macroeconomy.5 In general, the studies find that the Fed’s various asset purchase programs have lowered longer-term yields and the staff study finds that purchases and forward guidance have had an impact on the macroeconomy. But as the Vice Chair pointed out, estimated magnitudes vary quite a bit across studies and are surrounded by wide bands of uncertainty.\n\nThere is, however, no uncertainty about the dramatic change in the size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet as a result of the purchase programs. Assets on the Fed’s balance sheet have increased five-fold, from less than $900 billion in July 2007 to about $4.5 trillion today. On the liability side, banks have more than $2.5 trillion in reserves at the Fed, most of it in excess of that required to meet reserve requirements. In terms of composition, before the actions taken to combat the crisis, about 90 percent of the Fed’s assets were Treasuries and none were agency securities; now about 55 percent of the Fed’s assets are Treasuries and almost 40 percent are agency MBS. And of the Fed’s Treasury holdings, over 50 percent have a maturity of more than 5 years compared to about 20 percent before the crisis. Today, the Fed holds very few short-term Treasury securities.\n\nThe changes in the Fed’s balance sheet as well as the evolution of the Fed’s forward guidance have raised some challenges about how to move back from extraordinary monetary policy to ordinary monetary policy, what the Fed has called normalization. In my remaining minutes, I would like to discuss some of the Fed’s plans for addressing those challenges.\n\nMoving from Extraordinary Back to Ordinary\n\nThe FOMC has been preparing for policy normalization for quite some time. The FOMC first laid out exit strategy principles in June 2011; these were updated last September to take into account the changes in the Fed’s balance sheet. Just as it did before the Great Recession, the FOMC plans to implement monetary policy by adjusting short-term interest rates. It will communicate changes in the stance of policy by changing the target range for the fed funds rate.\n\nBut because the level of excess reserves held by banks is now much larger, the tools the FOMC will use to move the funds rate into the target range will be different than before the crisis. In particular, in October 2008 Congress gave the Fed the authority to pay interest on the reserve balances that banks and other depository institutions hold at the Fed. The Fed will use the interest rate it pays on excess reserves, the IOER rate, as the main tool for moving the funds rate into the target range. Raising the IOER rate will put upward pressure on the fed funds rate because banks will be unlikely to accept a rate in the market lower than the one they could get by depositing their funds at the Fed. We expect that while reserves are so plentiful and because not all financial institutions holding reserves are eligible to receive interest, the fed funds rate will trade somewhat below the IOER rate.\n\nIn addition to IOER, the Fed will use other tools, as needed, to ensure adequate control of the policy rate. One of these tools is an overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility. Overnight reverse repos, or ON RRPs, involve the Fed selling securities from its large portfolio of assets with an agreement to buy them back the next day at a pre-determined price from eligible counterparties, including banks, primary dealers, money funds, and government-sponsored enterprises. By offering a safe overnight asset for a broader array of money market participants, some of whom are not eligible to receive interest on reserves, overnight reverse repos should help put a firmer floor on the fed funds rate. These counterparties should be reluctant to lend their liquidity in the market at rates lower than what they could get at the Fed via this facility. The Fed has been testing overnight reverse repos, and the results to date suggest that they have been helpful in firming the floor on money market rates.\n\nThe FOMC has indicated that the overnight reverse repo facility will be used only to the extent necessary and will be phased out when no longer needed to help control short-term interest rates. This will help to ensure that the facility doesn’t lead financial institutions to permanently change the way they do financial intermediation. In addition, the Fed has been testing usage caps on overnight reverse repos and other design features. These would help mitigate the possibility that during times of financial stress the facility would attract liquidity from the market, thereby increasing the level of stress in the market. And the Fed is considering other tools, like term deposits and term RRPs, that could absorb some of the excess reserves in the banking system.\n\nThe Fed’s ability to pay interest on excess reserves, along with supplementary tools like overnight reverse repos, will allow the Fed to move interest rates up to target when it is appropriate to do so, despite the large size of the Fed’s balance sheet.\n\nOver the longer run, the Fed’s balance sheet will return to a more normal size and composition. The FOMC intends to reduce security holdings in a gradual and predictable way, primarily through ending reinvestment of principal payments on securities it holds and letting the securities mature and run off the balance sheet. At this point, the FOMC doesn’t anticipate selling the agency mortgage-backed securities on its balance sheet as part of the normalization process, although it might engage in limited sales in the longer run to reduce or eliminate residual holdings.\n\nThe evolution of the language in the FOMC’s statement, in particular its forward rate guidance, also poses some challenges for the FOMC. While explicit forward guidance was used as a policy tool during the recession and earlier in the recovery, in more normal times, away from the zero lower bound, I believe forward guidance should be viewed more as a communications device. As such, I would like to see the forward guidance evolve over time to give more information about the conditions we systematically assess in calibrating the stance of policy to the economy’s actual progress and anticipated progress toward our dual-mandate goals. It would articulate the considerations the Committee would take into account when determining future changes in policy, as well as information to help the public anticipate how policy is likely to change in response to changes in economic developments that affect the economic outlook. To the extent that households and businesses understand policymakers’ reaction function, their policy expectations will better align with those of policymakers, thereby making policy more effective. As normalization proceeds, I expect we will be able to make more progress along these lines.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, the Federal Reserve took some unprecedented policy actions in response to the financial crisis and deep recession. These extraordinary actions helped support progress toward the Fed’s goals of price stability and maximum employment. At the same time, they present some challenges for the return to ordinary monetary policymaking. But the FOMC has plans to address those challenges. It has laid out how it anticipates conducting monetary policy during normalization. In addition, the FOMC’s forward guidance on the future path of policy has been evolving. Most times in life, moving from extraordinary to ordinary is considered a bad thing. In the case of monetary policy, such a move should be viewed as a good thing – because it means conditions are in place for a sustainable economic expansion with maximum employment and price stability."

            "content": "Good afternoon. I thank the National Association for Business Economics for inviting me to participate in this year’s Economic Policy Conference. As an economist and policymaker, I appreciate learning the perspective of market and business economists. Just as the different views expressed by my colleagues around the FOMC table help to inform my own policy views, the insights of economists like you, whose business it is to forecast economic developments, help to shape my own economic projections.\n\nToday, I will present my outlook for the economy and monetary policy, and then turn to the important role clear communications can play in setting monetary policy. As always, the views I’ll present today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\n\nIt has been almost six years since the start of the recovery from the Great Recession. Although it hasn’t been the smoothest of rides, the economy has made significant progress. While there are a number of risks to the forecast – which you business economists know is always the case – I believe the improvement in underlying fundamentals points to an economy that has built sustainable momentum.\n\nMy optimism stems from the fact that a number of the so-called headwinds that held back growth earlier in the recovery and dampened the transmission of very accommodative monetary policy to the economy have waned. The Great Recession wreaked havoc on household and business balance sheets. But balance sheets have improved substantially over the expansion. Households have reduced debt levels relative to disposable income from a peak of 130 percent before the recession to about 100 percent today. Very low interest rates mean that households are spending less to service their debt. And thanks to higher prices of equities and houses, households have more than made up the $10 trillion in net worth destroyed in 2008. U.S. businesses are also in better financial condition after deleveraging. They are positioned to expand investment and hiring, and both are happening.\n\nThe headwind from government spending is also abating. Government spending declined over 2010 to 2013, but began to rise again last year. With tax revenues recovering, state and local governments have been adding to their payrolls and increasing expenditures. The drag from federal government spending has lessened over time.\n\nThe banking sector is regaining its health, with higher capital levels and lower loan delinquencies. Bankers are working through the new regulatory requirements and augmenting systems to better monitor and evaluate risks in their portfolios. Loans to consumers and businesses are now rising and delinquencies and write-offs are at low levels.\n\nAs the headwinds continue to diminish, we now also have a tailwind in the form of lower oil prices. No doubt, the drop in oil prices has led to reduced investment and dislocation in parts of the domestic energy sector, and this is affecting growth in certain regions of the country. However, for an oil-importing country like the U.S., the benefits of lower energy prices will offset the costs and result in a net positive for the U.S. economy in terms of consumer, business, and local government spending.\n\nDespite the positives, I should note that not all sectors will be equal contributors to growth. I don’t expect housing to come back strongly this year. However, easing of mortgage credit conditions will help support continued moderate improvement in housing.\n\nNet exports are also unlikely to contribute much to U.S. growth this year. The relative strength of the U.S. economy compared to that of many of our trading partners has contributed to a more than 10 percent appreciation in the broad value of the dollar over the past year and has meant a slowdown in U.S. export growth. Accommodative monetary policy actions have brightened the outlook for European economies, but growth and inflation are likely to remain low in the Eurozone for a while longer.\n\nIn addition, the harsh weather that has plagued most of the U.S. this winter will likely be a drag on growth in the first quarter. But I believe the effect will be temporary, as it was last winter. While some of the regional manufacturing surveys have come in a bit softer of late, I expect that softening reflects temporary factors and typical month-to-month variability rather than something more fundamental.\n\nOn balance, my modal outlook is for the U.S. economy to grow at about a 3 percent pace over 2015 and 2016. This is somewhat above my estimate of 2.5 percent longer-run growth, and is strong enough to support continued improvement in labor markets.\n\nIndeed, we have seen a significant improvement in labor market conditions. Last year, average monthly job growth strengthened to 260,000 jobs. Over the first two months of this year, average monthly gains increased again, to 267,000 jobs, despite the chilly winter weather. Nonfarm payrolls are now about 2.7 million above their pre-recession peak.\n\nIn February, the unemployment rate fell to 5.5 percent, down sharply from its peak of 10 percent in 2009 and more than a full percentage point lower than it was last February. I continue to view the unemployment rate as a useful indicator of labor market conditions. Some people feel its sharp decline is overstating the improvement in labor markets because of the confounding effect of cyclical declines in labor force participation. However, research, including some by my staff at the Cleveland Fed, finds that a large part of the decline we have seen in labor force participation since 2007 reflects a longer-run structural trend driven by factors like the aging of the population.1 Aging will also lead to declines in the employment-to-population ratio over time, yet last year, we saw a nice increase in this ratio as the acceleration in hiring was enough to overcome the effect of demographics. In addition, although they haven’t yet reached their pre-recession levels, we’ve seen significant declines in the broader measures of the unemployment rate such as those that include discouraged workers and those that include people working part-time who would prefer to work full-time.\n\nIn my view, taken together, labor market indicators point to an economy that is near the Fed’s goal of full employment. I expect the unemployment rate to decline to 5-1/4 percent or lower by the end of this year, somewhat below my longer-run estimate of 5-1/2 percent. Although wage growth has been subdued, it typically lags improvement in labor market conditions, and as employment continues to grow, I anticipate that wages will begin to accelerate and provide support for stronger consumer spending.\n\nConsumer price inflation has also been running below the Fed’s 2 percent objective, and I continue to monitor inflation developments closely. The sharp decline in oil prices is showing up in much lower headline inflation numbers, and the appreciation of the dollar has led to lower prices of imports. I expect further declines in inflation in the near term, but those should prove transitory as oil prices stabilize. I am reasonably confident that inflation will gradually return to the Fed’s goal by the end of next year as above-trend economic growth continues.\n\nI base this view on a couple of factors. First, while there has been some pass-through of oil-price declines to core measures of inflation that remove volatile food and energy prices, the pass-through has been relatively modest. For example, the Cleveland Fed’s median CPI measure has remained near 2-1/4 percent since last April. Cleveland staff research has found that this measure has some predictive power for headline inflation over the medium term.2 In addition, in my view, inflation expectations remain well-anchored. The survey-based measures of inflation expectations of both consumers and of professional forecasters have been fairly stable. These survey measures have historically done well at capturing longer-run trends in inflation and they have been shown to help forecast inflation.3 I am not inclined to take much of a signal about inflation expectations from the recent declines in market-based measures of inflation compensation based on the spread between yields on 10-year Treasury securities and 10-year Treasury inflation-protected securities, so-called TIPS. These market measures are likely being affected by the flight-to-quality flows into Treasuries from abroad, reflecting liquidity effects and changes in inflation risk premiums more so than inflation expectations.\n\nIt is important to recognize that forecasting inflation with any precision is very difficult. The confidence bands around the forecasts tend to be wide. For example, historical average projection errors across a range of private-sector and government forecasts indicate that the 70 percent confidence interval around a forecast of CPI inflation one year out is about plus or minus 1 percentage point.4 So when I say I am “reasonably confident” that inflation will return to target by the end of next year, it is within that context – I am not requiring higher-than-normal precision around the forecast. I see quite a bit of difference between the situation in Europe, where inflation has been falling and growth has been weak, and the situation in the U.S., where an oil-price shock is driving down headline inflation rates and the economy is strengthening. We have been climbing out of a very deep recession and have experienced a negative oil-price shock. So long as inflation expectations remain anchored and growth continues to be at or above trend, I am comfortable with it taking some time for inflation to return to our 2 percent goal. Of course, my projection is dependent on appropriate monetary policy, so let me discuss that next.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nThe financial crisis and the ensuing deep recession required an aggressive policy response. To support its goals of price stability and full employment, the FOMC has kept the federal funds rate at essentially zero since the end of 2008 and it conducted asset-purchase programs to exert downward pressure on long-term interest rates. This extraordinarily accommodative monetary policy has provided important support to the economy, helping to promote stronger labor markets and the pickup in growth that underlies my projection of a gradual return of inflation to our goal over time.\n\nBecause monetary policy affects the economy with a lag, policy needs to be forward looking and rates will need to begin to move up before we have fully reached our goals. Even after the first rate increase, policy will remain very accommodative for some time and this will promote attainment of our policy goals. The economy is now on firmer footing and our monetary policy stance should reflect that. Indeed, if incoming economic information continues to support my forecast, I would be comfortable with liftoff in the first half of this year. I would like our policy statement to allow for this possibility. However, I also want to emphasize, as the FOMC has, that policy is not on a pre-set path. Both liftoff and the path of policy thereafter will be based on incoming information to the extent that it affects the economic outlook and progress toward our goals of maximum employment and price stability.\n\nAt next week’s FOMC meeting, participants will have the opportunity to discuss their various views of the economic outlook and assessments of appropriate policy and I am looking forward to a fruitful discussion among my FOMC colleagues. One of the great strengths of the Fed is its structure. It is a decentralized central bank, which is independent within the government but not independent from the government. The Fed’s structure is one of balance. It includes representation from across the nation, balancing public-sector and private-sector interests, and Wall Street and Main Street concerns. The various viewpoints expressed in our discussions of economic conditions, models, and forecasts help the FOMC set monetary policy in pursuit of our congressionally mandated goals on behalf of the public interest.\n\nSince the FOMC has been given the responsibility to set monetary policy, it is incumbent upon us to explain the rationale for our policy decisions. The Committee has been on a journey toward increased transparency for quite some time. As the time for policy normalization grows nearer, clear communication is becoming ever more important. The better we can communicate our monetary policy framework and the basis for policy decisions, the more likely we can avoid undesirable disruptions and turbulence that could result from misunderstandings as we progress to a more normal policy stance. Of course, clear communication is not without challenges. Concepts like data dependency and forward-looking monetary policymaking might be fairly routine for business economists like you, but they are tougher to explain to the public at large. I would like to finish up my talk today with four concrete suggestions for how we might improve our monetary policy communications over the medium to longer run.\n\nSteps Toward Clearer Communications Over the Medium to Longer Run\n\nFirst, presenting a forecast that could serve as the benchmark for understanding the FOMC’s policy actions and post-meeting statements would be an aid to communication. Such a forecast would make it easier to explain how the economic outlook is dependent on the future path of monetary policy. It would clarify that for the FOMC to achieve its policy goals over the longer run, rates will need to begin rising before both goals are fully attained. Several central banks publish a forecast as part of their communications; in some cases, it is the policymakers’ forecast and in other cases it is a staff forecast. The FOMC experimented with developing a forecast representing the consensus of the Committee in 2012.5 But it proved difficult to reach a consensus on a consensus forecast. I believe there would be value in having such a benchmark forecast, and I think it should remain on our longer-run agenda of communication enhancements. But I also realize it will not be an easy task to accomplish.\n\nIn the meantime, the Summary of Economic Projections – or SEP – has been playing an important role in conveying the FOMC’s economic outlook. Four times a year, the SEP provides information on the range of projections of real output growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation across participants, as well as the policy paths that individual participants view as appropriate in achieving those projections.\n\nMy second suggestion for improving communications is to link the variables in the SEP. That is, instead of presenting ranges, the SEP could indicate what each policymaker is projecting for growth, unemployment, and inflation, and what policy path he or she believes will achieve those outcomes. This could be done without revealing the identities of the participants. Linking the variables would convey information on each individual policymaker’s view of the relationship among the variables and on his or her monetary policy reaction function – how the outlook is expected to play out under the policy path chosen.\n\nMy third suggestion is to enhance the SEP by providing more information on policymakers’ views about the uncertainty around their projections. As I discussed earlier, error bands around forecasted variables can be wide; they can also vary over the business cycle. It might seem counterintuitive that presenting information on uncertainty would actually help clarify things. In general, people like certainty. But the future path of policy is not certain because the evolution of the economy is not certain. In my view, giving the public a better sense of the probabilities associated with the projections would help them understand the current forecast, differences among forecasters, and subsequent changes to the forecast.\n\nMy fourth suggestion pertains to the structure of the FOMC’s post-meeting statement. The statement continues to serve the Committee well. But I believe we could simplify its organization to better illuminate that policy is being formulated based on the economic outlook and on realized and anticipated progress toward our policy goals. In this reorganized statement, economic developments would be discussed – not merely the changes in conditions but also the Committee’s assessment of whether these changes are material enough to have affected the Committee’s economic outlook. There would be more consistency about the conditions we systematically assess in calibrating the stance of policy so that the public would get a better sense of the Committee’s reaction function over time. The statement would then summarize the Committee’s outlook for progress toward its policy goals and the risks to that outlook. Of course, the outlook is dependent on the current and future stance of policy. So the statement would then describe the current stance of policy and any policy actions taken. This would include the funds rate, asset reinvestments, and any other policy tools being used. The statement would conclude by providing some information on the future path of policy. Depending on economic circumstances, this might be explicit forward guidance that serves as a policy tool, as it did during the Great Recession and early part of the recovery. But during more normal policy-setting times, the statement would, instead, provide a rationale for future policy decisions. It would articulate the considerations the Committee would take into account when determining future changes in policy, as well as information to help the public anticipate how policy is likely to change in response to changes in economic developments that affect the economic outlook. To the extent that households and businesses understand policymakers’ reaction function, their policy expectations will better align with those of policymakers, thereby making policy more effective.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, the economy is making substantial progress toward the Federal Reserve’s goals of maximum employment and price stability. If incoming information is consistent with my forecast, I believe it will soon be appropriate to begin raising the fed funds rate from its extraordinarily low level. The path of rates thereafter will continue to depend on the assessment of incoming information relative to the economic outlook and on realized and expected progress toward our monetary policy goals. Although policy communication will likely always remain somewhat of a challenge, I believe the benefits of clearer communication are worth the effort. Better communication is not merely an aspirational goal. I have offered some concrete suggestions on how we might make progress over the medium to longer run in improving our policy communications and, with it, the effectiveness of our monetary policy."

            "content": "It is a real pleasure for me to participate in this year’s Monetary Policy Forum. As an attendee of this event for the past several years, I have been very impressed with the organizers’ ability to choose a year in advance the topic that turns out to be the issue policymakers are grappling with at the time the forum rolls around. Once again, the organizers have been able to do this, with the important paper by Jim Hamilton, Ethan Harris, Jan Hatzius, and Ken West. Another example of the value of being forward looking when it comes to monetary policy!\n\nIn the time I have, I will discuss some of the highlights of the paper – some of which the authors have laid out as “lessons learned” from history. I’ll focus on measurement and implications for policy. Taking their lead, I’ll present five of my own lessons spurred by reading their interesting paper. Of course, the views I’ll present today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nMeasurement\n\nThe authors have done a very good job of examining the question, “Is there a new neutral or equilibrium real federal funds rate?” This is a deceptively simple question that hits on bigger issues such as whether the U.S. has drifted into “secular stagnation” and what the implications for monetary policy normalization are.\n\nThe first part of the paper is a thorough analysis of what the historical data and record can tell us. The authors have amassed an impressive data set on 21 countries, with annual data in some cases going back to 1858 and quarterly data back to 1958. Where the data are available, the authors use the discount rate set by the central bank as the interest rate of interest; in some cases, they have spliced together series. For example, in the U.S. for the annual dataset they use the discount rate over 1914-1953 and the average fed funds rate during the last month of the year from 1954 to present. As anyone who has put together data sets for research knows, this effort is not trivial.\n\nOf course before the empirical analysis can commence, it is important to understand what is meant by the “equilibrium federal funds rate” or more generally, the “equilibrium policy rate.” It is a fuzzy concept. There are several definitions in the literature. Moreover, several different terms in the literature, such as the equilibrium rate of interest, natural rate of interest, and neutral rate of interest, refer to the same object.\n\nThe paper’s definition is one that many economists use: the equilibrium real rate, r*, is that level of the policy rate that is consistent with full employment and stable inflation in the medium term. Sometimes instead of full employment a zero output gap or growth at potential is used. Presumably the stable inflation rate referred to is the policymakers’ target inflation rate. What’s undefined here is the meaning of “medium term.”\n\nThis r* is an important concept in monetary policy as it gives one a way to think about the degree of policy accommodation. For example, in a Taylor rule,\n\n\n\n\n\nThe big issue is that the equilibrium real rate, r*, is unobserved. Incidentally, so are the level of potential output and the natural rate of unemployment, which loom large in monetary policy discussions. The fact that r* is unobserved has been recognized by many economists over many decades. The authors explore several time-series approaches to estimating the real rate.\n\nOne approach is to estimate the real rate using averages over a cycle or longer of estimates of the ex ante real rate, defined as the nominal interest rate minus expected inflation,\n\nIf policymakers are setting the nominal interest rate, so that on average, the output gap (or unemployment gap) is zero, inflation is equal to target, and expected inflation is equal to target, then the ex ante real interest rate will equal the equilibrium real rate as defined by the authors. To see this, suppose policymakers are following a simple Taylor rule, then:\n\n\n\nThe authors’ empirical investigation indicates that estimates of the ex ante real rate have varied considerably over time. They show that the correlations between estimates of the ex ante real rate and output growth vary over the sample period and are sensitive to the time period examined and countries included. They also include a narrative review of the history of the U.S. ex ante real rate. This is interesting because it points out some of the factors that theory tells us might influence the real rate of interest. Based on this analysis, drawing on the connection between the ex ante real rate and the equilibrium rate, the authors conclude that it would be a mistake to estimate the equilibrium rate using long historical averages (this is their history lesson 2).\n\nIt is hard to dispute this and I don’t find it surprising. Indeed, Wicksell, in his seminal work Interest and Prices, says:\n\n- Knut Wicksell, Interest and Prices, 1898, p. 106\n\nWhich brings me to my first lesson from the paper:\n\nThe equilibrium real interest rate is an equilibrium concept. As such, it will vary with conditions that affect the demand for investment and the supply of savings. Because of this, it is difficult to estimate the equilibrium real rate using statistical approaches.\n\nAveraging real interest rates to estimate the equilibrium rate assumes that, on average, the real rate equals the equilibrium rate; that is, on average inflation and inflation expectations are at goal and output is at potential. But computing the average for a sample period for which this isn’t the case will yield biased estimates. For example, a sample period dominated by the 1970s in the U.S. would underestimate the equilibrium real rate since it was a period of rising inflation and growth above potential, implying the actual real rate was below the equilibrium real rate.\n\nSeveral other problems in estimating the equilibrium real rate, especially in real time, are discussed by Clark and Kozicki (2005) and Wu (2005). For example, using a filter, like the Kalman filter, to extract the trend based on a model such as the one in Laubach and Williams (2003) runs into problems. If we want to estimate the equilibrium rate today, we can use historical data, but we have no data on what will happen tomorrow. We face a one-sided filtering problem. As we step through time, we will have data beyond today which can be brought to bear in estimating today’s equilibrium rate, and that estimate could look quite a bit different from today’s estimate based only on data up to today. You can see the size of such discrepancies in Exhibit 1.\n\nWe should also keep in mind the data revisions that occur over time in some of the important macroeconomic variables such as output and PCE inflation. The authors of the current paper are using final revised data for their estimations, but the more recent data will be undergoing further revisions. These data revisions make it difficult to estimate the real rate in real time, adding another source of uncertainty to estimates. Clark and Kozicki (2005) show that the data revisions, as well as filtering, can lead to sizable revisions in estimates of the real rate.\n\nThis measurement issue is related to the discussion of secular stagnation. As the authors suggest, we have to be careful in making inferences from the time series. For example, as shown in Exhibit 2, if we look at the authors’ chart of the ex ante real rate, we see a decline in recent years. We might be tempted to extrapolate that decline and conclude that we will experience a lower real rate and lower potential growth in the future – that is, secular stagnation. But we saw a similar decline of the ex ante real rate in the 1930s and 1940s, yet potential growth moved up in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nThis discussion of the issues that arise when using a purely statistical approach leads me to a second lesson:\n\nSince the equilibrium real rate is endogenous, a theoretical model (or models) should be brought to bear to better understand the factors that will influence supply and demand and, therefore, the equilibrium rate. The natural rate in a DSGE model would be a good yardstick for evaluating the stance of monetary policy.\n\nI find dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models helpful in thinking about the economy. Not because they necessarily produce the best economic forecasts but because they provide an organized way to examine certain policy questions owing to their structural nature. Because they are structural models, they are a tool for better understanding the general equilibrium aspects of the economy. In contrast to reduced-form models, they build up from micro foundations, specifying agents’ objectives and constraints. And because agents are forward looking, expectations of future economic conditions and policy play a key role in determining economic outcomes. These expectations are endogenous and help determine agents’ decisions today, and therefore current economic outcomes. The models are stochastic in nature and economic shocks to supply and demand – e.g., changes in productivity, changes to the price of oil, changes to the rate of time preference, changes to the efficiency of financial intermediation – will generate economic fluctuations. Another important ingredient in the models is the presence of nominal rigidities – firms are price and wage setters, but are assumed not to be able to adjust prices instantaneously in response to a shock. So prices and wages exhibit some stickiness.\n\nWithin the context of a New Keynesian DSGE model, the equilibrium real rate of interest, or natural rate of interest, is that interest rate that keeps the economy’s output at the level that would prevail if all wages and prices were flexible and in the absence of shocks to wage markups, price markups, technology, and preferences. In much of the DSGE literature, this level of output is called the efficient level of output, and it corresponds to the concept of the potential level of output in other models. It is this equilibrium rate that provides a metric for measuring the stance of monetary policy in a DSGE model (see Barsky, Justiniano, and Melosi, 2014).\n\nWhile the definition of the equilibrium rate in the DSGE model abstracts from some shocks, the economy is subject to a large number of other types of shocks. So this theoretical approach suggests that the equilibrium real rate should vary over time. Moreover, the equilibrium rate is likely to be more variable than the estimates derived from statistical trends, since the theoretical concept of efficient output is more variable than the statistical concept of potential output derived from a trend in the output data.\n\nThus, I agree with the authors’ basic premise that the equilibrium rate should move with the economy. But I get there via a somewhat different route.\n\nWhile the DSGE or other structural models provide a conceptual advance, we do not have a definitive model. Models vary with respect to the types of shocks and number of sectors incorporated. Estimates of the equilibrium rate will be model dependent. Hence, the uncertainty uncovered by the authors using the statistical approach is not resolved in this model-based approach.\n\nImplications for Monetary Policy\n\nAfter documenting the large amount of uncertainty around estimates of the equilibrium real rate, the authors then turn to the implications for monetary policy – as a general proposition and for current policy. The authors make a compelling case using simulations of the Fed’s FRB/US model that when the central bank is uncertain about r*, incorporating inertia into the policy rule it would use if r* were certain, i.e., basing the current policy rate prescription less on the uncertain measure of the equilibrium real rate and more on the past level of the policy rate, can lead to lower economic losses.\n\nAs the authors point out, this result is consistent with work by Orphanides and Williams (2002, 2007) and others in the literature that shows that over-reliance on mismeasured objects such as output gaps, unemployment gaps, or equilibrium real rates can lead to poor policy decisions that induce undesirable fluctuations in the economy. Inertial policies can reduce the direct effect of the mismeasurement of r*, but they can also carry forward the policy errors generated by mismeasurement of the output gap. So it is not a given that inertia is always better; it will depend on the degree of mismeasurement and the structure of the model economy used in the analysis.\n\nThis leads me to a third lesson:\n\nMismeasurement may be one reason to favor more inertial policy rules, but there are others, including the zero lower bound.\n\nFor example, Reifschneider and Williams (2000) show that when the policymaker has perfect credibility, then augmenting a baseline rule to incorporate a response to periods in which the rule had been constrained by the zero lower bound can reduce the bad effects of the zero bound. This would have the impact of delaying an increase in the policy rate from the zero lower bound.\n\nIn Exhibit 3 I show this type of augmentation using the simple Taylor 1993 rule as the base rule. (Note, I chose Taylor 1993 for illustrative purposes and because it is simple and well known, not because I believe policy should necessarily follow this particular rule.)\n\nThe top panel illustrates the rule for r* = 2 and the bottom panel for r* = 1.5. In both cases, the rules suggest a liftoff but one that is delayed from what the standard Taylor rule indicates. The longer the zero lower bound has been binding, the longer the delay. Essentially, the rule keeps the funds rate unusually low for a period of time immediately after an episode of zero interest rates; that is, it incorporates a Woodford (2012) period.\n\nWhile I find the authors make a plausible case for using more inertial rules when r* is measured with error, I find their conclusions for current policy less salient. In exercises such as this, one must generate a baseline from which to measure differences. The authors assume that Fed policymakers are using the Taylor (1999) rule, so their conclusions about the exact timing of liftoff are contingent on that assumption.\n\nWhich brings me to my fourth lesson:\n\n“More inertia” is a relative statement. Other factors argue against being too inert. These include less than perfect commitment and communication, (unmodeled) implications for financial stability, and uncertainty aversion.\n\nThe results on inertia depend on agents understanding the policymaker’s reaction function and the policymaker being committed to following that reaction function. If the policymaker hasn’t effectively communicated and the public doesn’t understand the reason for the central bank’s policy path, a delay in liftoff with steeper path after liftoff may be misinterpreted. The public might believe that central bankers are holding rates low for longer because they have a gloomy outlook; this would not necessarily yield better economic outcomes.\n\nIn addition, while I am a firm proponent of using models to inform our policy decisions, there is some bias in the models. Our typical models can give us a pretty good sense of the employment and inflation costs of lifting off sooner rather than later. But they are less likely to be able to quantify the costs of waiting too long. For example, our models aren’t well enough developed to allow us to quantify the risks to financial stability of holding rates at zero for a long time, yet the crisis showed us that financial instability comes with a very high cost.\n\nThe results on inertia also depend on how policymakers react to the uncertainty they encounter. In the paper, policymakers make policy decisions assuming a particular value of r* in their policy rule. If it turns out that that measure is incorrect, then there are economic losses. The authors show that a policy rule that incorporates inertia can lead to lower losses based on a quadratic loss function.\n\nBut the world and decision making are more complicated than that. Policymakers know they don’t know the precise value of r*. Rather than a point distribution, they have beliefs over the value of r*. Only if their beliefs are described by a single distribution and the world is described by a linear-quadratic model would they base decisions on the mean of that distribution. Instead, if policymakers are aware of their own uncertainty about their models and data, and they are averse to uncertainty, then inertia need not be optimal. Giannoni (2002, 2007) shows that with forward-looking agents, if there is model uncertainty, then uncertainty-averse policymakers will follow a min-max strategy that aims to minimize the costs of worst-case scenarios. Their optimal policy rule will react more strongly to fluctuations in inflation and the output gap than if there were no uncertainty. Policymakers would put more weight on stabilizing inflation and the output gap and less weight on stabilizing the nominal interest rate.\n\nThis brings me to my final lesson:\n\nImplications for the timing of liftoff depend on the rule adopted. A difference rule is an alternative to inertia for handling mismeasured levels of the equilibrium real rate and the natural rate of unemployment. The policy path from such a rule differs from that of the inertial rule.\n\nA difference rule, such as those suggested by Orphanides and Williams (2002), would allow the policymaker to avoid having to estimate natural rates of interest or unemployment. As seen in the top panel of Exhibit 4, where the red line is a smoothed version of the difference rule, such a rule would have avoided the mistakes of the 1970s, when policymakers kept the policy rate too low. The bottom panel zooms in on the current period. Such a rule would call for higher interest rates today.\n\nTo conclude, I really appreciate the opportunity to comment on this fine paper. I recommend that everyone read it. The authors have provided a lot of food for thought. I have discussed five lessons I drew from their paper, but their work also underscores the importance of remembering what we don’t know and of remaining humble when it comes to setting monetary policy.\n\nSource: Figure 3 from Tao Wu, “Estimating the ‘Neutral’ Real Interest Rate in Real Time,” Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Economic Letter, No. 2005-27, October 21, 2005.\n\nSource: Figure 3 from Tao Wu, “Estimating the ‘Neutral’ Real Interest Rate in Real Time,” Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Economic Letter, No. 2005-27, October 21, 2005.\n\nSource: Figure 3 p. 407: Todd E.

            "content": "Good afternoon. I thank the Ohio Bankers League for inviting me to participate in this year’s economic summit. It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak with so many leaders from the state’s banking community. I’m glad to be here with my colleague Steve Jenkins, whom many of you know well and who will be speaking later today. It is also great to be in Columbus, where it seems as if the euphoria from The Ohio State University’s national championship isn’t going to wear off any time soon.\n\nToday, I will share my views on the outlook for the U.S. economy and monetary policy in 2015. Given the important role financial institutions play in the economy, I also want to offer some perspectives on banking supervision and regulation. Of course, the views I’ll present today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\n\nThe U.S. economy begins 2015 in its sixth year of expansion. The trip out of the Great Recession hasn’t broken any speed limits. For most of the journey, the economy has been traveling at a relatively slow to moderate pace, and it’s taken several rest stops along the way. But the recent data on the real side of the economy have been encouraging. There are accumulating signs that the economy is building momentum and that, this time, a pickup in speed will be sustained because the underlying fundamentals have improved.\n\nLast year’s severe winter helped spur an annualized decline of about 2 percent in real output in the first quarter. Growth rebounded to about 4 percent over the remainder of last year, quite a bit higher than the average growth rate of around 2 percent over the prior three years. Many of the so-called headwinds that held back the pace of growth earlier in the expansion and dampened the effect of very accommodative monetary policy on the economy have abated, suggesting that the economic momentum at the start of this year is likely to be sustained.\n\nOne of those headwinds has been the deleveraging that households and businesses had to do after the Great Recession. Consumer balance sheets have improved significantly over the expansion. Household debt relative to disposable personal income peaked at 130 percent prior to the recession but is now closer to 100 percent and has leveled out over the past couple of years. Very low interest rates mean that households are spending less to service their debt. And thanks to higher prices of equities and houses, households have more than made up the $10 trillion in net worth destroyed in 2008. The rise in home prices means that fewer households are underwater on their mortgages and mortgage delinquencies are down. Businesses also had to deleverage. But now business balance sheets are quite healthy. Business sentiment is positive and supportive of higher levels of investment and stronger hiring.\n\nAnother headwind came from the government sector. Government spending has been a drag on growth during much of the expansion. Unlike in most earlier recoveries, government payrolls actually fell during much of this expansion. Last year, buoyed by stronger tax revenues, state and local governments added to their payrolls after a meager increase in 2013 and declines in the prior four years. State and local government spending made a net positive contribution to real output growth last year, and the drag from federal government spending is waning.\n\nOf course, this audience doesn’t need to be reminded of the repairs that had to be made to bring the banking sector back to health in the wake of the Great Recession. Now that banks are recapitalized they are in a better position to take appropriate risks. Loans to consumers and businesses are rising and delinquencies and write-offs are at low levels.\n\nAt the same time the headwinds have diminished, we now have a tailwind in the form of lower oil prices. Last July, oil was selling at around $110 a barrel. Now the price is near $50. While the drop in oil prices will lead to some reduced investment and dislocation in parts of the domestic energy sector, lower oil prices will be a net positive for the U.S. economy. The lower costs of fuel to consumers, businesses, and local governments will support higher spending elsewhere. The U.S. Energy Information Administration is projecting that the average U.S. household will spend about $550 less on gasoline this year than it did last year. This will put money into people’s pockets that can be spent on other goods and services.\n\nBased on the improvement in fundamentals, as well as the fall in energy prices, and with the usual caveats that there are risks around any forecast, I expect the economy to grow at a 3 percent pace in 2015 and 2016, somewhat above my estimate of 2.5 percent longer-run growth. I don’t expect the housing sector to come back strongly this year, although continued moderate improvement is likely. The improvement will be supported by some relaxation of mortgage credit conditions, which remain fairly tight except for the highest quality borrowers. Net exports are also unlikely to contribute much to U.S. growth. As you are well aware, the U.S. economy is in better shape than the economies of many of our trading partners. Weak demand from abroad will dampen U.S. exports but will be more than offset by healthy domestic consumer and business spending that will support above-trend economic growth this year.\n\nThe increased momentum in the economy reflects a significant improvement in labor market conditions, which is seen across a broad number of indicators. On average, firms added 246,000 jobs per month last year, up from an average of 194,000 in 2013 and 186,000 in 2012. Nonfarm payrolls are now 2 million above their pre-recession level.\n\nThe unemployment rate is now 5.6 percent. This is down from a peak of 10 percent in 2009 and a full percentage point lower than it was last January. For several years now, the decline in the unemployment rate has been faster than many economists and policymakers thought it would be. For example, in December 2013, participants on the Federal Open Market Committee projected that the unemployment rate would be between 6.2 and 6.7 percent by the end of 2014. We are now well below that range.\n\nBroader measures of the unemployment rate are also down considerably since the start of the expansion, and their rate of decline is increasing. These measures include those that track people who are working part time but would prefer a full-time job or people marginally attached to the labor force who say they want to work but aren’t actively looking. Improvements are also evident in measures that track the long-term unemployed – people who have been out of work for more than six months. While these broader measures are not yet down to their pre-recession levels, they have all fallen considerably. For example, the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ so-called U6 measure of the unemployment rate, which includes marginally attached workers and people working part-time who want full-time work, fell almost 2 percentage points last year.\n\nI continue to view the unemployment rate as a useful indicator of labor market conditions. However, for those who put less stock in it because of the confounding effect of cyclical declines in labor force participation, I point to the ratio of employment to population. As our population ages, this ratio will naturally decline. Yet last year the acceleration in hiring was enough to overcome the effect of demographics, and we saw a nice increase in the employment-to-population ratio.\n\nLabor market conditions in Ohio have also improved over time, although at a somewhat slower pace than in the rest of the nation. During the recession, Ohio saw a sharper rate of job loss compared to the U.S. Between the start of the recession in December 2007 and the start of the expansion in June 2009, Ohio lost nearly 7 percent of its payroll jobs, while the U.S. lost almost 5-1/2 percent of its jobs. Since the start of the expansion, job growth in Ohio has averaged 1 percent per year. While this is somewhat lower than the 1-1/4 percent per year job growth seen in the nation, it is pretty good performance for Ohio, which usually sees slower job growth compared to the nation because of its industry mix and slower population growth.\n\nDespite the gains we’ve seen in labor markets, wage growth has remained subdued. However, as employment continues to grow, I anticipate that wages will accelerate and help support stronger consumer spending.\n\nConsumer price inflation also remains subdued and is running below the Fed’s 2 percent objective. The sharp drop in oil prices is showing up in much lower headline inflation numbers, and I expect inflation to decline further in the near term. So far, there has been only modest pass-through of those oil price declines to core measures of inflation that remove the volatile food and energy components. The Cleveland Fed’s median CPI measure has remained near 2-1/4 percent since last April, and as shown in Cleveland Fed staff research, this measure has some predictive power for headline inflation over the medium term.1 My expectation is that inflation will gradually move back up to 2 percent by the end of next year as economic activity continues to strengthen, oil prices stabilize, and inflation expectations remain anchored.\n\nI recognize that continued low readings on headline inflation have the potential to unsettle estimates of inflation expectations, so it is important that we carefully monitor developments on this front. Economists look at several different measures to help gauge inflation expectations. Market-based estimates of inflation compensation based on the spread between the yields on 10-year Treasury securities and 10-year Treasury inflation-protected securities, so-called TIPS, have fallen in recent weeks. However, in periods of highly volatile financial markets and flight-to-quality flows into U.S. securities, like those we’ve been experiencing, it is difficult to parse how much of the decline reflects a change in inflation expectations and how much reflects liquidity effects and changes in inflation risk premiums. In such times, I put more stock in the survey-based measures of inflation expectations, and these have been stable. In addition, while the Cleveland Fed’s own estimate of the 10-year expected inflation rate slipped from 1.85 percent in December to 1.66 percent in January, this reading is essentially in the middle of the range of readings we have seen since the financial crisis. Altogether, based on the various measures, my read is that inflation expectations remain anchored. And so long as that continues and growth doesn’t falter, I am comfortable with the forecast that inflation will move gradually toward the Fed’s 2 percent goal over the medium term, while lower oil prices drive down measures of headline inflation in the near term. Of course, this projection is dependent on appropriate monetary policy. So let me turn to that now.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nIn response to the financial crisis and deep recession, the Federal Reserve has run an extraordinarily accommodative monetary policy to promote its goals of price stability and maximum employment. The FOMC has kept its policy rate – the federal funds rate – at essentially zero since the end of 2008. This has lent important support to the economy, leading to the substantial progress we’ve seen in labor markets and the pickup in the pace of growth that underlie the projection that inflation will gradually return to our goal.\n\nThe economy is moving back to more normal territory, and as it does, monetary policy should begin to do so too. Because monetary policy affects the economy with a lag, policymakers need to be forward looking. We need to base our policy on both realized and expected progress toward our goals. Based on my forecast and the risks I see around that forecast, I believe it will soon be appropriate to begin moving rates up from zero. Because policy must be forward looking, in my view liftoff should occur before our goals are fully met. But even after liftoff, policy will remain very accommodative for some time, promoting attainment of both goals. Indeed, if incoming economic information supports my forecast, I would be comfortable with liftoff in the first half of this year, but as the FOMC has emphasized, policy isn’t on a pre-set path. Both liftoff and the path of policy thereafter will be based on incoming information to the extent that it affects the economic outlook and progress toward our goals of maximum employment and price stability.\n\nA Tiered Approach to Banking Supervision and Regulation\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, one of the headwinds that held back the pace of economic recovery was the considerable work that had to be done to improve the health of the financial system after the financial crisis. I wouldn’t want to conclude my talk to this group without acknowledging the key role that banks play in providing valuable credit, risk-management, and liquidity services to businesses and households.\n\nWhile banks are designed to take risks, operate with leverage, and are subject to oversight, we saw during the financial crisis that our system was not without flaws. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, signed into law in 2010, includes a number of provisions to strengthen the supervisory and regulatory framework, with the goal of promoting a more resilient financial system. Consistent with the act, the Federal Reserve and other federal banking agencies are taking a tiered approach to banking supervision and regulation. This approach recognizes that the risk a banking organization poses to the financial system is likely to vary according to its size, range of activities, and complexity, and so supervision and regulation should vary as well. For example, individual community banks are subject to regulatory oversight to help ensure they remain sound and able to extend credit and other services to their communities. But the actions community banks take do not typically impose costs on the rest of the financial system or create the kinds of contagion that can put the entire financial system at risk. So community banks shouldn’t be subject to the same types of macroprudential rules and supervision aimed at the systemically important institutions.\n\nThe tiered approach categorizes institutions based on their complexity and the level of risk they pose to the overall financial system, and then tailors oversight appropriately. Doing so will help to reduce the potential costs bankers might face if made to comply with rules that don’t further the goal of a healthy and resilient financial system. It will also free up the bandwidth of examiners and supervisors so they can focus more of their attention on where the risks actually lie. The Federal Reserve has organized its supervision of institutions around four groups of banks: community banks, which are institutions with $10 billion or less in assets; regional banking organizations, with assets between $10 billion and $50 billion; large banking organizations; and systemically important institutions. By appropriately deploying our supervisory resources, we feel we can better promote a healthier, more resilient financial system.\n\nSeveral examples illustrate the tiered approach. Many of the new requirements under Dodd-Frank apply only to the 100 or so banks with more than $10 billion in assets. For example, the nation’s 5,700 or so community banks are not subject to requirements for annual stress testing or resolution planning, but for those banks to which they do apply, the requirements become more extensive for the largest and most systemically important firms. Community banks and smaller regional banks with $50 billion or less in assets are not subject to the quantitative minimum liquidity requirement the Fed approved last year, nor do they fall under the extensive enhanced prudential standards required under Dodd-Frank for bank holding companies with more than $50 billion in assets.\n\nStronger capital requirements are an essential part of the new regulatory system. But the capital positions needed for systemically important banks are higher than those needed for community banks, and after consultations with community bankers, the rules adopted by the federal regulatory agencies reflect this.\n\nAnother more recent example of the tiered approach involves the Federal Reserve Board’s policy statement that allows certain small, noncomplex bank holding companies to operate with higher levels of debt than normal so long as doing so doesn’t compromise safety and soundness. In a recent speech, Federal Reserve Governor Tarullo explained that while the Federal Reserve Board generally discourages the use of debt to finance acquisitions, it recognizes that debt is often needed to finance transfers of ownership of small banks because they have limited access to equity financing.2 Last December, Congress raised the asset-size threshold for bank holding companies qualifying to operate with higher debt from $500 million to $1 billion. Last week, the Fed invited public comment on its proposed rule to implement this law. When final, this rule will raise the percentage of banks qualifying for the policy to nearly 90 percent from 75 percent.\n\nWhat I hope you will take from these examples is that the Federal Reserve recognizes the new regulatory environment poses challenges for bankers. We are committed to ensuring that our implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act does not put undue burden on community banks, but works to foster a healthier and more resilient financial system, which will benefit banks of all sizes and the overall economy.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, I see the economy on firmer footing than it has been for some time. Although there are risks around my forecast, I see growth averaging about 3 percent over the next two years. While the drop in oil prices will lower inflation in the near term, as oil prices stabilize, output and employment growth continue, and inflation expectations remain anchored, I expect inflation to gradually move back to the Fed’s goal of 2 percent. Based on realized and expected progress toward our goals, I believe it will soon be appropriate to begin moving interest rates up from zero. The Committee will base its decision about the timing and path of interest rates on incoming economic information to the extent that it affects the economic outlook and progress toward our goals of maximum employment and price stability.\n\nAs I noted earlier, it takes time for monetary policy to affect the economy. So the public won’t be able to immediately see whether a policy action taken by the Fed was a good one. That is one reason that I believe clear communication about monetary policy is so important. It is incumbent upon policymakers to explain the rationale for their decisions, including their evaluation of economic conditions as well as their outlook for the economy. This is what I tried to do today.\n\nI would like to leave you with one final thought. Congress has set the Fed’s goals but it has also given the Fed independence in making monetary policy decisions in pursuit of those goals. That is, monetary policy decisions do not have to be approved by the president or Congress. This is consistent with a large body of research, both here and abroad, which shows that when central banks formulate monetary policy free from government interference and are held accountable for their decisions, better economic outcomes result. I believe that calls to audit the Fed are misnamed and misguided. Misnamed because they really aren’t about auditing the Fed – the Fed is already subject to many audits of its financial statements and activities, and Chair Yellen regularly testifies before Congress on monetary policy. Misguided because they really are about allowing political considerations to influence monetary policy decisions. This would be a tremendous mistake because it would ultimately lead to poorer economic performance. I strongly believe that the Federal Reserve’s independence in setting monetary policy is worth preserving."

            "content": "Good morning. I am very pleased to participate in this conference co-organized by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and the Office of Financial Research. I want to thank Stephen Ong and Joe Haubrich from the Cleveland Fed and Mark Flood and Greg Feldberg from the OFR for putting together such an interesting program. I also thank the editors of the Journal of Financial Stability, which will be publishing a special volume of the journal with some of the papers from the conference. This is the second in what I hope is a series of conferences co-sponsored by the Cleveland Fed and the OFR. I very much value the collaboration between our institutions, which share a similar mission of fostering financial stability in our nation. I believe avenues such as this conference, which bring together researchers, financial sector supervisors, and policymakers from around the globe, provide important ways for us to share different perspectives on the complex subject of financial stability. This dialogue can lead to a better understanding of what we know and what we still need to learn, a crucial step on the road to more effective policymaking.\n\nThis morning, I’d like to share my perspectives as a monetary policymaker on the important task of fostering financial stability in the post-crisis environment. It may seem strange that the nexus between monetary policy and financial stability is still an open question. The Federal Reserve itself was created a hundred years ago after the financial panics that beset the country in the late 1800s and early 1900s. After the severe 1907 banking panic, the idea that a central bank might contribute to a more stable financial system gained traction and the Federal Reserve Act was signed into law in 1913. Yet, today, after the severe financial crisis of 2008, we are again rethinking the role of central banks in promoting financial stability. In my remarks today, I will highlight some of the changes in the approach to bank supervision we have undertaken since the financial crisis and then discuss the relationship between monetary policy and financial stability in the post-crisis world. Of course, these will be my views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nMacroprudential Supervision\n\nFinancial institutions are able to provide valuable credit, risk-management, and liquidity services to businesses and households because they are designed to take risks and are highly leveraged compared with nonfinancial businesses. But this risk-taking and leverage raise the possibility of systemic problems that could threaten the functioning of the financial system, hurt real economic activity, and impose significant economic costs. The pain inflicted by the 2008 financial crisis and deep recession that followed is still being felt by many in our economy. Financial sector supervisors and policymakers can learn many lessons from the crisis and its aftermath, and the country has taken a number of steps to help ensure we do not have a repeat occurrence. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, signed into law in 2010, includes a number of provisions to strengthen the supervisory framework, and financial institution regulators themselves are changing the way they go about monitoring risks. Wanting to promote financial stability is not new, but in addition to microprudential supervision, which promotes the safety and soundness of individual institutions, there is now more recognition of the importance of identifying and monitoring emerging risks to the stability of the financial system as a whole and taking appropriate steps to contain these systemic risks. In this macroprudential approach, examiners and supervisors are taking a more horizontal view in which a particular risk is evaluated across institutions rather than only at one institution at a time.\n\nUnder the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve and other financial regulatory agencies were directed to augment the microprudential supervision of individual institutions with a macroprudential approach to supervision designed to address systemic risk. The Financial Stability Oversight Council, with representation from federal and state financial system regulators, was created to coordinate the government's efforts to identify and respond to systemic risks by establishing prudential standards for systemically important firms. The Office of Financial Research, also a product of the Dodd-Frank Act, has the important task of improving the quality of financial data, which are a crucial ingredient supporting policymakers’ efforts to better understand the financial landscape and to spot systemic risks.\n\nThe regulatory reforms aim to foster financial stability in two ways: first, by lowering the probability of a financial crisis, and second, by reducing the costs imposed on the rest of the economy when a shock hits the financial system. Falling mainly in the first category are the new higher standards for financial institution capital and leverage requirements, liquidity requirements, concentration limits, standards for corporate governance including executive compensation, and the stress tests. Falling mainly in the second category are Dodd-Frank’s requirement that a systemically important financial institution provide a resolution plan or living will detailing how it would wind down the firm should it fail, and the act’s Title II provisions establishing an orderly liquidation authority to resolve troubled nonbank financial companies. Developing a system to effectively resolve systemically important financial institutions in a way that avoids causing problems that cascade throughout the financial system is a key task on the agenda for promoting financial stability. Ironically, we will have a more stable financial system if we build a system that allows insolvent institutions to fail, and less regulatory intervention to prevent closure of these firms. An effective resolution method will give managers and creditors the incentive to monitor the risks their institution is taking to avoid losses.\n\nIndeed, one of the lessons of the crisis was that incentives matter and regulation itself creates incentives. Sometimes these incentives work to promote financial stability. But sometimes regulations, no matter how well intentioned, can create counterproductive incentives – so-called unintended consequences. For example, at least some part of the strong growth in financial intermediation that occurred outside of the regulated banking system was driven by the desire to avoid regulation. Another example is suggested by the recent discussion surrounding the European Union’s cap on bonuses paid to bankers. U.K policymakers expressed concerns that the cap may not have the desired effect of limiting total compensation, and thereby limiting risk-taking, but instead may result merely in a shift to other types of uncapped compensation, such as fixed salaries, or may spur banks to move operations outside of the EU.\n\nOne guiding principle we should follow in any regulation is to pay attention to the incentives created by the regulatory system we have put into place. Explicit and implicit rules and the ways they are implemented create incentives. These incentives influence the behavior of all market participants: the financial intermediaries and their investors and customers, and the regulators. A second principle to follow in regulation is to avoid working against market forces. Instead, we should design a system that harnesses market discipline to work with improved regulation. I view Dodd-Frank’s establishment of the OFR to collect financial firm data, as well the act’s permission to compel more public disclosures, as encouraging the transparency needed for market discipline.\n\nAlthough there is still more work to be done, regulators are making progress in developing tools to implement the macroprudential approach to promoting financial stability. In general, the macroprudential tools can be classified into two categories: structural tools and cyclical tools. The structural tools aim to build the resiliency of the financial system throughout the business cycle. These tools include the Basel III risk-based capital requirements, minimum liquidity requirements, central clearing for derivatives, and living will resolution plans.\n\nIn contrast, the cyclical tools are aimed at mitigating the systemic risk that can build up over the business cycle. The seminal model of Kiyotaki and Moore shows how these risks can be amplified and propagated.1 In their model, because borrowers cannot be forced to repay, all lending is collateralized. When the economy is performing well, the value of the collateral increases, which supports further borrowing and higher output. But when a negative shock hits the economy and output declines, collateral values also fall, which means borrowing falls, which depresses output even further. Thus, the collateral constraint is a mechanism that amplifies and propagates the effects of temporary shocks on the economy. Brunnermeier and Sannikov build on the Kiyotaki and Moore model.2 In their model, an economic boom increases bank capital levels high enough so that credit is amply available to borrowers. This lowers the volatility of both output and asset prices. The lower volatility induces banks to increase their leverage and lend even more, so much so that the system is now vulnerable to a negative shock. These models illustrate that systemic risk is endogenous, determined by the choices of the model’s decision makers, and that systemic risk varies across the cycle.\n\nMacroprudential tools aimed at addressing these emerging risks include the countercyclical capital buffer, the capital conservation buffer, and stress test scenarios. The countercyclical capital buffer allows regulators to increase risk-based capital requirements when credit growth is judged to be excessive and leading to rising systemic risk. The capital conservation buffer ensures that banks raise capital above regulatory minimums in good times so that when they cover losses in bad times, their capital ratio will stay at or above the regulatory minimum. The stress tests can include scenarios that become more severe during strong economic expansions. Other possible cyclical tools, not yet established in the U.S. but used in other countries, include loan-to-value ratio limits and debt-to-income ratio limits that vary over the cycle. In some countries, these macroprudential tools have been targeted at particular sectors like housing credit or household credit. For example, Canada tightened loan-to-value and debt-to income limits on mortgage lending over the 2009 to 2012 period.3 Beginning in 2010, Israel also implemented a package of macroprudential tools to restrict the supply of housing credit.4 Spain introduced dynamic loan-loss provisioning in 2000.5 This method builds up reserves during good economic times according to the historical losses experienced by the asset classes held in the bank’s portfolio. This buffer is then available to absorb losses in bad times.\n\nAssessing the performance of these macroprudential tools is an area of ongoing research. It is complicated by the fact that there is relatively little experience with the use of these tools, and econometrically, it is difficult to isolate the effects of the macroprudential tools from the effects of changes in monetary policy and fiscal policy that occurred at the same time. For example, according to Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer, the Bank of Israel did not have good empirical estimates of the effectiveness of the different macroprudential measures.6 Moreover, gauging success may depend on your metric. While the Spanish banking system had the highest ratio of loan-loss reserves to nonperforming assets in western Europe in 2006,7 and so was in a better position to handle losses, the provisioning did not prevent a housing bubble in Spain. A study by economists at the IMF examining the effectiveness of macroprudential tools in reducing systemic risk in 49 countries found mixed results.8 The authors concluded that many of the most frequently used tools were effective in reducing the pro-cyclicality of credit and leverage, but the effectiveness depended on the type of shock hitting the financial sector.\n\nThis study and others suggest that the macroprudential approach has promise, but that the jury is still out on just how effective the tools will be. To me, this underscores the importance of our continued vigilance in monitoring the buildup of risks in the financial system. Better monitoring of these risks will be aided by the data being collected by the OFR and the metrics being developed in the Federal Reserve System and elsewhere, such as the Cleveland Fed’s financial stress index,9 which summarizes movements in a number of financial variables associated with stress. It is important to remember, however, that many of these metrics quantify correlations in the data rather than telling us something about the structure of the underlying financial markets or what has caused the movement in the metric and whether it requires a policy response.\n\nFor this, one needs structural general equilibrium economic models that seriously incorporate financial markets and the possibility of financial stress, borrower defaults, and financial institution failures. These models need to be fairly complex. Before the financial crisis we may have convinced ourselves that we could rely on representative agent models, linearized around a steady state, with one interest rate. But the nature of the financial crisis pointed out the inadequacies of these models for understanding the impact of severe financial stress on the real economy. By their nature, financial crises involve nonlinearities, potentially multiple equilibria, and financial frictions that limit arbitrage. So our models need to include these features. Macroprudential tools focus on the allocation of credit in the economy and work through redistribution. To study the effects of such tools, our models need to include heterogeneous agents – entities with different rates of risk tolerance and time preference – and multiple interest rates.10 Of course, monetary policy also entails some redistributions of income and wealth, and understanding the dynamics of the effects of monetary policy also requires the use of more complex models.11 There is an ongoing research effort at central banks around the world in developing models that can be used to evaluate how policymakers should incorporate financial stability concerns into monetary policymaking, the subject to which I now turn.\n\nMonetary Policy and Financial Stability\n\nThe severity of the financial crisis and ensuing recession renewed the discussion of how central banks should respond to developing systemic risk. During this episode, we saw that financial imbalances can build up even in a low-inflation environment. While price stability may promote financial stability, it is not a sufficient condition. We also saw that when financial markets are not functioning well, the transmission of monetary policy to the economy can be disrupted, and this can undermine its effectiveness in achieving the goals of price stability and maximum employment. In addition, the FOMC has recognized that nonconventional monetary policy, including large-scale asset purchases and the extended period of essentially zero interest rates, could pose potential risks to financial stability by affecting market functioning and spurring risk-taking in a search for yield, and the Committee continues to monitor these potential risks.12 Thus, our recent experience has shined a bright light on the interactions between monetary policy and financial stability and has led to some reassessment of the proper relationship between the two.\n\nBefore the crisis, the conventional approach generally taken by the Fed was to use monetary policy to respond to asset price movements – whether driven by fundamentals or not – only to the extent that those movements contained information about inflation and output growth. Monetary policy would not try to limit the size of imbalances as they developed, but would opt to mop up the consequences of a correction after the fact.\n\nBut others argued for a more activist approach, with monetary policy being used to try to stem developing imbalances before they caused harm to the real economy. BIS and OECD economist William White characterized these approaches as “clean” or “lean.”13 That is, should monetary policy clean up the mess after a bubble bursts, or should it lean against a bubble that appears to be forming? Former Federal Reserve Governor Randy Kroszner used another colorful metaphor: should monetary policy act as a fire extinguisher or a smoke detector?14\n\nIn my view, the divisions between these two views are sometimes overstated. Both sides recognize that central banks have a responsibility to promote financial stability, acting as the lender of last resort to solvent financial institutions with good collateral. Both sides agree that monetary policy should take financial conditions into account as part of the economic environment and that asset prices play an important role in the monetary policy transmission mechanism, potentially affecting both aggregate demand and inflation, but that monetary policy should not target asset prices. Neither side argues that monetary policy should respond to small misalignments of financial conditions and economic fundamentals, but both would support a monetary policy response to the extent that imbalances in credit and financial markets pose risks to price stability over the medium and longer run. Looked at in this way, the differences between the two viewpoints are perhaps more a matter of degree and nuance.\n\nRather than frame the discussion in terms of whether or not the central bank should attempt to pop an asset price or credit bubble, I would prefer that we frame the discussion in terms of the risks to macroeconomic and financial system stability. Financial crises can arise from high levels of optimism about the economy, which can lead to a rapid expansion in credit, which feeds into higher asset prices and a lower cost of capital, which then leads to further credit and economic expansion. Eventually, if the expectations turn out to be overly optimistic, investments won’t pay off, confidence will collapse, credit supply will fall, and there can be a rapid decline in prices and a pullback in credit.15 This need not be a bubble: the optimistic expectations formulated may have been based on the information available at the time. But the rapid rise in prices can lead to a bubble by generating behavior that is consistent only with continuing rises in prices. For example, as asset prices rise, lenders may begin to lower credit standards and rely on further appreciation of asset prices to cover any potential credit losses rather than on borrowers’ ability to repay. This can continue until losses start to overtake asset price appreciation. Whether the original rapid rise in asset prices was generated by a bubble or not is less important than the observation that asset price dynamics can yield undesirable outcomes for the economy. The central bank needs to assess whether the risk of macroeconomic and financial system instability has risen, not whether there’s a bubble.\n\nIn deciding whether or not to intervene by taking an action against a growing imbalance, policymakers need to balance the expected improvement in future economic conditions against the potential cost of unduly limiting credit extension. In the case of the recent collapse in the housing market, policymakers underestimated the breadth and depth of the negative impact this would have on the rest of the economy and the financial system. To the extent that we misjudged the impact, there is a larger potential gain to more carefully monitoring financial market conditions, implementing structural macroprudential tools aimed at lowering systemic risk, and being open to taking offsetting action should imbalances develop.\n\nBut what tool should policymakers use? There is ongoing discussion on this issue. At this point, given the state of our knowledge, I would opt to use the macroprudential tools as the first line of defense, since they can be more targeted to the markets and institutions where the risks are emerging. Whether monetary policy would be as effective is debatable. While interest rates affect the fundamental value of assets, it is not clear they affect the speculative or bubble portion. The impact may depend on the underlying nature of the financial imbalance. Indeed, in the Gali model, raising interest rates to combat a bubble can actually further inflate it.16 In addition, monetary policy tends to be a blunt instrument. Of course, depending upon the nature and breadth of the financial shock, this might be a desirable attribute. As former Federal Reserve Governor Jeremy Stein said, one benefit of using monetary policy is that “it gets in all the cracks,” meaning that a change in interest rates would affect all financial institutions and markets, whether regulated or not.17\n\nIn a situation in which the macroprudential tools proved to be inadequate and risks to financial stability continued to grow, monetary policy should be on the table as a possible defense. I note, however, that in this case, the blurring between financial stability goals and monetary policy goals would be high: if we assessed the risks to financial stability to be sufficiently great, achieving our dual mandate goals would be in jeopardy as well. This is an illustration that, in most cases, the goals of price stability, maximum employment, and financial stability are complementary.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, well-functioning financial markets and institutions are valuable assets to our economy. The painful experience of the global financial crisis and ensuing severe recession underscores the importance of doing all we can to keep the financial system healthy. Policymakers and regulators are expanding their data-collection efforts and developing metrics to better monitor financial market conditions and to assess emerging financial market stress and systemic risks. We are augmenting microprudential supervision with new macroprudential tools aimed at making the financial system more resilient. And we are developing the types of macroeconomic models that will allow us to evaluate different policies to promote financial stability. Progress is being made, but there is more work to do. Efforts like this conference, which bring together the best and the brightest in the field to share their expertise, play an essential role in furthering this agenda. I urge you to continue your important work on this front so that we can improve our policymaking to promote economic and financial stability."

            "content": "Good evening and thank you very much for the invitation to speak in the Imperial Business Insights Series. I have learned that this successful series is now in its third year and it has brought speakers to the podium to discuss a wide range of topics in the major themes of finance, innovation, and entrepreneurship. Tonight I will speak about forward guidance and monetary policy communications. I think it is clear that this topic is related to finance, but I submit that it is also related to the two other themes of your series: innovation and entrepreneurship. Since the onset of the 2008 financial crisis, policymakers have had to be quite innovative in addressing the challenges facing the global economy. They have had to be entrepreneurial in developing new economic models and monetary policy tools to help navigate the uncharted waters of the past six years. Tonight, I’ll give my views on one of those tools, forward guidance, and the role it plays as a part of the broader communications provided by monetary policymakers. Of course, my remarks will reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nFederal Reserve Structure and Governance\n\nTo understand the importance of monetary policy communications in the United States, it helps to understand a little about the structure of the institution responsible for setting monetary policy. That institution, the Federal Reserve System, was established by Congress in the Federal Reserve Act, which was signed into law in 1913. We like to say that the Federal Reserve is a decentralized central bank, which is independent within the government and not independent from the government. The structure is one of balance. Congress designed the Federal Reserve System to alleviate concerns that it would become dominated by financial interests in New York or political interests in Washington. The design includes representation from the rest of the nation, balancing public-sector and private-sector interests, and Wall Street and Main Street concerns.\n\nThe Federal Reserve System has 12 regional Reserve Banks and a seven-member Board of Governors in Washington that oversees those Banks. The governors, who serve the public, are appointed by the president of the United States and confirmed by the Senate, the upper house of Congress. Governors serve staggered 14-year terms, which span several terms of the president and members of Congress. The length of the term is intended to insulate the governors from short-term political influence and allows them to take a longer-run perspective when setting monetary and financial regulatory policy. The chairman and vice chairman of the Board of Governors are chosen by the president and confirmed by the Senate from among the sitting governors for four-year terms. They can be reappointed until their terms as governors expire.\n\nThe 12 Reserve Banks operate in the public interest. They are distributed around the country in locations that were the centers of economic activity back when the Fed was established.1 Each Reserve Bank has a nine-member board of directors. The directors of the Reserve Banks are chosen in a nonpolitical process. Three directors represent banks and six are nonbankers who represent business, agricultural, industrial, and public interests in the Districts they serve. The nonbank directors are responsible for choosing the Bank’s president, who is subject to approval by the Fed’s Board of Governors.\n\nThe body within the Federal Reserve System responsible for setting monetary policy is the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, which was established in the Banking Act of 1935 and holds eight regularly scheduled meetings per year in Washington. This 12-member Committee is made up of the seven members of the Board of Governors, the president of the New York Fed, and four other Reserve Bank presidents, who serve on a rotating basis. As president of the Cleveland Fed, I vote every other year, as does the Chicago Fed president. The other presidents vote every third year. I note, though, that presidents who happen not to be voting members at the moment still participate in FOMC meetings. Thus, by design, the discussions at our meetings contain a mosaic of economic information and analysis from all parts of the country. I make it a point to bring in the information my staff and I have gleaned about economic and financial conditions from the businesses and banks in my District, as well as from our directors. This regional information, along with national data and analysis, plays an important part in our setting of national monetary policy in pursuit of our goals.\n\nThose monetary policy goals were given to the Fed by Congress. The Federal Reserve Act says that the Fed should conduct monetary policy to “promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.” When prices are stable and the economy is at full employment, long-term interest rates are typically at moderate levels, so it is often said that the U.S. Congress has given the Fed a dual mandate. Note, this is in contrast to the Bank of England, which has a single mandate to deliver price stability, and subject to that, to support the government’s economic objectives, including those for growth and employment.\n\nWhile Congress has set the Fed’s goals, it has also given the Fed independence in making monetary policy decisions in pursuit of those goals. That is, monetary policy decisions do not have to be approved by the president or Congress. It was the FOMC, rather than Congress, which established for the first time in 2012 a numerical goal for inflation over the longer run. This goal is 2 percent inflation, as measured by the year-over-year change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE inflation, and it’s the level the FOMC feels is most consistent with its congressional mandate.\n\nThe Bank of England also has independence. The 1998 Bank of England Act granted the bank independence in setting interest rates, although the government sets the inflation target, which is announced each year by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. There are many other examples of independent central banks, which is perhaps not too surprising, since a body of research both in the U.S. and elsewhere shows that when central banks formulate monetary policy free from government interference and are held accountable for their decisions, better economic outcomes result.\n\nThat is one reason that I believe clear communication about monetary policy is so important. Independence in setting monetary policy is worth preserving because it yields more effective policy. But accountability must go hand-in-hand with independence. A central bank cannot expect to remain independent from the political process unless it is transparent about the basis for its policy decisions. Because it takes time for monetary policy to affect the economy, the public won’t be able to immediately see whether a policy action was a good one. So it is incumbent upon policymakers to explain the rationale for those decisions, including their evaluation of economic conditions as well as their outlook for the economy.\n\nThe Benefits of Clear Communication in Monetary Policymaking\n\nBut clear communication is not necessarily easy. Eleven years ago, Alan Greenspan, then chairman of the Federal Reserve, gave an economic outlook speech. The next day’s headline in The New York Times read as follows: “Greenspan Hints at End to Low Rates,” while the headline in The Wall Street Journal read: “Greenspan Suggests Continued Patience on Rates.”2 That one speech generated such contradictory messages illustrates the challenges monetary policymakers face when communicating with the public. Yet despite the challenges, over the past two decades the Federal Reserve has been on a journey to enhance its policy communications. Clear communication and transparency can make monetary policy more effective by helping households and businesses make better economic and financial decisions. When policymakers are clear about the goals of monetary policy and the economic information that is important in their forecasts and policy decisions, the public will have a better idea of how monetary policy is likely to change as economic conditions evolve. Moreover, people will have a better sense of how policy will react not only to anticipated changes in conditions but also to unanticipated economic developments. Such knowledge helps households and firms make better saving, borrowing, investment, and employment decisions.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has been increasing the amount and type of information it provides to the public on its policy decisions. Twenty years ago the FOMC relied on open market operations rather than policy statements to signal shifts in the stance of monetary policy. It wasn’t until 1994 that the FOMC began to explicitly announce changes in its fed funds rate target and added more description about the state of the economy and the rationale for its decisions. Now that statement includes the votes of individual members and the preferred policy choices of any dissenters. The Committee provides minutes of its meetings three weeks after the meeting has concluded, and a full transcript with a five-year lag. The FOMC provides information on individual participants’ economic outlook and policy paths in the Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP, which are released four times a year. Since 2011, the chair of the Committee has held press briefings four times a year to present these economic projections. The briefings allow the chair to expand on the information contained in the FOMC’s post-meeting statement. She can highlight things that are too complex to discuss in the relatively short FOMC statement, and she can give a sense of alternative views as well. Indeed, Chair Janet Yellen did that at her September press briefing when she discussed various members’ views on forward guidance, to which I now turn.\n\nForward Guidance in Extraordinary Times\n\nThe FOMC’s forward policy guidance has received considerable attention. During the unusual economic circumstances of the past six years, the FOMC has provided forward guidance to help the public better understand the anticipated future path of interest rates. The formulation of the forward guidance has changed over time, from qualitative guidance, to calendar dates, to economic thresholds, and to a blend of state-contingent and date-based guidance. Let’s walk through those changes.\n\nIn December 2008, the FOMC began with qualitative guidance indicating that it anticipated that weak economic conditions were likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the fed funds rate for “some time.” In March 2009, “some time” became “extended period.” In August 2011, the FOMC changed its qualitative forward guidance to a calendar date when it said that it anticipated an exceptionally low fed funds rate at least through mid-2013. That date was later extended to late 2014, and then to mid-2015.\n\nThe FOMC changed the formulation of its forward guidance from calendar dates to thresholds in December 2012. The Committee said that it anticipated that the 0-to-¼ percent target range for the fed funds rate would be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remained above 6½ percent, inflation between one and two years ahead was projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continued to be well anchored.\n\nA year later, in December 2013, the FOMC blended state-contingent forward guidance with an element of calendar-date forward guidance. First, the FOMC indicated that in determining how long to maintain highly accommodative monetary policy, it would consider information in addition to the unemployment rate and PCE inflation, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. The FOMC then translated this into time, saying that based on its assessment of these factors, the 0-to-¼ percent target range for the funds rate would likely be appropriate “well past the time that the unemployment rate declines below 6½ percent, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal.”\n\nIn March of this year the thresholds were replaced with guidance that linked the path of policy to the Committee’s assessment of both realized and expected progress toward its dual-mandate objectives. The guidance continued to provide a time element by indicating that based on the FOMC’s assessment, the funds rate target will likely remain 0-to-¼ percent for “a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.”\n\nThe Federal Reserve was not alone in using forward guidance. The Bank of Canada, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, the Swedish Riksbank, and the Bank of England have all provided some form of forward guidance on the anticipated future path of policy. Nor was the Fed alone in changing the formulation of its forward guidance over time. For example, when the Bank of England introduced forward guidance in August 2013, it was formulated in terms of economic thresholds. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) said that it intended not to raise the policy rate or reduce the size of its balance sheet at least until the unemployment rate had fallen to 7 percent unless any one of the following three conditions were breached: if inflation 18 to 24 months ahead was 0.5 percentage point or more above the 2 percent target, if medium-term inflation expectations were no longer sufficiently well anchored, or if the Financial Policy Committee judged that the stance of monetary policy posed a significant threat to financial stability that couldn’t be mitigated with other tools.\n\nIn February of this year, as the unemployment rate approached 7 percent, the MPC replaced this threshold forward guidance with guidance indicating that, despite the sharp fall in unemployment, policymakers saw further scope to reduce spare capacity in the economy before raising the policy rate. The MPC provided more information in its Inflation Report on the factors that, in addition to the unemployment rate, would help determine the timing and pace with which policy accommodation would be removed. Thus, the evolution in guidance away from thresholds occurred both in the U.S. and in the U.K. as unemployment rates came down.\n\nIn extraordinary economic times, like the ones we’ve experienced in recent years, forward guidance can be thought of as more than a communications device. It is a tool of monetary policy that has the potential to increase the degree of monetary policy accommodation, especially when interest rates are essentially at their zero lower bound. By reducing uncertainty about the future path of policy, forward guidance helps lower interest rates by reducing the premiums investors demand to compensate them for interest-rate uncertainty.\n\nIn addition, in theory, if the central bank indicates that the future path of short-term interest rates will be low for a long time – perhaps lower and for longer than would have been consistent with the central bank’s past behavior – this can also put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, thereby spurring current economic activity. According to the theory, if people believe that the central bank will keep rates very low, they will expect higher economic activity and higher inflation in the future. When households, businesses, and market participants are assured of better economic prospects in the future, they should be more willing to make investments in capital and labor today rather than delaying them, and this will help the current economy.\n\nNote, though, that for forward guidance to have this effect, the public must believe that the central bank is setting policy differently than it has in the past and also that the central bank is committed to implementing this particular policy. If, instead, the public believes that the central bank is behaving as usual, it could misinterpret a very low policy rate as suggesting a gloomier outlook, and this would work to depress current activity – the exact opposite of the intended effect. In addition, before they will change their behavior and start spending today, households and firms have to believe that the central bank is committed to behaving in this unusual way. How to increase the credibility of such a commitment continues to be a subject of economic research.3\n\nForward Guidance in Normal Times\n\nSo, in extraordinary economic times, forward guidance can be viewed as an additional monetary policy tool. But in more normal times, away from the zero lower bound, I view forward guidance more as a communications device that conveys to the public how policy is likely to respond to changes in economic conditions. In other words, in normal times, forward guidance will focus less on when policy will be changed or even the particular path of future policy, and more on the rationale for policy decisions. To the extent that households and businesses understand how policymakers are likely to react to economic developments – whether anticipated or unanticipated – their policy expectations will better align with those of policymakers. As I discussed earlier, this alignment can make policy more effective.\n\nIn the late 1980s and 1990s, the public had a pretty good sense of how the FOMC’s policy would respond to economic developments, the so-called reaction function. They were able to get a handle on the FOMC’s reaction function because after the great inflation of the 1970s, the FOMC became more predictable and systematic in how it reacted to changes in economic activity and inflation.4 As a result, forward guidance was rarely used.\n\nBut the Great Recession required the Fed to behave in a way quite distinct from its past behavior, and consequently, there is less understanding about how policymakers are likely to react to incoming economic information than there was earlier. So in my view taking steps to enhance the public’s ability to understand the rationale behind the FOMC’s decisions has value. As our economy returns to normal, I would like the forward guidance used during the extraordinary times of the past six years to evolve into our offering a clearer sense of the FOMC’s reaction function.\n\nI believe the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections, with suitable amendments, could play a central role in helping the public better understand how U.S. monetary policy is likely to respond to economic developments. I will offer three possible avenues for consideration, and let me note again that my views are not necessarily shared by others on the FOMC, including those who serve with me on the FOMC’s subcommittee on communications.\n\nFirst, the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections could link the variables across each participant’s forecast. Currently, the SEP provides information on the range of projections of real output growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation across FOMC participants, as well as the policy paths that individual participants view as appropriate for achieving those projections. But there is no linkage across the variables. For example, there is no way to see whether a person low in the range of unemployment rate forecasts is high in the range of inflation projections. Rather than presenting ranges, the SEP could be enhanced by linking the variables for each participant’s projection so that the public could see what each policymaker is projecting for growth, unemployment, and inflation, and what policy path he or she believes will achieve those outcomes. This could be done without revealing the identities of the participants and would convey information on each individual policymaker’s reaction function.\n\nSecond, the SEP could more plainly communicate the degree of uncertainty around the projections. Currently, the divergence of views among participants is presented, but the divergence across projections is different from the uncertainty any one individual would put around his or her outlook. Giving the public a better sense of the probabilities associated with the projections would be valuable.\n\nThird, while the SEP provides important information on the diversity of views among participants, trying to increase the information we provide on the consensus view would be worthwhile. After all, it is the consensus view that is reflected in the policy statement after FOMC meetings. Presenting more information on the consensus economic outlook that underlies the Committee’s policy decisions would help clarify the statement. I realize this will not be an easy task. Indeed, the Committee experimented with developing a consensus forecast in 2012.5 However, the Bank of England’s Inflation Report shows that such a consensus forecast with confidence bands around the projections can be done in a way that enhances policy communications. As we return to a more normal policy-setting environment, the FOMC might be successful in developing its own consensus forecast, which could form a basis for explaining policy decisions and alternative views.\n\nForward Guidance Betwixt and Between Extraordinary and Normal Times\n\nOf course, we are not there yet. So perhaps the more immediate question is what should forward guidance look like during the transition from extraordinary times to normal times? After several years of nontraditional monetary policy, the transition toward a more normal economy is likely to entail some uncertainty about monetary policy setting. I believe clear policy communications can and should play a key role in reducing that uncertainty. So let me offer three suggestions to improve our communications.\n\nFirst, I favor the FOMC being as clear as it can be that monetary policy will be contingent on the state of the economy. This is why I believe the FOMC’s addition to its forward guidance at its October meeting was an important step in the right direction. It was a clear statement that if incoming information indicates faster than anticipated progress toward the Committee’s employment and inflation objectives, then increases in the target range for the Fed’s policy rate are likely to occur sooner than the FOMC currently anticipates. And if progress is disappointing, then increases are likely to be later. I think this is an important message to convey to the public.\n\nSecond, I believe it would be helpful over time to provide more information in our statement and other communications about the conditions we systematically assess in calibrating the stance of policy to the economy’s actual progress and anticipated progress toward our dual-mandate goals, and to the speed with which that progress is being made. That is, the FOMC should explain how and why we came to our assessment that realized and expected progress toward our goals is pointing to a particular policy path.\n\nThird, because there is a plethora of incoming economic data and information, which can send confusing signals, our communications, rather than merely providing an accounting of the changes in economic conditions, should help the public to better understand policymakers’ consensus assessment of what is signal versus noise in the data. What changes in the data and other economic information do we view as material enough to change our medium-run economic outlook or the risks around that outlook? Systematically providing the public with such information will allow people to anticipate how policy is likely to change in response to economic developments that affect the outlook.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, I have laid out some possible improvements to the Federal Reserve’s policy communications. Such improvements cannot happen overnight – after all, we have been on a journey toward better communication for quite some time and I expect us to continue on that journey. Although there is a diversity of views on the Committee, I believe there is enough common ground to encourage us to seek progress along the lines I am suggesting. I believe our efforts will be rewarded because clear communications will lead to better economic outcomes and help make the trip back to normal a smoother ride."

I understand that a long line of Federal Reserve presidents and governors have addressed your distinguished group and I am very honored to follow in their footsteps. Tonight I will discuss the role of communications in Fed policymaking, focusing on the FOMC’s forward guidance on the future path of policy. Of course, my remarks will reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Benefits of Clear Communication in Monetary Policymaking\n\nEleven years ago today, Alan Greenspan, then Chairman of the Federal Reserve, gave an economic outlook speech. The next day’s headline in The New York Times read as follows: “Greenspan Hints at End to Low Rates,” while the headline in The Wall Street Journal read: “Greenspan Suggests Continued Patience on Rates.1 That one speech generated such contradictory messages illustrates the challenges monetary policymakers face when communicating with the public. Yet despite the challenges, over the past two decades the Federal Reserve has been on a journey to enhance its policy communications. That journey continues today because there are good reasons to believe that better communication will lead to better economic outcomes.\n\nClear communication and transparency can make monetary policy more effective by helping households and businesses make better economic and financial decisions. When policymakers are clear about the goals of monetary policy and the economic information that is important in their forecasts and policy decisions, the public will have a better idea of how monetary policy is likely to change as economic conditions evolve. Moreover, people will have a better sense of how policy will react not only to anticipated changes in conditions but also to unanticipated economic developments. Such knowledge helps households and firms make better saving, borrowing, investment, and employment decisions.\n\nTransparency about monetary policy plays another important role: it gives the public the information it needs to hold the central bank accountable for its policies. After all, in order to evaluate the central bank’s policy decisions, the public has to know the basis for those decisions. Accountability is essential in a democracy, and it can also promote better policymaking. In the U.S., Congress has given the Fed a mandate to promote price stability and maximum employment, and it has given the Fed independence in making monetary policy decisions in pursuit of those goals. A body of research both here and abroad shows that when central banks formulate monetary policy free from government interference and are held accountable for their decisions, better economic outcomes result.\n\nOf course, it has taken some time for central banks, including the Fed, to recognize the benefits of increased transparency. Twenty years ago the FOMC relied on open market operations rather than policy statements to signal shifts in the stance of monetary policy. It wasn’t until 1994 that the FOMC began to explicitly announce changes in its fed funds rate target and added more description about the state of the economy and the rationale for its decisions. Since then, the Fed has taken a number of additional steps to improve the public’s understanding of monetary policy. The FOMC now releases the votes of individual members and the preferred policy choices of any dissenters in its post-meeting statement, and it has expedited the release of the minutes of its meetings. And I think anyone who has looked at the minutes over time will notice that they have grown meatier, discussing in more detail the consensus view of policymakers, the perceived risks to the outlook, and also the range of views expressed around the table.\n\nOver time, the FOMC has increased the information it provides on its economic outlook. Economic projections, which are now contained in the Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP, are released four times a year instead of twice a year. The projections include more economic variables and a longer forecast horizon, as well as the policy paths that underlay participants’ projections.\n\nAnother important step toward enhanced communications came in 2012 when, for the first time, the FOMC laid out the guiding principles it follows in setting monetary policy. A key part of those principles was the establishment of an explicit numerical goal for inflation over the longer run. The goal is 2 percent inflation, as measured by the year-over-year change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE inflation. Being explicit about the inflation objective reflects the FOMC’s desire to be transparent and communicate clearly to the public. But it also underscores the FOMC’s commitment to price stability and thereby helps anchor the inflation expectations of households and businesses at the target. Inflation expectations are an important determinant of actual inflation. So having an explicit target helps promote price stability.\n\nPerhaps one of the most valuable additions to the FOMC’s communications arsenal is the press briefing the Chair of the Committee holds four times a year to present the FOMC’s economic projections. The briefings, which started in 2011, provide a vehicle for the Chair to expand on the information contained in the FOMC’s post-meeting statement. She can highlight things that are too complex to discuss in the relatively short FOMC statement, and she can give a sense of alternative views as well. Indeed, the Chair did that at her September press briefing when she discussed various members’ views on forward guidance, to which I now turn.\n\nForward Guidance in Extraordinary Times\n\nThe FOMC’s forward policy guidance has received considerable attention.

In August 2003, in the midst of elevated perceived risks of deflation, the Committee indicated that it believed policy accommodation could be maintained for a “considerable period.” As deflation risks eased and economic conditions changed during that cycle, the forward guidance evolved as well, eventually indicating that the FOMC would be firming policy.\n\nThe common element in both of these forward guidance episodes is that they happened during periods of unusual economic circumstances: in the earlier instance, a deflation scare; in the later instance, the financial crisis, ensuing very deep recession, and subsequent slow recovery.\n\nIn extraordinary economic times, forward guidance can be thought of as more than a communications device. It is a tool of monetary policy that has the potential to increase the degree of monetary policy accommodation, especially when interest rates are essentially at their zero lower bound. By reducing uncertainty about the future path of policy, forward guidance helps lower interest rates by reducing the premiums investors demand to compensate them for interest-rate uncertainty.\n\nIn addition, in theory, if the central bank indicates that the future path of short-term interest rates will be low for a long time – perhaps lower and for longer than would have been consistent with the central bank’s past behavior – this can also put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, thereby spurring current economic activity.

How to increase the credibility of such a commitment continues to be a subject of economic research.2\n\nForward Guidance in Normal Times\n\nSo, in extraordinary economic times, forward guidance can be viewed as an additional monetary policy tool. But in more normal times, away from the zero lower bound, I view forward guidance more as a communications device that conveys to the public how policy is likely to respond to changes in economic conditions. In other words, in normal times, forward guidance will focus less on when policy will be changed or even the particular path of future policy, and more on the rationale for policy decisions.

Currently, the divergence of views among participants is presented in the SEP. But the divergence across projections is different from the uncertainty any one individual would put around his or her outlook. Even if there were no divergence, so that each participant was projecting the same economic outcome and policy path, it would be incorrect to assume that the participants were therefore certain about that outcome or policy path. The SEP does give a sense of the number of participants who see balanced risks around their projections and whether the degree of uncertainty is higher or lower than average. But giving the public a better sense of the probabilities associated with the projections would be valuable.\n\nThat brings me to a third potential avenue to help clarify communications. While the SEP provides important information on the diversity of views among participants, trying to increase the information we provide on the consensus view would be worthwhile. It is the consensus view that is reflected in the policy statement after FOMC meetings. Presenting more information on the consensus economic outlook that underlies the Committee’s policy decisions would help clarify the statement. I realize this will not be an easy task. The Committee experimented with developing a consensus forecast in 2012.4 It turned out not to be the right time because policy comprised several elements, including the funds rate path, asset purchases, and forward guidance, as well as the fact that there was considerable diversity of views about the economy’s structure and dynamics during those extraordinary economic times. However, we will eventually return to a more normal policy-setting environment, and in such an environment, the Committee might be more successful in developing such a consensus forecast, which could form a basis for explaining policy decisions and alternative views.\n\nForward Guidance Betwixt and Between Extraordinary and Normal Times\n\nOf course, we are not there yet. So perhaps the more immediate question is what should forward guidance look like during the transition from extraordinary times to normal times? After several years of nontraditional monetary policy, the transition toward a more normal economy is likely to entail some uncertainty about monetary policy setting. I believe clear policy communications can and should play a key role in reducing that uncertainty. To that end, I favor the Committee being as clear as it can be that monetary policy will be contingent on the state of the economy. I favor putting less focus on a particular calendar date for liftoff. This is why I believe the FOMC’s addition to its forward guidance last week was an important step in the right direction. It was a clear statement that if incoming information indicates faster than anticipated progress toward the Committee’s employment and inflation objectives, then increases in the target range for the fed funds rate are likely to occur sooner than the FOMC currently anticipates. And if progress is disappointing, then increases are likely to be later. I think this is an important message to convey to the public.\n\nI believe it would also be helpful over time to provide more information in our statement and other communications about the conditions we systematically assess in calibrating the stance of policy to the economy’s actual progress and anticipated progress toward our dual-mandate goals, and to the speed with which that progress is being made. That is, the FOMC should explain how and why we came to our assessment that realized and expected progress toward our goals is pointing to a particular policy path.\n\nI realize that there is a plethora of incoming economic data and information, and they can send confusing signals. Our communications should help the public to better understand policymakers’ consensus assessment of what is signal versus noise in the data. What changes in the data and other economic information do we view as material enough to change our medium-run economic outlook or the risks around that outlook? Systematically providing the public with such information will allow people to anticipate how policy is likely to change in response to economic developments that affect the outlook.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, I have laid out some possible improvements to the Federal Reserve’s policy communications. Such improvements cannot happen overnight – after all, we have been on a journey toward better communication for quite some time and I expect us to continue on that journey. Although there is a diversity of views on the Committee, I believe there is enough common ground to encourage us to seek progress along the lines I am suggesting. I believe our efforts will be rewarded because clear communications will lead to better economic outcomes and help make the trip back to normal a smoother ride."

            "content": "Introduction\n\nGood afternoon and thank you for that very kind introduction. I also thank the Cleveland Association for Business Economics, CFA Society Cleveland, and the Risk Management Association for inviting me to speak today. I am pleased to say that a number of Cleveland Fed employees are members of your fine organizations and some are here with us today.\n\nI am now into my fourth month on the job as president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. In that short time, in addition to getting to know Cleveland and the rest of the Fourth District, I have attended and voted at three meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC. As most of you know, the FOMC is the body within the Federal Reserve System responsible for setting monetary policy. Our latest meeting was just last week. In addition to our usual policy statement describing the Committee’s monetary policy decision, the FOMC released its Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP, which summarizes each FOMC participant’s economic projections for output growth, unemployment, and inflation based on his or her individual view of appropriate monetary policy. The FOMC also released updated information on the approach it plans to take to return monetary policy to more normal territory, in terms of both the level of interest rates and our policy tools. So there is a lot for us to talk about today, and I would like to take this opportunity to discuss my views on the economy, monetary policy, and normalization. Of course, these are my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\n\nThe economy is now in its sixth year of expansion, and while it has had its ups and downs, it has made significant progress toward fulfilling the Federal Reserve’s goals of price stability and maximum employment. Real output growth rebounded sharply in the second quarter, growing at more than a 4 percent annual pace, after falling slightly more than 2 percent in the first quarter due to the harsh winter weather. I expect real GDP to expand at about a 3 percent annual pace in the second half of this year and over 2015 and 2016. This is a moderate pace of growth, but it is somewhat above my estimate of longer-run trend growth, which I put at around 2.5 percent. I believe several factors support above-trend growth over the next couple of years. Household and business balance sheets have improved and so have consumer and business confidence, which should support spending. In addition, monetary policy remains highly accommodative. And I expect labor markets, which have shown significant progress, will continue to strengthen and help sustain consumer spending. Of course, there are risks around this forecast. These include geopolitical risks, which have escalated in recent weeks, as well as weakness in some economies abroad. Despite the risks, it’s my view that our economy is on firmer ground than it has been for some time.\n\nMy output projections of 3 percent in 2015 and 2016 put me at the upper end of the central tendency of FOMC participants’ new projections for 2015 and just above the upper end for 2016. The central tendency is obtained by dropping the lowest and highest three projections from among the FOMC participants. For 2015, the central tendency is 2.6 to 3.0 percent, and for 2016, it is 2.6 to 2.9 percent. I note that my 2.5 percent estimate for longer-run growth is also somewhat more optimistic than the central tendency of 2.0 to 2.3 percent. Of course, there is always a good deal of uncertainty around estimates of trend growth, perhaps even more so today in the aftermath of such a deep recession. I lowered my estimate of trend growth after the Great Recession, but perhaps not far enough given the low productivity growth we’ve experienced over the past couple of years. On the other hand, I think it is premature to discount the future too much. It is good to remember the experience of the 1990s when over a period of several years, many forecasters revised down trend growth estimates only to subsequently revise them up significantly in response to strong productivity growth.\n\nAs I mentioned, labor market conditions have improved significantly over the expansion. Admittedly, the recovery in jobs has been much slower than anyone would have liked, and the August payroll employment increase was a bit of a disappointment, coming in at 142,000 jobs, after six months of increases greater than 200,000. But I think it’s important not to overreact to one month’s number. The monthly data can be volatile, and the payroll data get revised. Monthly payroll gains have averaged 215,000 jobs so far this year, somewhat stronger than last year’s pace.\n\nThe unemployment rate currently stands at 6.1 percent, down significantly from a peak of 10 percent in October 2009, and more than a percentage point lower than a year ago. The improvement has been faster than many economists and policymakers, including some on the FOMC, had anticipated. For example, last September, according to the central tendency of their projections, FOMC participants were projecting that the unemployment rate would be 6.4 to 6.8 percent in the fourth quarter of this year. But the unemployment rate is already lower than that. Other measures of unemployment or underemployment have also improved over time. These improved measures include those that track people who are working part time but would prefer a full-time job, and those that track the long-term unemployed—people who have been out of work for more than six months. More progress needs to be made and I anticipate that it will be made. My outlook is that as the expansion continues, firms will continue to add to their payrolls and the unemployment rate will continue to decline. I expect that by the end of next year, the unemployment rate will fall to around 5.5 percent, which is my estimate of the longer-run, or natural, rate of unemployment, and remain near there in 2016. Like longer-run growth estimates, there is considerable uncertainty around estimates of the longer-run unemployment rate. These estimates depend on demographics, production technology, and other structural factors, and can vary over time. My estimate is on the upper end of the central tendency of 5.2 to 5.5 percent of the FOMC’s projections of longer-run unemployment. This means that I am projecting a somewhat faster return to full employment than some of my colleagues.\n\nTurning to inflation, although it remains below the FOMC’s goal of 2 percent, inflation measured by the year-over-year change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures has increased to 1.6 percent this year from 1.2 percent last year. Consistent with a pickup in economic growth and expectations of inflation remaining well anchored, my projection is that inflation will gradually move back toward the FOMC’s 2 percent goal by the end of 2016. Of course, this projection is dependent on appropriate monetary policy. So let me turn to that now.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nIn response to the financial crisis and deep recession, the Federal Reserve has run an extraordinarily accommodative monetary policy to promote our goals of price stability and maximum employment. The FOMC has kept its policy rate – the federal funds rate – at essentially zero since the end of 2008, and it has also used forward guidance to communicate the anticipated future path of policy. In addition, to exert downward pressure on long-term interest rates, the FOMC has purchased longer-term Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities, expanding the Fed’s balance sheet nearly five-fold since before the crisis.\n\nThe current program of longer-term asset purchases, commonly called quantitative easing or QE, began in September 2012. At that time, the unemployment rate was about 2 percentage points higher than it is today. Based on the cumulative progress in labor markets since that time, this year the FOMC began tapering the amount of assets it has been buying each month. Remember that tapering is not tightening. That is, the FOMC has continued to add accommodation, just at a reduced pace. Based on the realized and anticipated continued improvement in the economy, I supported the FOMC’s decision last week to reduce the pace of purchases by another $10 billion, to $15 billion per month, and to indicate that if incoming information broadly supports the Committee’s outlook, the program would end at our meeting next month.\n\nI also supported the Committee’s decision to maintain the 0-to-¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate. As the economic expansion continues, eventually monetary policy will need to return to a more normal stance. Indeed, the September SEP shows that the Committee believes it will be appropriate for the policy rate to increase over the next several years, with most participants expecting economic progress toward our goals to warrant the first rate increase in 2015. As one can see by looking at the SEP, there is some diversity of views about the appropriate path of interest rates. That is to be expected. Monetary policy must be dependent on the realized and expected evolution of the economy, and differences in the outlook across FOMC participants can result in different views of appropriate policy. In addition, policymakers will calibrate their views on appropriate policy to changes in their outlook over time. This is what is meant by policy not being on a preset course: It should respond to changes in the realized and anticipated course of the economy.\n\nIndeed, this is a part of the Committee’s forward guidance, which remained unchanged last week. The guidance indicates that in determining how long to maintain the current target range for the fed funds rate, the FOMC will assess both realized and expected progress toward our objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation, and we will look at a wide range of information in making that assessment. The guidance then indicates that, based on that assessment, the Committee continues to anticipate that it will likely be appropriate to maintain the current 0-to-¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends.\n\nI would prefer this second part of the forward guidance be reformulated. Even though the Committee has emphasized that policy is contingent on the state of the economy, in my view, the “considerable time” part of the guidance tends to focus the public’s attention on a calendar-time for liftoff rather than on the changes in economic conditions that will help determine changes in appropriate policy. I believe the Summary of Economic Projections is a better vehicle to convey information about the anticipated timing of liftoff, as it ties policy paths to the economic outlook. But I acknowledge there is a range of views about forward guidance.\n\nWith the fed funds rate effectively at zero, forward guidance has been used as a tool of monetary policy to add policy accommodation. Indicating that the future path of short-term interest rates will be low for a long time can put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, thereby spurring current economic activity even when the policy rate is at the zero lower bound. But in more normal times, away from the zero lower bound, I view forward guidance more as a communications device that conveys to the public how policy is likely to respond to changes in economic conditions. As such, I would like to see the forward guidance evolve over time to give more information about the conditions we systematically assess in calibrating the stance of policy to the economy’s actual progress and anticipated progress toward our dual-mandate goals, and to the speed with which that progress is being achieved. A faster than expected pace of progress toward our goals would argue for a faster return to normal—that is, an earlier liftoff and more rapid funds rate increases than currently anticipated by the Committee—while a more subdued pace would argue for a slower return—a later liftoff and less rapid increases. I believe that effective communication about the contingent nature of our policy will be a key ingredient as we move back toward more normal monetary policymaking.\n\nNormalization Principles and Plans\n\nIn that vein, I was very supportive of the FOMC’s release of updated information about its plans for the eventual normalization process. The release of this information was certainly not a signal of a change in the stance of policy. Rather, it was intended to provide the public with the FOMC’s current thinking on how the process is expected to go. Some of the elements are the same as the broad exit strategy principles first laid out by the Committee in June 2011. Others are necessarily new because the size and composition of the Fed’s balance sheet are quite a bit different than they were in 2011. Of course, there is likely to be some learning-by-doing as normalization proceeds, and the FOMC is prepared to adjust details of the plans if warranted by economic and financial developments. Nonetheless, the FOMC has reached a general consensus on several aspects of the process.\n\nJust as it did before the Great Recession, the FOMC will communicate the stance of monetary policy using the federal funds rate—the market rate at which banks borrow and lend reserve balances overnight to one another. We will set a target range for the funds rate, as we are doing now, and when economic conditions and the economic outlook warrant less accommodative monetary policy, we will raise the target range. But the tools the FOMC will use to bring the funds rate up to the target range will have to be different than before the crisis because the level of excess reserves held by banks is now much larger. The extraordinary accommodation and nontraditional policy tools the Fed used to address the financial crisis and deep recession have left the Fed holding nearly $4.5 trillion in assets, compared to about $900 billion before the crisis. Banks have on deposit at the Fed more than $2.7 trillion in reserves over and above what they need to meet regulatory requirements. Before the financial crisis, the level of excess reserves was less than $2 billion. With this many reserves in the system, the Fed will use the interest rate it pays on excess reserves as the main tool for moving the funds rate into the target range. When the Fed raises the rate it pays on excess reserves, this will put upward pressure on the federal funds rate since banks will be unlikely to accept a lower rate in the market than they could get by depositing their funds at the Fed. We expect that while reserves are so plentiful, the fed funds rate will trade somewhat below the interest rate on excess reserves. So we could set the excess reserves rate at the upper end of the fed funds target range.\n\nIn addition, the Fed will use other tools as needed to ensure adequate control of the policy rate. One of these tools is an overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility. Basically, with overnight reverse repos, the Fed lends securities from its large portfolio overnight in return for liquidity from eligible counterparties. Offering this alternative investment should help put a floor on the fed funds rate. But there is the potential that in times of market stress too much liquidity could be drawn from the private market to the Fed’s facility, thereby exacerbating financial market stress. To limit this possibility, the FOMC has been considering and testing different design features, and as the FOMC indicated, the overnight reverse repo facility will be used only to the extent necessary and will be phased out when it is no longer needed to help control the fed funds rate. The Fed might also use other supplementary tools like term deposits to absorb some of the excess reserves in the banking system. The Fed’s ability to pay interest on excess reserves, with these supplementary tools providing backup if needed, will allow the Fed to move interest rates up to target when it is appropriate to do so, despite the large size of our balance sheet.\n\nBut over the longer run, the Fed’s balance sheet will return to a more normal size and composition. The Fed will hold no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively and the securities it does hold will primarily be Treasury securities. Holding a broad asset class like Treasuries minimizes the effect of the Fed’s asset holdings on the allocation of credit to particular sectors of the economy or classes of borrowers.\n\nTo return to a more normal balance sheet, the FOMC intends to reduce security holdings in a gradual and predictable way, primarily by not reinvesting repayments of principle on securities it holds and letting the securities mature and run off the balance sheet. The FOMC expects to stop the reinvestments only after it begins to increase the fed funds rate. I support that ordering because I would rather the first signal of a change in the stance of monetary policy be conveyed by a change in the fed funds rate target range—our key way of communicating changes in policy—rather than by a change in reinvestment strategy.\n\nAt this point the FOMC doesn’t anticipate selling the agency mortgage-backed securities on its balance sheet as part of the normalization process, although it might engage in limited sales in the longer run to reduce or eliminate residual holdings. If so, the timing and pace of any sales would be communicated to the public in advance. At this point, I do not view asset sales as a necessary tool for controlling interest rates. But once normalization is underway, I would be open to considering a gradual path of asset sales over time as a way to return the balance sheet more quickly to the more normal size and composition we anticipate it to have over the longer run.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, the economy has made substantial progress toward the Fed’s goals of maximum employment and price stability. As the economy returns to more normal territory, monetary policymakers are prudently planning for the eventual normalization of the stance and framework for conducting monetary policy. Last week the FOMC provided its post-meeting policy statement, new economic projections, and updated information on the process it anticipates using to normalize policy. I believe such communications can play an important part in how well the trip back to normal goes by increasing the public’s understanding of the anticipated evolution of the economy and the process of returning to normal. In the end, a return to normal policy means the economic expansion with stable prices is sustainable without the support of extraordinary monetary policy—and that is a very good place to be."

            "content": "Introduction\n\nIt is a real pleasure to be here today and to address the Economic Club of Pittsburgh, the CFA Society Pittsburgh, and the Pittsburgh Society of Investment Professionals. I have been on quite a journey during my first three months on the job as the new president of the Cleveland Fed. Not only have I attended my first two Federal Open Market Committee meetings in Washington as a voting member, but I have been getting to know the Fourth Federal Reserve District, which includes Ohio, western Pennsylvania, the northern panhandle of West Virginia, and eastern Kentucky. One of my first stops was to Pittsburgh, and it is wonderful to be back here today for my first public speech since becoming president in June.\n\nThe economy and monetary policy have been on journeys of their own. Today, I want to share my views on both. But before I continue, let me note that these are my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nEconomic Conditions and the Outlook\n\nThe economy is now in its sixth year of expansion. It has been a slow and difficult journey, with some stops and starts along the way. And while the final destination has not yet been reached, the economy has made significant progress on the road back toward fulfilling the Federal Reserve’s goals of price stability and maximum employment.\n\nPerhaps the clearest signals of that progress are in the labor market. Tomorrow all eyes, including my own, will be on the Labor Department’s monthly jobs report for August. Because these statistics can vary from month to month, rather than focus on one monthly number, I like to look at the underlying trend in the data. Here, the news is good: We’ve seen steady improvement in labor market conditions. So far this year, nonfarm payrolls have risen an average of about 230,000 jobs per month, which is somewhat stronger than last year’s pace and represents significant progress since the start of the recovery. In addition, there has been some consistency in those gains, with monthly increases of more than 200,000 jobs in each of the past six months. While the recovery in jobs has been much slower than anyone would have liked, as of this May, the economy finally met the milestone of having added more jobs during the expansion than the 8.7 million jobs lost during the Great Recession.\n\nThe unemployment rate is another important gauge of labor market conditions, and it, too, has shown substantial improvement. It currently stands at 6.2 percent, down from a peak of 10 percent in October 2009, and more than a percentage point lower than a year ago. Of course, unemployment rates vary by region, depending on a number of factors. The Pittsburgh metropolitan area’s unemployment rate was near the nation’s before the recession. But it did not rise as high and has been running somewhat below the national average over the expansion, reflecting the region’s concentration of faster-growing “meds and eds” jobs.\n\nDespite regional variation, overall, the fall in the national unemployment rate has been faster than many economists and policymakers, including some on the FOMC, had anticipated. For example, last September, according to the central tendency of their projections, FOMC participants were projecting that the unemployment rate would be 6.4 to 6.8 percent in the fourth quarter of this year. But the unemployment rate is already lower than that. Other measures of unemployment or underemployment have also shown improvement over time. These include measures that track people who are working part time but would prefer a full-time job, and the long-term unemployed – people who have been out of work for more than six months.\n\nYet the labor market’s journey is not yet complete – more progress needs to be made. My outlook is that as the expansion continues, firms will continue to add to their payrolls and the unemployment rate will continue to decline. I expect that by the end of next year, the unemployment rate will fall to around 5½ percent, which is what I view as the “natural rate,” or longer-run rate, of unemployment.\n\nUnlike labor markets, economic growth needed some snow tires on its journey earlier this year. Real output fell at a slightly more than 2 percent annual rate in the first quarter. I attribute most of this stall-out to temporary factors, like the extremely bad winter weather, rather than a sign of weakening in the underlying economy. In fact, during the second quarter, we saw a significant rebound in activity, and I expect real GDP to expand at about a 3 percent annual pace in the second half of this year and next year. That growth rate is consistent with continued improvement in labor markets, which will help support income growth and keep consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of economic output, expanding at a moderate pace.\n\nAnother important positive is the considerable progress that households have made in repairing their balance sheets – but this has taken some time. The Great Recession destroyed a lot of wealth. At the aggregate level, household net worth fell by more than $10 trillion in 2008. It took more than three years to make that up. Last year, rising prices of equity, which many families hold in their pension and retirement funds, and rising house values contributed to the increase in household wealth. The improvement in real estate prices means fewer homeowners are holding negative equity in their homes and delinquencies on mortgages are down significantly.\n\nCurrently, about one in 20 mortgages is seriously delinquent, meaning either 90 days or more past due or in the process of foreclosure. Three years ago that ratio was one in 12. So things have improved, but there is still a way to go before we return to the levels seen before the housing crisis, when only one in 50 mortgages was seriously delinquent.\n\nAnd I do expect to see continued progress in the housing market. We won’t go back to the unsustainable levels of construction and surging prices that we saw prior to the crisis – nor should we want to. And like other sectors of the economy, housing won’t follow a linear path. In fact, we saw a fairly strong increase in housing activity, including housing starts and sales, in 2012 and the first half of 2013. Then, as mortgage rates rose in the second half of last year and cold weather set in, that pace of activity slowed down.1 Looking through the swing caused by the severe weather, single-family housing starts this year have been expanding at about the same pace as last year. The multifamily housing sector has shown more strength, which may represent a longer-run shift from owning to renting in the aftermath of the bursting of the housing bubble and tighter mortgage credit conditions. Overall, my outlook is for the moderate improvement in housing to continue, supported by mortgage rates that are still very low by historical standards and a level of affordability that is better than before the crisis.\n\nSimilar to households, businesses have also been repairing their balance sheets during the expansion. Corporate profits are at high levels. Nonetheless, business investment has been somewhat slower than one would have expected based on economic fundamentals. We heard from many businesses over the past two years that they had the wherewithal to invest but wanted to wait a while longer until they were more confident that the economic expansion was sustainable and some of the uncertainty about fiscal policy was resolved. We are now seeing that happen. Fiscal policy is less of a drag this year than it has been over the last couple of years, and business confidence has risen. Manufacturing surveys and anecdotal reports indicate that firms are planning to increase capital spending, and we are seeing stronger orders and shipments.\n\nPutting all of this together, I expect growth over the next six quarters to be somewhat above my estimate of trend growth, which I put at around 2.5 percent. Of course, there is always a good deal of uncertainty around estimates of trend growth, perhaps even more so today in the aftermath of such a deep recession. I am a bit more optimistic than some about longer-run growth because while productivity growth has been running low, I think it is good to remember the experience of the 1990s. Back then, over a period of several years, many forecasters revised down trend growth estimates only to subsequently revise them up significantly in response to strong productivity growth.\n\nTurning to inflation, the recent news has been encouraging. Inflation is moving back toward the Fed’s goal of 2 percent, measured by the year-over-year change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE inflation. This measure of inflation has increased to 1.6 percent this year from 1.2 percent last year. This is encouraging because we wouldn’t want to see inflation run either persistently above or persistently below our goal. Consistent with a pickup in economic growth, and expectations of inflation remaining well anchored, my forecast is that inflation will move back toward 2 percent over time.\n\nOne might ask whether that’s a reasonable inflation forecast given that we haven’t seen much acceleration in wages yet. I believe it is. Cleveland Fed analysis, based on several measures of wages and broader compensation, indicates that it is difficult to find a lead-lag relationship between wages and prices – the strongest correlations are contemporaneous ones, especially since the mid-1980s.2 We should expect wages to rise with prices, not necessarily lead prices. In my view, it would not be prudent for policymakers to simply wait for wages to accelerate before assessing the implications of the stance of monetary policy for future price inflation. Indeed, policymakers must always be forward looking. We must continue to process incoming information on economic activity, labor market conditions, and prices, and assess whether or not that information is consistent with or has changed our outlook. We also have to keep in mind the risks that surround the forecast, including the geopolitical risks that have escalated in recent weeks. Despite these risks, my read of the data and the incoming information we collect from our business contacts is that the economy is standing on firmer ground than it has been for some time. The economy has made, and continues to make, substantial progress on its journey back to our dual-mandate goals.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nSo that’s my travelogue of the economy’s journey. But in response to the financial crisis and deep recession, monetary policy took a journey of its own – into uncharted waters. The depth and nature of the recession required the Federal Reserve to run an extraordinarily accommodative monetary policy to promote our goals of price stability and maximum employment. The FOMC has kept its policy rate – the federal funds rate – at essentially zero since the end of 2008. To exert downward pressure on long-term interest rates, it has purchased longer-term Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities, expanding the Fed’s balance sheet from about $900 billion in 2007 to almost $4.5 trillion today. It has also used forward guidance to communicate the anticipated future path of policy.\n\nAs the economy journeys back to more normal territory, monetary policy will also need to navigate back to more normal seas – something you probably have heard referred to as “policy normalization.” Eventually we will be able to move away from our extraordinary policy tools, like asset purchases, and back toward implementing monetary policy by targeting short-term interest rates. In fact, already, based on the cumulative progress the economy has made in labor markets, since the start of the year, the FOMC has been scaling back the pace at which it has been buying assets. At our July meeting, the FOMC voted to reduce the pace by another $10 billion, to $25 billion a month. If the economy continues on my anticipated trajectory, then I expect the asset purchase program to end this fall.\n\nYet, even with the end of the purchase program, the Fed’s balance sheet will remain very large, with assets of much longer maturity than usual, and this will complicate the normalization journey. The FOMC has been developing tools to help during the trip. One of these tools, an overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility, is currently being tested. Basically, with reverse repos, the Fed lends securities from its large portfolio in return for liquidity, which is thereby drained from the market. The Fed also is testing the use of term deposits to absorb some of the excess reserves in the banking system. The FOMC has been discussing the design of these tools, which would be intended for limited use during normalization. The Fed’s ability to pay interest on excess reserves, with these supplementary tools providing backup if needed, will allow the Fed to move interest rates up to target when it is appropriate to do so, despite the large size of our balance sheet.\n\nIn addition to taking another step to taper asset purchases, in July, the FOMC maintained its forward guidance on interest rates. This guidance indicated that given our assessment of realized and expected progress toward our dual-mandate objectives, it will likely be appropriate to maintain the current 0-to-¼ percentage point range for the federal funds rate for a considerable period after the asset purchase program ends. With the end of the program nearing, I believe it is again time for the Committee to reformulate its forward guidance. The forward guidance the FOMC has offered for the path of the policy interest rate has undergone several changes along the way as we’ve moved from the extraordinary times of financial crisis and deep recession to recovery and expansion. The guidance has tied the eventual liftoff of the fed funds rate from zero to a calendar date, to a numerical threshold for the unemployment rate, and, more recently, to qualitative information rather than to quantitative measures.\n\nWhile it might sound best to simply give a date about when liftoff is likely to occur, I believe using a calendar date at this point would be poor communication. It could mislead the public into thinking that policy is on a pre-set course. If the public doesn’t understand that policy is dynamic and based on the economic outlook, then a change in the guidance can create its own disruption. Well-formulated forward guidance also has to recognize that economic conditions can evolve differently than anticipated. For example, over the past year the improvement in the unemployment rate has been faster than the FOMC anticipated just a year ago. My preference is for forward guidance to convey that changes in the stance of policy will be calibrated to the economy’s actual progress and anticipated progress toward our dual-mandate goals, and to the speed with which that progress is being achieved. This latter piece recognizes the importance of policy to be forward looking: A faster pace of progress toward our goals would argue for a faster return to normal, while a more subdued pace would argue for a slower return.\n\nCommunication\n\nForward guidance is just one aspect of the communications that will be an important part of the journey back toward normal monetary policy. The FOMC will need to do its best to communicate the rationale for its policy decisions and to prepare the public for this unprecedented trip.\n\nOf course, effective communication is not a trivial task. Yet the potential economic benefits have kept the FOMC striving for increased transparency over time. It’s hard to believe that it was just 20 years ago, in 1994, when the FOMC first began to issue a statement after it had changed policy. Since then the FOMC has taken other steps, including expediting the release of the minutes of its meetings, publishing economic projections four times a year followed by the Chair’s press conference, and releasing a statement clarifying our longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy.\n\nThe FOMC is continuing its journey toward more effective communications. This summer, Chair Yellen asked Governor Fischer to chair, and Governor Powell, President Williams of the San Francisco Fed, and myself to serve on a subcommittee on communications to help the FOMC frame and organize the discussion of a broad range of communications issues. I believe striving for clearer communication will yield benefits, especially as we undertake normalization. As normalization nears and progresses, there is likely to be increased volatility in financial markets; that is not necessarily a bad thing. Indeed, the goal of communication is not to reduce all volatility – volatility is a necessary part of price discovery in financial markets. But the better we can communicate our monetary policy framework and the basis for policy decisions, the more likely we can avoid undesirable disruptions and turbulence that could result from misunderstandings as we prepare for and progress on the journey to a more normal policymaking framework and policy stance.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, the economy has made considerable progress on its journey back to maximum employment and price stability. Although there are risks around the forecast, including geopolitical ones, my expectation is for the economy to continue to make progress, with growth at about 3 percent over the second half of this year and next year, the unemployment rate falling to 5½ percent – my estimate of the natural rate – by the end of next year, and inflation returning to 2 percent over the next two years. Monetary policy remains extraordinarily accommodative, but as labor markets have shown considerable improvement, the FOMC is tapering the pace at which it is purchasing longer-term securities, and I anticipate that program to end this fall.\n\nGiven the uncharted waters we are in, the journey back to a normal monetary policy stance and framework for conducting policy is a challenging one, and the FOMC continues to plan for it. The communication surrounding normalization is going to play an important part in how well the journey goes. Explaining the factors that influence the changes in the outlook and FOMC policy decisions, as well as how the FOMC plans to conduct policy, can help the public make informed expectations as the economy evolves and monetary policy travels back to normal."

            "content": "I thank the Cleveland Fed for inviting me to speak today. And I thank you, Sandy, for that very warm introduction. I am honored to have been chosen as the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s next president and CEO. I realize I have a very hard act to follow, but I am very grateful that Sandy has built such a fine institution. The conference we have enjoyed over the past two days underscores the strengths and interests of the researchers at the Cleveland Fed, and I plan to build on that foundation when I officially start my new job next week.\n\nUnderstanding inflation dynamics is of vital importance to central banks. Today I will focus on some open research questions surrounding inflation from a policymaking viewpoint. I toyed with the idea of titling my talk “We Need Your Help,” but thought better of it. Nonetheless, my hope is to inspire researchers to work on some of these questions and perhaps participate in a future conference here at the Cleveland Fed.\n\nI view conferences that bring together central bank, academic, and market economists, as well as members of the business community, as important avenues to improve our collective understanding of the economic issues facing monetary policymakers.\n\nBefore continuing, I note that my remarks represent my own views and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Benefits of Price Stability\n\nCongress has directed the Federal Reserve to conduct monetary policy in pursuit of a dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices. In my view, these goals are complements.\n\nIn keeping with the theme of our conference, I am going to concentrate on the price stability part of the mandate. The benefits of price stability for the economy seem clear and have been pointed out by a number of Fed officials over the years.1\n\nWhen prices are stable, businesses and consumers can focus on productive activities rather than on ways to protect the purchasing power of their money. They can make long-term plans and commitments without having to deal with the uncertainty about the value of their money. Also, when the price level is stable, any price changes reflect changes in the supplies of certain goods or services relative to others. These relative price changes provide important information for businesses and consumers when deciding where to allocate their scarce resources.\n\nAnother significant benefit of price stability is that it promotes the other important responsibilities of the central bank. It helps foster financial stability by minimizing unexpected transfers from lenders to borrowers that happen when inflation causes loan values to fall. And by fostering confidence in the economy, price stability supports growth and maximum employment, the other part of the Fed’s dual mandate.\n\nRecent Policy Developments\n\nSo I think you will agree that price stability is valuable and it is an important goal of monetary policy. This is fitting since over the longer run, monetary policy is the principal determinant of inflation. In fact, the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, made this important point in its statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy, which it issued in January 2012 and has affirmed each year since.\n\nThis statement lays out the guiding principles that the FOMC follows in setting monetary policy. As part of those principles, the statement established for the first time an explicit numerical goal for inflation over the longer run. The goal is 2 percent inflation, as measured by the year-over-year change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE inflation. Being explicit about the inflation objective reflects the FOMC’s desire to be transparent and communicate clearly to the public. But it also underscores the FOMC’s commitment to price stability.\n\nWhen businesses and consumers have confidence that the central bank is committed to 2 percent inflation over the longer run and will defend that target when inflation is either above or below it, they are more likely to look through temporary changes in inflation. This helps anchor inflation expectations at the target. As a result, underlying inflation will be less responsive to one-time supply shocks, such as changes in the price of oil. So having an explicit target helps promote price stability.\n\nI view the FOMC’s statement on its longer-run goals as entirely consistent with the Fed’s dual mandate. The statement makes explicit that the FOMC will take a balanced approach to meeting its mandated goals and explains why the FOMC has established a numerical objective for inflation but not a comparable one for maximum employment. Monetary policy is the chief determinant of inflation over the longer run, but the maximum level of employment is largely determined by demographics, production technology, and other factors that change over time and are not influenced by monetary policy.\n\nWhile the FOMC can choose the value of inflation it seeks to achieve over the longer run, it does not have the ability to achieve just any long-run objective for employment.\n\nLong-run employment is determined by economic fundamentals. That said, sound monetary policy is a necessary ingredient in promoting strong economic fundamentals, allowing the economy to more effectively achieve its potential.\n\nBy helping policymakers set appropriate monetary policy, the explicit 2 percent inflation target promotes not only price stability but also full employment over the longer run.\n\nToday, the FOMC reiterates that 2 percent inflation goal in the policy statement it releases after its meetings. And the target is an important part of its forward guidance on the policy interest rate. For example, the April policy statement said that in deciding how long to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate, the FOMC will assess realized and expected progress toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.\n\nOpen Research Questions on Inflation and Inflation Expectations and the Implications for Monetary Policy\n\nThat the FOMC is now more explicitly formulating its monetary policy in terms of projected progress toward its goals underscores how important it is for policymakers to be able to accurately measure inflation and inflation expectations and to forecast inflation over the medium and longer run. As we have discussed over the past two days of the conference, there has been considerable progress in advancing our knowledge of inflation dynamics, measurement, and forecasting. But there is more work to do.\n\nLet me discuss six open questions – not quite as many as a David Letterman Top-Ten List – but questions where I believe further research will help inform our understanding of inflation and in turn, aid monetary policymaking. I will start with a couple of measurement issues.\n\nFirst, how should we estimate the underlying trend in inflation?\n\nThere are various measures of inflation. The FOMC’s preferred measure of consumer inflation is the PCE inflation rate. A perhaps more familiar measure is the Consumer Price Index, or CPI, inflation rate.2 Even though these and other measures of inflation tend to move together over the long run, they can diverge in the short run.\n\nPolicymakers need to look through noisy month-to-month changes in the indexes to discern the underlying trend in inflation. They need a way to separate temporary changes from changes that are more persistent. To get a signal about the underlying trend, many economists look at the traditional core measures of PCE and CPI inflation, which exclude the prices of food and energy because they tend to be very volatile.\n\nBut research has shown that the prices of other components of the CPI basket, like apparel, tend to be even more volatile than the prices of food.3 For that reason, the Cleveland Fed’s measures of median CPI inflation and 16 percent trimmed-mean CPI inflation are potentially more informative than the core CPI measure.\n\nIn constructing their measures, Cleveland Fed economists exclude a percentage of the most volatile components each month regardless of which items they happen to be. These measures have been shown to help identify the underlying trend in CPI inflation.4 On the other hand, some of my own research has shown that headline PCE inflation can beat the core measure in predicting future PCE inflation.\n\nAnd a further forecasting complication is that the PCE inflation rate gets revised over time. This leads me to my second research question: How should monetary policymakers incorporate revisions to PCE inflation into their policymaking framework?\n\nPolicymakers need to set monetary policy in real time knowing that their policy affects the economy with a lag and knowing that their targeted inflation measure is subject to revision. The revisions are beneficial because they reflect new data that yield a more accurate measure of inflation. But the revisions also pose a challenge to setting monetary policy. For example, in early 2002, policymakers were concerned about a drop in inflation. However, this drop was ultimately revised away.\n\nOf course, policymakers know that the data are going to be revised. In fact, some interesting research has shown that the revisions can be predicted to a certain extent.5\n\nBetter understanding the magnitude and pattern of these revisions could help inform policymakers about how best to respond to changes in measured inflation rates. More broadly, further research on how monetary policymakers should set policy in the face of uncertainty about the state of the economy would be useful.\n\nMy next questions concern the nexus between our economic models and our measures of inflation.\n\nQuestion three asks: Would households and businesses be better off if the central bank chose to target an inflation measure other than headline inflation?\n\nSome theoretical models suggest this is the case – although there is still a lot of debate in the literature. According to some models, central banks should target those prices of goods and services that tend to adjust slowly to changing economic conditions – what economists call “sticky prices.”6\n\nTo see some of the practical implications of this question, suppose the model is right and it is best to stabilize sticky prices. One admittedly crude way to identify sticky versus flexible prices is to break up the overall Consumer Price Index into its services and goods components. Today, if you look at core prices in the service sector, inflation has been relatively stable at 2.25 to 2.5 percent since 2012. It is the less sticky core goods prices that have decelerated and have brought the broader measures of inflation down below the FOMC’s goal.\n\nEven a less crude measure of flexible versus sticky price inflation, which was developed at the Cleveland Fed and is now provided by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, shows that sticky price inflation has been relatively stable around 2 percent.7 To the extent that the model is valid, this paints a more benign view of recent inflation, one that could have implications for the appropriate path of monetary policy.\n\nOf course, these models are simplifications, based on several assumptions, and not ready to be used for setting monetary policy. However, I think this example provides ample motivation for further research on alternative measures of inflation and modeling.\n\nThat our models could benefit from further research underscores my fourth research question: How should we reconcile the actual pricing behavior of firms with predictions from the workhorse inflation model used by many mainstream macroeconomists, the so-called New Keynesian model?\n\nThe availability of data on the individual prices used to construct aggregate price indexes like the CPI has allowed some intrepid researchers to establish several interesting facts about real-world pricing behavior.\n\nOne finding is that firms appear to change prices more frequently than predicted by standard macroeconomic models that have been calibrated to match various features of the macroeconomic business cycle.8 This is a troubling finding in that it suggests a disconnect between the micro data and macro models that are often used to inform monetary policy analysis. Better reconciliation of the models with the empirical facts of the micro data would be a welcome avenue of additional research, and I would expect our models to improve the more we learn.\n\nIn fact, models of inflation have evolved over time as economists have become more knowledgeable about inflation dynamics. Modern theories have emphasized the important role of inflation expectations in determining current and future inflation. This brings me to my fifth research question: Which measure provides the best gauge of inflation expectations?\n\nSurveys provide one way to measure inflation expectations. The Michigan Survey asks households about their inflation expectations. The Blue Chip Consensus Forecast polls economists. And the Philadelphia Fed’s Survey of Professional Forecasters does exactly what its name suggests. But surveys do not solve the measurement problem because the measures differ across surveys.\n\nSo economists have derived other measures of inflation expectations from financial market data, including the spread between nominal Treasury bond yields and yields on TIPs, or Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, and rates on inflation swaps. But isolating inflation expectations from these measures is not a trivial challenge.\n\nTo help address the measurement issue, the Cleveland Fed produces estimates of inflation expectations that combine information from a number of different sources.\n\nThe methodology is based on a model of long-term interest rates, which reflect expectations about what short-term interest rates will be in the future, as well as the premia investors demand to compensate for expected inflation and for the volatility in inflation and short-term interest rates over time. Cleveland Fed researchers use data on nominal yields, inflation swaps, and surveys of inflation expectations to separately identify these factors, which allows for a better measure of inflation expectations.\n\nIn addition to improved measures, clearer understanding of how inflation expectations are formulated and the interplay between expectations and actual inflation would be quite useful to monetary policymakers. While theory suggests that changes in inflation expectations should lead changes in inflation, in some studies, the empirics go the other way.\n\nMoreover, there have been times when inflation expectations seem to have become disconnected from actual inflation. For example, in Japan, after a long period of being stuck near zero, actual inflation ran below zero from 2009 through mid-2013. Even so, measures of inflation expectations were near 2 percent, well above actual inflation for a number of years.9\n\nThis presents a conundrum. Either the measures of expectations are off, or our theories of inflation and inflation expectations are off, or both. Whichever it is, there are implications for inflation forecasts that put significant weight on inflation expectations.\n\nThis brings me to my sixth and final research question: Is there a way for central banks to communicate about inflation and inflation expectations that will help ensure inflation expectations remain well-anchored and increase the central bank’s credibility for achieving its inflation target?\n\nAnswering this question hinges on better knowledge of the relationship between inflation and inflation expectations, more accurate models of inflation dynamics that match the data, and measures that lead to more accurate forecasts of the underlying inflation rate – all the research questions I have just discussed. I believe effective central bank communication is a crucial area of further research, especially in today’s environment when monetary policymakers are relying on forward guidance on interest rates as a primary policy tool.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn my remarks today I have focused on the price stability part of the dual mandate, in keeping with the theme of this conference. We cannot have full employment over the longer run without price stability over the longer run. That is why understanding inflation is so important for Federal Reserve policymakers who aim to set policy to achieve both parts of their dual mandate.\n\nI have laid out quite an ambitious research agenda. But good policymaking depends on the research that informs it. I urge researchers at central banks, in academia, and in the private sector to tackle the questions I have discussed, and to do so sooner rather than later. I hope we can reconvene this group at a future Cleveland Fed conference to discuss your advances.\n\nThe more we understand inflation dynamics, the more we will understand how inflation will respond to changes in monetary policy. These findings are going to be particularly relevant as the Fed, in response to improvements in economic conditions, returns to a more normal policy setting framework over time."

I am honored to be participating in this session with Governor Noyer (Banque de France) and Deputy Governor Nishimura (Bank of Japan). The Global Interdependence Center has a long history of bringing together financial market participants, industry experts, government officials, and media representatives to discuss the most pressing issues of the day. This Tokyo conference upholds and extends that fine tradition.\n\nThe title of this session is “Monetary Policy: How to Cope with the Current Financial Crisis.” There is no denying that many countries are facing serious economic challenges right now. We have already heard something about these challenges from a European and a Japanese perspective; I will offer some observations from the United States. I want to note, however, that my remarks reflect my own views, and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThis morning I would like to discuss how the Federal Reserve's framework for conducting monetary policy has evolved during the past decade. In my view, this evolution has been strongly influenced by developments in economic theory, by lessons from the Great Depression, and by the ongoing economic challenges here in Japan. Although much has been written about the Federal Reserve's use of unconventional monetary policy in response to the global financial crisis, I suggest that the response itself should be seen as a very natural progression in the application of economic knowledge. That alone, of course, is no guarantee of unqualified success, but it should provide a high degree of confidence in the design of the basic approach to policy that the Federal Reserve has been taking in the past few years.\n\nI plan to elaborate on this perspective in the remarks that follow. First, I will briefly describe how the development of rational expectations theory during the past few decades has come to exert a broad influence on the design and practice of U.S. monetary policy. Second, I will briefly review the recent financial crisis in the United States, highlighting some lessons learned from the Great Depression and from the ongoing challenges in Japan to promote economic growth and price stability. Although I will refer specifically to the United States and Japan, I do not mean to imply any exclusivity; my comments are broadly applicable to monetary policy in many other countries. Third, I will illustrate how the Federal Reserve's monetary policy framework and practices have evolved to incorporate knowledge from theory and experience. I will conclude with some thoughts about the potential costs and risks associated with U.S. monetary policy.\n\nInsights from Rational Expectations\n\nWhen I first became a Federal Reserve economist, the rational expectations revolution in economics was just beginning in academia and had yet to affect the development and implementation of monetary policy. Rational expectations is just a shorthand way of saying that the behavior of people and business firms inside of our economic models has to be consistent with the way the economy actually performs. For example, people cannot be modeled as systematically underestimating the inflation rate that the model actually generates; they know how the economy actually works and cannot be systematically fooled. In those days, we didn't realize that our models rested on several flawed principles, and that we were not characterizing monetary policy in a very satisfactory way.\n\nOne significant flaw was the manner in which inflation expectations were modeled: Inflation would typically be generated in the models in ways that were inconsistent with the other equations that specified how economic actors behaved. Another flaw was in the estimation of model parameters: Until Robert Lucas pointed it out, macroeconomists did not realize that models estimated under one policy regime would not likely provide accurate information under a different regime. That meant that such models should not be relied on to assess how the economy would perform if the strategy driving monetary policy were to change. Third, we did not realize the usefulness of actually defining monetary policy as a rule for systematically adjusting a variable under the central bank's control-such as the federal funds rate or the monetary base-in response to the economy's movements away from desired outcomes, such as full employment and price stability.1 In particular, the seminal work of Kydland and Prescott spawned a literature on the use of rules as “commitment devices” through which policymakers could implement policy strategies that would be durably optimal through time.2\n\nThe rational expectations revolution arose and attracted attention in policymaking circles because it showed promise in solving a problem that the reigning framework could not-namely, inflation had been accelerating for nearly a decade and was undermining the performance of the real economy. The economist Athanasios Orphanides reviewed U.S. monetary policy during the 1970s in the following way:\n\n“Close examination of policy during the Great Inflation suggests that actual policy decisions were consistent with application of a “modern\" systematic, activist, forward-looking approach to policy. Policy was consistent with an inflation target of two percent, which should have safeguarded the goal of reasonable price stability. Policy responded strongly to forecasts of inflation and the unemployment gap, which could have been reasonably expected to result in a high degree of economic stability. Policy was meant to guide the economy to its “optimum feasible path,\" consistent with what some “modern\" research emphasizing activist policy design would suggest would be the “optimal\" strategy to follow. And yet, economic outcomes were disastrous.”3\n\nThe rational expectations literature developed quickly during the 1980s, but it took some time for its insights to change the way the Federal Reserve and other central banks thought about the design and implementation of monetary policy.4 Let's face it: The reason that “conventional wisdom” is “conventional wisdom” is that it usually produces acceptable results. Montagu Norman, the secretive Governor of the Bank of England in the 1920s is famously quoted as saying, “Never explain, never apologize.” Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan was well known during his tenure for his deliberately obscure comments on the direction of interest rates. And it was not until 1994 that the Federal Open Market Committee, known as the FOMC, began to issue statements after its meetings, and not until 1999 that statements were issued after every meeting. Needless to say, the conversion to a new monetary policy framework took a while, as new ideas were debated, evaluated, and modified to fit into a consistent framework that could satisfy theorists and practitioners alike. Today, these insights are taken for granted as the “stock in trade” of working economists.\n\nSo how have these and other advances in economic thought transformed central banking? Today, monetary policy is understood as being more than decisions made at individual policy meetings to adjust the short-term interest rate. Instead, monetary policy is now thought of as a forward-looking endeavor. We recognize that businesses and consumers make decisions based in part on their expectations of how the central bank will behave. They will form expectations of our goals and how we are likely to respond to future economic and financial conditions. These expectations are then embodied in the prices of all financial assets. Consequently, the entire term structure of interest rates reflects the public's expectation of the entire sequence of short-term policy rate decisions.\n\nNot only is transparency important in a democracy for its own sake, but also because it will lead to better economic outcomes. Drawing on the insights from rational expectations, central banks now recognize that the public can make wasteful economic decisions if it constantly has to guess what the central bank is doing, and that the public is not going to be systematically fooled in any event. Fundamentally, if the public does not trust its central bank to make good decisions, it will take actions to protect itself from what it perceives to be the harmful effects of those policies.\n\nToday, best practices in central banking require policymakers to be explicit about their objectives and to gain the credibility necessary to achieve them. To be credible, central banks must have objectives that can be feasibly achieved through time; they must have policy tools that can get the job done; and they must provide the public with the information it needs to understand how the central bank is likely to respond to evolving conditions. Central banks have learned that as awkward as transparency might be on occasion, over the longer term transparency-not secrecy-is their friend. A central bank without an effective communications strategy today is operating with one hand tied behind its back.\n\nLet me emphasize this point in another way. Central banks realize that an important part of their business is to manage the public's expectations about monetary policy. Central banks that can consistently deliver what they promise will likely build credibility that can be highly useful during challenging times-for example, times when the central bank might have to deviate from past practices to accomplish its objectives.\n\nRational expectations theory developed at a time when the United States was grappling with high inflation. Policies that were “supposed” to work were not working, which created a climate that was accepting of innovation. However, we have also seen periods of deflation prove to be fertile ground for monetary policy innovation. Consider the U. S. experience many decades ago during the Great Depression as well more recent experience here in Japan, which has been experiencing subpar growth and mild deflation.\n\nLessons from the Great Depression and Japan\n\nThe Great Depression was a global event that remains fascinating to economists even now, some 75 years later. As remarkable as it may seem, economists still disagree about what caused it. Fortunately, there is considerably more agreement about some of the forces at work that transmitted and amplified the original tremors, turning them into an economic catastrophe. Misguided monetary policy ranks high on the list. Milton Friedman's research led him to conclude that the Federal Reserve transformed what would otherwise have been an ordinary recession into a depression by allowing the money supply to decline by one-third between 1929 and 1933. Other researchers contend that the Federal Reserve compounded this initial failure through benign neglect for more than a decade, beginning in 1932.5 The mistake here, say the economic historians, was the belief that monetary policy becomes completely ineffective once short-term interest rates fall to zero.\n\nMany lessons have been drawn from the Great Depression. In a speech two years ago, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke discussed several that he had taken to heart, one of which I want to highlight today.6 Chairman Bernanke stressed that policymakers must respond forcefully, creatively, and decisively to severe financial crises. He noted that early in the Depression, policymakers essentially failed to respond at all to the failing economy. As he put it, “They were insufficiently willing to challenge the orthodoxies of their day.” He notes that it was Franklin Roosevelt who, in a break from the conventional economic wisdom of his day, made the decision to take the United States off the gold standard. Leaving the gold standard enabled the dollar to depreciate and thus helped to increase production and put an end to deflation. The big takeaway here is that monetary policy is not powerless just because the short-term interest rate is near zero.\n\nAcademic research conducted since the Great Depression has coalesced into a more general framework for explaining how central banks can offset recessionary and deflationary pressures when short-term interest rates are near zero. One strategy would be to convince the public that short-term interest rates would remain low for a considerable period of time, for example, until deflationary pressures evaporated. Another strategy would be to resist deflationary pressures and stimulate economic growth by undertaking large-scale asset purchases.\n\nOn the basis of this research, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) has adopted each of these strategies at various times since the late 1990s to combat deflation and weak economic performance. The BOJ has promised to keep rates low until deflation pressures dissipate, and it first launched a large-scale asset purchase program in 2001. This program was dramatically expanded in the next few years, and essentially ended in 2006 after early signs that deflation was abating. In 2010, in response to a re-emergence of deflation and a slowdown in economic growth, the Bank of Japan launched a new Comprehensive Monetary Easing program and bought roughly $1.1 trillion in Japanese government bonds and other assets.\n\nDeciding that this action was not sufficient, the BOJ just recently announced another asset purchase program, to continue until inflation on a year-over-year basis hits 1 percent.7 It is clear that the BOJ has been experimenting with various communications and asset purchase programs to provide the necessary policy stimulus. Nevertheless, as Japan's current situation illustrates all too painfully, success is not guaranteed. Practical experience in Japan reveals that it is not easy to design effective communication and policy strategies, despite what economic textbooks indicate and macro models predict will work.8 The lessons from Japan's experience seem to be (1) work strenuously to avoid deflation pressure and zero interest rates in the first place; (2) quantitative easing must be done on a very large scale, and (3) do not remove monetary accommodation prematurely.\n\nFederal Reserve Monetary Policy\n\nLet me turn to the implications of what I have said so far for U.S. monetary policy. I do not plan on reviewing the Federal Reserve's actions during the last few years in much detail, as they have been extensively covered in the financial press and in speeches by other Federal Reserve officials. Instead, I hope to illustrate how the evolution in economic thought, combined with the lessons taken from the Great Depression and Japan, have influenced the Federal Reserve's strategy for addressing the economic collapse, and its aftermath, in the United States.\n\nIn the United States, the first signs of financial instability appeared in the summer of 2007, but it was not until the following summer that the full magnitude and nature of the problem became truly evident. As market liquidity died up and market functioning became impaired, the Federal Reserve lowered its policy interest rates and focused its efforts on lending to illiquid institutions. Nevertheless, the economy plunged into the deepest recession the country had seen since the Great Depression.\n\nBy the end of 2008, the federal funds rate, the Federal Reserve's primary policy interest rate, had been reduced to essentially zero, and could be reduced no further. However, in a departure from the Great Depression era, the modern Federal Reserve did not perceive the zero lower bound on interest rates to be a barrier to further action. Chairman Bernanke in particular had studied the Great Depression carefully, and he had also paid close attention to Japan's challenges in overcoming the zero interest rate floor.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's strategy quickly emerged, and it was based on three components: large-scale asset purchases, communications, and an exit strategy. I will discuss each in turn, beginning with asset purchases. The Federal Reserve's decision to purchase longer-term assets at a large scale is fundamentally designed to approximate the actions that it would otherwise take with its conventional policy tool, the federal funds rate. The key point here is that this balance-sheet approach is not primarily focused on increasing reserves to the banking system, but rather on depressing the yield on risk-free assets relative to risk assets. The result should be more credit being directed to private-sector investments, such as corporate debt and equities, and the mortgage market.\n\nThe Federal Reserve announced its first Large Scale Asset Purchase, commonly known as QE1, in November 2008. Several months later the FOMC decided to ease financial conditions further, and by the end of 2009, the FOMC had announced plans to purchase up to $1.75 trillion in U.S. Treasury securities, debt issued by the housing-related government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), and the mortgage-backed securities the GSEs insure.\n\nHowever, despite the easing in monetary conditions achieved through these unprecedented steps, the economy failed to gain traction the following year. Alarmingly, inflation fell below 1 percent and the risk of deflation was rising. In an effort to both strengthen the economic recovery and head off the risk of deflation, the FOMC announced QE2 in November 2010. With this initiative, the FOMC purchased an additional $600 billion in longer-term U.S. Treasury securities, bringing the cumulative size of asset purchases to about $2.35 trillion. Unfortunately, despite the subsequent end of the deflation threat, the FOMC decided that a further easing in monetary conditions was appropriate.\n\nThe second component of the Federal Reserve's strategy is communications. The Federal Reserve has been providing substantially more information to the public than ever before regarding its objectives, the economic outlook, and its expectations regarding the likely path of the federal funds rate several years into the future. These communications are designed to enable the public to better anticipate how the Federal Reserve will likely respond to changes in the economic outlook.9\n\nOne important communication innovation is the FOMC's announcement in January of this year that it had established numerical values for its dual mandate objectives of price stability and maximum employment. The FOMC determined that 2 percent inflation and an unemployment rate in the range of 5.2 to 6 percent are the values it sees as being most compatible with efficient economic performance over the longer term. The FOMC also noted that inflation is controllable by monetary policy, but the longer-run unemployment rate is primarily determined by non-monetary factors.\n\nThe FOMC has also bolstered its communications by providing a quarterly summary of economic projections, which, among other pieces of information, includes the FOMC participants' projections of the federal funds rate. The Chairman holds a press conference to introduce and explain these economic and policy projections.\n\nThe third strategy component relates to the removal of extraordinary policy accommodation. Even as it was preparing for a significant expansion in its balance sheet, the Federal Reserve prepared an exit strategy. The FOMC has published the principles that will guide the return to policy normalization; and it has been testing the tools it will use when the time comes.10In doing so, the Federal Reserve has not been just following good risk management practices; it has recognized that a sound exit policy is critical to the credibility of its strategy in the first place.11 In this sense, the FOMC's statement regarding its exit principles helps it to “commit” to removing its extraordinary policy accommodation in a prudent manner.\n\nThe FOMC's policy statement following its September meeting very clearly illustrates the progression of the FOMC's use of communications to augment and enhance the decisions it makes about balance-sheet actions. The FOMC decided at the September meeting to initiate a third asset purchase program. Rather than announce a purchase program of a specific size, the FOMC indicated it would purchase additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month, and that if the labor market outlook does not improve substantially, the FOMC will continue its purchase of agency mortgage-backed securities and undertake additional asset purchases until such an outcome is achieved-mindful, of course, of its price stability objective. In addition, the FOMC also said it expects a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens and, in particular, that exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate are likely to be warranted at least through mid-2015.\n\nIn this statement we can see all of the elements of the FOMC's policy strategy at work: forward guidance about the likely path of the federal funds rate, asset purchases at large scale, and a linkage between the scale and pacing of the asset purchase program with the evolving economic outlook. The amount of assets to be purchased will depend on how the economic outlook evolves, as well as the FOMC's assessment of the relative benefits and costs of the program. Nevertheless, it is clear by now that the Federal Reserve's balance sheet has dramatically expanded already, and more seems in the offing. Has the strategy been successful?\n\nResearch on the effects of our balance-sheet operations indicates that they have been keeping 10-year Treasury yields well below what they otherwise would have been.12 The same can be said for yields on mortgage-backed securities. These benefits have not compromised the FOMC's commitment to price stability: Inflation has been running in the 2 percent range lately, and inflation expectations appear to be well-anchored.13 Furthermore, simulations with the Federal Reserve's FRB/US macro model indicate that GDP growth would have been notably weaker, and unemployment notably greater, in the absences of QE1 and QE2.14\n\nOf course, the full scope of the announced policy actions has yet to play out. Nevertheless, despite vigorous efforts-by the Federal Reserve since 2008, and by the Bank of Japan since 2001- such as the large-scale asset purchases, accompanied by various forms of communications, forward guidance, and commitment, there is still a long way to go to reach full employment in each country. It is quite possible that quantitative easing programs and forward guidance have a smaller impact on the actual economies than they do on models of actual economies. As Federal Reserve Board Governor Jeremy Stein recently observed, some tenets of corporate finance theory suggest that large-scale asset purchases might have diminishing returns over time.\n\nWhere Stein is cautious, there are some economists who are far more skeptical. A recent paper by the economist Michael Woodford articulates the view that asset purchases per se have not, and cannot, affect spending. In his view, purchases do not lead to changes in asset prices in financial markets, but might operate through a signaling effect that interest rates will remain low for a long time. The only mechanism that will work to induce more spending is a commitment to keep rates low for longer than would be normally expected on the basis of prior practice, along with a tolerance for higher inflation in the short term.15\n\nHere is where, perhaps, Japan and the United States part company. The United States experienced a very large contraction only a few years ago, but has not suffered from deflation. Japan, on the other hand, has been struggling with a chronic growth and deflation problem for well more than a decade.\n\nWe are living in very difficult times, harder for policymakers than for economists. Economists have theories and models to inform them, but policymakers must find a way to forge a workable strategy from the different perspectives and incomplete evidence. As Orphanides made clear in his characterization of U.S. monetary policy during the 1970s, central bankers need to be careful about becoming too enamored of their theories and their models, especially when they are dealing with unusual circumstances.\n\nCentral bankers in the United States, Europe, and Japan have demonstrated a great willingness to escape the “orthodoxies of their day.” Nevertheless, the final chapters of these respective stories have yet to be written. No country has yet successfully emerged from the application of these new and unconventional techniques and renormalized its policy operations. Despite our impression that we are headed in the right direction, central bankers must remain vigilant.\n\nWe all have much to learn, and much hard work ahead of us."
