This is the third year\nthat our Bank has sponsored a conference on education. Some of you\nmay be asking: Why is a Federal Reserve Bank, which is engaged in\nsetting national monetary policy, focusing on education? After all, the\nFederal Reserve's objectives for monetary policy are price stability\nand maximum sustainable economic growth.\nLet me share my enthusiasm for studying the connection between\neducation and economic growth. As president of the Federal Reserve\nBank of Cleveland, I serve the Fourth Federal Reserve District, which\nincludes Ohio, western Pennsylvania, eastern Kentucky and the\npanhandle of West Virginia. After I was named president in early\n2003, I spent a lot of time meeting with business leaders throughout\nthe District. I found that my conversations with them were\ndominated by concerns about the economic challenges we were\nfacing as a region.\n\nPresident and CEO,\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nConference on Universities,\nInnovation, and Economic Growth\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nNovember 17, 2006\n\nAlthough the national economy was recovering from the recession,\nour District was not recovering at the same pace. Indeed, our District\nis still lagging the nation, especially in terms of employment growth.\nNationally, employment growth has rebounded. Nearly 3 1/2 million\nnet jobs have been created since the business cycle peak.\nIn the Fourth District states, however, employment has yet to return\nto its pre-recession levels. Indeed, we are still down by about 36,000\nnet jobs. This disappointing economic performance has caused our\nBank to devote more research to the factors that drive economic\ngrowth.\nEconomists at our Bank have been studying this aspect of the\neconomy for several years now. Recently, they have concluded that\ndifferences in state income levels over the past 75 years can be\nexplained mostly by two factors: innovation and education. In simple\nterms, those states that enhance their knowledge base are the ones\nthat are likely to prosper in the future.\nFor example, states that have a high degree of inventiveness - which\nis measured by the number of patents per resident - can gain\neconomic dividends that last for generations. The same is true for\neducation - residents of states that have a large share of highly\neducated graduates can produce significantly higher incomes.\nHere in Ohio, we are lagging the national average in terms of our\nlevel of educational attainment, and our advantage in patent\ncreation is not as large as it used to be. The hard truth is that having\na strong traditional manufacturing base no longer guarantees the\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20061117.cfm[4/29/2014 2:07:17 PM]\n\n\fUniversities, Innovation, and Economic Growth :: November 17, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nprosperity it once did. I don't mean to say that we should leave\nmanufacturing behind - it still provides a lot of value. However, a\nstate can improve its relative economic position by focusing on\ncompanies - including manufacturing companies -- that invest in new\nand innovative technologies.\nThe second way to make major gains is by investing in education. It is\ninteresting to note that Kentucky has made a lot of inroads in\neducation over the past generation. The state still has a low overall\nrate of educational attainment, but the numbers are moving higher.\nWith those gains, Kentuckians have also seen an improvement in their\nper capita incomes. Our keynote speaker today, Dr. Lee Todd, will\ntell us a bit about this story from his perspective as the president of\nthe University of Kentucky.\nOverall, our research shows that states with the highest share of\ncollege-educated adults - states like Massachusetts, Connecticut and\nColorado - have higher income levels. So it is in our best interest, no\nmatter where we live, to build up our \"stocks of knowledge\" through\ninnovation and education.\nHistory also gives us some interesting perspectives on what drives\nincome growth. It may be hard to imagine, but for nearly all of\nrecorded history there was virtually no per capita income growth.\nZero. Before the 19th century, the rate of population growth pretty\nmuch offset any gains from technology.\nThen came the Industrial Revolution, which ushered in a period of\nunprecedented innovation, invention, and income growth. Since\n1890, per capita income has risen by 10 times in the United States\nalone - from $5,000 to $50,000, measured in year 2000 dollars. Many\nexperts believe that the accumulation of knowledge and skills - or\nhuman capital - made the big difference in the success of the\nIndustrial Revolution.\nThe more skilled the population, the faster is the rate of innovation.\nSkilled labor then becomes more valuable and commands higher\nearnings. Higher earnings, in turn, create incentives for people to\nacquire more skills, or more human capital. Economists refer to this\nprocess as endogenous growth. It simply means that more innovation\nleads to higher skill accumulation, which leads to more innovation,\nand so on.\nUniversities truly stand at the crossroads of education and innovation.\nThey contribute to the process by educating their students - who are\nthen better prepared to innovate and work with new technologies\nand business practices -- and by conducting basic research.\nHowever, universities can play additional roles - seeking patents and\nthen selling or licensing the technology, incubating new businesses,\nsetting up faculty members in operating companies, helping to take\ncompanies public, and so on. Universities can even cooperate with\nlocal governments and private companies in their neighborhoods to\ncoordinate office space, transportation, housing, and retail space.\nIn yesterday's paper about technology transfer, Gerald Marschke and\nhis co-authors studied the diffusion of technology by looking at U.S.\npatent data. Essentially, they found that from the mid-1980s to the\nlate 1990s, industry increasingly turned to inventors who had\nuniversity research experience. The authors interpret this trend as\nevidence of growth in the influence of university research on\nindustrial innovation.\nSo we know that universities support economic growth by educating\nstudents, conducting basic and applied research, and fostering the\nformation of new business ventures. Do universities need to build a\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20061117.cfm[4/29/2014 2:07:17 PM]\n\n\fUniversities, Innovation, and Economic Growth :: November 17, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\ncritical mass of activity in each of these activities in order to be\nsuccessful? And if they do, how big is big enough? Some of the\nexperts you will hear from today will share their ideas on how to get\nthere from where we stand now.\nWe should also ask ourselves what role public policy should play in\npromoting innovation and education. At a basic level, public support\nof universities makes a great deal of sense, since there is so much\npotential for society as a whole to benefit.\nThis support for universities can be directed in various ways. The\nwish list is long. Parents of university students want lower tuition,\nmore course offerings, and more connections between students and\nfaculty members. Faculty members want more time for basic research\nand may not be interested in commercial applications. Business\nleaders want greater access to university faculty and facilities for\ncommercial purposes. Local economic development agencies want to\nleverage the university presence for neighborhood development.\nClearly, universities cannot be all things to all people. Making the\nappropriate choices can be difficult for universities, because\ngovernments and communities have limited funds to support those\nchoices. The more we know about how universities can affect growth,\nthe better the choices we are likely to make.\nFor example, should government incentives encourage universities to\nincubate businesses that could become larger companies, or should\ngovernment incentives be focused more on basic research? Would\nsociety be better served if universities owned and managed their\npatents, or if universities sold their patents to others? After all,\nprivate companies conduct research, develop new products, and\ncreate new businesses. In what areas should universities compete\nwith the private business sector and in what areas should they\ncooperate? Until we have more concrete answers to these questions,\npublic policymakers should be mindful that their actions could\nimpede the process of innovation and human capital development.\nBesides the factors that lead to greater innovation, we would also\nlike to know how knowledge and technology spread throughout\nsociety at large. Suppose that innovation increases in settings with\nmore face-to-face contact, meaning that we should expect more\ninnovation in locations with large research centers. If so, perhaps\ngovernment should favor a smaller number of large research-intensive\nuniversities. In this case, what happens to people who do not live in\nthese locations? Are there ways to enhance the ability of these\npopulations to learn through publications and the Internet? Answers\nto many of the questions I have posed this morning can help promote\nboth regional growth and growth for the entire economy.\nToday, we plan to build on yesterday's session by hearing from a\ndistinguished group of people who make business or public policy\ndecisions every day that require an understanding of the relationships\nbetween universities, innovation, and economic development.\nThese experts cover the waterfront, from managing networks of\nfederal research labs, to running a large, flagship state university, to\ncoordinating tech transfer and economic development at two\nneighboring universities. Other experts lead new business\ndevelopment inside a Fortune 100 company and direct science and\ntechnology policy in one of our fastest-growing states. We will also\nhear from a panel of venture capitalists.\nBy the end of the day, I expect that we will begin to see a\ncomprehensive and realistic picture of what it takes to transform\nideas into bankable companies that contribute to regional prosperity.\nWe hope this information will be beneficial in helping our region\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20061117.cfm[4/29/2014 2:07:17 PM]\n\n\fUniversities, Innovation, and Economic Growth :: November 17, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\n\naddress its challenges.\n\nCareers | Diversity | Privacy | Terms of Use | Contact Us | Feedback | RSS Feeds\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20061117.cfm[4/29/2014 2:07:17 PM]\n\n\f"

I will begin with some perspectives on\nthe goals and direction of monetary policy. Then I will describe how\nwe as a nation are transitioning to a slower pace of economic\ngrowth. Finally, I will talk about some of the risks that I see to our\neconomic outlook.\n\nPresident and CEO,\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nKeynote Address: Pittsburgh Business\nTimes 2006 CFO of the Year Awards\nPittsburgh, PA\nNovember 6, 2006\n\nThe Goals and Direction of Monetary Policy\nLet me begin, then, with some background on monetary\npolicymaking. We routinely hear and read in the financial media\nabout decisions that the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC,\nmakes, but I find that few people know very much about the FOMC\nand how it operates. This Committee is the policymaking body of the\nFederal Reserve - the group that sets the direction for short-term\ninterest rates. The FOMC consists of the seven members of the Board\nof Governors, plus the 12 Reserve Bank presidents. We meet eight\ntimes a year in Washington.\nThe FOMC's objectives are to maintain price stability - meaning a low\nand stable rate of inflation over the long term - and to promote\nmaximum sustainable economic growth.\nWe use the federal funds rate - that is, the interest rate at which\nbanks lend money to other banks overnight - as our main policy\ntool. By adjusting the target for this rate, we are trying to make\nsure that the financial system accommodates the economy's needs for\nmoney and credit. It is a delicate balance. Adding too much money\nand credit might cause the demand for goods to increase faster than\ntheir supply, which will eventually generate inflation. Adding too\nlittle money and credit can slow demand relative to supply and\nultimately depress prices.\nIn judging where to set the target for the federal funds rate, we\nevaluate many aspects of the economic environment. Of course,\ncurrent conditions in the economy play an important role. But\nbeyond how the economy is performing now, we must also look\nforward, because where we set the funds rate today affects the\nperformance of the economy and inflation in the future.\nIn fact, setting the federal funds rate target is a little like throwing a\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20061106.cfm[4/29/2014 2:07:33 PM]\n\n\fMonetary Policy and the Economic Outlook :: November 6, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nforward pass in a football game. Any good quarterback knows that\nyou cannot just throw the ball to where the receiver is when you see\nhim. You have to throw the ball to where you think he will be by\nthe time the ball gets downfield. So it is with setting the federal\nfunds rate. It is not just where the economy is positioned today that\nmatters, but also where we think it is headed. That's a little free\nadvice for Ben Roethlisberger.\nEnough about football - I am more knowledgeable about monetary\npolicy. Let's consider the FOMC's recent policy moves for a moment.\nIn June of 2004, the FOMC raised the federal funds rate for the first\ntime in almost four years. At that time, we did not know by how\nmuch we would need to raise the funds rate - that would depend on\nhow the economy evolved. But we knew it had to go considerably\nhigher to avoid the risk of inflation taking hold. So, in a series of 17\nquarter-point adjustments over a two-year period, the FOMC has\nbrought the federal funds rate from a low of 1 percent to 5-1/4\npercent, where it stands today.\nAt our last three meetings, we decided to leave the federal funds\nrate target unchanged. Holding the rate steady is giving us time to\nassess the full impact of our 17 rate increases and to see how\neconomic conditions unfold over the near term.\n\nTransitioning to a Slower Pace of Economic\nGrowth\nSo how do I see economic conditions unfolding? In a\nnutshell, I see the economy growing at a slower pace than it did over\nthe past few years, but as I will explain, I don't think we should be\noverly concerned about this somewhat slower pace of growth.\nWhen I think about changes in economic activity, I tend to\nseparate them into two categories: those that reflect short-term\nchanges in supply or demand, and those that reflect longer-term\nsupply or demand factors. The economy's performance at any\nparticular time reflects a combination of these short-term and\nlonger-term developments.\nIdentifying the longer-term factors - and assessing how they\nmay be changing - can give us a baseline for estimating longer-term\neconomic growth. Two of the most important forces in our economy\nthat affect longer-term growth are the number of people working\nand how productive they are. In simple terms, these two factors\nalone determine how much an economy can produce. When the\nworkforce grows, so too does our economic output. Likewise, when\nwe are more productive, we can generate more goods and services.\nTake the second half of the 1990s. Innovations in information\ntechnology generated gains in productivity that were a full\npercentage point greater than they had been over the previous two\ndecades. At the same time, labor force participation - the share of\nthe working-age population who choose to be in the labor force - was\nat an all-time high. The result was the \"roaring '90s,\" when the\neconomy grew much faster than its average rate during the post­\nWorld War II period.\nAlthough we can expect productivity growth to remain strong\nthroughout this decade, growth in our workforce has started to slow\na bit. Our population is aging, and the baby boom generation is\nincreasingly heading into retirement. I know that this development is\na concern here in Allegheny County, whose population has the\nsecond-highest average age of any large county nationwide.\nThe point is that we cannot take the economic boom that we saw at\nthe end of the 1990s as an appropriate guide for what to expect in\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20061106.cfm[4/29/2014 2:07:33 PM]\n\n\fMonetary Policy and the Economic Outlook :: November 6, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nthe years to come. As our population ages, we should expect a\nsomewhat slower baseline rate of economic growth going forward. If\nthe labor force grows more slowly, output should grow more slowly as\nwell. This would not mean that the economy is performing poorly,\nbut that there are structural limitations to how rapidly it can expand.\nSo what about the short-term fluctuations in economic activity I\nmentioned? How should we think about these in the context of the\neconomic outlook? These are changes in economic activity that\ntemporarily push the economy off its baseline growth path. They can\nappear in the form of booms or busts.\nThe housing sector is a perfect example. The United States enjoyed a\nhousing boom over the past few years, with more than 7 million new\nhomes built since 2000. This resulted in the highest homeownership\nrates in history. During the past year, however, home building has\nfallen off sharply, with a particularly steep decline in the third\nquarter. The supply of unsold homes on the market has risen to\nlevels we have not seen in more than 10 years.\nThe housing boom lifted economic growth above its baseline in the\nearly part of the decade, but the housing slump we are experiencing\nnow is pushing economic growth below that baseline over the near\nterm. For this reason, and as a result of the longer-term factors I\noutlined earlier, I expect the economy to grow at a more moderate\npace over the next few years than we saw in the past couple of\nyears.\n\nTwo Risks to the Outlook: Housing and\nInflation\nStill, there are risks to this scenario. The first risk is that the\nweakness in housing will spill over to other sectors of the economy.\nThe second risk is that inflation will remain too high.\n\nHousing\nLet me speak to the housing risk first. Most of the data suggest that\ninvestment in new housing will remain weak at least through 2007.\nSurveys tend to confirm this outlook. Both consumers and builders\nreport much less confidence in the housing markets than they did a\nyear ago.\nNevertheless, we need to remember that the current decline in home\nbuilding follows a dramatic increase in recent years. In other words,\nthe downturn is coming off a very high base. Still, I recognize the\npossibility that this situation could get worse before it gets better. If\nfurther declines in the housing sector are abrupt, and if home prices\nfall sharply, we could see spillover effects in other parts of the\neconomy. One obvious area that could be affected is consumer\nspending.\nWhy could consumer spending be affected? During the late 1990s and\nearly 2000s, homeowners often tapped into the appreciating value of\ntheir houses by refinancing and taking out home equity lines of\ncredit. Some homeowners also may have felt wealthier, saving less\nand spending more than usual. If home prices continue to fall, as\nthey have begun to do recently, we may see this reflected in weaker\nconsumer spending. This concern might be a little less pronounced\nfor those of us in western Pennsylvania and Ohio, where, in general,\nour home values have appreciated by only about half as much as the\nnational average.\nFortunately, despite the housing risks I have described, other sectors\nof the economy still look pretty good. For the most part, consumers\nare still buying things. Businesses are still investing in new plants and\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20061106.cfm[4/29/2014 2:07:33 PM]\n\n\fMonetary Policy and the Economic Outlook :: November 6, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\noffice buildings. And foreign economic activity also remains strong,\nwhich provides an additional source of demand for our goods and\nservices. Certainly the tone in labor markets has been very positive\nlately. Continued hiring suggests a high level of business confidence\nabout economic growth next year.\nThink of it this way. We seem to have two economies at\nwork - the housing economy, which is experiencing a very large\nadjustment, and the \"everything else\" economy, which is performing\nfairly well.\n\nInflation\nThe second risk to the economic outlook is the notable\nincrease in inflation we have seen over the past few years.\nUnlike the housing contraction, the current elevated inflation rate\ndoes not pose an immediate threat to economic growth. However, if\nthe inflation rate fails to move lower, people might believe that\ninflation has permanently shifted higher, and then adjust their\nbehavior accordingly. If that happened, the whole inflation\nenvironment could change for the worse - distorting investment,\nreducing productivity growth, and affecting economic growth in the\nlong-run.\nHow did inflation become a risk? How did inflation move from about\n1 percent in 2003 to roughly 3 percent this year? In large part, the\nanswer can be traced to the rapid increase in energy prices we have\nexperienced. Oil prices are more than three times what they were in\nearly 2002, rising from roughly $20 a barrel then to nearly $70 a\nbarrel in recent months.\nOil prices have recently moderated somewhat, bringing down the\n\"headline\" rate of inflation - what is commonly referred to as the\nConsumer Price Index. However, core consumer price inflation which excludes energy and food items - remains at a higher level\nthan I would like. The reason for this is that the production of almost\neverything we use requires energy. The continuing price increases\noutside the energy sector are partly a reflection of prior increases in\nenergy and commodity prices being passed through to the prices of\nother goods and services. We still don't know how these increases\nwill work their way through the system.\nBut there is some good news. Consumer and business expectations\nabout inflation have remained fairly stable, despite the run-up in\ninflation over the past couple of years. We have many measures of\ninflation expectations to look at, but they all generally suggest that\nlong-term inflation expectations are holding steady. This suggests\nthat financial markets believe that the Federal Reserve's monetary\npolicy will bring the trend in inflation back down.\n\nConclusion\nTo sum things up, I expect the economy to weather the recent\nchallenges in the housing market. Of course, we are not entirely out\nof the woods with respect to the housing risk, but I do not expect\nconditions in the housing market to spill over into the broader\neconomy in a meaningful way. I fully expect the economy to\ncontinue to grow at a moderate, but sustainable, pace.\nThe inflation outlook is a slightly different story. I do not\nbelieve that inflation will accelerate further. In fact, I expect some\nslowing in the rate of inflation as recent energy price changes and\nthe effects of monetary policy actions work through the economy.\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20061106.cfm[4/29/2014 2:07:33 PM]\n\n\fMonetary Policy and the Economic Outlook :: November 6, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nBut some risk remains that inflation will not recede into a range\nconsistent with the FOMC's price stability objective. In that event, it\nis possible that some additional monetary policy restraint would be\nrequired.\nI hope that my remarks here tonight have helped to shed some light\non the monetary policy issues you have been reading and hearing\nabout.

A Brief Overview of the Federal Reserve\nSystem\nLet me begin, then, with a little \"Fed 101.\" As you know, the Federal\nReserve is our nation's central bank. It plays a unique role in our\neconomy, and it has a unique structure that draws from both the\npublic and private sectors.\n\nThe Federal Reserve was created by an act of Congress in 1913 and\ncharged with creating a safe, stable, and more flexible monetary and\nfinancial system. These responsibilities are carried out by 12 regional\nReserve banks and the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C.\n\nOne of the Federal Reserve's great strengths is this decentralized\nstructure. The public aspect of the System is represented by the\nseven governors on the Federal Reserve Board, who are appointed by\nthe President of the United States to 14-year terms.\n\nThe private aspect of the System is represented by the 12 regional\nReserve Banks. Each of these Banks has its own charter and is\ngoverned by an independent board of directors, under the general\noversight of the Board of Governors.\n\nI lead the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. My district-the Fourth\nDistrict-includes all of Ohio, western Pennsylvania, eastern Kentucky,\nand the northern panhandle of West Virginia. Cleveland is our\nheadquarters, and we also have branch offices in Pittsburgh and\nCincinnati.\nLike the other 11 Reserve Banks, the Federal Reserve Bank of\nCleveland cooperates with the Board of Governors in supervising\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20061005.cfm[4/29/2014 2:07:55 PM]\n\n\fAn overview of the Federal Reserve System :: October 5, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nbanks in our respective regions. We also conduct research on\nnational and regional economic conditions; we provide financial\nservices to banks and the U.S. Treasury; and we are a resource for\npeople and organizations that are involved in community economic\ndevelopment.\n\nEach Reserve Bank works to understand the unique\ncharacteristics of its District. By better understanding the forces that\nshape our regional economies, we can better develop sound monetary\npolicy for the nation.\nThe Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, is the group\nthat is responsible for setting monetary policy. As president of the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, I serve on this Committee, along\nwith the eleven other Reserve Bank presidents and the seven\nmembers of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.\n\nThe FOMC has a dual mandate from Congress: first, to maintain price\nstability over the long term-that is, to keep inflation under controland second, to promote maximum sustainable economic growth. We\nseek to achieve these objectives by influencing interest rates and the\nmoney supply.\n\nThe main monetary policy tool we use is targeting the federal funds\nrate-that is, the interest rate that banks charge each other for\novernight loans. Changes in this rate, in turn, affect a host of other\nshort-term interest rates and economic variables.\n\nII. My Role as a Federal Reserve Policymaker\nNow I would like to give you more of an insider's perspective on my\nrole as a Federal Reserve policymaker. It is a fascinating process,\nand one that I find challenging and energizing.\n\nThe FOMC meets in Washington, D.C., generally eight times a year.\nMost of our meetings last for a single day, although the Committee\nhas been scheduling some two-day meetings to discuss special\ntopics.\n\nI happen to be a voting member on the FOMC this year. I rotate that\nresponsibility with the president of the Chicago Reserve Bank every\nother year. But whether or not I vote during a particular year, I\nparticipate fully in the policy discussions at every meeting.\nAs you can imagine, I put a lot of work into my role as a\nFederal Reserve policymaker. I constantly review the latest national\nand international economic statistics. Economists throughout the\nFederal Reserve System pore over the data, conduct research, and\ncreate models to project economic activity. A big part of my\npreparation for the FOMC meetings essentially involves sifting through\nthe different explanations that might lie behind the national\nstatistics.\n\nVery often, the official data that are available are just not current\nenough for a forward-looking enterprise like monetary policy. So to\nprepare for FOMC meetings, I must rely not only on my team of\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20061005.cfm[4/29/2014 2:07:55 PM]\n\n\fAn overview of the Federal Reserve System :: October 5, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\neconomists-as talented as they are-but also on people in the\ncommunity. Input from businesspeople and consumers provides me\nwith reliable information on the economy far ahead of when the\nofficial statistics are released.\n\nYou might think of the statistical data that we gather on the\neconomy as being like the readout on your car's dashboard: All of the\ninformation is meant to tell you what is happening to your car, but it\ntypically does not tell you why it is happening. When the oil light on\nyour car's dashboard comes on, you know that the oil level is\nprobably low, but you don't know why. Maybe there's a leak, or\nmaybe your mechanic left the cap off the reservoir. To find out, you\nhave to look under the hood.\n\nMeeting with people is my way of looking under the economy's hood.\nThe conversations enable me to understand the why behind the\nwhat. They help me judge which of the various explanations being\noffered for the condition of the national economy is most reasonable.\n\nI take these stories and lessons I learn from them to Washington.\nThey allow me to attach reality-not to mention human faces and\nvoices-to what would otherwise be seemingly sterile statistics. This\ninformation plays a key role in shaping our national policy decisions.\n\nA typical FOMC meeting begins with the Board of Governors' staff\npresenting their projections for the domestic and international\neconomy. Each participant at the table can ask the staff questions\nabout the projections. Then we have what is known as a \"go-round,\"\nwhere each FOMC participant provides comments on the economy\nand the economic outlook. As part of their commentary, the 12\nFederal Reserve Bank presidents present their views on economic\ndevelopments in their respective regions.\n\nAfter the discussion about the current economic situation and\noutlook, the Committee members turn their attention to policy. To\nframe that conversation, the Board of Governors' staff suggests a few\npolicy alternatives, and then the Committee members offer their\nview. We vote on our decision, which is formally called a \"policy\ndirective,\" and then discuss how best to explain it to the public. We\nrelease our decision to the public at about 2:15 in the afternoon.\n\nA more complete summary of the meeting is provided in the meeting\nminutes, which are released three weeks following each meeting.\nFull meeting transcripts are made available after five years.\n\nAfter hearing my short description, it may sound as if the FOMC\nmeetings are very rigid and formal affairs, but I want to emphasize\nthat there is always a great deal of interaction and collegiality\naround the table. I think of the meetings not so much as discreet\nevents, but rather as part of an ongoing dialogue and debate. Over\nthe course of time, we have some complex and fascinating\ndiscussions that help to inform all of our thinking.\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20061005.cfm[4/29/2014 2:07:55 PM]\n\n\fAn overview of the Federal Reserve System :: October 5, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\n\nAlthough the process itself is fairly straightforward, the judgments\nassociated with monetary policy are not always as obvious as they\nmight appear. Economic conditions can be unpredictable, and we are\nunder no illusion that we are perfect forecasters. To paraphrase\nformer Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, we are essentially\nrisk managers. We need to make policy choices that stand the best\nchance of moving us toward our objectives, given our imperfect\nunderstanding of the changing environment around us.\n\nI mentioned earlier that the FOMC's objectives are price stability and\nmaximum sustainable economic growth. As a practical measure, we\nlook at the growth rate of a number of \"core\" inflation measures to\nassess price stability in the short- to medium run. As you may know,\ncore measures of inflation strip out some of the more volatile\ncomponents of the price indexes, such as food and energy.\n\nFor maximum sustainable economic growth, we try to support the\nexpansion of gross domestic product, or GDP, near its \"potential.\"\nThe tricky part is that the economy's potential growth rate can\nchange over time. Some changes are temporary ones-such as when\nwe have energy price shocks. But some changes are more\npermanent-for instance, when new technological advances lead to\nmajor upward shifts in productivity, or when changes in the trend of\nlabor force participation affect the labor supply. These changes\nmake it difficult to measure potential GDP reliably.\n\nAlthough we have more than one objective, I believe that in the long\nrun, maintaining price stability is the unique contribution that the\nFederal Reserve can make to promoting maximum sustainable\neconomic growth. In many, if not most, cases this is true in the short\nrun as well. The bottom line is that you cannot achieve long-run\ngrowth without price stability.\n\nThose are the basics of the Federal Reserve and monetary policy. I\nwant to emphasize that although monetary policy is national in\nscope-meaning that the FOMC makes decisions based on what is best\nfor the country as a whole-we are well aware that different regions\nof the country face their own special circumstances and challenges.\n\nAs we saw last year, some regions, like the Gulf Coast, can face\nsudden and catastrophic changes, while others, like our region, are\nin the process of responding to longer-term structural changes.\n\nIII. Economic Transition in Northeast Ohio\nI would now like to take a few minutes to discuss the economic\nchallenges that we are currently facing in Northeast Ohio. More than\nfour million people live in the 15 counties that make up Northeast\nOhio. After a century of relying on the heaviest types of traditional\nindustry-coal, steel, autos, rubber, and electrical equipment-we have\nbeen deeply affected by global trends, including rapidly changing\ntechnology and increased international trade.\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20061005.cfm[4/29/2014 2:07:55 PM]\n\n\fAn overview of the Federal Reserve System :: October 5, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\n\nDeep currents of change have swept over our industrial landscape.\nEconomists call this process \"creative destruction.\" Creative\ndestruction is a natural, and indeed a necessary, part of our\neconomic development. As familiar industries of the past are\nreplaced by the innovative technologies that will shape our future,\nresources are redirected to wherever they are most productive.\nCapital and creative energy will flow toward the new goods, services,\nand processes that will deliver the greatest value, and jobs will\neventually follow.\n\nOf course, creative destruction can be an uncomfortable process, but\nin reality it is the absence of this ebb and flow that should concern\nus. There is some evidence to suggest that a weak level of creative\ndestruction can help explain why employment and economic growth\nhave been less robust in our region than in other parts of the\ncountry. Here in Ohio, we have had a lower rate of job creation than\nthe nation over the past few decades, as you might guess. But you\nmight also be surprised to hear that we have also had a lower rate of\njob destruction.\n\nDuring the past few years, Ohio's rate of job destruction has been\nmoving up, closer to the national average. This may be a promising\nsign that Ohio's labor market is moving toward a more dynamic state.\nHowever, we still need to see rates of job creation move higher\nbefore our state's economy becomes dynamic enough to sustain\nhealthy growth.\nWhat can be done to encourage a more dynamic economy?\nOne critical thing we need to do is to improve the levels of\neducational achievement in Ohio. A growing body of research\nsuggests that education is a key component of an area's economic\ngrowth prospects. This is not hard to understand, especially in a\nglobal economy which seems to put an increasing premium on highly\nskilled workers.\n\nWhat is perhaps surprising, however, is that this is not a recent\nphenomenon or an outgrowth of the computer age. As a matter of\nfact, in a recent research project, economists at the Federal Reserve\nBank of Cleveland considered a number of factors that might explain\ndifferences in the relative income levels among the states in our\ncountry. They found that the best predictor of a state's relative\nincome position is its so-called \"stock of productive knowledge,\" as\nmeasured by levels of educational attainment and patents, and that\nthis has been the best predictor since the 1940s.\n\nBack then, differences in high-school graduation rates were a key\ndriver of differences in income levels across the states, and Ohio\nranked 19th in the country in high school completion. We also\ntended to produce significantly more patents per person than the\nnational average-about one and a half times more. Since the 1960s,\nhowever, Ohio's patents per person have declined to about the\nnational average.\n\nOhio also does not fare very well in the measure of educational\nattainment that matters most today-college graduation rates. In this\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20061005.cfm[4/29/2014 2:07:55 PM]\n\n\fAn overview of the Federal Reserve System :: October 5, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\ncategory, Ohio ranks 39th out of the 50 states in the share of its\nresidents who have earned baccalaureate degrees. Not surprisingly,\njust as Ohio's patent production and educational attainment have\nfailed to keep pace with most of the country, Ohio's per capita\nincome-which was once above the national average-has also not kept\npace with the national average for more than two decades now.\n\nIt is very interesting to know that some of the challenges we are\nfacing in Ohio are very similar to those facing policymakers in Italy.\nEven today, in 2006, only about 11 percent of Italians hold college\ndegrees. Italian officials I have met with said that they were envious\nof the education attainment in our country, where about 28 percent\nof the adult population has a college degree.\n\nAll of us want to build a sound foundation for future economic\nprosperity. I believe that one of the most promising ways to do that\nis to create a civic culture that supports education. I am proud to be\na part of a statewide group -- the Ohio Business Alliance for Higher\nEducation and the Economy - that is working to increase the strategic\nrole of our colleges and universities in contributing to Ohio's\neconomic growth.\n\nAs we look ahead, our prospects for building a stronger regional\neconomy will depend on our commitment to invest in intellectual\ncapital. The knowledge base of our students and the technological\nskills of our workers will be critical for our future prosperity. I am\nconvinced that the investments we make in education today-if other\nconditions are right-will serve as a springboard for economic growth\ntomorrow.\n\nI am confident that our region has a solid foundation for future\ngrowth for several reasons:\nWe have a wealth of established companies and a promising array of\nemerging technology firms.\nWe have a large concentration of financial expertise and legal talent.\nWe have fine public and private universities, such as John Carroll,\nand an outstanding health-care sector.\nWe have outstanding natural and cultural resources.\nMost important, we have talented, committed people who enjoy\nliving and working here.\n\nConclusion\nI hope that I have offered you a bit more insight on the Federal\nReserve System, the Federal Open Market Committee and the\nNortheast Ohio economy.\n\nCareers | Diversity | Privacy | Terms of Use | Contact Us | Feedback | RSS Feeds\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20061005.cfm[4/29/2014 2:07:55 PM]\n\n\f"

Economists throughout\nthe Federal Reserve System pore over the data, conduct research,\nand create models to project economic activity. But I also rely on\nconversations I have with business leaders to get a better sense of\nhow you see economic conditions and the prospects for business going\nforward.\n\nCopper Development Association,\nGlobal Market Trends Conference\nWyndham Drake Hote, Oak Brook,\nIllinois\nSeptember 8, 2006\n\nFor example, last month, right before the Federal Open Market\nCommittee meeting, one of the CEOs of a very large manufacturing\nfirm in my District called to tell me about a manufacturing trade\nassociation meeting he had just attended. He said that rising copper\nprices dominated the discussions at that meeting. He told me that\nfrom the perspective of those in attendance, the rise in copper prices\nwas not totally demand driven - other factors were driving up copper\nprices.\nUnderstanding why the prices of commodities, like copper, increase\nor decrease is one of the many pieces of the puzzle that we as\npolicymakers try to fit together to help us figure out how the\neconomy and inflation will perform in the future.\nAs I am sure you are well aware, the Federal Open Market\nCommittee, or FOMC, decided to keep the federal funds rate target\nunchanged at our last meeting on August 8. Although I cannot speak\nfor any of my colleagues on the Committee, let me explain what was\nbehind my decision to support a pause at that meeting.\nAlthough the elevated inflation numbers concerned me, and indeed\nthey still do, the overall pace of economic activity - especially\nhousing activity - had begun to moderate, and the full effect of the\nFOMC's previous rate increases had not yet been felt. I viewed the\npause as appropriate to give me the chance to accumulate more\ninformation before judging whether additional policy firming would\nbe needed.\nAnother important element in my thinking was the stability of\ninflation expectations. I will quote directly from the minutes of the\nAugust 8 meeting here: \"Following 17 consecutive policy firming\nactions, members generally saw limited risk in deferring further\npolicy tightening that might prove necessary, as long as inflation\nexpectations remained contained.\"\nI put special emphasis on inflation expectations because that is the\ntopic I would like to discuss with you this morning. In particular, I\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20060908.cfm[4/29/2014 2:08:08 PM]\n\n\fInflation, Inflation Expectations, and Monetary Policy :: September 8, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nwant to explain why it is vitally important that the central bank - the\nFederal Reserve - anchor inflation expectations in order to best\npromote sustainable economic growth.\nI will begin by explaining how inflation - which Congress has\nmandated the Federal Reserve to control - is conceptually different\nfrom relative price increases. Then I will talk about why keeping\ninflation expectations anchored is so important to our nation's\nprosperity. Finally, I will describe some of the measures I use to\ngauge inflation expectations and why it is important to continue to\nlearn more about inflation expectations.\n\nI. What Is Inflation and How Is It Different\nfrom a Relative Price Increase?\nLet me begin by making a crucial distinction - between inflation and\na relative price increase.1 People often see price increases in some\nof the items they buy and assume that a period of inflation has\nbegun. However, inflation is a condition that affects all prices, not\njust the price of particular goods or services.\nConsider copper prices. As of yesterday, copper prices were roughly\nseven times higher than they were in 1965. Now, I might conclude\nthat the resource costs of obtaining copper are now seven times\nhigher than they were forty-some years ago. But we all know that's\nnot true.\nThe truth is that, despite large swings up and down, the relative\nprice of copper - that is, its price relative to the average of all prices\n- tended to fall for much of the period from the mid-1970s through\n2001.2 Over the past several years, the relative price of copper has\nshot up, of course, but even with this sharp increase, the relative\nprice is nowhere near seven times its 1965 level.\nCopper prices have not risen that much more than all prices, on\naverage. The fact is that all prices, on average, have risen five-fold\nin the past forty years. This five-fold increase in all prices is inflation.\nChanges in relative prices--that is, the prices of individual items\nrelative to the average of all prices--are quite different from\ninflation. Changes in relative prices reflect changes in the supply and\ndemand conditions in specific markets. Sometimes we experience\nsuch a large and persistent relative price change that it temporarily\nripples through the inflation data. The obvious example is energy\nprices.\nToday, energy prices are greatly increasing the costs faced by\nvirtually every business and household in our country. Purchasing the\nsame amount of gasoline or heating oil as we did a couple of years\nago requires us either to earn more, save less, or purchase fewer\nnon-energy items. Adjusting to higher energy prices requires us to\nmake real sacrifices. The Federal Reserve cannot offset these costs\nbecause we do not create oil.3\nNevertheless, the Federal Reserve can still control inflation over the\nmedium to longer term. How can we control the average price level\nover time? To paraphrase a famous economist, Irving Fisher, the\naverage price level doesn't rise because of the goods; it rises because\nof the money.4 Simply put, if growth in money exceeds its demand,\nits purchasing power will depreciate. This is inflation. It affects all\nprices and wages, and ultimately it has only one origin, the central\nbank. This is because the central bank is solely responsible for\n5\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20060908.cfm[4/29/2014 2:08:08 PM]\n\n\fInflation, Inflation Expectations, and Monetary Policy :: September 8, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nmanaging the nation's money supply.\nI think most people recognize the importance of allowing individual\nprices to move up and down relative to one another. At the same\ntime, I think that most people would agree that allowing the value of\nour money to depreciate over time is bad for economic prosperity.\nBut just what is it about inflation that is so costly? How is it that\ninflation uses up precious resources?6 Well, it turns out that the\nlasting harm to our economy comes when a sustained period of\ninflation changes inflation expectations. This, in turn, affects the\ndecisions that households and businesses make. Let me turn to that\ntopic in more detail.\n\nII. Why Anchoring Inflation Expectations Is\nImportant to Prosperity\nBack in 1968, Milton Friedman warned economists and policymakers\nnot to try to stimulate economic growth at the cost of \"just a little\nmore\" inflation.7 He predicted that people would come to anticipate\nthat little bit of extra inflation, and then would change their\nbehavior in various ways. The end result would be slower economic\ngrowth and ever-higher inflation. In effect, Friedman was warning\npolicymakers not to treat inflation as a static concept, but to\nappreciate the interdependence between inflation and inflation\nexpectations.\nUnfortunately, the economic events of the 1970s bear out Friedman's\nwarning. Households and businesses did adjust their behavior to\nminimize the costs they faced from rising inflation. And once\ninflation expectations became unglued, we watched with dismay as\nthe costs arising from inflation expectations took a huge toll on our\nresources. The economy spiraled into \"stagflation\" - an environment\nof worsening economic performance and higher inflation.\nLet's consider some of the ways that rising inflation expectations can\nhinder economic performance. For example, we know that people\nwho fear higher inflation often choose to put their wealth into real\nassets, such as land, or gold, or silver, or copper.8 They do this not\nso much as a traditional business investment, but as a hedge against\na rising price level. So as the expectation of inflation grows, these\nasset prices will likely reflect two things: the value of the asset in\nproduction and its value as an inflation hedge. This alters the flow of\nour scarce resources from their best use.\nOf course, this is just one example of the damage that an inflationary\npsychology inflicts on our economy. When people begin to anticipate\na decline in the purchasing power of their dollars, they will take\nmany actions to protect themselves. They will use their time and\nwealth to try to minimize the amount of money they hold because\nthat money is slowly losing its purchasing power. Inflation also raises\nthe effective tax rate that people pay on income they earn from\ninvesting and saving. This, in turn, induces people to forgo\ninvestments and discourages them from saving.\nInflation also makes it difficult for borrowers and lenders, who now\nmust evaluate the future purchasing power of money, not just the\nreal terms of a contract. The costs associated with making these\npredictions rise with inflation because higher levels of inflation are\ngenerally more volatile and more difficult to predict. As inflation\nbecomes more unpredictable, lenders demand insurance against this\nrisk in the form of higher interest rates. This makes long-term\ncontracts, particularly financial contracts, more costly than they\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20060908.cfm[4/29/2014 2:08:08 PM]\n\n\fInflation, Inflation Expectations, and Monetary Policy :: September 8, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nwould be if inflation weren't a concern.\nPeople can also make costly mistakes as they try to distinguish\nbetween changes in relative prices and inflation. If inflation is highly\nunpredictable, entrepreneurs may assume that all price changes are\nthe result of the inflationary policies of the central bank, and ignore\nsome important relative price signals telling them to adjust their\nbusiness plans.\nAll of the actions that people take to guard against inflation consume\nprecious resources that would be used more productively in a world\nwhere people didn't have to worry about inflation. These are the\ncosts that that a central bank must keep in check if our economy is\nto achieve its full potential.\n\nIII. The Measurement and Theory of Inflation\nExpectations\nWell, it's one thing to understand that you want to keep inflation\nexpectations in check, but it is an entirely different matter knowing\nwhen, in fact, they are in check. Let me explain some of the ways we\nattempt to measure inflation expectations.\nWe can look for changes in inflationary sentiment in a variety of\nindicators. Asset markets give us some indirect measures. For\nexample, we can track the price movements of any number of\ninvestment goods, such as metals and other commodities, or real\nestate, or any tangible asset that investors might see as a \"safe\nhaven\" from inflation.\nWe can also monitor the behavior of long-term interest rates relative\nto short-term rates, otherwise known as \"the yield curve.\" A\nsteepening of the yield curve - that is, a rise in long-term rates\nrelative to short-term rates - might signal that bond buyers are\ndemanding some protection against inflation.9\nA relatively new and very promising measurement comes from\nTreasury Inflation Indexed Securities, commonly known as TIPS.\nThese securities give the investor a fixed real return because their\nprincipal and interest payments are tied to the Consumer Price\nIndex. Because regular Treasury securities are not tied to the CPI, we\ncan compare the rate of return between TIPS and regular Treasury\nsecurities to infer how much inflation investors might expect to see\nover different time horizons - for example, over the next 5 to 10\nyears.\nThe problem with financial market indicators is that asset prices\nrespond to any number of risks, not just inflation.10 In a world that is\nalways confronting and evaluating risks, disentangling the inflation\nrisk from all the other risks is a very imperfect science. Nevertheless,\nfinancial market indicators are proving to be a useful yardstick for\nmonitoring inflation expectations.11\nYou might think that a better way to gauge inflation expectations\nwould be to simply ask people their views on inflation. In fact, there\nis a survey that does just that. Once a month, the University of\nMichigan interviews about 500 households around the nation, asking\npeople how much they think prices will rise in the next 12 months\nand over the next 5 to 10 years. Here, too, there are some problems\nwith interpreting the raw data.

And as\nwe learn more about how inflation expectations are formed, we can\ndo our job as monetary policymakers even better.\n\n[1] A discussion of these issues can be found in Bryan, Michael F., \"Is\nIt More Expensive, Or Does It Just Cost More Money?\" Economic\nCommentary, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, May 15, 2002.\n\n[2] Based on the CPI.\n[3] There may be indirect costs that the central bank can help ease.\nFor example, if oil prices rise and, as a result, labor productivity\nfalls, there will be downward pressure on wages. If wages are\ndownwardly \"sticky,\" unemployment may result and the creation of a\nrising price level might allow \"real\" wages to adjust and alleviate the\nunemployment. These are not the direct costs of higher oil prices,\nhowever.\n\n[4] \"[By inflation w]e mean the .movement which would have been\nbrought about if the 'changes on the side of money', . changes which\ntend to affect all prices equally, had been the only changes\noperating and there had been no forces present 'on the side of the\nthings' tending to change their prices relatively to one another.\"\nIrving Fisher, 1922.\n[5] Appreciating this distinction helps one better understand ideas\nlike \"core\" inflation, which are useful metrics for the central bank,\nand perhaps only the central bank, to monitor. These core inflation\nmeasures, most commonly constructed as an aggregate price statistic\nless food and energy prices, attempt to strip away the most volatile\nof the relative price movements that may temporarily cause the\naggregate price measure to fluctuate in a way that is not\nsymptomatic of a persistent change in the purchasing power of\nmoney.\n[6] A recent summary of these costs can be found in Anderson,\nRichard G., \"Inflation's Economic Cost: How Large? How Certain?\" The\nRegional Economist, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, July 2006.\n[7] Friedman, Milton, \"The Role of Monetary Policy,\" American\nEconomic Review, vol. 58, no. 1, March 1968, pp. 1-17.\n[8] It may also be that the process by which inflation is transmitted\nto all prices begins with basic commodities like copper. Indeed, there\nis some evidence that commodity prices tend to lead inflation at the\nretail level, although the statistical strength of this relationship is not\nespecially strong. For example, see Furlong, Fred, and Robert\nIngenito, \"Commodity Prices and Inflation,\" Economic Review, Federal\nReserve Bank of San Francisco, 1996 (no. 2).\n[9] Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke discusses the link\nbetween monetary policy and the yield curve in \"Reflections on the\nYield Curve and Monetary Policy,\" speech before the Economic Club\nof New York, March 20, 2006.\n[10] For a discussion of monetary policy and the behavior of asset\nprices, including the pitfalls of policy based on the behavior of asset\nprices, I recommend Kohn, Donald L., \"Monetary Policy and Asset\nPrices,\" Speech delivered at a European Central Bank Colloquium in\nhonor of Otmar Issing, March 16, 2006.\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20060908.cfm[4/29/2014 2:08:08 PM]\n\n\fInflation, Inflation Expectations, and Monetary Policy :: September 8, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\n[11] Research at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland suggests that\nthe risk premium in the TIPS market is likely to fluctuate and\ncomplicate an accurate interpretation of the inflationary sentiment\ncoming from financial markets. See Carlstrom, Charles T., and\nTimothy S. Fuerst, \"Expected Inflation and TIPS,\" Economic\nCommentary, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, November 2004.\n[12] See Bryan, Michael F. and Stefan Palmqvist, \"Testing Near­\nRationality Using Detailed Survey Data,\" Working Paper, Federal\nReserve Bank of Cleveland, 05-02.\n[13] See Bryan, Michael F. and Guhan Venkatu, \"The Demographics of\nInflation Opinion Surveys,\" Economic Commentary, Federal Reserve\nBank of Cleveland, October 15, 2001, and \"The Curiously Different\nInflation Perspectives of Men and Woman,\" Economic Commentary,\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, November 2001.\n[14] A large number of recent papers have described various ways the\nformation of inflation expectations may affect the conduct of the\ncentral bank. Two examples are: Ball, Laurence, N. Gregory Mankiw,\nand Ricardo Reis, \"Monetary Policy for Inattentive Economies,\"\nJournal of Monetary Economics 52, May 2005, and Orphanides,\nAthanasios, and John C.

While\ncommunity development is a topic that may be less visible in the\nfinancial press, it is one that is equally meaningful to all of us here.\nThe work that you do - whether in banking, community outreach,\npublic policymaking, teaching, or research - reflects a dedication to\nbettering the lives of others.\n\nPresident and CEO,\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nCom m unity Development Policy\nSummit\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nJune 22, 2006\n\nWe are here today and tomorrow to examine concentrated poverty that is, poverty that affects more than 40 percent of people living in\na particular region or city - through the lens of community\ndevelopment. I think we can all agree that community reinvestment\ninitiatives have done a great deal to help low- to moderate-income\nfamilies over the past generation. But we know that there is still a\nlong way to go.\n\nIt took a recent catastrophe - Hurricane Katrina - to refocus our\nnation's attention on poverty. The disaster in New Orleans last year\nreminded us that even in twenty-first-century America, some people\nstill have limited access to bank accounts, permanent homes, and\ntransportation. Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath have compelled\nthe public and our policymakers to recognize the enormity of poverty\nin America and to explore public policy solutions to this enduring\nproblem.\n\nIn approaching this policy summit, you may be wondering: What is\nthe Federal Reserve System's connection to concentrated poverty?\nWhy does the Cleveland Fed care about this issue?\n\nThe fact is that we are committed to the goals of community\ndevelopment. Our Community Affairs program helps us fulfill one of\nour important public policy mandates - to enforce fair-lending\nregulations that protect consumers in the financial marketplace. We\nalso believe that understanding the issues behind concentrated\npoverty will help us better assess overall economic performance.\n\nI will begin my remarks with an overview of the Federal Reserve's role\nin community development. Next, I will describe more broadly some\nof the progress made over the past few decades and some of the\ncontinuing challenges we all face in addressing poverty. Finally, I will\nshare my thoughts on why I think this type of policy summit can help\nlead to positive change.\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20060622.cfm[4/29/2014 2:08:31 PM]\n\n\fThe Challenge of Concentrated Poverty :: June 22, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\n\nPlease note that the views I express today are mine alone. I do not\npresume to speak for any of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve\nSystem.\n\nI. The Federal Reserve and Its Role in\nCommunity Development\nLet me begin with some background on the Federal Reserve System\nand how our work relates to the overall area of public policy that you\nare interested in: community development.\n\nYou are all probably familiar with the Federal Reserve's role in setting\nour nation's monetary policy. The 12 Reserve Banks also provide\nfinancial services to banks and the U.S. Treasury, cooperate with the\nBoard of Governors to supervise banks, and conduct economic\nresearch.\n\nOver the past few decades, the Federal Reserve has pursued a broad\nrange of research involving patterns of wealth and poverty. We want\nto better understand how concentrated poverty affects market\nefficiency and economic growth. We know that most people who are\ntrapped in poverty cannot participate fully in the labor market or the\nfinancial system. So there is good reason, just from a macroeconomic\nviewpoint, for the Federal Reserve to analyze these issues.\n\nBut our involvement actually reaches much further. As part of our\nresponsibilities to promote fair and equal access to credit and to\nprotect the rights of consumers, the Federal Reserve has become\ninvolved in community development, especially as the nation's fairlending laws have evolved over the past few decades.\n\nCongress gave the Federal Reserve a substantial role in the regulation\nof lending practices through the Truth in Lending Act of 1968. This\nlaw was designed to protect consumers in credit transactions by\nrequiring lenders to disclose the terms of credit and the costs\nassociated with borrowing money. As the civil rights movement\ngained momentum across the nation, Congress quickly moved beyond\ngeneral consumer protection laws into various antidiscrimination\nlending laws.\n\nBefore these laws were enacted, there was a growing concern that\naccess to credit was not being provided on a fair and equal basis. But\nnow an array of federal and state fair-lending laws have been\nenacted to safeguard consumers' rights in our financial system,\nincluding in home-mortgage lending. In fact, the Federal Reserve has\nrecently intensified its focus on data derived from the Home\nMortgage Disclosure Act of 1975.\n\nAnother important law is the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977,\nwhich we all know as CRA. The Federal Reserve has had a role not\nonly in writing and enforcing the regulations associated with this\nlegislation, but also in studying its effects over time. In fact, Glenn\nCanner and Robert Avery at the Board of Governors have reported\nthat since the law was enacted, banks have greatly increased their\npresence in low- to moderate-income communities and have\nintroduced products and services tailored to these markets - while\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20060622.cfm[4/29/2014 2:08:31 PM]\n\n\fThe Challenge of Concentrated Poverty :: June 22, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\n\nstill making a profit.\n\nOver the years, community reinvestment strategies have certainly\nbenefited people in these markets. By establishing banking\nrelationships, people gain a building block of economic success:\naccess to credit. Of course, access to credit - by itself - is certainly\nnot a solution to poverty. But the wise use of credit enables\nindividuals and families to accumulate wealth, make sound\ninvestments, and avoid costly financial mistakes.\n\nIn light of all of these initiatives, the Federal Reserve has taken a\nleadership role in supporting community development. Each of the 12\nFederal Reserve Banks has a strong Community Affairs office. This\nfunction has grown to encompass applied research, public programs,\noutreach, and public education in \"best practices\" for community\ndevelopment practitioners - all with the goal of improving conditions\nin low- to moderate-income communities. Our policy summit today is\npart of that education and outreach effort.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's Community Affairs offices are also working with\nthe Board of Governors on a multiyear project focusing on\nconcentrated poverty and its effect on community development. The\ngroup is now collecting data, studying trends, and investigating the\noutward migration of concentrated urban poverty. We hope to bring\nnew insights to the public policy debate over the coming years.\n\nII. Addressing Poverty: What Has Been\nAccomplished - What Remains to Be Done\nSo here we are in 2006, nearly 40 years after the fair-lending laws\nfirst made their appearance. What has been accomplished in reducing\npoverty over the past generation, and what still remains to be done?\n\nBy the late 1990s, poverty rates had fallen close to their historical\nlows. However, census data indicate that overall poverty has actually\ninched higher from 1999 to 2004. You will hear more about that\ntrend this afternoon. We also know that income inequality has\nworsened, and there are increasing concerns that income mobility one of the cornerstones of the American dream - is decreasing. And\nalthough concentrated poverty appears to have declined somewhat in\nrecent years, part of that decline was caused by the geographic\ndispersion of poor people rather than by an actual reduction of\npoverty itself.\n\nRecent economic research has also verified what we have all been\nreading and observing lately - Americans with weaker job-market\nskills have not benefited as much from the growing U.S. economy as\nhave other Americans with higher-level skills. Economists call this\n\"skill-biased technical change.\" People who lack the skills needed to\nkeep up with changes in technology cannot take full advantage of the\nbenefits of the growing sectors of the economy. If lower-skilled\nAmericans fall further behind, the result will be increased income\ninequality and, ultimately, greater poverty.\n\nDespite these trends, we can learn from some recent experiences\nthat will help us focus on the most promising places to expend our\nenergies to combat poverty. Through the Federal Reserve's research\nand outreach, we have been learning where different approaches can\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20060622.cfm[4/29/2014 2:08:31 PM]\n\n\fThe Challenge of Concentrated Poverty :: June 22, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\n\nlead to better outcomes.\n\nAt the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, our research staff has\nhelped us to understand that human capital is every bit as important\nas physical capital in driving innovation and income growth. That has\nled our Bank to sponsor forums on the economics of educational\nattainment and to conduct studies on the links among education,\ninnovation, investment, and economic performance.\n\nOur Bank has also taken part in new research that aims to find a more\ncomprehensive measure of economic trends in Northeast Ohio. This is\nthe \"Dashboard Indicators\" project, which collects detailed\ninformation about the economic performance of the region, including\npoverty rates, to better focus regional economic development\nefforts. You will hear more about this project in just a few minutes.\n\nData will be critical in any effort to overcome concentrated poverty.\nChairman Ben Bernanke expressed this idea well in a recent speech:\n\"Both government policymakers and community-development\norganizations need the 'reality check' that hard data can provide. To\nknow whether our policies and programs are delivering the desired\nresults, we need to be able to measure inputs and outcomes,\nprogram by program and community by community. Better\ninformation increases accountability and promotes good governance\nin both the public and the nonprofit sectors.\"\n\nI could not agree more with the Chairman's comments. And indeed,\nthroughout the Federal Reserve System, we have been taking an\nactive role to uncover the hard data that will lead us to the priorities\nof better accountability and better outcomes.\n\nIII. How This Policy Summit Can Lead to\nPositive Change\nWe know the questions that must be answered: How can we\nstrengthen workforce skills? How can we reduce income inequality\nand help promote the American ideal of income mobility?\n\nAnswers to those questions can begin to emerge from policy\nconferences like this one. I am proud that the Federal Reserve can\nserve as a facilitator for your analysis and collaboration.\n\nOur conference agenda has brought together experts from across the\nnation who can explore the complex details of concentrated poverty,\nand who can suggest ways to overcome it. We are privileged to have\nwith us as our keynote speaker Dr. William Julius Wilson - a\nnationally recognized expert on urban poverty - who will discuss\nsome of the root causes of poverty.\n\nIn your discussions here, both today and tomorrow, I encourage you\nto be bold in your thinking, to challenge assumptions, to envision not\nwhat has been but what could be.\n\nSome will say that the problem of concentrated poverty is\ninsurmountable. Confronting the dilemmas of wealth and poverty\nmay, indeed, be the one of the most difficult challenges of our\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20060622.cfm[4/29/2014 2:08:31 PM]\n\n\fThe Challenge of Concentrated Poverty :: June 22, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\ngeneration. But let's step back and ask ourselves: What kind of\nsociety will we leave to the next generation? One that is rigidly\nstratified by economic class? Or one that allows for income mobility,\npermitting individuals and families to rise as far and as fast as their\nown talents will take them?\n\nEven when the policy answers to these problems are identified,\nmobilizing the public to pursue them will require tremendous efforts.\nYet throughout our history, each generation has faced challenges\ninvolving such fundamental social questions.\n\nA great American lawmaker of the nineteenth century, Daniel\nWebster, once reminded the nation of the task ahead: \"Let us\ndevelop the resources of our land, call forth its powers, build up its\ninstitutions, promote all its great interests, and see whether we also,\nin our day and generation, may not perform something worthy to be\nremembered.\"\n\nWebster's comments are just as relevant for us today. In our day and\ngeneration, our nation enjoys material wealth in a measure that\nAmericans have never before known. However, we know that not\neveryone shares those advantages. There is no better time for bright,\ntalented, and motivated people to dig in - to grapple with the\nenduring issue of poverty amid plenty - and to fulfill a task that will\ntruly be \"worthy to be remembered.\"\n\nCareers | Diversity | Privacy | Terms of Use | Contact Us | Feedback | RSS Feeds\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20060622.cfm[4/29/2014 2:08:31 PM]\n\n\f"

During\nthose same two weeks, we will also see a lot of speculation in the\nmedia and elsewhere about what the FOMC will do when we meet on\nJune 28th and 29th. Today, I will talk about how I am thinking about\ncurrent economic conditions and monetary policy.\n\nBuena Vista Palace, Orlando, Florida\n\nBroadcast Cable Filnancial\nManagement Association\n\nJune 12, 2006\n\nI will begin with some background on how we make monetary policy\ndecisions. Next, I will explore how our economy's performance is\ninfluencing the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions. Finally, I\nwill discuss a topic that is near and dear to both of our professions communications - and talk about how clear communications can\nfactor into the policymaking process.\nPlease note that the opinions I express here today are mine alone. I\ndo not presume to speak for any of my colleagues in the Federal\nReserve System.\n\nI. What We Do at the Federal Reserve\nLet me begin, then, with a few words about what we do and how we\noperate at the Federal Reserve.\nWhen news reports talk about \"the Fed,\" they are really talking about\na combination of two entities: the seven-member Board of Governors\nbased in Washington and led by Chairman Ben Bernanke, and the 12\nFederal Reserve Banks around the country.\nI lead the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland - the Fourth District in\nthe 12-district system. The Fourth District includes all of Ohio,\nwestern Pennsylvania, eastern Kentucky, and the panhandle of West\nVirginia.\nLike the other 11 Reserve Banks, the Federal Reserve Bank of\nCleveland supervises banks; conducts research on economic\nconditions; provides financial services to banks and the U.S.\nTreasury; and serves as a resource for community economic\ndevelopment. And, yes, we also participate in conducting monetary\npolicy-an area that has been dominating the headlines recently.\nMonetary policy is conducted by the FOMC, which brings together the\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20060612.cfm[4/29/2014 2:08:43 PM]\n\n\fEconomic Conditions and Monetary Policy :: June 12, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nseven governors and 12 Reserve Bank presidents. We meet eight\ntimes a year in Washington, D.C.\nLet me give you a quick run-through of a typical meeting. One of the\nfirst things we consider are projections for domestic and international\neconomic conditions. These projections are developed by the\neconomists at the Board of Governors and are contained in a\ndocument known as the Green Book. The projections are reviewed\nwith the Committee, and we use this time on the agenda to raise\nquestions about the projections and discuss issues associated with\nthem.\nNext, we discuss what we have been hearing from business leaders in\nour respective districts about international, national and regional\nbusiness conditions. In FOMC meetings, we have what we call a \"go\n'round.\" We literally go around the conference table, with each of the\n19 members offering his or her viewpoint on economic conditions and\nthe economic outlook.\nAfter each member has spoken, it is time to consider policy options,\nwhich are outlined for the Committee members in advance, in a\ndocument called the Blue Book. Then it is time for a second \"go\n'round,\" with members stating their views on which policy option\nshould be adopted. If it is obvious that members generally agree, this\n\"go 'round\" can be fairly brief. Otherwise, a more in-depth discussion\ntakes place.\nWhen we feel that we have enough information to make a decision\non monetary policy, we proceed with a vote. Then we publish a\npublic statement about our decision, summarizing what we did and\nwhy. Three weeks later, we publish the minutes of our meeting.\nToday, market watchers are focused on what we will decide to do\nlater this month with our main policy instrument - the target for the\nfederal funds rate. The federal funds rate is the rate at which banks\nlend each other money overnight. Movements in this rate have a\npowerful, if indirect, effect on the interest rates that have an impact\non you and other consumers - on loans for cars, home mortgages, and\nbusiness finance.\nThe FOMC has a dual mandate: first, to maintain price stability over\nthe long term, and, second, to promote maximum sustainable\neconomic growth. Ultimately, we want the public to be confident\nthat inflation will remain low and stable over time, and that the\neconomy will continue to expand.\n\nII. How Economic Performance Influences\nMonetary Policy\nNow let me explain how we go about deciding where to set the\ntarget for the federal funds rate. Our national economy today is in\nreasonably good condition. But in order to set policy appropriately,\nwe have to analyze not just where we are now, but also how we got\nhere and where it looks like we're heading.\nSo, how did the current business cycle unfold, and how did the FOMC\nrespond? The economic downturn that began in 2001 called for a\nsignificantly lower federal funds rate. In light of weakening economic\ngrowth, falling market interest rates, and a general increase in\nperceived risks in the global economic outlook, the FOMC reduced\nthe federal funds rate from 61V percent to 1V percent by late 2002 a level that had not been seen since 1961.\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20060612.cfm[4/29/2014 2:08:43 PM]\n\n\fEconomic Conditions and Monetary Policy :: June 12, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nIn early 2003, in addition to maintaining an accommodative monetary\npolicy to support the economic expansion, the FOMC also became\nconcerned with the possible emergence of an unwelcome disinflation.\nIn response, in June 2003, we lowered the federal funds rate one\nmore time, to the historically low level of 1 percent.\nStarting in mid-2004, as the threat of unwelcome disinflation passed,\nand as economic conditions began to normalize, it made sense to\nbegin the process of removing our policy accommodation. We\naccomplished that by raising our target for the federal funds rate.\nWe did not know, at the time, how high we would have to raise the\nfederal funds rate target. But we knew that the direction had to be\nconsiderably northwards. Step by step, in a series of 16 quarter-point\nadjustments, the FOMC has raised the federal funds rate to where it\nis today - 5 percent.\nLooking at the nation's current economic situation, do the data\nsuggest that we have adjusted the federal funds rate appropriately?\nHow are we doing in achieving our objectives of sustainable economic\ngrowth and price stability?\nLet's start by looking at economic growth. After a weak fourth\nquarter in 2005, mainly due to significant energy-price shocks and\ndevastating hurricanes, the economy bounced back quite strongly in\nthe first quarter of this year. Looking ahead, most forecasters are\nexpecting economic growth to be about 3 percent for the second half\nof this year and for 2007. These growth rates, while consistent with a\nhealthy economy, are lower than what we experienced for most of\n2004 and 2005.\nThe sectors of the economy that will support our economic growth\nthis year are expected to be somewhat different from those that\nprevailed in the past few years. The housing market, after several\nyears of strong expansion, is already showing signs of cooling off this\nyear. Consumer sentiment has been deteriorating, according to the\nlatest survey responses, and recent data show signs that consumer\nspending is softening from its strong first-quarter performance.\nConsumers have sustained their spending during the past several\nyears, in part, by cashing out some of their home-equity dollars. This\nextra source of financing is likely to slow down in a softening housing\nmarket. Fortunately, though, I expect to see enough employment and\nincome growth coming out of the labor market to keep consumer\nspending advancing at a moderate rate.\nOn the business side, I look for capital spending to continue to\nexpand at a decent pace again this year. Stronger economic growth\nabroad will also boost American exports. These two sectors - business\nspending and exports - are likely to mitigate the effects of a\nslowdown in the consumer and housing sectors.\nIn summary, as the year progresses, I anticipate that the pace of\neconomic expansion will slow from its rapid rate of growth in the\nfirst quarter. Nevertheless, I believe that we are on track to achieve\nour objective of sustainable economic growth.\nWhat about our objective of price stability? Inflation rates can be\naffected by all kinds of unusual events in the short term, especially\nlarge swings in energy prices. Of course, all of us are painfully aware\nof the huge increases we have seen in energy prices. We feel it every\ntime we fill up our gas tanks. Americans are complaining that the\nenergy-price increases have hit them hard - and they're right. The\nprice of a barrel of oil has gone from about $20 in 2002 to roughly\n$70 today.\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20060612.cfm[4/29/2014 2:08:43 PM]\n\n\fEconomic Conditions and Monetary Policy :: June 12, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nPrice pressures are also being felt across an array of other\ncommodities, goods and services. As a result, the core rate of\ninflation has also been edging up lately. The Consumer Price Index\nhas increased by 3.5 percent during the past year. The so-called core\nrate - that is, the CPI excluding food and energy - hasn't risen as\nmuch: It rose slightly more than 2 percent during the past year. But\nthe core CPI has increased at an annualized rate of more than 3\npercent during the past three months. This inflation picture, if\nsustained, exceeds my comfort level.\nFortunately, the public is, for the most part, looking at this\ndisappointing inflation news as a transitory development. Measures of\nlong-term inflation expectations have been mixed lately, but, on the\nwhole, I regard them as remaining contained. The FOMC's challenge is\nto make sure that they stay contained.\nThe recent news on inflation troubles me, but the news has not come\nas a complete surprise. Last year I began to anticipate that we might\nconfront some disappointing inflation data in the first half of this\nyear, although I was not expecting quite as much inflation as we\nhave seen. Still, I have been expecting price pressures to diminish.\nThis juncture in the policymaking process is the most difficult. There\nis, after all, a time lag between monetary-policy actions and their\nultimate effect on inflation. That is, even though the recently\nreported inflation numbers have been edging upward, I think that the\ncurrent 5 percent level of the federal funds rate is near a point that\nis consistent with a gradual improvement in the inflation outlook.\nOf course, my current inflation outlook depends on the rest of the\neconomy developing along the lines of my broader forecast.\nSpecifically, I expect a flattening-out of energy prices, a cooling\nhousing market, continued strong productivity growth, and a\nmoderation in the overall pace of economic activity.\n\nIII. Communications in Monetary Policy\nBy now, it should be clear that setting monetary policy consists of\nseveral forward-looking elements - forecasts, inflation expectations,\nand the lagged effects of current and recent policy actions, to name\njust a few. Communications also play an important role in the entire\nenterprise of policymaking, especially in light of these forwardlooking factors.\nOur communications not only inform the public of our interest rate\nactions, but also provide a context for understanding why the actions\nwere taken, and, more broadly, help the public to form expectations\nabout future economic and inflation conditions. For the FOMC to\nanchor the public's inflation expectations - which I have argued is\nessential to meeting our objectives of sustainable economic growth\nand price stability - our policy decisions and communications must\ngive the public confidence that we will produce low inflation over\nthe long run.\nThe FOMC does not have long experience with frequent and detailed\nmonetary policy communications. The Committee only began its\ncurrent practice of immediately announcing its policy decisions in\n1994. In a previous speech, I characterized the period since then as\none in which the FOMC started learning how to talk.\nTo me, that process is in some sense like a person learning how to\nwalk through a dark room without knowing where the furniture is.\nYou move very slowly, feeling your way. Sometimes you discover\nyou're a bit off course. You may stumble, but you learn to adapt and\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20060612.cfm[4/29/2014 2:08:43 PM]\n\n\fEconomic Conditions and Monetary Policy :: June 12, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nmove toward your destination. From my perspective, changes in the\nCommittee's communications process since 1994 reflect an institution\nthat is becoming more comfortable with greater transparency.\nLet me give you an example of how our more recent communications\nhave evolved. Recall the episode that I mentioned earlier in my\nremarks, about our concern over unwelcome disinflation in 2003 and\nearly 2004. To address that particular problem, the Committee\nexplained that it expected to maintain its low federal funds rate for\na considerable period. This language guided market participants to\nexpect no policy changes for a while.\nAs the threat of unwelcome disinflation passed, the language was\ngradually modified, eventually to be replaced by language suggesting\nthat the accommodative policy could be removed at a measured\npace. This phrase signaled that the funds rate would rise, but that it\nwould be rise slowly and predictably.\nThat language was altered once again last December, in an important\nway. Rather than repeating that accommodation could be removed at\na measured pace, the Committee said that some further measured\nfirming might be required. This change indicated, for the first time,\nthat the Committee was focused on the risks of higher inflation. In\nJanuary, the word \"measured\" was eliminated, signaling that the\ntiming and magnitude of future actions would be less certain.\nAs our experience demonstrates, communicating to markets is\ncomplicated because incoming data can affect not only how we\nevaluate current economic conditions, but also our view of where the\neconomy is heading. Also, FOMC members may not all interpret the\ndata in the same way at the same time.\nThe minutes of our meetings, including the last one, indicate that\nthere can be differences of opinion. Although these differences lead\nto better policy decisions over time, they add to the challenge we\nface as a Committee in communicating with the public.\nSo, what are financial markets expecting? Well, as you may know,\nthere is a market that deals with federal funds futures, and at the\nmoment, market participants place much higher odds on another 25basis-point rate hike than on a pause at the FOMC's meeting later this\nmonth.\nHowever, before the next FOMC meeting, more information on both\nprices and real economic activity will be available. Even if those\nnumbers fail to change my outlook for inflation and economic\ngrowth, they may push my assessment of risks in one direction or\nanother. New data, including statements from FOMC members, could\nalso shift the odds that market participants place on the FOMC's\nupcoming decisions, in much the same way as they have during the\npast few weeks.\nIt is important to emphasize that a good communication policy does\nnot mean that the public will always be able to anticipate what the\nFOMC will do next. Sometimes the economic situation is simply too\nfluid to admit such certainty.\nWhat good communications can do is help people appreciate the\nCommittee's objectives, understand how policymakers are thinking\nabout the prospects for meeting those objectives, and consider how\nnew information might affect policy choices.\nI hope that my remarks have given you a better understanding of how\nI think about economic conditions and the challenges we are facing\nas monetary policymakers.\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20060612.cfm[4/29/2014 2:08:43 PM]\n\n\fEconomic Conditions and Monetary Policy :: June 12, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\n\nCareers | Diversity | Privacy | Terms of Use | Contact Us | Feedback | RSS Feeds\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20060612.cfm[4/29/2014 2:08:43 PM]\n\n\f"

To traditionalists, that is probably still a pretty\nradical notion.\nBut the diversity of this campus surely prepares those of you\ngraduating today for the even broader range of people you will meet\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20060513.cfm[4/29/2014 2:08:58 PM]\n\n\fNotre Dame College Commencement Address :: May 13, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\n\nbeyond Notre Dame.\nAs new college graduates, you are armed with a rare and valuable\nresource: a college degree - a distinction earned by fewer than 30\npercent of the adult population in this country.\nAnd you are poised to contribute to a society that - despite its\nshortcomings - remains a beacon of success and an example to the\nentire world that individuals can accomplish great goals, when they're\nfree to expend their energies in search of great achievement.\nWhatever field you have chosen - I know that each one of you wants\nto be successful.\nYou have already made a big investment in your future by earning the\ndegree that you are receiving today.\nAnd if the world were static and predictable, you might think that\nyour degree is sufficient to make you successful throughout your\nworking life.\nBut trust me, it isn't.\nThis is just the warm-up act.\nI am convinced that your future success will depend on your\nwillingness to focus on three important building blocks: skills,\nstriving, and stamina.\nThese, in my view, are the building blocks of success.\nYou have begun building your skills here at Notre Dame College.\nYou are equipped with the gift of a liberal-arts education, which has\ntaught you to explore, to question, to challenge, and to prepare to\nre-create the world around you.\nYou have learned how to learn.\nAs you prepare to enter the workplace, the careers that you have in\nmind today may change dramatically, or they may not even exist a\ndecade from now.\nFor the rest of your working life, you will be called upon to build\nyour skills constantly, and perhaps to change your career completely.\nBecause you will be confronted with the need to change, you must\nresolve today to become a lifelong learner.\nI was lucky to have parents who instilled in me and my siblings a\npassion for learning.\nMy parents moved our family to the United States when I was five\nyears old.\nThey were willing to sacrifice everything for their children.\nTo give us the chance for a better life, they summoned up the\ncourage to leave their home, their family, their friends, and their\nfamiliar country.\nAlthough my parents did not have a chance to go beyond the\nequivalent of elementary school, they recognized that education is\nthe pathway toward future opportunity - and they knew that the\nUnited States offered the best prospects in the world for gaining that\neducation.\nEven today in Italy, only about one-tenth of the population completes\ncollege.\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20060513.cfm[4/29/2014 2:08:58 PM]\n\n\fNotre Dame College Commencement Address :: May 13, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nBy any measure, those who are lucky enough to be in America whether they are native-born or newcomers - enjoy a potential for\ngrowth that is unsurpassed in the world.\n\"We are the land of opportunity,\" said Senator Kennedy in 1965.\n\"Our streets may not be paved with gold, but they are paved with the\npromise that men and women who live here - even strangers and\nnewcomers - can rise as fast and as far as their skills will allow.\"\nIn addition to skills, you will need to embrace the second building\nblock - striving.\nYou will need to possess a desire and drive to succeed.\nAs you strive, you will often find yourself outside your comfort zone.\nBut stepping outside that zone is the hallmark of our American\nsociety.\nFrom the pilgrims to the prospectors to the technology pioneers of\ntoday, America was built by people who dared to sacrifice comfort\nfor opportunity.\nEvery generation strives for a better life for those who follow.\nAs a society, we have continued to improve our standard of living.\nIn the past six decades, in fact, American incomes have risen by more\nthan 400 percent.\nThrough innovation, and many struggles, we have a standard of living\nin this country that remains the envy of the world.\nIt is still the dream of every parent to give their children a better life\nthan they have had.\nConnie Schultz, the Pulitzer Prize winning columnist at The Plain\nDealer, wrote a story recently about her father, who had just passed\naway.\nShe said that the very first column that she wrote for the Plain\nDealer was about her father's lunch pail, how she wanted it, but he\ncouldn't find it.\nShe said that she and her father shared opposing forces of the same\npassion for that lunch pail. He wanted to forget what she always had\nto remember, that he wore his body out so that his four kids could\nlive a life he never knew.\nMy eyes filled with tears as I read those words.\nI thought of my own father, who worked in construction, and who\nspent years wearing out his body so that his four children could live a\nlife he and my mother never knew.\nRemembering how hard he worked every day inspires me to strive.\nI didn't have to struggle in the same sense that my father did, doing\nphysical labor.\nBut I often struggled in different ways, because I found myself in\nunfamiliar territory.\nThe list of firsts is long for me, as it will be for many of you.\nFirst generation with a college degree, first to move away from my\nfamily to start a professional career, first to attend graduate school,\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20060513.cfm[4/29/2014 2:08:58 PM]\n\n\fNotre Dame College Commencement Address :: May 13, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nfirst to hold an executive title.\nBeing the first is hard, but the rewards are worth it.\nI appreciate, from my own pathway through life, that such new\nexperiences can \"take you out of your comfort zone.\"\nBut let me assure you: As you move into the professional world, some\nof your greatest achievements occur when you're alive to the\npossibilities of new ideas.\nThe third building block to success is stamina, that is, perseverance.\nYour ability to set clear goals and to persist until you achieve them\nwill be critical for a successful career.\nYou will surely encounter some obstacles, but perseverance will help\nyou turn obstacles into opportunities.\nMy first job after graduation was as a research assistant at the Board\nof Governors of the Federal Reserve System in Washington, D.C.\nAs part of the orientation on that first day, we went on a tour of the\nbuilding.\nI remember walking into the Board Room where the Federal Open\nMarket Committee meets to set monetary policy for the nation, and I\nremember setting a goal that day that one day I would sit at that\ntable.\nToday, as one of 12 Federal Reserve Bank presidents and a member\nof the Federal Open Market Committee, I have an assigned seat at\nthat table along with Chairman Ben Bernanke.\nIt didn't happen overnight. There were obstacles along the way. And\nthere were times when I doubted that I had the stamina to achieve\nmy goal - but I persevered.\nMy perseverance has paid off, and it is still paying me dividends every\nday.\nI know that your perseverance will allow you to achieve your goals\nand pay you the same kind of dividends.\nAnd I feel confident that you have the inner resources and the\nstrength of character to use your skills, striving, and stamina to fulfill\nyour hopes and dreams.\nI know I said that your future success will depend on your willingness\nto focus on those three important building blocks - skills, striving and\nstamina.\nBut there is one more critical element to achieving success - having\nstrong values.\nLike many of you, I could not always look to my parents as role\nmodels for my professional career.\nBut the values they instilled in me are critical to my success in both\nmy personal and professional life - the values of hard work, respect\nfor every individual, and most important - family and faith.\nIn the same way, you can look to your families - and to the faculty\nand staff of Notre Dame - and recall all the strong values that they\nhave instilled in you.\nIt has been my honor to share these thoughts with you, and to share\nthis wonderful day with you and the Notre Dame family.\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20060513.cfm[4/29/2014 2:08:58 PM]\n\n\fNotre Dame College Commencement Address :: May 13, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nAs you leave Notre Dame College with your diploma proudly in hand, I\nwish you all great personal and professional success.\n\nCareers | Diversity | Privacy | Terms of Use | Contact Us | Feedback | RSS Feeds\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20060513.cfm[4/29/2014 2:08:58 PM]\n\n\f"

I will comment on the\neconomic transitions we are facing in Northeast Ohio, and I will\ndiscuss the critical role that education can play in reinvigorating our\nregion.\nPlease note that the opinions I express today are mine alone. I do\nnot presume to speak for any of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve\nSystem.\n\nSandr Pianalto\nPresident and CEO,\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nCuyahoga Valley Communities\nCouncil\nBrecksville, OH\nFebruary 16, 2006\n\nThe Role of the Federal Reserve System\nBefore I turn to economic renewal, I want to give you some\nbackground on the organization that I am part of - the Federal\nReserve System - and the role we play in the economy. The Federal\nReserve has been getting a lot of media attention lately. Our new\nchairman, Ben Bernanke, gave his first economic report to Congress\nthis week, and I know that a lot of people are following the actions\nof the Federal Open Market Committee, which has raised its target\nfederal funds rate at 14 consecutive meetings. Because of this\nattention, I have been getting a lot of questions about what we do at\nthe Federal Reserve and how we are structured. It appears that the\nFederal Reserve is somewhat of an enigma.\nThe Federal Reserve System is our nation's central bank. Our mission\nis to preserve price stability, to foster maximum sustainable growth\nin output and employment, and to promote a stable and efficient\nfinancial system.\nThe Federal Reserve was created by an Act of Congress in 1913. At\nthat time, there was a debate in Congress over whether the Federal\nReserve should be a public institution that would report to the U.S.\nTreasury or whether is it should be a private institution that would\nbe owned and operated by commercial banks. The legislation ended\nin a compromise - drawing on both the public and private sectors to\ncreate a unique, decentralized structure.\nThe Board of Governors in Washington is the public aspect of the\nsystem. Each of the seven governors who serves on the Board of\nGovernors is appointed by the President of the United States to a 14year term. These long terms were intended to insulate the Federal\nReserve from political pressures.\nThe 12 Reserve Banks across the country are the private aspect of\nthe System, meaning that they operate somewhat independently,\nwith their own charters and boards of directors, but under the\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20060216.cfm[4/29/2014 2:09:10 PM]\n\n\fRenewing our Regional Economy :: February 16, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\ngeneral oversight of the Board of Governors in Washington.\nI head the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. My district - the\nFourth District - includes all of Ohio, western Pennsylvania, eastern\nKentucky, and the panhandle of West Virginia. Our main office is in\nCleveland, and we have branch offices in Pittsburgh and Cincinnati.\nLike the other 11 Reserve Banks, the Federal Reserve Bank of\nCleveland conducts economic research, provides financial services,\nand supervises banks.\nAn important function of the Federal Reserve is monetary policy.\nAnd just what do I mean by \"monetary policy?\" In a nutshell, this is\nhow the Federal Reserve manages the nation's supply of money and\ncredit. Monetary policy is conducted by the Federal Open Market\nCommittee, commonly known as the FOMC. The FOMC brings\ntogether the twelve Reserve Bank presidents and the seven\ngovernors.\nWe meet eight times a year in Washington to determine the course of\nmonetary policy. When the news media speak of interest rate\ndecisions by \"the Fed,\" they are really referring to decisions made by\nthe FOMC.\nOur monetary policy task is straightforward - but it is certainly not\nsimple. Our goals are to maintain price stability and promote\nmaximum sustainable economic growth. You might think that these\ntwo goals are at odds, but in fact they go hand in hand. The only\nway that the Federal Reserve can promote maximum sustainable\neconomic growth is by maintaining price stability.\nOur policies are informed by the careful monitoring of economic\ndevelopments. My colleagues and I constantly review the latest\nnational and international economic statistics. We have several\nhundred economists throughout the System who pore over the data,\nconduct research, and create models to project economic activity.\nI also rely on the input of people who are closely in tune with the\nday-to-day pace of business on Main Street. These are my Bank's\ndirectors, members of my business advisory councils, and people like\nyou, in communities throughout the District. This input provides me\nwith reliable information \"in real time\" about how the economy is\nperforming, and it offers me a glimpse into economic trends long\nbefore the national statistics are released.\nThe main monetary policy tool we use is targeting the federal funds\nrate - the interest rate that banks charge each other for overnight\nloans. Changes in this rate, in turn, affect a host of other short-term\ninterest rates and economic variables.\nThose are the basics of the Federal Reserve and monetary policy. I\nwant to emphasize that although monetary policy is national in scope\n- meaning that the FOMC takes policy actions based on what is best\nfor the country as a whole - we are well aware that different regions\nof the country face their own special circumstances and challenges.\nAs we saw last year, some regions, like the Gulf Coast, can face\nsudden and catastrophic changes, while others, like our region, are\nin the process of responding to longer-term structural changes.\n\nEconomic Transition in Northeast Ohio\nLet me now turn to the economic challenges that we are currently\nfacing in Northeast Ohio. More than four million people live in the 15\ncounties that make up Northeast Ohio. Compared with the rest of\nthe country, we are still a region that manufactures, coats, polishes,\nand extracts.\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20060216.cfm[4/29/2014 2:09:10 PM]\n\n\fRenewing our Regional Economy :: February 16, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nAfter a century of relying on the heaviest types of traditional\nindustry - coal, steel, autos, rubber, and electrical equipment - we\nhave been deeply affected by global trends, including rapidly\nchanging technology and increased international trade.\nDeep currents of change have swept over our industrial landscape.\nEconomists call this process \"creative destruction.\" Creative\ndestruction is a natural, and indeed a necessary, part of our\neconomic development. As familiar industries of the past are\nreplaced by the innovative technologies that will shape our future,\nresources are redirected to wherever they are most productive.\nCapital and creative energy will flow toward the new goods, services,\nand processes that will deliver the greatest value, and the jobs will\neventually follow.\nOf course, creative destruction can be an uncomfortable process; but\nin reality, it is the absence of this ebb and flow that should concern\nus. There is some evidence to suggest that a weak level of creative\ndestruction can help explain why employment and economic growth\nhave been less robust in our region than in other parts of the\ncountry.\nFor example, I think there is a common perception that Ohio has had\na higher-than-normal share of job losses due to plant contractions\nand closings over the past few decades. But, in fact, until very\nrecently Ohio's rate of job destruction has been less than the\nnation's. This might sound promising at first, but as I have suggested,\nit actually points to a less dynamic economic environment.\nHow so? Well, the fastest-growing areas of the country tend to\nexhibit the greatest rates of job destruction. As this happens, old\njobs are replaced with newer, more productive and more innovative\nactivities. And it is precisely the creative part of creative\ndestruction that is less evident in Ohio. We have not only had a\nlower rate of plant contractions and closures than the nation, but\nalso a lower rate of plant openings and expansions.\nDuring the past few years, Ohio's rate of job destruction has been\nmoving much closer to the national average, while job creation is still\nsub-par. This combination has actually worsened Ohio's relative\nposition nationally in job creation. Clearly, our state's economy is\nless dynamic than it should be to sustain healthy growth.\nWe can see the results of this trend during the so-called \"boom\" years\nof the 1990s. During that decade, our region struggled to keep pace\nwith the nation in many labor market measures. For instance, in the\n1990s, growth in employment nationwide was about 21 percent; but\nin Northeast Ohio, our employment growth was only half that much about 11 and a half percent. Wages followed a similar pattern: The\nincrease in average annual wages nationwide was more than 51\npercent, but in our region, wages increased only three-quarters of\nthat amount - just under 38 percent.\nAlthough declines in manufacturing employment are a part of the\nstory, they aren't the whole story. In fact, the region's relatively\nweak job growth is fairly broad based, and it affects industries across\nboth the manufacturing and service sectors. From 1990 to 2003,\ntwo-thirds of Ohio's industries saw slower employment growth than\ntheir national counterparts. If you combine these trends with those\nrelated to plant openings and closings, you might presume that our\nregion has a generally less favorable and less fertile business\nenvironment.\nThat does not have to be the picture for the long term, however.\nLooking ahead, we can foresee economic change that opens the way\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20060216.cfm[4/29/2014 2:09:10 PM]\n\n\fRenewing our Regional Economy :: February 16, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\ntoward a future every bit as prosperous as our past - but only if we\nprepare for it, plan for it, and summon the resolve to embrace new\nopportunities.\nWe have many strengths that provide a solid foundation for future\ngrowth:\n- We have a wealth of established companies and a promising array of\nemerging technology firms.\n- We have a large concentration of financial expertise and legal\ntalent.\n- We have fine public and private universities, and an outstanding\nhealth care sector.\n- We have outstanding natural resources, such as the Cuyahoga Valley\nNational Park.\n- Most important, we have talented, committed people who enjoy\nliving and working here.\nBecause of this, I am confident about the potential for renewal in\nNortheast Ohio.\nTake a look at some of our country's currently successful areas, and\nyou will see that they also went through difficult transitions. For\nexample, a famous billboard from 1971 asked, \"Will the last person\nleaving Seattle turn out the lights?\" At that time, the decline of\naerospace and timber seemed to spell doom for that city. Now, of\ncourse, Seattle is known as a major center for software and the\ncoffee trade - businesses that the city hardly even dreamt of in\n1971. Also think of North Carolina's Piedmont region. This area\nfaced steady declines in its core industries - tobacco, textiles, and\nfurniture - before becoming the \"Research Triangle\" and a major\nbanking center today.\nWhat made these successes possible, and what can we do to emulate\nthem?\n\nWhy Education Matters\nThis brings me to the last topic I would like to discuss tonight:\neducation. There is no magic formula, but a growing body of\nresearch seems to suggest that education is a critical component of\nan area's economic growth prospects. Indeed, Seattle shows up as\nthe U.S. city with the highest proportion of bachelor's degree holders,\nand Raleigh, North Carolina - one corner of the Research Triangle ranks third.\nWhat about areas of the country that are older, colder and formerly\nindustrial? Regions in the Northeast and Midwest that have prospered\nduring the past 25 years have also tended to have high levels of\neducational attainment. A number of studies suggest that levels of\neducational attainment are strongly correlated with economic growth\nover time. This is not hard to believe, especially in a global\neconomy, which seems to put an increasing premium on highly skilled\nworkers.\nWhat is perhaps surprising, however, is that this is not a recent\nphenomenon or an outgrowth of the computer age. As a matter of\nfact, economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland are\ndiscovering that a state's so-called \"stock of productive knowledge,\"\nas measured by levels of educational attainment and patents, has\nbeen the best predictor of its relative income level since at least the\n1940s.\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20060216.cfm[4/29/2014 2:09:10 PM]\n\n\fRenewing our Regional Economy :: February 16, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nBack then, differences in high school graduation rates were a key\ndriver of differences in income levels across the states, and Ohio\nranked 19th in the country in graduation rates. We also tended to\nproduce significantly more patents per person than the national\naverage - about one and a half times more. Since the 1960s,\nhowever, Ohio's patents per person have declined to about the\nnational average.\nOhio also does not fare very well in the measure of educational\nattainment that matters most today - college graduation rates. In\nthis category, Ohio ranks 39th out of the 50 states in the share of its\nresidents who have earned baccalaureate degrees. Not surprisingly,\njust as Ohio's patent production and educational attainment have\nfailed to keep pace with most of the country, Ohio's per capita\nincome - which was once above the national average - has not kept\npace with the national average for more than two decades now.\nWe all want to build a sound foundation for future economic\nprosperity. I believe that one of the most promising ways to do that\nis to create a civic culture that supports education. I am proud to be\na part of a statewide group - the Ohio Business Alliance for Higher\nEducation and the Economy - that is working to increase the strategic\nrole of our colleges and universities in contributing to Ohio's\neconomic growth.\nAs we look ahead, our prospects will depend critically on our\ncommitment to invest in intellectual capital. The knowledge base of\nour students and the technological skills of our workers will be\ncritical for the future prosperity of our region. I am convinced that\nthe investments we make in education today - if other conditions are\nright - will serve as a springboard for economic growth tomorrow.\n\nConclusion\nI have enjoyed sharing my perspectives on economic renewal in our\nregion. I believe that together, we can create and nurture a civic\nculture that promotes economic creativity, encourages investment in\nnew technologies, and champions education.\nThe late Lew Platt, the former head of Hewlett-Packard, once\nadvised business leaders that \"Formerly successful companies did not\nmake gigantic mistakes.the only real mistake they made was to keep\ndoing whatever it was that had made them successful for a little too\nlong.\"\nSo it is for our region. Instead of resisting change, we must prepare\nfor new opportunities. In this effort, I know that we can remain\nconfident in our region's resourcefulness, and that we will remain\ncommitted to building an economic future that will be as enriching\nas our past.\n\nCareers | Diversity | Privacy | Terms of Use | Contact Us | Feedback | RSS Feeds\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20060216.cfm[4/29/2014 2:09:10 PM]\n\n\f"

I will begin with some\ncomments about the economy's recent performance and the outlook\nfor 2006. Next, I will explain why making sound policy decisions\nrequires me to think about both the demand and supply sides of the\neconomy. Finally, I will describe how the stories behind the\nforecasts directly relate to the way I think about the appropriate\ncourse for monetary policy.\n\nPresident and CEO,\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nCleveland Association for Business\nEconomics (CABE)\nFebruary 13, 2006\n\nPlease note that the views I express today are mine alone. I do not\npresume to speak for any of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve\nSystem.\n\nEconomic Performance and the 2006 Outlook\nI will set the context for my remarks by first taking a brief\nlook at our recent economic performance and the outlook for 2006.\nAlthough the national economy in 2005 was not as strong as it was in\n2004, overall we saw solid growth for the year. As you know, the\neconomy endured a series of significant energy-price shocks that, in\nearlier eras, might have triggered a recession. Instead, third-quarter\nGDP growth remained strong.\nNow, it is true that the advance estimate for fourth-quarter GDP\ngrowth was only 1.1 percent. Some may interpret this weak\nperformance as a sign that the energy shocks may have finally taken\ntheir toll. However, we should remind ourselves that these are\npreliminary numbers. Third-quarter GDP growth was substantially\nrevised upward, so we may learn in a few weeks that fourth-quarter\ngrowth was not quite as weak as the initial estimate indicates.\nWe should also remember that it is fairly common to miss on\nforecasts of quarter-to-quarter economic performance. For instance,\nit would not surprise me too much to look back and see that some of\nthe growth we thought would occur in the final three months of last\nyear was actually spread across the third quarter of 2005 - when GDP\ngrowth was stronger than expected - and the first quarter or two of\nthis year.\nPlease understand that I am not suggesting we should be complacent\nabout the weak statistic for fourth-quarter growth. I will be\nwatching the incoming data very carefully over the next several\nmonths. In fact, the early data for January have been reasonably\ngood.\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20060213.cfm[4/29/2014 2:09:23 PM]\n\n\fEconomic Forecasts and Monetary Policy :: February 13, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nAssuming the preliminary fourth-quarter report holds up, though,\nGDP still grew last year by 3.5 percent. For the year as a whole, it is\nclear that employment growth accelerated, business fixed investment\nwas relatively strong, and core inflation remained subdued.\nWhat about the outlook for 2006? Most forecasters are\nexpecting another solid performance. Forecasts published by Blue\nChip Economic Indicators, the Congressional Budget Office, and NABE\neconomists generally call for real GDP to expand by roughly 3-1/4 to\n3-1/2 percent this year. Housing investment is generally expected to\nslow, while business fixed investment is expected to increase. These\nforecasts call for interest rates, the unemployment rate, and core\ninflation to remain steady. I know that at your meeting last month,\nyour three forecasters presented views that were largely the same.\nNo one, of course, is expecting that every detail of these\nforecasts will prove to be precisely accurate. We have to\nacknowledge reality: Any forecast is only as good as our ability to\nlook into the future and foresee the unforeseeable.\nIn fact, the standard deviation of annual real GDP growth is about 2 ­\n1/2 percentage points. This means that most of the time we would\nexpect real GDP growth to vary in a range that is quite large between 1 and 6 percent. Although very good economic forecasting\nmodels can narrow that range of uncertainty, a fair amount of\nuncertainty still remains. Forecasting is a tough business, leading\nsome people to question the value of forecasting altogether.\nI find forecasts to be helpful. However, achieving better forecast\naccuracy is less important to me as a member of the Federal Open\nMarket Committee than understanding the forces that drive the\neconomy. As a result, although I know that forecasts tend to be\ninaccurate - sometimes very inaccurate - the process of thinking\nthrough those forecasts is central to the way I do my job. Within the\nnumbers, I need to look not just at the \"what\" but also at the \"why.\"\nIn other words, I need to think hard about the demand- and supplyside assumptions that underlie economic forecasts.\nThinking about the Demand and Supply Sides of the Economy\nSo let me explain why I believe that making sound policy decisions\nrequires me to think about both the demand and supply sides of the\neconomy.\nMost often, it seems that forecasts are presented from the demand\nside - as the sum of growth in different categories of spending. In\nother words, we gauge how fast consumption spending is likely to\ngrow, add an estimate of how fast investment is likely to expand,\nthrow in a prediction of government spending growth, include some\nassumptions about net exports and, voila, we have a GDP forecast.\nBut this is really just a description of what the forecast is, not a\ndescription of why the forecast is what it is.\nAs a policymaker, I am less interested in a statement like \"GDP will\ngrow by 3-1/4 percent,\" than I am in answering the question \"Why\nwill GDP grow by 3-1/4 percent?\" I find great value in the story\nbehind a forecast, even if I suspect that unforeseen events could\nprove the forecast wrong. Both supply and demand conditions inform\nthe stories behind the forecasts.\nHere is an example. Just recently, a major newspaper ran an\narticle that stated: \"Largely because consumer spending slowed to a\nnear halt in the fourth quarter last year, overall economic growth\nfell.\" On the surface, that statement seems pretty straightforward: If\nspending is strong, the economy grows. If spending is weak, the\neconomy grows by less. Is that really the best way to think about\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20060213.cfm[4/29/2014 2:09:23 PM]\n\n\fEconomic Forecasts and Monetary Policy :: February 13, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nU.S. economic performance in 2005?\nIt is certainly true that GDP growth last year was off the pace of\n2004. But, as we are all painfully aware, energy prices rose\ndramatically over the course of the year. Consumers saw energy\nprices rise about 30 percent by the time they peaked in September.\nClearly, energy-market disruptions - a supply condition - could go a\nlong way toward explaining why economic activity, including\nconsumer spending, was more restrained than in the recent past.\nSo, which interpretation is right? Did economic growth slow\nin 2005 because spending slowed? Or did spending slow because\neconomic growth was restrained by a series of large energy-price\nspikes? To put it another way, did growth slow because demand in\nthe economy was too weak, or did it slow because productive\ncapacity in the economy was reduced by adverse supply effects?\nFor me, from a policymaker's perspective, these are important\nquestions. My job is to help find the course of monetary policy that\nis consistent with price stability and with the economy operating at\nmaximum sustainable growth or, in other words, growing at its\npotential. This means that we have to have an idea of where\n\"potential\" is, and we have to be able to identify factors that affect\npotential, as opposed to factors that affect only aggregate demand.\nIn practice, there may be circumstances that affect both demand and\npotential, but we still must try to disentangle demand effects from\nsupply effects. And the reason we must be able to make these\ndistinctions is that demand and supply effects can have different\nimplications for the appropriate course of monetary policy.\n\nThe Stories Behind Forecasts and Monetary\nPolicy\nNow I will turn to how the stories behind the economic forecasts\ndirectly relate to the way I think about the appropriate course for\nmonetary policy. I use the term \"stories\" as a shorthand way of\ndescribing the various hypotheses that lurk behind the economic data\nwe receive. Each story that I might consider rests on some\nhypothesis about potential GDP, full employment, and other concepts\nsuch as the neutral real rate of interest. The challenging part of\nusing these concepts to inform policy decisions is that they are not\nfixed numbers, or even fixed ranges of numbers. Their values\nthemselves are a complicated function of the supply and demand\nconditions that I have been discussing.\nFormer Chairman Greenspan has expressed skepticism about the\nability of policymakers to translate these concepts into precise\nnumerical benchmarks. But the concepts themselves must be taken\ninto account when the FOMC assesses the appropriate path for\nmonetary policy. When you hear policymakers - or at least this\npolicymaker -- speak of concepts like \"potential GDP\" or \"full\nemployment,\" you are really hearing an attempt to sort out the\nsupply and demand conditions that frame the economic environment.\nThinking through these concepts is not just an academic exercise. It\nis a necessary part of creating a framework for monetary policy\ndecision-making. To fulfill its mandate, the Federal Reserve must\nlook not just at the economy's top-line performance. We must try to\ndetermine the stories that may be hidden within the numbers. And,\nas I said earlier, even though it can be frustrating to know that our\neconomic forecasts will likely be inaccurate, we know that the very\nprocess of constructing the stories behind the forecasts is invaluable.\nLet me suggest some concrete examples to help clarify what I mean.\nFrom 1997 through 1999, real GDP growth averaged almost 4.4\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20060213.cfm[4/29/2014 2:09:23 PM]\n\n\fEconomic Forecasts and Monetary Policy :: February 13, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\npercent, which is well above most traditional estimates of how fast\nthe economy can grow without accelerating inflation. But several\nmembers of the FOMC - among them, former Chairman Alan\nGreenspan and Jerry Jordan, my predecessor as president of the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland - argued that growth itself is not\ninflationary if it is driven by productivity gains.\nAlthough they were considering the same projections that others\nwere studying, Chairman Greenspan, Jerry Jordan and the others had\na much different picture of what it meant for inflation. They saw\nfavorable supply-side conditions as the cause of the rapid growth,\nwhile others saw overheated demand conditions. In my view, history\nhas proven that the supply-side perspective was correct.\nConsider a more recent example. Many people expected job growth\nto bounce back more quickly over the past four years than it did. Job\ncreation was well below expectations as the economy emerged from\nthe 2001 recession. Just how far below was made clear by the dating\nof the recession itself. As you know, a committee sponsored by the\nNational Bureau of Economic Research determines the precise timing\nof the beginning and the end of recessions. Although the committee\nconcluded that the recession ended in November 2001, it was not\nuntil July 2003 that it was confident enough to make that judgment.\nThe main reason for the delay was the unusually weak behavior of\njob growth.\nIn fact, it took almost four years for the economy to reach\nthe point where there were as many people working in the United\nStates as there were at the beginning of the recession in 2001. It was\nnot until last year that we reached the milestone of having created 2\nmillion new jobs in this expansion. A reasonable interpretation of this\nperiod is that demand for goods and services was not strong enough\nto create more robust demand for workers. That view implies that\nthe economy had generally been operating below its potential. If an\neconomy is operating below its potential because of weak demand,\nthen a relatively more accommodative monetary policy is the right\nmedicine - and it can be administered without fear of stoking\ninflation. Indeed, the FOMC followed this course for a considerable\nperiod of time.\nIt is true that even today, new jobs are still being created\nmore slowly than the roughly 3 million jobs created each year\nbetween 1994 and 2000. How can we account for this performance?\nDoes a demand-side story make the most sense? In this case, I think\nthat trends on the supply side of the economy suggest that we might\nneed to interpret sluggish labor markets differently today.\nPerhaps the most interesting trend is the pattern of labor-force\nparticipation - that is, the fraction of people who either have a job\nor are actively seeking a job. Since 2001, the labor-force\nparticipation rate of all age groups, except those 55 and older, has\ndeclined. The change has been especially noticeable among younger\nworkers - 16- to 24-year-olds. Those participation rates have\ndeclined by about 5 percentage points. That amounts to 1.9 million\nyoung people who, for now, are no longer potential workers.\nHas this episode of slower employment growth resulted from\ndemand conditions, supply conditions, or some combination of both?\nIf it is defined as a demand condition, perhaps poor job prospects\nhave discouraged people from even attempting to find work. Will\nanother year like 2005 reverse the recent trend? And does that mean\nthat monetary policy should be accommodative until the economy is\nonce again generating substantially more than 2 million new jobs per\nyear?\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20060213.cfm[4/29/2014 2:09:23 PM]\n\n\fEconomic Forecasts and Monetary Policy :: February 13, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nAlternatively, if the lower labor-force participation rate is defined as\na supply condition, then it may be driven by younger workers'\ndeferring entry into the labor force - perhaps to obtain more\nschooling and skills. If that is the correct explanation, then potential\nemployment will be calculated much differently from the number we\nsaw in the 1990s. In that case, attempting to spur more rapid job\ngrowth with an accommodative monetary policy is exactly the wrong\nthing to do. It will not accomplish the goal of maximum sustainable\ngrowth in the long run, and it may threaten our goal of price\nstability.\n\nConclusion\nAs economists - whether we work in corporate life, the\nacademic world, or the policymaking realm - we are all in the\nbusiness of economic forecasting, but each of us may approach our\nprofession from a different perspective.\nThe mission of the Federal Reserve leads me to look at economic\ndata - and the very process of economic forecasting - with a different\npurpose, and thus from a somewhat different perspective than simply\nproducing the most accurate GDP forecast. Our motivation for\nforecasting economic conditions begins with our need to shape\nmonetary policy to the evolution of the economy as we work to fulfill\nour dual mandate of price stability and maximum sustainable\ngrowth. For that reason, we look to the supply side as well as the\ndemand side of the economy when evaluating conditions.\nI hope this discussion has helped clarify how I approach my\nresponsibilities as a member - and this year a voting member - of the\nFederal Open Market Committee. Armed with that knowledge, the\nnext time you hear news reports about the FOMC's decisions, I hope\nthat you will have an even deeper understanding of the process I use:\nconsidering not just the \"whats\" that make it into the headlines, but\nthinking about the \"whys\" that I carefully weigh, within policy\ndeliberations, in an effort to maintain price stability and maximum\nsustainable growth.\n\nCareers | Diversity | Privacy | Terms of Use | Contact Us | Feedback | RSS Feeds\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20060213.cfm[4/29/2014 2:09:23 PM]\n\n\f"

So I\nspend a lot of my time thinking about why this country, which for my\nfamily offered hope and possibilities, is now struggling to educate\nmany of our children.\n\nPresident and CEO,\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nConference on Building the Case for\nInvestments in Preschool\nThe Grand Hyatt Hotel, New York, NY\nJanuary 10, 2006\n\nI was intrigued when I saw the agenda and the title of this session:\nWhy Care? The Impact on Industry and Our Economy. It's really quite\na valid question, when you think about it. Why should we care about\ninvestments in early childhood education? I think we all know why\nparents and students should care: we have heard this morning that\nthe individual returns to early childhood investments are large.\nI want to expand on the comments of this morning's speakers, who\ndiscussed the results of research on the costs and benefits of early\nchildhood education. I am not an expert in this area, and I do not\nintend to go over the same ground they have covered. But if the\nbenefits include higher future levels of education and increased\nskills, then as an economist and a Federal Reserve Bank CEO, I can\ntell you some of the broader benefits our nation can achieve from\nmaking those investments.\nThis morning, I will focus on why a successful economic future\nrequires us to do a better job of educating our children. By doing so,\nwe will increase labor force skills and productivity, we will spend\nfewer resources on social programs, and we can sustain better\neconomic policies.\n\nLabor Force Skills and Productivity\nWe have evidence that the benefits of preschool education\naccumulate throughout a child's primary and secondary education.\nHowever, today the United States actually lags many other developed\ncountries in the share of children under age four who are enrolled in\npreschool. We also know that in order to improve our primary and\nsecondary education systems, we will have to find better ways for\nschool administrators, families, teachers, and taxpayers to work\ntogether. The challenges confronting us are large, but not nearly as\ngreat as the cost of failure.\nThe economy in my Federal Reserve district, which includes Ohio,\nwestern Pennsylvania, eastern Kentucky, and a portion of West\nVirginia, has been under-performing the U.S. economy for several\ndecades. We have seen our population, employment, and personal\nincomes grow more slowly than in other areas of the country. Many\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20060110.cfm[4/29/2014 2:09:37 PM]\n\n\fEarly Childhood Education and Our Economic Future :: January 10, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\ndifferent factors are associated with these trends, and our region's\nsituation is by no means unique, but I am increasingly convinced that\neducation plays a prominent role in explaining what has been\noccurring.\nShortly after I became president of the Bank, in 2003, I asked our\nresearch department to take a sharper focus on understanding the\nforces that have been shaping our region's economy. Education was at\nthe top of their list.\nSome businesspeople in my District have been expressing concerns\nabout increasing competition from foreign companies. Political\nleaders worry about jobs moving offshore. In this global economy, I\nbelieve that how we address our education challenges will be a\ndecisive factor in our economic performance. I am not terribly\nworried that our unemployment rate will rise over time as a result of\nnot keeping pace with the educational attainment levels reached in\nother countries. Over the past five decades, the U.S. economy has\nconsistently employed about 95 percent of the people participating in\nthe labor force - and I expect that trend to continue. What is at\nstake is not the number of jobs, but the quality of those jobs - and\nthe compensation earned by the people who fill them.\nEconomic research tells us that productivity and incomes are closely\nrelated at both the regional and national levels. Incomes rise in\nregions and countries as people become more productive. Developing\nnations are replacing subsistence-level employment with jobs that\nenable people to acquire more goods and services, to save a little,\nand perhaps even to enjoy some more leisure time. Opportunities for\nhighly educated people are booming in many developing countries, as\neveryone moves up the development ladder. The United States is not\ncompeting with other countries for a fixed number of global jobs, but\nwe should recognize that our relative standard of living in this global\neconomy will depend, ultimately, on our relative levels of education\nand productivity.\nI am not alone in paying close attention to these connections. My\nfriend and colleague Michael Moskow, who is president of the Federal\nReserve Bank of Chicago, spoke last fall at an education conference\nwe hosted at our Bank. He told us that he is \".constantly tracking\nproductivity growth because it is a key determinant of our standard\nof living. And an important factor driving productivity growth is\nworker quality, which includes the education and the experience of\nthe workforce.\"\nPresident Moskow's team of economists estimates that almost a\nquarter of a percentage point of the average annual growth in labor\nproductivity from 1965 to 2000 can be linked to labor quality. He\nnoted that changes in age, education, and labor force participation\ncause this amount to vary over time, and he expressed some concern\nthat retirements among highly experienced baby boomers could\ndepress our productivity growth rate unless they are offset by\nremaining employees who improve their skills and by new employees\nwho enter the workforce with a high level of skills.\nJust how important is the role of education? At the regional level, we\ncan see tangible evidence of the link from education to productivity\nto income. States that have had the largest growth in per capita\nincomes in the United States over the past half century also tend to\nbe the states that have had the largest increases in educational\nattainment. Numerous studies, including some that we are doing at\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, indicate that educational\nattainment is a key variable in accounting for differences in per\ncapita income growth among either metropolitan areas or states.\nEducational attainment also affects labor force participation and\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20060110.cfm[4/29/2014 2:09:37 PM]\n\n\fEarly Childhood Education and Our Economic Future :: January 10, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nunemployment rates. Today, only about 45 percent of high school\ndropouts are in the labor force, versus nearly 80 percent of college\ngraduates. The unemployment rate of high school dropouts is almost\n8 percent, but for college graduates it is only about 3 percent. So it\nfollows that with greater levels of education, not only will more\npeople be willing to work, but more of them will have jobs, all else\nbeing equal. Not only should we expect those who are working to be\nearning more, but we should expect more people to be working to\ntake advantage of their investment in education. The result will be\nan increase in our nation's sustainable rate of economic growth,\nwhich surely makes our nation stronger.\nThere is also a connection between education, productivity, personal\nincome, and corporate profits. Better-educated and better-prepared\nemployees produce more output at a lower cost, meaning that they\ncan earn higher incomes and that their employers can make higher\nprofits. It's a beautiful thing--both employees and businesses win.\n\nEducation and Social Benefits\nNow I would like to turn to the social benefits of education. This\nmorning's panelists explained that some of the benefits from more\neffective preschool education accrue to the individuals, families, and\ncompanies making the investments, while other benefits accrue to\nthe cities, states, and the nation as a whole through \"spillover\neffects.\" You will notice that so far I have not distinguished between\nthese two channels - the gains in productivity, incomes, and\nemployment that I described could come from a combination of these\nbenefits.\nBut clearly, having higher living standards gives us a greater capacity\nto ease the burden on the less fortunate among us. At the same\ntime, it offers the prospect of reducing the number of people who\nrequire certain kinds of income support in the first place.\nLet me share an example of why this is so important at the national\nlevel. We hear a lot about our nation's growing fiscal imbalance and\nwhat it may mean for future spending on our Medicare, Medicaid,\nand Social Security programs. The trustees of the Social Security\nAdministration periodically produce 75-year projections of the\nSystem's finances. To do this, they must choose a rate of growth for\noutput and incomes to gauge the solvency of the program out into\nthe distant future.\nThe number of retirees per worker is increasing, leading to calls for\nreforms of the Social Security System. In their most recent report,\nthe trustees assume a productivity growth trend of 1.6 percent per\nyear for the intermediate-cost projection. Using this assumption, in\n75 years real output in the economy will grow by a little more than\nthreefold.\nUnfortunately, we cannot estimate our economy's productivity growth\ntrend into the distant future with any great precision. If productivity\ngrowth were to average 2.25 percent per year, we would see output\nand incomes not threefold, but fivefold greater after 75 years.\nImproving our productivity from 1.6 percent to 2.25 percent would\nadd additional resources to our economy each and every year into\nthe future, and result in a very large increase in our national living\nstandard.\nA more productive labor force would be able to contribute more\ntaxes and perhaps would require fewer public benefits as well. At the\nsame time, if more people were working and fewer of them were\nunemployed, then fewer resources would be needed to pay for our\nstate and federal unemployment insurance programs. As a result, the\ntaxes imposed on businesses and workers to pay for this insurance\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20060110.cfm[4/29/2014 2:09:37 PM]\n\n\fEarly Childhood Education and Our Economic Future :: January 10, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\ncould be lower. Similarly, some of the resources that we now devote\nto remedial education or fighting things like crime and drug abuse\ncould be either rebated to taxpayers or channeled in other\ndirections.\n\nEducation and Better Economic Policy\nFinally, I would like to make a few comments about how a bettereducated population can help us achieve better economic policies.\nEven though I have just outlined how higher skill levels in our labor\nforce can improve economic growth over time, all may be lost if our\nnation's economic policies are not designed and implemented to\nachieve sustainable long-run growth.\nOften, decisions that appear unpopular in the short run are exactly\nthe policies we need for the long-run health of the economy. I find\nthat to be very true in my role as a policymaker on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee. When I meet with businesspeople, I sometimes\nhear comments to the effect that rising interest rates are\ninflationary, since they add to borrowing costs. But the fact is that\nshort-term actions by the Federal Open Market Committee are\nsometimes essential to producing longer-term price stability.\nAppropriate policy moves today can bring about moderate long-term\ninterest rates and maximum economic growth for the long run.\nMany other economic policies - such as tax policies, trade\nagreements, regulatory policies and government spending initiatives affect the performance of our national economy over time. I could\ngive you countless examples of policies that appear to provide short­\nterm benefits to our economy, but in fact could have negative\nconsequences over the long haul.\nThe Federal Reserve also confronts the consequences of adult\nilliteracy, especially financial illiteracy, in its capacity as a regulator.\nWe know that our financial system can be daunting even for highly\neducated and market-savvy individuals, let alone those with less\neducation and experience with financial transactions. We see the\nconsequences of poorly educated consumers every day when we see\nthe numbers of people who have poor credit ratings, who have filed\nfor bankruptcy, and who may have lost their homes to predatory\nlenders. The private and public costs of dealing with these\nunfortunate outcomes are considerable. So, just as better educated\npeople can make our workforce more productive, they also can make\nfor smarter consumers and savers.\n\nConclusion\nI hope that I have given you some insights this morning into how a\nmore educated population and more highly skilled labor force can lift\nour nation's economic performance over time.\nWe all should care about this issue, and I am convinced that it begins\nwith early childhood education. If we can reach children early and\nhelp them value educational attainment, we can accomplish some\nincredible things:\n• We can raise levels of employment, productivity and incomes;\n• We can reduce the fiscal burden associated with programs such as\nSocial Security and unemployment insurance; and\n• We can promote public understanding and support for policies that\nbenefit all of us over the long run.\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20060110.cfm[4/29/2014 2:09:37 PM]\n\n\fEarly Childhood Education and Our Economic Future :: January 10, 2006 :: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nYes, there are good reasons to be excited about the many benefits to\nour country that can come from investing more resources in\npreschool education and early child care. I know that we will be\nhearing from some speakers later in the program about how to\nchannel this enthusiasm into action.\nWithout tempering that enthusiasm, I do feel compelled to say that\nas an economist and a CEO, I know that investments in human\ncapital, just like investments in physical capital, can be made wisely\nor poorly. We have a lot to learn about how to do this right, so it\nwill be important to collect data and support good program analysis\nas we move forward.\nI also know that investments at the early childhood level will not, by\nthemselves, be sufficient to build the kind of educated population\nour economy needs today and in the future. In the language of\nbusiness, this means that we need to strengthen the entire supply\nchain. Those of you who are in business know that a quality product\nbegins with a quality process, and that it costs much more to fix\ndefects in the later stages of product assembly than doing it right at\nthe outset. Prudent investments in the early stages have the\npotential for paying a stream of dividends for all of us well into the\nfuture.\nIn the case of early childhood education, these investments hold the\npromise of narrowing some of the skill gaps that we see in our\nsociety today, creating higher employment levels, and helping us\nachieve better economic policies.\n\nCareers | Diversity | Privacy | Terms of Use | Contact Us | Feedback | RSS Feeds\n\nhttp://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2006/Pianalto_20060110.cfm[4/29/2014 2:09:37 PM]\n\n\f"
