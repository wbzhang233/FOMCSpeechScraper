A lot has happened since we conv ened  last November , \nincluding the widespread distribution of vaccines  and a further reopening of the economy . The \nvirus continues its disruptive presence, though to lesser degree.  For the economy, the key \ndevelopment has been  a seemingly  abrupt transition  from a  world  of demand shortfalls to one of  \nsupply constraints . Surging demand over the course of 2021, supported by aggressive fisca l \npolicy and accommodative monetary policy, has pushed on a supply side that continues to suffer  \npandemic -related disruptions .  \nThe combination of resurgent demand and constrained supply has pushed up prices , both \nin energy markets and in the broader economy.  The price of oil has doubled over the past year, \nwith WTI increasing from about $40 a barrel  to over $80 a barrel, while domestic natural gas \nprices have risen almost 150 percent.  Aggregate inflation also has picked up significantly , rising \nto 4.4 percent over the 12 months ending in September, the fastest pace in over 30 years and \nconsiderably higher than the 1.1 percent rate recorded last November . While higher  energy \nprices have  contributed to this increase, when its impact is excluded,  inflation still remains \nelevated at 3.7 percent.       \nWith increasing prices dominating headlines, the central question confronting economic \nforecasters  and policymakers  at the Fed  is just how long  this elevated inflation  will persist . The \nanswer to this question depends  fundamentally on how long the current tightness in the economy \ncontinues, and, in turn, the outlook for both supply and demand.  While movements in energy \nprices are frequently attributed to  supply developments, the importance of supply fo r broader \nprice mo vements had been increasingly called into question prior to the pandemic . A long period \nof lackluster demand growth following the 2008 financial crisis  accompanied by muted inflation  \nhad taken some emphasis off the role of supply constraints in determining  the level  of inflation . \nJust prior to the pandemic, the importance of th e relationship between supply and inflation had \nreached a low point . After decades of viewing the relationship between the unemployment rate \nand inflation  (summarized by the Phillips Curve ) as a central constraint on  how hot the economy \ncould run without  sparking inflation , many questioned the continued relevance of this constraint .   \n Today, I  would like to briefly touch on the price dynamics  in both energy markets and \nthe overall economy before considering what lessons the energy market might provide for the \n\n2 \n consideration of price dynamics in the overall economy, and then end with some thoughts on the \noutlook for monetary policy.  \n \nRecent Developments  \nAcross a variety of energy commodities, d evelopments in both supply and demand have \nled to rapid price increases . For oil, a reopening economy has pushed up demand,  with global oil \nconsumption rapidly returning to  pre-pandemic levels , significantly  lifting  crude  prices. Despite \nhigher prices, U.S. oil producers appear wary to ramp up production on the heels of  the collapse \nin prices early in the pandemic.  OPEC has also shown restraint , sticking to previously agreed \nproduction quotas,  even as prices have cli mbed.  The price moves for natural gas have been even \nmore dramatic, especially in Europe, where low inventories  coming off a n especially cold winter \nlast year and weak renewable production during the summer coupled with resurgent demand—in \npart as climate considerations shifted electric al generation away from coal —ha ve led to surging  \nprices .   \nLikewise , we see  the interaction of demand and supply  dynamics creating price pressures \nin the broader  economy . Fiscal transfers in the United States  have supported incomes and \nspending . This has been particularly true for goods , as the pandemic led consumers to rotate \nconsumption from in-person services towards purchases for their homes.  Strong demand has led \nto a remarkable increase in prices for durable goods, which rose  over 7 percent in the previous  12 \nmonths following 25 years of consistent price declines.   \nSupply disruptions  have also contributed to the rise in prices . Notably, shortages of \nsemiconductors have constrained output  in a number of industries, including automobiles.  \nSnarled global supply chains have pushed up shipping costs and disrupted the production of a \nwide variety of goods.  Supplier delivery times have slowed dramatically, not only for \nmanufacturers but also for service providers , in part as  shipping times from Asia to the West \nCoast have doubled, and transit costs have skyrocketed.  The number of ships waiting to unload \nat Long Beach has become a commonl y cited economic indicator.  Inventories have been \ndepleted, with the retail inventory -to-sales ratio running 30 percent below its historic averag e and \nat all-time low s.   \nThere are also widespread reports that a lack of available labor is  curtailing production in \nmany industries, contributing to kinks in the supply chain and pushing up prices.  A number of \n\n3 \n indicators point towards a tight labor market.  Reported unfilled job openings are at  record levels, \nwhile the rate at which workers are q uitting their jobs, a typical sign of a tight labor market, is at \nan all -time high.  Wage growth has also accelerated, particularly for lower -income hourly \nworkers.  \nIt is important to note that the tightness in the labor market could prove temporary as a \nsizable number of people , about 5 million,  remain  out of work relative to before the pandemic . \nThese workers are roughly split between those reporting being unemployed and those who report \nno longer being in the labor force.  Non-college educated women with children represent a large \nportion of those that have dropped out of the labor force, suggesting that disruptions to childcare \nremain a barrier to work for many.  In particular, daycare capacity appears to have fallen 10 \npercent relative to pre-pandemi c levels.  A full recovery of the labor market appears unlikely until \nchildcare normalizes.    \n \nLessons from Energy Markets for the Broader Economy  \nWith the broad economy running into supply constraints to an extent that we have not  \nwitnessed  for some time , judging the outlook can be particularly challenging. Looking to the \nexperience of energy markets, where supply developments have long been an important \ncomponent of price fluctuations , we see several lessons that may inform today’s experience .  \nOne lesson from the history of oil price movements  is that it can be very difficult to \ndisentangle the role of supply versus  demand.  Prices are determined by the intersection of supply \nand demand, and the price impact of any particular supply disruption will depend i mportantly on \nthe underlying strength of demand.  The sharp fall in oil prices in 2014 occurred against the \nbackdrop of both a rapid increase in supply associated with the growth of U.S. shale oil \nproduction and relatively weak growth in oil demand as the g lobal economy continued its slow \nrecovery from the financial crisis.  These two factors interacted to cut the price of WTI in half, \nfrom over $100 a barrel to around $50 a barrel, over the second half of 2014.    \nAnother lesson from oil markets is that  precautionary motives are an important \ndeterminant of current demand  and prices . News of an actual or perceived supply shortfall can \nlead to a  desire to increase stockpiles , amplifying the price increase from any given supply \ndisruption.  For example, t he OPEC  shocks of the 1970s led to an increase in demand for  oil \ninventories (and full gas tanks) which then help ed maintain higher prices.  Similarly, in the \n\n4 \n broader economy I am hearing anecdotes  of firms responding to t oday’s supply challenges by \nover-ordering and accumulating precautionary inventories of the necessary inputs to  production, \nincluding semiconductors  and steel. As firms attempt to shore up their supply chains and move  \naway  from a just -in-time production mo del, the incentive to carry higher inventories could \nfurther support prices  across a broad variety of goods .  \n \nLessons for Monetary Policy \nThis history of energy price movements has informed t he conduct of monetary policy.  In \nparticular, energy price shocks have played a key role in developing the thinking around how \nmonetary policy should respond to elevated inflation, particularly inflation that appears to arise from supply developments.  The oil price shocks in the 1970s, the run up in oil prices in the mid-\n2000s , and the collapse in prices in 2014  all provide context for how monetary policy should \nrespond to inflation  developments  with an important supply component.  In particular , experience \nwith energy prices has largely formed the basis for  argumen ts that monetary policy should not \nreact to increases in overall inflation driven primarily by supply developments . I would \ncharacterize these  argument s along two  related  lines.  First, monetary policy should look through \ntemporar y increases in inflation.  Second, monetary policy should not respond aggressively to \nincreases in inflation resulting from a shift in  relative pric es.  \nAlong the first dimension, given that it takes some time for changes in the stance of \nmonetary policy to affect inflation , it is often argued that policymakers should look through \ntemporary changes in inflation.  It is this argument that led to the creation and widespread usage \nof measures of core inflation that exclude energy and food prices. Given the frequ ency of \ntemporary shocks to energy and commodity price inflation  that are  often attributed to supply, \ncore inflation is likely to offer  a better measure of underlying or trend inflation and thus is \nthought to provide an important guide to monetary policy.  This argument was prevalent in 2014 \nand 2015 when a sharp decline in oil prices pulled down overall inflation, and the Federal \nReserve at the time argued that policy should look through this decline on  the assumption that \nthe dip was temporary.    \n\n5 \n Second, there is a large literature suggesting that monetary policy should not respond \naggressively to changes in  relative price s.1 The logic is that relative prices serve as important \nsignals that help to reallocate economic resources to  sector s that are relatively tight from sector s \nthat ha ve excess slack.  Of course, t his reallocation could be achieved  with offsetting  changes in \nprices, an increase in prices in the tight sector s and a decrease in prices in slack sector s, which, in \ntheory,  could leave overall inflation about unchanged.  However, in reality , firms in slack sector s \nhave often found that  cutting prices, and particularly wages, is  difficult.  Thus, with incomplete \nadjustment in slack sector s, relative price changes often end up push ing up overall inflation.  \nTheory suggests it is better for policymakers to accept this increase in inflation, which should be \ntemporary, than to tighten policy and restrict overall activity in an effort to force offsetting price \ndeclines in shrinking sector s. This argument was  frequently made in the mid -2000s as oil prices \nrose steadily  and lifted overall inflatio n, due to perceived shifts in supply and demand in the oil \nsector . Even as higher oil prices contributed to higher overall inflation, it was argued that \npolicymakers should look through this temporary increase in inflation rather than force adjustment s on other sectors of the economy .  \n \nThe Outlook for Monetary Policy \nHow might these lessons apply today?  The timeframe for resolving bottlenecks and the \nscope of categories reflecting price pressures make the answer to this question less than straightforward.   \nDisruptions that  initially appeared to be temporary bottlenecks driving up prices  now \nlook as if they may  be more long -lasting , with widespread reports suggesting that supply chains \nwill not recover until well into 2022.  Additionally , while in the spring the increase in prices was \nbeing driven by select categories  of goods and services,  more recently the increase in prices has \nbecome generalized , and is apparent across a b road swath of the economy . Through May, both \nthe pe rcent of consumer expenditures showing large increases in prices and the percent of \nexpenditures showing large decreases in prices were historically elevated.  However, in recent \nmonths, price s that had been depressed by the pandemic, including hotel accomm odations and \nairfares , have rebound ed, even as prices for goods that have seen price spikes —for example used \n \n1 Including a paper presented at this year’s Jackson Hole Symposium.  Monetary Policy in Times of Structural \nReallocation (kansascityfed.org)  \n\n6 \n cars, appliances, and furniture —remain elevated.  As a consequence, currently 50 percent of  an \naverage household’s expenditure basket is now experiencing unusually higher prices .  \nAs supply chains heal and demand eases, there is reason to expect  inflation will \neventually moderate, but it is also clear that the risk  of a prolonged period of elevated inflati on \nhas increased . The argument for patience in the face of  these inflation pressures has  diminish ed.  \nThis week , the F ederal Reserve started the process of normalizing the stance of monetary \npolicy by announcing its intention to end asset purchases.  The Committee plans to decrease the \npace at which it is purchasing Treasury securities by $10 billion a month and  agency mortgage -\nbacked securities by $5 billion a month, laying out a trajectory for ending these purchases by the \nmiddle of next year.     \nIt is important to note that w hile the pace of asset purchases  is slowing , the cumulative \neffect of these purchases is arguably the more subst antive force acting on the economy. Since \nMarch of last year, the Federal Reserve has purchased more than $4 trillion of securities, pushing \nour total asset holdings to $8.5 trillion dollars. These asset holdings are depressing longer -term \ninterest rates m ost relevant for households and businesses and thereby are providing a significant \namount of accommodation. And, importantly, this accommodation will persist even when tapering is complete.  \nAs the adjustment of asset purchases gets underway, the focus of attention will naturally \nshift to the path of the policy rate. Since last December, the Committee has stated that it expects to keep the policy rate near zero until the labor market has reached levels consistent with \nmaximum employment and inflation has ri sen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed \n2 percent for some time.  \nTaken together, monetary policy remains highly accommodative in an economy where \ninflation is elevated  and labor markets have yet to fully recover. With both supply and demand \nfactors clearly at play , the choices for policymakers will be complicated as uncertainty remains \nhigh for how temporary or persist ent these frictions will prove to be. \nIn most circum stances , the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate objectives  for maximum \nemployment and stable prices are in alignment, so that the Fed’s policy actions support both objectives simultaneously.  There are however times when the objectives can appear to be in \nconfl ict. And now might be one of those times  with inflation running well ahead of its longer -run \naverage and labor markets appearing to have further room to recover . While the current \n\n7 \n economic alignment certainly adds complexity for policymakers , ending asset purchases is an \nimportant first step along the path to policy normalization  as we balance our long -run objectives \nand seek to promote sustainable growth and financial stability.",

        "content": "The Long Return to Normal  \n \n \nRemarks by  \nEsther L. George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \nSeptember 24, 2021  \nAmerican Enterprise Institute  \nRemarks delivered virtually  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve \nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives . \n\n1 \n Thank you,  Steve , for the invitation to participate in this forum.  I look forward to this \nmorning’s conversation  with your panelists . \nWhen the pandemic took hold and widespread  shutdown s were adopted in the spring of \n2020,  it was immediately apparent that the hit to economic activity would be enormous . Less \ncertain  was ho w long the shock would persist.  Many workplaces sent staff home  with the \nassumption that things would return to normal within a few weeks . Now a year -and-a-half later, \nnormal remains on the horizon.  With the 2020 recession being both the deepest and shortest on \nrecord, the  economy has bounced back sharply, while the return to normal continues to be the \nkey dynamic shaping  the economic outlook.  \nIn discussing the shocks to which the economy is now adjusting , I would include both the \nclosures and disrupt ions associated with the pandemic as well as the enormous fiscal and \nmonetary policy response that followed.  The pandemic shock disrupted the pattern of  \nconsumption  by favoring goods over services . It also disrupted production, introducing frictions \nin labor markets and scrambling global supply chains.  The policy response led to a spike in  \nhousehold savings —as fiscal deficits funded transfer payments —and to a doubling of the Fed’s \nbalance sheet.   \nIn many cases , these shocks —the pandemic and the policy reaction —were offsetting as \nevidenced by the rapid recovery of output and employment.  However, in other cases, the \npandemic and the policy response conspired to  push the economy away from its equilibrium, \ndisrupting long-run trends.  For example, the ratio of goods consumption to services consumption \nis now far above  its long -run historical trend.  Similarly, the household saving rate jumped to an \nall-time high  early in the pandemic, and, although it has come down, rema ins considerably above \nits average in recent decades.  In both these examples, as well as others, i t is reasonable to expect \nthat historical patterns will reemerge, with consequence s for demand, employment, and prices.  \nAs both the pandemic and the policy re sponse fade, the pull toward normal will shape the \noutlook.   \nThat said, while I am comfortable suggesting that the economy  has not returned to \nnormal , I would not be comfortable suggesting that  I know what normal will end up looking like . \n“Normal” is likely to be elusive for some time.  The pandemic was a tremendous disruption  that \nhas affected every aspect of how  and where people work, where they live, and what activities \nthey engage in . Some of the changes coming out of the pandemic will persist  and alter the \n\n2 \n structure of the economy.  Of course, separating transitory from persistent is one of the central \nchallenges of economic policymaking.   \nIt might seem odd to be discussing a return to normal when the Delta variant has pushed \nnew infections  uncomfor tably close to all-time highs . However, m y sense is that , \nnotwithstanding the tragic human toll, the primary effect of the Delta variant will be to prolong \nthe return to normal, rather than upend the process altogether.  \nIn the rem ainder of my time , I would like to discuss some of the key normalization \ndynamics I will be watching in the economy.  Overall, I view these dynamics  as support ing a \ncontinued strong recovery and further gains in employment, while simultaneously relieving some  \n(though not all ) of the price pressures that have elevated inflation in recent months.  I will then \nturn to  the outlook for monetary policy, including some thoughts on what policy normalization \nmight look like, and how the decisions of the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) might \nshape that process . \n \nThe Economic Outlook  \nOne dynamic  likely to shape the outlook is the reemergence of long -standing patterns of \nconsumption, particularly spending on goods relative to services.  With the onset of the \npandemic, r estrictions and consumer caution led to sharp decline s in the consumption of contact -\nintensive services , such as hotel accommodations , concerts, and restaurants , even as homebound \nconsumers ramped up spending on goods . Though services remain a far larger component of \nconsumption than goods, their relative share has declined.  For example, in the second quarter , \nconsumers purchased $1.80  of services for every $1 of goods, far less than the $2. 20 they spent \non average in the years leading up to the pandemic. Over time as the pandemic’s grip wanes , I \nexpect old patterns to re emerge as audiences return to theaters, conferencegoers resume travel, \nand the Jackson Hole Symposium returns to Jackson Hole , for example . This return to normal \nwill pivot c onsumption back towards services and away from goods.   \n The rotation towards services  consumption  will be important for  further improvements in \nthe labor market.  Service sector jobs, primarily in leisure and hospitality and health, represent the \noverwhelmi ng majority of the over 5 million jobs that have yet to return following the dramatic \nloss of jobs in March and April of last year . I expect a return of services consumption to lead to \nfurther strong job gains, with the caveat that the Delta variant could delay this rebound.     \n\n3 \n A pivot towards services will also take some pressure off the red-hot goods market.  \nStrong demand for durable goods, exacerbated by supply chain difficulties, has been an \nimportant contributor to the overall rise in inflation. Over the past year, durable goods prices \nhave increased 7 percent, the first sustain ed break in an over 20-year trend of declining prices.  \nAutomobiles, both new and used, have been an important part of this increase, but the prices for other goods, such as household appliances and recreational equipment have also moved up \nsharply.  As consumption rotates from goods to services, some of the pre ssure should ease for \noverstretched goods demand, even as services growth continues to support the overall recovery \nin the economy.  \nAlthough I expect an easing in the demand for goods , and a loosening of bottlenecks , to \nrelieve some of the pres sure on prices,  the data offer a note of caution . In particular, recent \nmonths have seen a rebound in previously depressed services prices even as goods prices remain \nelevated.  For example, prices for hotel accommodations  in the  index of personal consumption \nexpenditures (PCE)  are now  9 percent above pre -pandemic levels, even as spending on hotel \nrooms remains  16 percent below  where it was prior to the pandemic.  Earlier  this year, PCE \ninflation was recording record levels of dispersion across categories  of consumption . For \nexample, in February , categories representing 16 percent of PCE expenditure s were reporting \ninflation far in excess of average, mostly goods, whereas 26 percent of expenditures recorded \nextraordinar ily low inflation, mostly services.\n1 By June, the percent of expenditures with well-\nbelow average inflation had fallen to 5 percent, while 51 percent of expenditures recorded  price \nincreases far above recent  trend . This is to say, that a shift in demand towards services could help \nease inflation pressures, but that a sustained step down in inflation is likely to also require a \nstabilization in services prices.  \nWhy are prices for some services increasing rapidly even as demand remains weak ? \nSpeaking to contacts in my district, a common explanation is th e lack of available labor.  Without \nworkers, supply is curtailed and prices rise.  The labor shortage has developed as over 5 million \nfewer people are employed relative to before the pandemic.  In large part , the current tightness of \nlabor markets reflects a dramatic decline in labor force participation that developed at the start of \nthe pandemic and has shown  little improvement since.  Despite the persistence of the decline in \nlabor force participation, I believe the pandemic shock remains behind a large part of th e decline, \n \n1 Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco | PCE Inflation Dispersion (frbsf.org)  \n\n4 \n with a high likelihood of workers returning as pandemic -induced frictions , including concern \nover the safety of returning to work as well as disruptions to childcare arrangements,  continue to \nease.   \nThe pandemic shock has led  many women to leave the labor force, disproportionately  \nwomen of color without college degrees .2 The absence of these workers from the labor force is \ncontributing to labor shortages in some services industries.  Difficulty in obtaining child -care \nlikely explains some of the decline in participation.  Tellingly, employment in daycare centers \nremains 10 percent below pre -pand emic levels, suggesting that capacity in this important \nindustry remains impaired.  As the pandemic fades, a normalization of childcare could bring these \nworkers back into the workforce, supporting growth, increasing employment, and alleviating \nsome of the labor shortages that could be contributing to price increases.   \nAnother dynamic contributing to the fall in labor force participation has been an increase \nin the proportion of the population  reporting being retired.  Interestingly, research by staff at  the \nKansas City Fed has shown that the rise in reported retirement does not reflect an increase in the \ntransition of workers into retirement, but rather a sharp decrease in the typical flow of retirees \nback into the workforce.3 Before  the pandemic, every mont h a substantial number of retirees \nreported returning to work.  It is possible increased health concerns during the pandemic \ndisrupted this flow.  Here again , as the pandemic fades , it might be reasonable for this flow to \nonce again reemerge, adding workers to the labor force and further alleviating worker shortages.    \nAll in all, my expectation is that a return to  historical patterns of consumption, with a \nrenewed emphasis on servic es, and a recovery in labor force participation, with the return of \nchildcare and decreased health concerns , will contribute  to an outlook for continued growth,  \nless-binding constraints , and moderating inflation.   \nThere are risks around this outlook, including the continued presence of the pandemic. \nImportantly, the effects  of the upsurge in new cases  could be as pronounced for  supply as  for \ndemand, prolonging the tightness of the economy and maintaining upward pressure on prices. Renewed concern over the virus could impede the recovery in services consumption such that \ndemand remains directed towards sectors of the economy that are near capacity and away from \n \n2 Women without a College Degree, Especially Minori ty Mothers, Face a Steeper Road to Recovery \n(kansascityfed.org)  \n3 What Has Driven the Recent Increase in Retirements? -  Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City (kansascityfed.org)  \n\n5 \n those sectors that have available slack . The surge in the virus could also delay the normalization \nof the labor market, particularly if schooling and childcare are  once again disrupted.  \nAside from the economic threats associated with th e pandemic,  the high level of \nhousehold savings  contributes an additional element of uncertainty to the outlook . Estimates \nsuggest  that the stockpile of household saving s has increased by close to $2.5 trillion.  Of course, \nhealthy household balance sheets are positive for the economy, and , if the  savings  are spent out \nover time,  this spending could support steady economic growth for some time . However, if \nhouseholds instead choose to spend rapidly, a rush  of demand could keep the economy at \ncapacity, reinfo rcing bottlenecks and putting continued upward pressure on prices.  Households \nhave a lot of firepower, and if and how quickly they choose to spend will be an important factor \nin how tight the economy remains.  Of course, whether consumers choose to spend or  save is a \ndecision directly impacted by monetary policy, so the speed at which any excess household \nsaving is spent down is not independent of our policy decisions.   \n \nThe Outlook for Monetary Policy \nSince last December, t he Committee has stated that it expects to keep the policy rate near \nzero until the labor market has reached levels consistent with maximum employment and \ninflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. The \nFOMC also expects to maintain its purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities until \nsubstantial further progress has been made towards these employment and inflation goals.   \nIn my view , the criteria for  substantial further progress ha ve been met , with inflation \nrunning well above our target and the unemployment rate at 5.2  percent , down 1½ percentage \npoints relative to December.  Under these conditions, the rationale for continuing to add to our \nasset holdings each month has waned , and signaling  that we will soon consider bringing our  asset \npurchases to an end is appropriate .  \nWhile recent public focus has been on the timeline for tapering asset purchases, the \ncumulative effect of these purchases is arguably the more substantive force acting on the \neconomy. Since March of l ast year, the Federal Reserve has purchased more than $4 trillion of  \nsecurities, pushing our total asset holdings to nearly $8.5 trillion dollars. These asset holdings are depressing longer -term interest rates most relevant for households and businesses an d thereby are \n\n6 \n providing a significant amount of accommodation. And, importantly, this accommodation will \npersist even when tapering is complete.  \nAs the adjustment of our asset purchases get s underway, the focus of attention will \nnaturally shift to the path of the policy rate . The ongoing effects of these asset  purchases , \nalongside  the presence of both upside and downside risks, will complicate the task of judging the \nachievement of criteria for raising rates. One might argue that today’s inflation dynam ics are \nlikely to keep inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time and align with the \nCommittee’s threshold criteria. On the other hand, the criteria for judging maximum employment \nare murkier.  \nWhile it is clear that we remain far from the historic low levels of unemployment \nachieved pre-pandemic, it is less clear to me that such a benchmark will be the best guidepost in \nthe current expansion . As I discussed, t he pandemic introduced a number of frictio ns into the \nlabor market.  Barring further intensification of the virus, I would expect these frictions to fade, \npromoting strong job gains and a relatively fast approach to maximum employment.  However, I \nam open to the possibility that the pandemic has res ulted in a number of structural changes in  the \nlabor market.  These changes could affect the  assessment of maximum employment in ways that \nare not yet clear.   \n \nPolicy Normalization  \nBeyond interpreting the evolving economic landscape, policymakers also must consider \nthe implications of the multiple policy tools at play as we contemplate removing policy \naccommodation.  While the shift from extraordinary policy accommodation to policy \nnormalization remains some way off, the linkages between balance sheet policies and the path for policy rates  will be factors in future policy deliberations . All else equal, maintaining a la rger \n“normal” balance sheet should imply a higher “normal” terminal policy rate, as higher policy \nrates are needed to offset the stimulative effect of the balance sheet’s continued downward \npressure on longer -term interest rates .  \nGiven the likely trade -offs between the policy rate and the size and composition of the \nbalance sheet as policy shifts towards equilibrium, several factors could affect policymakers’ \ndecisions.  For example, o ne question that might be consider ed is where al ong the yield curve \nwould we prefer the most policy space:  at the long -end or at the short -end?  If the zero lower \n\n7 \n bound is thought to be a costly constraint on policy, there might be an advantage in pushing \ntowards a higher neutral policy rate, arguing for  maintaining a relatively large balance sheet \nweighted towards longer -maturity assets.  The accommodation provided by our balance sheet in \nthis case will have to be offset by higher policy rates, which in turn would provide us with more \nspace to cut rates i n a downturn.  \nWe might also want to consider the rationale for a smaller balance sheet, or at least \nshifting toward one with shorter -maturity assets, with a lower neutral policy rate.  One rationale \nmight be a desire to decrease our footprint in financial markets.  Another is that we might be \nconcerned about the slope of the yield curve.  Raising rates while maintaining a large, long -\nmaturity balance sheet is a recipe for inverting the yield curve, with potential negative effects  for \ntraditional ban king models.  Commentators often discount the effect of an inverted yield curve on \nbanks, arguing that net interest margins are only weakly correlated with bank profitability.  While \nthis might be true for the largest banks , it is not true for small banks.  An inverted yield curve is a \nparticular headwind for community banks, promoting further consolidation in the sector and \nundermining the critical role that community banks provide in terms of local access to credit and \neconomic development.  \nAs the  economy re covers from this pandemic shock, its path is likely to confound our \nassumptions about what a return to normal might look like.

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAugust 11, 2021 \n18\nth Annual Economic Measurement Seminar  \nNational Association for Business Economics  \nRemarks delivered virtually  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve \nSystem, its governors, officers or repre sentatives . \n\n1 \n Thank you for inviting me to participate in this year’s Economic Measurement S eminar .  \nAs you well know, m easurement and data are central to  monetary policy making.  Data are the \nvocabulary that policymakers use to build  the narratives that are essential for  making sense of the \neconomy and  for explain ing policy decisions . Data alone cannot tell the story, but the story \ncertainly depends on data.  Consequently, the same data can often underpin widely divergent \neconomic narratives.  As a policymaker, those narratives are shaped not only by an assessment of \nthe data, but also by experiences . Wisdom and the humility to adjust a narrative is essential, \nespecially when  the data make the story increasingly difficult to  tell.  \nToday I would like to look at the data and narratives as they relate to  a particular question \nwith important implications for monetary policy: Is the e conomy tight or slack ? The strength of \ndemand and the ability of supply to meet that demand have been significantly impacted by the \npandemic and the related policy response.  As I talk to contacts in the Kansas City Fed ’s region , I \noften hear anecdotes that suggest an economy that  has run into constraints, including reports of \nthe difficulty in finding workers and of having to pay much higher prices for materials and \ntransportation.  These stories are confirmed by the data, with a record number of unfilled job \nopenings  and sharply higher prices for many commodities.  At the same time, almost 6 million \nfewer individuals are working now relative to before the pandemi c. This suggest s that there \nremains  considerable slack in the labor market .  \nSo, is the economy tight or slack ? Prices are telling in making this assessment.  An \neconomy operating near or at its productive capacity is likely to display higher prices.  On the \nother hand, slack implies under -utilized resources, such that higher demand can be met without \nincreased prices.    \nIn my remarks today, I’ll explore  some of the  factors that are currently contributing to a \ntight economy, which is lifting inflation . While there is good reason to think that many of the \nfactors boosting demand and restraining supply will fade over time , the extraordinary events of \nthe global pandemic make this unfolding narrative a complex one , not the least as the course of \nthe virus r emains uncertain . Importantly, p olicymakers must consider not only near -term but also \nlong-run implications of their policy choices and be prepared to adjust as the economy evolve s.  \n   \n\n2 \n A tight economy \nYou don’t have to look hard to spot signs of an economy that has run into constraints.  \nBusiness surveys are reporting a record number of  job openings . In addition, w orkers are quitting \njobs at a record pace, typically a  sign of a hot  labor  market when alternative opportunities  are \nplentiful.  Not surprisingly , many firms are reporting raising wages or expect ing that they will be \nraising wages  soon.   \nStrong demand and limited supply are  also apparent in depleted inventories.  The \ninventory-to -sales ratio for retailers is at a record low and far below historical norms.  The run -\ndown in inventories has been particularly notable in the automotive sector, where the days ’ \nsupply of available vehicles for sale, at just under 30 days, is less than half its typical level.   \nTight supply and high demand  are behind the recent increase in price inflation.  Prices, as \nmeasured by the consumer price index  (CPI), increased 5.4  percent over the 12 months ending in \nJuly, matching June’s increase and remaining at the fastest pace of increase in over a decade.  To \nbe sure , some of the increase in prices simply  reflects a reversal of price declines recorded earlier \nin the pandemic , particularly  for service categories like airfares and hotels . But the normalization \nof some prices is not the whole story.  Other prices have moved far above pre-pandemic levels.  \nThe sharp increase in car prices has been w idely  reported, not just as it relates to new cars but \nalso used cars and even rental cars.  Indeed, durable goods more generally have experienced large \nincreases  in prices, sometimes at the fastest pace in decades . Outside of consumer prices, there’s \nalso been a sharp rise in commodity prices and transportation costs.  \nBased on this evidence, the economy shows clear signs of tightness.  An important \nquestion is : Will this tightness persist with implications for the path of monetary policy ?  \n \nThe evolution of factors contributing to a tight economy  \nWhether the economy is temporarily tight or more persistently tight will depend on the \nevolution of the dynamics affecting both supply and demand . Currently , demand is exceptionally \nstrong, boosted by expansive fiscal policy and low interest rates.  It is also unbalanced, favoring \nthe consumption of a  subset of goods.  Supply is constrained by frictions in the labor market and \nproduction bottlenecks  resulting from kinks in global supply chains.  \nThere is reason to believe that some of the drivers  boosting demand and constraining \nsupply will fade over time . In particular , I anticipate four factors that could introduc e slack into \n\n3 \n what is now a tight economy.  After discussing these factors, I will turn to a few of the risks \naround this outlook, including the possibility of economic disruptions related to the Delta \nvariant.   \nFirst, notwithstanding the upswing in the virus, I expect to see the continued rotation of \nconsumption from goods to services . More than a year ago , many consumers were forced to \navoid contact -intensive services, such as hotel accommodations , concerts, and amusement parks, \nas well as visits to doctors, dentists, and hair stylists.  Stuck at home, c onsumers rotated their \nconsumption towards goods, often ordered online.  This led to a very uneven pattern of demand.  \nAt the end of the first quarter of this year , services consumption was 5  percent below pre-\npandemic levels , while  the consumption of durable goods was a remarkable 34 percent higher on \nthe same basis.   \nThis unexpected shift in demand towards a subset of  consumption goods has been behind \nsome of the observed tightness in the economy.  For example, purchases of household appliances  \nin the second quarter , including refrigerators and washing machines,  were running 12 percent \nabove the level at the start of 2020 , in part as the pandemic set off a wave of  home  remodeling . \nReports of long delivery delays proliferated  as demand ran up against supply constraints . Not \nsurprisingly,  prices for major household  appliances have surged, increasing 14 percent in the 12 \nmonths to June.   \nWith the advent of widespread vaccination and a lessening of pandemic disruptions \nthrough the spring , services consumption has picked up , and goods consumption has stepped \ndown.  Still, services consumption remain s depressed  relative to previous levels,  suggesting \nfurther room to grow.  As consumption rotates from goods to services, some of the pressure \nshould ease for ove rstretched goods demand, perhaps allowing inventories to rebuild, even as \nservices growth continues to support the overall recovery in the economy.   \nA second factor  is the likelihood that the growth of overall demand will moderate  as \ngovernment supports fade.  The tremendous amount of fiscal stimulus provided to the economy \nsince the start of the pandemic, on the order of $ 6 trillion,  has been essential in supporting \neconomic activity.  However, much of this stimulus has already been distributed,  with the last \nchecks to households going out at the end of March and the Paycheck Protection Program for small business es closing to new applicants at the end of June.  Thus,  the peak boost to growth \nfrom fiscal policy has likely passed . Some estimates show that fiscal policy,  after adding almost \n\n4 \n 4 percentage points to growt h last year,  will subtract about 2 percentage points from growth over \nthe next few years.1 Additional spending bills under consideration could blunt this drag , but \nseem unlikely to fully offset it.   \nA third factor focuses on supply-side considerations contributing to near -term tightness  in \nthe economy.  As it relates to labor supply, temporary factors related to the pandemic are likely \ncontributing to the current tightness in the labor market , importantly  reflect ed in a still-depresse d \nlevel of labor force participation. D isruptions to schooling and daycare led many workers with \nsmall children, primarily non -college educated women, to drop out of the labor force.  Enhanced \nunemployment benefits could also be playing a role, as potential workers  sit on the sidelines and  \nassess their options.    \nAs schools reopen, and enhanced unemployment benefits end, these constrain ts on labor \nsupply should ease.  Already we are seeing promising signs that the labor market is healing.  The \nJuly jo bs report , released last week, showed the unemployment rate dropp ing to 5.4 percent as \nthe economy added close to 1 million jobs.  The labor force participation rate,  however , remained \nalmost 1½ percentage points below its pre -pandemic level, suggesting fur ther room for recovery.    \nFinally, s upply constraints go well beyond labor markets.  A number of materials and \ninputs to production have also experienced  bottlenecks, notably semiconductors and steel , but \nother  aspects of production have been affected as well.  In part, these shortages reflect the \ndifficulties of restarting or reorienting production after a year of sharp shifts in demand.  The \nbottlenecks have also arisen from domino effects related to the tight logistical networks that were \nin place before the pandemic.  With a flexible, dynamic economy, firms can be expected to \novercome most of these bottlenecks through the rest of the year.   \nThis narrative for why the current supply and demand constraints  might be expected to \nease over time strikes me as a reasonable baseline.  My own expectation is that growth will step \ndown but remain robust ; that the labor market will continue to recover at a rapid pace; and  that \ninflation will moderate.  But this narrative would be incomplete without acknowledging the risks \naround these assumptions.  \nOne key risk is the lingering presence of the pandemic.  The upsurge in Covid cases \nrelated to the Delta variant  threatens r enewed restrictions on activity or increased caution on the \npart of consumers and could delay the recovery across many dimensions.  Importantly, the effects \n \n1 See, for example, the  Hutchins Center Fiscal Impact Measure (brookings.edu)  \n\n5 \n could be as pronounced on the supply side as the demand side, prolong ing the tightness of the \neconomy and maintaining upward pressure on prices.  Renewed concern over the virus could \nimpede the recovery in services consumption such that demand remains directed towards sectors \nof the economy that are near capacity and away from those sectors that have available slack . The \nsurge in the virus could als o delay the normalization of the labor market, particularly if schooling \nand childcare is once again disrupted.  The spread of the variant has been particularly disruptive \nin Asia, where vaccination rates remain quite low.  Given Asia’s large imprint in glob al value \nchains, disruptions in the manufacturing sector there can spill over quickly to other parts of the \nworld , further exacerbating production bottlenecks and shortages , and inflation pressure . \nAside from the economic threats associated with the Delta variant, the assumption that \ndemand will moderate may prove otherwise  given the high level of household savings . In \nparticular, a considerabl e portion  of the stimulus transfers to households ha ve been saved , with \nestimates suggest ing that the stockpile of household saving has increased by close to $ 2.5 \ntrillion . Of course, healthy household balance sheets are positive for the economy, and t o the \ndegree that the saving is spent out over time, this could support strong and steady growth for \nsome time.  However, if households instead choose to spend rapidly, a burst of demand could \nkeep  the economy at capacity, reinforcing bottlenecks and putting continued upward pressure on \nprices.  Households have a lot of firepower, and if and how quickl y they choose to spend will be \nan important factor in how tight the economy remains . \n \nThe outlook for m onetary policy  \nWhat does this mean for monetary policy  and the Federal Open Market Committee’s  \nlong-run objectives for the economy ? How should policymakers account for today’s “tight” \ndemand and supply dynamics in their decisions about the path of asset purchases and interest rates?  \nSince last December, t he Committee has stated that it expects to keep the policy rate near \nzero until the labor m arket has reached levels consistent with maximum employment and \ninflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. The \nFOMC also expects to maintain its purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities unti l \nsubstantial further progress has been made towards these employment and inflation goals.   \n\n6 \n Without question, the combination of fiscal and monetary policy supports at the onset of \nthe pandemic bridged the economy’s transition from a deep contraction to a robust rebound.  \nNow, with the recovery underway, a transition from extraordinary monetary policy \naccommodation to more neutral settings must follow.  Today’s tight economy as I described \nearlier certainly does not call for a tight monetary policy, but it does signal that the time has \ncome to dial back the settings.  With year -over -year inflation running well over the Committee’s \ntarget and steady progres s in monthly employment gains, the FOMC’s long -run objectives for \nprice stability and employment  are in focus.   \nWhile recognizing that special factors account for much of the current spike in inflation, \nthe expectation of continued strong demand, a recover ing labor market, and firm inflation \nexpectations are consistent, in my view,  with the Committee’s guidance regarding substantial \nfurther progress toward its objectives.  I support bringing asset purchases to an end under these \nconditions.   \nAs this adjustment gets underway, public attention will naturally turn to timing for \nadjusting the policy rate , though it is important to note the timing of the tapering of asset  \npurchases is not mechanically connected to the timing of any policy rate adjustment . With both \nupside and downside risks in play, and multiple policy tools in use, judging the achievement of \ncriteria for raising rates is more complicated.  One might argue that today’s inflation dynamics \nare likely to keep inflation moderately above 2 percen t for some time and align with the \nCommittee’s threshold criteria.  On the other hand, the criteria for judging maximum employment \nare murkier.   \nWhile it is clear that we remain far from the historic low levels of unemployment \nachieved pre-pandemic, it is less clear to me that such a benchmark will be the best guidepost in the current expansion . The pandemic introduced a number of  frictions into the labor market, \nmany of which are likely to evolve over time . Barring further intensification of the virus, I would \nexpect these frictions to fade, promoting strong job gains and a relatively fast approach to maximum employment.  However, the experiences of the past year may well have resulted in a \nnumber of structural changes to the labor market, including how, when, and where people work.  \nThese changes could affect the  assessment of maximum employment in ways that are not yet \nclear.   \n\n7 \n As witnessed during the last expansion, it can take some time to draw individuals back \ninto the labor market.  This is not an argument for keeping rates unchanged but ensuring \naccommodation adjusts as the economy expands, avoiding imbalances  and instability tha t can \nderail such gains.  \nNeedless to say, t he road ahead to policy normalization is likely to be a long and bumpy \none as we navigate inflation and labor market dynamics in the post -pandemic economy . \nConsidering the financial stability landscape also will b e key to the achievement of our goals.  \nAlong the way, a careful assessment of  the data will be essential in shaping the narratives that \nguide policy decisions, balancing nimbleness and patience and steering clear of  policy errors .",

        "content": "The Outlook for the Economy and Banks  \n \nRemarks by  \nEsther L. George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n    \n              \nMay 26, 2021 \nOklahoma Bankers Association Annual Conference  \nOklahoma City, Oklahoma  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers or representatives.  \n\n1 \n  I appreciate the opportunity to attend your annual meeting in person and to extend my \nbest wishes to Roger Beverage as he retires. It has been my pleasure to work with Roger over the \nyears, and his leadership to the banking industry will be missed.   \nFor more than one  year now, our nation has been confronted by a pandemic that has \ntaken a heavy toll. In addition to substantial loss of life and illness, our economy was also challenged in ways that were without comparison in recent history. Now, thanks to the efforts of scien ce and healthcare, it appears we are on a path to return to normalcy.  \nIn my remarks today, I will offer some thoughts on the  economic outlook, as well as the \noutlook for banking.\n1 \n \nThe outlook  \nSince the pandemic upended the global economy a little over a year ago, we have made \nconsiderable progress along the path to economic recovery. By many measures , the gap s that \nopened up in early 2020 have narrowed. Real gross domestic product (GDP), the br oadest \nmeasure of the nation’s economic output, increased at a robust 6½ percent annual rate in the first \nquarter, and will likely surpass its pre -pandemic level this quarter. The unemployment rate , at \njust over 6 percent in April, has improved considerabl y from its nearly 15 percent peak a year \nago.  \nThat progress alone is reason to be optimistic. Even so, we remain more than 8 million \njobs shy relative to pre -pandemic levels.  While t his shortfall partly reflects the  still-elevated \nunemployment rate, anoth er factor has been a decline in labor force participation  with  many \npotential workers  sitting on the sidelines .  \nAs we look ahead, I anticipate strong employment growth in the coming months , \nparticularly in contact- intensive industries such as hospitality and live entertainment, where the \nrebound in jobs has so far been  incomplete.  The outlook is also supported by an  extraordinary \namount of policy stimulus, both fiscal and monetary. Fiscal transfers have led to a considerable improvement in hous ehold balance sheets, with an accumulation of saving s far in excess of \nnormal levels.  In fact, the outlook is so strong that the discussion has quickly shifted from \ndemand shortfalls to supply constraints.  \n \n1 I thank Nick Baker, Stefan Jacewitz, Blake Marsh, and Rajdeep Sengupta of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas \nCity for their assistance in preparing thes e remarks.  \n\n2 \n Inflation over the 12 months  ending in April , as measured by the consumer price index  \n(CPI), increased to 4.2 percent, the fastest pace in over a decade and up considerably from the \n1.4 percent pace recorded at the start of the year.  What the current pace of inflation means for the \ninflation outlook for the medium term is less than clear . Many factors that have boosted current \ninflation seem likely to fade over time . All the same, I am not inclined to dismiss today’s pricing \nsignals or to be overly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judgi ng the outlook for \ninflation. The past few decades saw inflation play a relatively minor role in the day -to-day \ndecision- making of businesses and consumers. Maintaining this  state of affairs as we seek to \nachieve our objectives for maximum employment and price stability  will be important.  \nAs the pace and strength of the recovery unfolds , monetary policy settings remain highly \naccommodative and will remain so for some time in line with the FOMC’s  forward guidance. \nThe Committee has stated that it expects to keep the policy rate near zero until the labor market has reached levels consistent with maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. The FOMC also expects to maintain its purchases o f Treasuries and mortgage -backed securities until substantial further progress has \nbeen made towards these employment and inflation goals.   \nJudging the appropriate timing for policy adjustments is always challenging. The \neconomy is an incredibly complex se t of relationships, many of which have been disrupted by \nthe pandemic with uncertain long- term consequences. This is true for how we consume, how we \nproduce, and how we work. As the economy works its way towards a new equilibrium, policymakers will be well served to take a flexible approach to monetary policy decisions, in my view. In this regard, the Federal Reserve’s revised framework for monetary policy, adopted last August, provides a “framework,” rather than a “rule.” The  FOMC has in the past avoided s trict \nadherence to monetary policy rules, so it is unsurprising that the revised framework is not a precise prescription for policy action even as it repositions the Federal Reserve’s approach to achieving its congressional mandates for employment and inflation.  \nThe structure of the economy changes over time, and it will be important to adapt to new \ncircumstances rather than adhere to a rigid formulation of policy reactions.  With a tremendous \namount of fiscal stimulus flowing through the economy, the lands cape could unfold quite \ndifferently than the one that shaped the thinking around the revised monetary policy framework. That suggests remaining nimble and attentive to these dynamics will be important as we seek to \n\n3 \n achieve our policy objectives in the cont ext of sustainable economic growth and the well -being \nof the American public.   \n \nThe r ole of banks in the r ecovery   \n The banking industry has of course also played a key role in the recovery to date . Banks \nwere vital  in keeping the economy going in the early days of the pandemic . As investors fled to \nthe safety of cash and other liquid assets, financial markets witnessed a liquidity squeeze that \nwas particularly acute in short -term funding markets. Banks were well sit uated to withstand this \nliquidity squeeze.2 Crucially, the ir resilienc e reflected strong liquidity and capital positions  and \nmassive economic support from the government . As a result, banks were not only able to \nprovision for anticipated losses from the p andemic, but also to continue lending during the early \ndays of the pandemic. B anks provided around $ 270 billion in withdrawals on existing lines of \ncredit t o businesses in the first quarter of 2020 to cover anticipated revenue shortfalls.3  \nWhile the initial pandemic policy response of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve \naddressed the liquidity squeeze in March 2020, subsequent policy actions have pivoted from containing a potential financial crisis to addressing the challenges of supplying new credit to the businesses and households hardest hit by the pandemic. Banks have been a critical conduit for these policy measures. Most notably, banks disbursed funds to small businesses that were hard \nhit by the pandemic  through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP ). As of May 2, 2021, over \n5,000 lenders have approved close to 11 million loans under the PPP, totaling $780 billion in \nfunds to eligible small and medium- sized businesses .\n4 Regional and community banks have been \nparticularly active participants in the program. PPP loans ma ke up more than a quarter of \noutstanding C&I loans at  regional banks and around 40 percent at community banks —\nsignificantly more than large banking organizations ( LBOs ). This is a massive program , and its \nability to reach critical corners of the economy has depended on the strength of the relationships \nthat community and regional banks built over years of work with small, local businesses in their communities.  \n \n2 Rajdeep Sengupta and Fei Xue, 2020. \" The Global Pandemic and Run on Shadow Banks ,\" Economic Bulletin, \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, May 11, 2020.  \n3 The data reported are end -of-quarter changes in unused commitments for banks between Q4:2019 and Q1:2020. \nAnecdotal evidence would suggest that most of the draws occurred late in the first  quarter of 2020.  \n4 https://www.sba.gov/funding -programs/loans/covid -19-relief -options/paycheck -protection -program/ppp- data  \n\n4 \n The sheer size of the economic policy  response to the pandemic, however, has created \ncertain challenges for banks. B ank deposits have increased dramatically . At the same time , fiscal \ntransfers have weighed on loan demand. While small businesses have obtained much -needed \nfunding through the PP P program, most large corporate firms have been able to take advantage \nof easing credit conditions in bond financing. Federal aid packages have helped households \nrepay debt, boost savings and improve credit scores —complementing a decade- long cycle of \ndelev eraging by households from the peak of the 2008 f inancial crisis. As a result of this rapid \nand broad turnaround in credit conditions, demand for more credit , especially for bank loans , has \nbeen reduced. Facing low loan demand, banks have us ed much of their increased deposit funding \nto acquire low -yielding, liquid securities , which has weigh ed on overall bank profitability.  \n As the recovery from the pandemic continues, loan demand is lik ely to increase,  and \nbanks will find new lending opportunities. Indeed, demand for auto lending, for example , has \npicked up recently. However, t otal loan growth —and particularly business lending growth \noutside the PPP program —remains  tepid despite bank standards easing as economic uncertainty \nhas abated. Pressure to raise profitability could increase.  \n \nImplications for r isk-taking and b ank c apital  \nEven if loan volumes do pick up appreciably, profitability is likely to remain a concern. \nWith interest rates expected to remain low for some time, profitability measures , such as net \ninterest margins , will continue to be compressed.  The pressure t o boost profitability can result in \nturning to other , possibly riskier,  alternatives to bolster returns .  \nThe link between profitability and risk- taking is not always clear cut , but the  search for \nhigher returns  can understandably have negative consequences  for the banking system and the \neconomy more broadly. Some r esearch  argues that wh en a bank’s incentives are well aligned, \npreserving value can limit risk -taking .5 Such incentives may come under pressure in today’s \nenvironment where l ower profitability might encourage risk- taking, whether by increasing \n \n5 Demsetz, Rebecca, Mark R. Saidenberg, and Philip  E. Strahan, 1996, “ Banks with Something to Lose: The \nDisciplinary Role of the Franchise Value ,” Federal Reserve Bank of New York Economic Policy Review, 2(2), 1-\n14; among others . \n\n5 \n duration in asset portfolios, by loosening underwriting standards to compete for loans, or by \nexpanding into new or riskier lines of business.  \nDespite loan demand uncertainties, bank earnings during the firs t quarter of this year \nhave been positive, benefitting in large part from the release of loan loss reserves , particularly for \nlarger banks . Banks also have become  more reliant on non- interest income  sources. However, \nrecent events around Archegos Capital and Greensill Capital  are reminders of the impact of \nidiosyncratic losses and the ongoing value of risk management and strong capital. Both opaque, complex transactions  or those with seemingly  well -understood risks  can lead to unex pected \nlosses.  \nRegulatory reforms enhanced capital rules in response to the 2008 f inancial c risis, in part  \nto protect against risks that are not well understood . These rules strengthened requirements for \nthe amount and quality of capital in systemically significant banks and undoubtedly contributed \nto stab ility in the banking industry as the global pandemic  unfolded. Our largest banks, those \nlabeled GSIBs  (global  systemically important banks) entered the pandemic with capital  levels \nwell above those leading into the last crisis . However, in terms of leverage ratios, c ommunity \nand regional banks continue to hold even more  capital  than GSIBs .\n6 \nThe fundamentals of s trong capital and robust risk management will remain important as \nthe economic recovery advances  and banks resume dividend payments and share repurchases . \nResisting an excessive focus on short -term results at the expense of long -term interests  will be \nkey.7 The full effect of the pandemic on bank portfolios  is still unknown, and with so much \nuncertain , there are benefits to a longer -term view of capital.  \nA shifting f inancial s ector  landscape  \n Even as the banking industry manages through the aftermath of the pandemic, banks also \nare responding to strategic shifts in  the broader financial sector landscape.  The nation’s banking \nsystem across all sizes —large, small, and regional —ha s historically been the driver of financial \nservices for consumers and businesses.  However, technology and innovation also have a long \n \n6 The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s semi -annual updates on Bank Capital Analysis (BCA)  judges capital \nstrength across the banking industry. As of December 31 , 2020, the aggregate Tier 1 leverage ratios for global \nsystemically import ant banks (GSIBs) was 7. 5 compared to 9.1 for RBOs  and 10.0 for CBOs . \n7 For definitions of short -termism , see Sheila Bair, “Lessons of the Financial Crisis: The Dangers of Short -\nTermism,” Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance & Financial Regulation, Monday, July 4, 2011 , or  \nhttps://www.cfainstitute.org/en/advocacy/issues/short -termism . \n\n6 \n history of joining forces to disrupt existing conventions.  Similar to the proliferation of nonbank \nlenders, we now see thi s dynamic playing out in today’s financial system as it relates to \nfacilitating payments.  In essence, the unbundling of traditional banking services  poses new \nquestions for a legal and regulatory framework that has positioned the banking system to support \nmonetary policy transmission, financial stability and consumer protections . \nThe ability to send money with the speed and convenience of an email is appealing and \nunderstandably gaining rapid adoption. Indeed, we’ve witnessed over the past year an increased  \nadoption of digital payments. Yet we can’t overlook that despite efforts to make payments faster, less costly, and broadly accessible, nonbank entrants into financial services operate largely outside our existing institutional and regulatory frameworks. In some cases, novel charters at the \nstate and federal level have emerged to conduct these activities with new forms of money  and \ncustomized regulatory frameworks . \nTo what extent our existing legal and regulatory frameworks will need to evolve is \nunclear. The characteristics associated with commercial banks have generally assumed access to the public safety net of federal deposit insurance and the Federal Reserve’s discount window  \nwith a state/federal regulatory framework and direct access to the Federal Reserve’s payments rails.\n8 State and federal regulators collectively should consider how these fintechs and payment \nplatforms fit into the banking system.   \nToday’s accelerating pace of  technological  change has implications for our financial \nsystem.  But what hasn’t changed are the Federal Reserve’s priorities for the payment system : \nsafety, accessibility and efficiency.  It is through this lens that the Federal  Reserve remains \ncommitted to its goal to deliver its  first new payment service in over 40 years, the FedNow \nService.  The FedNow Service is a high priority for the Federal Reserve and will lay a foundation \nfor the future of payments that can be used as a s pringboard for innovation and yield important \neconomic benefits for the public. We are taking a phased approach in developing the FedNow Service so we can bring initial releases to market as quickly as possible, while providing flexibility to add key featu res in future releases.

        "content": "In the Wake of a n Unprecedented Year  \n \nRemarks by  \nEsther L. George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n      \n                \nJanuary 12, 2021  \nCentral Exchange  \nKansas City, Mo. \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve \nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.   \n\n1 \n  Thank you for inviting me to participate in your event today. I appreciate the opportunity \nto speak with you about my outlook for the nation’s economy and look forward to our \ndiscussion. As we turn the calendar to a new year, the opportunity to reflect on the past and to look ahead to the future  is a time -honored tradition. Today I will do a little of both. \n Last year was one for the record books. The year had  both the largest  decl ine in quarterly \nGDP  on record as well as the largest increase. The unemployment rate hit a  50-year low before \nclimbing to levels not seen since the Great Depression . The equity market  set record highs, while \nthe price of oil dropped below zero for the first time ever, if only for a moment. The year  saw the \nlargest fiscal policy reaction and the most rapid increase in government debt , even as  the yield on \ngovernment securities  fell to new lows . The Federal Reserve, for its part, broke new ground in \npolicy accommodation, while expanding its balance sheet to record size. Suffice to say, 2020 \nwas not a typical  year.  \n I am hopeful, as I believe many of us are, that 2021 will mark the beginning of a return to \nsomething more like normal . Just two weeks in, we are off to a rocky start. However, I am \ngenerally optimistic that the year will be one of continued economic recovery, though not without bumps and potholes , particularly in the first part of the year as the virus continues to \nexact a terrible human and economic toll.  \n In my remarks t oday, I will offer my  outlook for the economy, noting my growing \nconfidence in the recovery, notwithstanding near -term turbulence. Underlying this outlook are \nmy expectations about a path to resolving the pandemic, renewed fiscal support and the continued accommodative stance of monetary policy. Even as the economy recovers , the events \nof the last year are likely  to leave an imprint on the economic outlook for years to come. There is \nno going back to where we started, and I’ll highlight my own thoughts on some of the longer -\n\n2 \n term consequences of the pandemic. Finally, I will turn to what this all means for the path of \nmonetary policy.  \n The Economic Outlook  \nStarting with  the outlook, e conomic activity appears to have stalled at the end of last \nyear. Consumer spending edged down broadly, not just in the contact -intensive service sectors  \nmost sensitive to the path of the virus, but also for durable  goods , which have been quite strong \nup to now . The widespread nature of this  pullback suggests that fading fiscal support along with \nuncertainty about the timing of any new government transfers likely weighed on activity , as did \nthe resurgence of the virus  across the country.  \nWith the v irus still impe ding the resumption of many activities, employment growth also \nhas stalled , with the economy shedding 140,000 jobs in December . Given that we ended the year \nstill 10 million jobs short relative to  before the pandemic, the re remains quite a large gap to \nclose. About a third of the jobs that have yet to come back are in the high- contact leisure and  \nhospitality industry, making it likely that the pace of employment growth will remain lackluster until widespr ead vaccination is achieved and the virus diminishes as an everyday concern.   \nOverall, much of the optimism for eventual recovery this year is tied to a successful and \nwidespread vaccination program . One of the most substantial risks to the outlook is a significant \ndelay or disruption in the administration of the vaccine. Already, a slower -than-expected roll out \nhas led many analysts to push back their estimates  for when the U nited States  might achieve \nbroad- based immunity . It is difficult to imagine a sustained and robust recovery until the virus no \nlonger interferes with the public’s day- to-day decision -making.    \n\n3 \n That said, there is reason to be optimistic about the economy’s growth prospects post -\nvaccination. One signal has come from equity markets , which have responded favorably to \npositive vaccine news. Sectors that have been particularly hard hit by the virus, including air \ntravel  and leisure and hospitality, have seen some of the largest price gains , suggesting that \ninvestors, at least, are optimistic that demand could bounce  back strongly for these still -\ndepressed services. Inventories are another dynamic  that could support strong growth later this \nyear. B usinesses, and particular ly retail establishments, ran down their inventories  during the \nearly stages of the pandemic, unsure of future sales prospects. A sustained recovery in demand could prompt businesses to restock, boosting production and growth, even if perhaps also straining some supply chains .   \nThe additional fiscal support passed at the end of last year also se ts the stage for a strong \nrecovery. A renewed Paycheck Protection Program offers the prospect of sustaining small businesses until demand picks up, avoiding the significant cost and disruption of bankruptcy or \nclosure. Transfer payments in the CARES A ct had boosted aggregate personal income to an all -\ntime high in the spring, even as wage income fell off steeply, providing a key support to consumption and the economy. In recent months, personal income had been trending down, as the payments faded and wage in come has yet to fully recover. The new fiscal package, with \nenhanced unemployment benefits and household stimulus payments, should once  again push up \npersonal income, maintaining support for spending and growth.  \nAs with the earlier government transfers, t here is a high likelihood that a large portion of \nthe renewed fiscal support will end up being saved by households rather than spent. In April, the \npersonal saving rate shot up to a record 34 percent, as transfer payments boost ed income and \nCovid restrictions and concerns  limited consumption. Although the saving rate has come down \n\n4 \n since, it remains almost twice as high as the average prior to the pandemic.  Of course, fiscal \nsupport that is saved has less of an immediate impact on growth than that which is spent , but it \nalso is true that transfers that strengthen  household balance sheets  can prevent  a pullback in \nspending that might otherwise occur as households demand higher  precautionary buffers  in an \nuncertain environment . Also, once concern for the virus  ebbs, relatively healthy household \nbalance sheets should allow for a quick rebound in demand and a resumption of activity. To the \nextent such dynamics prevail, the economy might avoid the experience of the Global Financial \nCrisis , when even after  the recession ended there was a prolonged period of household \ndeleveraging that contributed to a lackluster pace of growth for years.   \n Long- Term Implications of the Pandemic \nWhen thinking about the long- term consequences of 2020, I find it helpful to group the \npotential factors into three broad categories. First, despite the best efforts of policymakers, t here \nare likely to be  scars from the crisis that will take time to heal. Businesses and workers have \nsuffered a tremendous disruption, and while the re is some optimism for a quick bounce -back, it \nwould not be unexpected for some of the negative effects to  persist . Second, the crisis will leave \na lasting impact  on business  and public  sector  balance sheets , with governments  taking on \nnotably more debt, central bank balance sheets  swelling  around the world, and corporate \nborrowing soaring, even as household balance sheets , in the aggregate, have improved. Third, the \ncrisis  will likely have a lasting effect on the structure of the economy, both by changing the way \nthat people work as well as what and how they consume.       \nStarting with the f irst of these three broad categories , there could be economic sc arring \nthat eventually heals , but only after some time. For example, as mentioned earlier, 10 million \n\n5 \n fewer  individuals are working now relative to before the pandemic . Given the notable  decline in \nlabor force participation over the same period, it would appear that about half of those workers \nthat lost jobs dropped out of the labor force altogether. Traditionally, i t has taken some time to \nbring individuals back into the l abor force, and it has often taken a fairly hot labor market to do \nso.   \nAn additional dynamic with this crisis h as been the disproportionate decline in labor \nforce partici pation among woman. In particular, about half of the decline in wom en’s \nparticipation is attributable  to caregiving, likely reflecting disruptions in child care. While this \ncould suggest a quicker bounce -back once the virus is checked and normal child care options \nreturn , it is important to note that even after  returning to the job, these workers could suffer  \ninterruptions in human capital development and career progression, with unfortunate  long- term \neffects.  \nTurning to the s econd  broad category , 2020 has scrambled balance sheets  across the \neconomy. While household balance sheets  are generally i n good shape , this has come at the \nexpense of government finances . The federal government  increased its liabilities to fund \ntransfers that, in many cases, have turned into household assets. Again , it must be noted that the \nrelative strength  of household balance sheets is in the aggregate. Certainly, the pandemic has led \nto significant economic hardship for many, as a large number of households struggle to pay bills and purchase necessities. One of the defining features of the pandemic has be en the unevenness \nof its economic impact. There has been substantial variation in how different industries, \nprofessions and geographies have been affected, with some sectors reporting record activity even as others have seen demand collapse.     \n\n6 \n On the bus iness side, non- financial corporations  have further increased borrowing from \nalready elevated levels, in part to cover pandemic -related holes in revenue but also, for larger \ncorporations, to take advantage of near -zero interest rates and favorable borrowing conditions .  \nThese shifts in balance sheets can have long -run impacts. For example , the large increase in \ngovernment debt could limit a fiscal policy response during some future crisis. Higher levels of \nbusiness debt could threaten financial stab ility, increasing the fragility of the financial system to \nprospective shocks.  \nFinally, l ooking at the t hird broad category , the pandemic has likely unleashed, or at least \naccelerated,  structural and technological changes  that will contin ue to play out over years or even \ndecades.  These include a shift to remote work , as well as online retail and entertainment. While \nthese changes could ultimately result in increase d economic  productivity, there will likely be \nnear- and medium -term disruptions as resource s shift between sectors . These changes also \nincrease the risks around  the value of capital in certain sectors —for example, commercial and \nretail real estate —which  could in turn raise important financial stability considerations.    \n Monetary Policy  \nAn excep tionally  uncertain economic outlook, with the chance of both downside and \nupside surprises , creates a complicated  and difficult environment for monetary policy. While t he \nvaccine promises an eventual end to the virus’s hold on the economy, there remains a substantial gap to be bridged before we get there. With the most recent fiscal package, the economy could get the necessary momentum to  bridge this gap and prevent  standard recessionary dynamics  from \ntaking hold before we reach the s afety  of widespread vaccination.   \n\n7 \n Monetary policy is also playing an important role in supporting the economy, as it has \nsince the start of the pandemic. In March, t he Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) cut its \npolicy inte rest rate to near zero  and launched an aggressive balance sheet expansion program, \npurchasing large quantities of Treasuries  and Mortgage -Backed Securities  (MBS). While the se \npurchases were initially directed towards smoothing market functioning, the expansion of the \nFed’s balance sheet also supports accommodative financial conditions, to the benefit of the overall economy. In September, the FOMC provided forward guidance, consistent with the Fed’s new monetary policy framework, that interest rates would remain near zero until the labor \nmarket reached levels consistent with maximum employment and inflation had  both risen to 2 \npercent and was on track to exceed 2 percent for some time. In December, the Committee further extended its forward guidance to cover its asset purchases, s tating that it will continue to increase \nits holding of Treasuries and MBS by at least the current pace until substantial further progress has been made on its employment and inflation goals. Overall, the outlook is for monetary policy \nto remain accommodat ive for some time.        \nClearly, in the current environment where the economy continues to heal, an  \naccommodative policy stance is appropriate. It is too soon to speculate about the timing of any \nchange  in this stance . The Committee  has agreed that further substantial progress in achieving \nhigh employment and average inflation at its 2 percent target is necessary  before making \nadjustments . This wait -and-see approach will guide the trajectory of monetary policy. As the \ndata come in , and the  economy evolves, the public and markets should be able to adjust their \nexpectations regarding the policy path. This feature of forward guidance is especially useful now given the heightened uncertainty around the outlook, stemming in large part from  the path of the \n\n8 \n virus. In the near -term, the r isks are predominately negative , but once the pandemic is behind us , \nthere is  considerable  scope for a snapback in activity .   \nHowever, a s the economy recovers and the Committee judges progress toward its \nmanda te for employment and inflation, policymakers will necessarily wrestle with judgments \nabout the appropriate stance of its policy settings. With longer -term implications of the pandemic \nnoted earlier unfolding over time, these deliberations are likely to be challenging. For example, \nhow long- lasting will the effect s of the pandemic on the labor market  be? Should we expect  \nemployment to return to its lows of early 2020? Or w ill changes in the structure of the economy \nand labor markets shift employment’s long- run equilibrium ?   \nWill inflation continue to fall short of central bankers’ desired 2 percent long- run \naverage, or  will other dynamics take hold and shift inflation impulses ? For example, a lthough \naggregate inflation, as measured by the PCE index, remains muted, a few hard- hit services prices \nhave played a disproportionate role in depressing the aggregate index. To the extent that a post -\nvaccine bounce- back boosts demand and prices in these sectors, including airfares and hotel \naccommodation, inflation could move up quickly. Other large contributors to the decline in inflation are a bit idiosyncratic, including owner -occupied housing and financial servic es. In \ncontrast to these sectors, price inflation for many other  categories  of consumption (particularly \ngoods) has  moved up, sometimes quite sharply. Such a scenario does not suggest higher inflation \nis a near -term threat, but rather that inflation could approach the Committee’s average inflation \nobjective more quickly than some might expect.   \nFinally, will highly accommodative monetary policy seed imbalances in the economy that \nincrease the fragility of the economy to the next inevitable shock? Will othe r mechanisms \neffectively mitigate and balance any destabilizing elements of a low -for-long rate environment?  \n\n9 \n As we  close the chapter on 2020, the N ew Y ear ushers in its own mix of optimism and \nchallenges. The experience of the pandemic will undoubtedly leave its mark even as our nation’s \neconomy shows its resilience  and recovers. Ultimately, the wisdom to understand this unfolding \nlandscape and to respond  with appropr iate policy adjustments will set the course for achieving \nour objectives for financial stability, sustainable long- run growth, employment and inflation.",
