George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOctober 11, 2018  \nEconomic Forum  \nTulsa, Oklahoma  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal \nReserve System, its governors, officers or representatives.  \n\n1 \n Ten years ago this month, financial conditions were fragile and the economy was deep in \nrecession.   The unemployment rate stood at 6.5 percent  on its way to 10 percent a  year later.  \nThe recovery from th at recession was slow, but the economy has come a long way.  The \ncombination of fiscal stimulus, corporate and bank  bailouts , and unconventional monetar y policy \naided in stabiliz ing the economy .  Yet, these dramatic actions did  not generate the sharp bounce \nback of economic activity that we might have expected based on some past recoveries .  Instead, \nthe economy found its footing in a  moderate , but resilient, recovery with annual growth in real \nGross Domestic Product (GDP) of around 2 percent.  More surprisingly, despite  the sluggish \npace of  output  growth , employment has grown at a relatively brisk  pace, pushing the \nunemployment rate down to its lowe st level since 1969 . \nBecause we are well into a recovery of record length, and with interest rates increasing, \nmany pundits are saying a recession is inevitably on the horizon.  Others are convinced  that \nrecent tax cuts and increased government spending , combined with robust consumer and \nbusiness spending , provide momentum that could extend the current expansion .  Rather than try \nto project the future, I’ll discuss what I see as the key factors that are in play today and that, on \nbalance, suggest continued growth ahead.  In doing so, I’ll offer my views on monetary policy \nand highlight the changing role of the energy  sector in contributing to the overall performance of \nthe economy , including the region served by the Kansas City Fed . \n \nU.S. Economic Outlook  \n By nearly every measure, the U.S. economy is performing well.  With accommodative \nfinancial conditions, elevated levels of confidence and solid labor markets, it seems reasonable to \nexpect economic growth slightly above trend with low and stable inflation  for the next few years . \n\n2 \n Consumers are poised to continue to be the main force behind this expansion, and the recent \npickup in business investment may continue as well .   \nDigging  a little deeper into the details, several factors support  the outlook for \nconsumption. Household balance sheets remain strong. The latest data show that the personal \nsavings rate is 6.6  percent  and household net worth as a share of income is at a histor ically high \nlevel. W age growth has  steadily increased, approaching 3 percent in the latest report s, and \nconsumer confidence is at its highest level since prior to 2008 . Finally, job gains continue to rise \nfaster than is needed to absorb workers entering the labor force . \nThe outlook for business spending is also favorable.  Business  investment expanded \nrobustly last year , and the momentum has continued in 2018. During the first half  of this year , \nbusiness investment grew at an average annualized rate of 10  percent . This is a welcome step up \nfrom the stagnant investment levels in 2015 -2016.  \nLooking ahead, capital expenditures seem poised to continue at a robust pace, as \neconomic growth remai ns solid , borrowing costs remain low , and rising labor costs combined \nwith labor shortages lead firms to invest in technology to automate tasks .  The recent cut in the \ncorporate tax rate provides additional incentives  for investment. And, as I will discuss later, \nadvances  in shale oil production have become an important factor in boosting investment .  This \nimpetus from the energy sector seems likely  to continue.  Over the longer -term, however, \ninvestment spending will likely slow to a more sustainable rate in line with the economy’s \npotential growth rate .  \nOther sectors of the economy, including net exports, residential investment, and \ninventories, a re likely to be a more neutral and uncertain influence on the overall economy.  For \nexample, the recent appreciation of the dollar, along with  possible  retaliatory tariffs and slower \n\n3 \n growth in the emerging market economies, could cause net exports be  a modest drag on overall \neconomic growth.  Nevertheless, I expect domestic demand to remain strong.  \nThis strong demand growth will reinforce the outlook for a tight labor market.  The \nunemployment rate currently stands at 3.7 percent, well below most estimate s of its long -run \nsustainable level. With solid employment gains averaging 190,000  jobs per month in the last \nthree months , some observers argue the economy is getting a second wind .  My own \ninterpretation of these gains is that we are seeing the hallmarks o f a mature expansion.   Looking \nthrough monthly fluctuations in the job market report s shows that the pace of payroll growth has \nactually moderated from a few years ago. At its peak in early 2015 , the year -over-year change in \ntotal payrolls was roughly 3 mi llion. In contrast, the latest data point to a year -over-year change \nin total payrolls of 2.5 million. I expect this trend of slowing employment gains to continue as \nlabor market conditions tighten further  and it becomes harder for firms to fill vacancies.  \nDespite tight labor markets and above trend growth, inflation has remained low. In fact, \ninflation has been remarkably stable even as the unemployment rate has fallen sharply.  That \nsaid, the accommodative stance of monetary policy that has prevailed , even as the \nunemployment rate has fallen below estimates of its long -run sustainable level,  could push \ninflation somewhat higher over the next couple of years.  Of course, the outlook for inflation  has \nimplications for monetary policy.  \n \nImplications for Monet ary Policy  \nAt last month’s meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) t ook another step \nto remove some of the extraordinary monetary accommodation that has been in place since the \nonset of the financial crisis.  This gradual normalization of policy seems appropriate to me given \n\n4 \n that the FOMC’s employment and inflation objectives have largely  been achieved while the \ncurrent setting of its overnight interest rate target remains below estimates of its longer -run \nvalue.   \nAs the FOMC seeks to make moneta ry policy a more neutral influence on the economy \nand, thereby, sustain the economic expansion , policymakers must consider a variety of risks and \nuncertainties around the outlook  for the economy .  On the upside, accommodative financial \nconditions, elevated  consumer confidence and expansionary fiscal policy could lead to further \nincreases in economic growth  and inflation . On the downside, trade policy uncertainty, growing \nrisks in emerging market economies and policy divergence between the U.S. and other adv anced \neconomies could slow down both foreign and U.S. growth.   \nWhile I see these risks as currently balanced, the path of policy cannot be on a pre -set \ncourse at this stage of the expansion.  The FOMC’s approach of gradual increases in the target \nfederal funds rate, combined with gradual reductions in the size of the Fed eral Reserve ’s balance \nsheet, has aimed to thread this needle.  This means p olicymakers will need to carefully assess the \neffects past policy actions are likely to have  as they look  for economic fundamentals to remain \nconsistent with the objectives of maximum employment and price stability .   \n \nThe Shale Oil Revolution  \nTo this point, I’ve talked about the cyclical nature of the economy and how monetary \npolicy interacts with those cyclical fea tures .  At the same time, however, a number of structural \nchanges are occurring in the U.S. economy that bear watching.  Among these developments are \nthe aging of the population, ongoing technological change  and weak readings for productivity \n\n5 \n growth.  A ke y industrial change that is particularly relevant in Oklahoma  is related to the shale \noil revolution, and I’d like to spend a few minutes talking about some of its implications.   \nIn the 1970s and 1980s, sharp oil price increases pushed the U.S. economy in to \n“stagflation” — an economic downturn with a simultaneous and persistent increase in inflation.  \nAt the time,  the United States was heavily dependent on oil imports for its energy needs, and \nhigher oil prices acted as a tax on U.S. consumers paid to forei gn oil producers.  Of particular \nnote, t he rise in inflation that resulted from higher oil prices tended to persist. Once inflation \nrose, people expected it to remain elevated, suggesting a lack of confidence in the F OMC  to \nmaintain price stability over th e longer run.     \nToday , the economy’s reaction to a sharp change in oil prices is quite different.  As you \nknow, oil and gas production has boomed in the United States over the past two decades  thanks \nto horizontal drilling and fracking technologies.  In addition, the public’s expectations for \ninflation have become better anchored following the Fed’s heightened response to inflationary \nshocks as well as its adoption  in 2012 of an inflation target .  As a result, today , oil price increases  \nlead to an increase in oil and gas production and a related increase in investment spending, \ntemporarily raising inflation but offsetting some or all of the adverse effect on aggregate \neconomic activity. Similarly, today, a sharp downturn in oil and gas p rices can put temporary \ndownward pressure on inflation  with benefits to consumers but adverse consequences for the \nenergy secto r – as we witnessed in 2014 -15.  Importantly, the inflationary effects are viewed as \ntemporary rather than persistent because of the anchoring of inflation expectations around 2 \npercent.  \nAlthough recent developments have muted the effects of oil price changes on the \neconomy  as a whole , they have to some extent increased volatility in the oil sector itself and in \n\n6 \n business capital exp enditures. For example, the oil and gas sector nationwide has experienced a \nsurge in output per rig and per worker.  From 2012 to 2017, productivity in the U.S. oil and gas \nextraction sector more than doubled.1  Associated with this increase in productivit y and along \nwith wide swings in oil prices , the number of rigs and workers required for production has fallen \ndramatically .   \n  Research by my staff finds that the energy sector has had a significant influence on \ninvestment spending in the U.S. economy, bo th to the upside and to the downside. From 2006 to \n2014, for example, total capex spending for U.S. publicly  traded firms rose roughly 41 percent. \nThis boost in spending was largely driven by energy investment, which grew  125 percent \ncompared to a more mod est 21 percent for non-energy investment. By the same token, after the \noil price decline in 2014 , energy investment plunged more than  50 percent over the following  \ntwo years .  Despite a modest 2 percent growth in non -energy investment spending over this \nperiod, total capex fell 15 percent . Variability in energy investment has had a sizable influence \non the broader investment landscape.2  \nOf course the shale oil boom also has had myriad effects on local economies that are \nheavily dependent on the oil and gas extraction industry.  Yesterday , I had the chance to tour the \nlarge oil storage facility in Cushing, just an hour west of here, to learn more about these \ndynamics.  Wor ld trade is an important issue today and it affects many local economies, \nincluding those involved in oil production.  For example, with the lifting of the oil export ban, \nwe’ve seen U.S. oil exports surge , and places like Cushing are dealing with export d elivery \nchallenges until investment in midstream and downstream capacity comes on line .   \n                                                 \n1 Chad Wilkerson . 2018.  “Oil and Gas Productivity Doubled in the Past Five Years —What Happens Next? ” \nOklahoma Economist , Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, June 18.  \n2 David Rodziewicz, 2018. “ Energy Investment Variability within the Macroeconomy ,” Economic Review , Federal \nReserve Bank of Kansas City, Third  Quarter.  \n\n7 \n A key question is whether this now abundant and accessible natural resource has , on net, \nhad a positive effect on local economic conditions. Some theories suggest res ource abundance \nmay increase local economic development through higher demand for labor in the energy sector \nand spillover spending in the local economy. Other theories, though, suggest industries not \nclosely related to the resource extraction industry may  be harmed as energy production expands. \nFor example, labor demand by the extraction industry may be high enough to bid up local wages, \nwhich in turn could pull employees from other lower -paying jobs and make it difficult for other \nindustries to survive. A t the national and international level, this phenomenon has been referred \nto as the “natural resource curse,” but the topic has received much less attention at the local \nlevel.  \nStaff at the Kansas City Fed took a look at this issue and examined how the bo om in the \nU.S. natural gas industry has affected local economies in the central United States. By looking at \nlabor market conditions at the county level in a nine -state region  including Oklahoma,  they \nanalyzed how employment and wages have responded to the  rapid expansion of natural gas \nproduction from 2001 to 2011. The key finding is that the gas boom had a modest but po sitive \nimpact on local labor market outcomes in counties where natural gas production has increased, \nand little evidence of a so-called natural resource curse.3 \nGiven the nature and scale of the  dramatic developments  in the energy sector , we \ncontinue to monitor this segment of our economy very closely, both in the Kansas City Fed \nregion and be yond.  We stay abreast of real-time trends throug h roundtable discussions with \nindustry executives, and we conduct a quarterly survey of our oil and gas firms  to monitor \nactivity .  Our third -quarter survey will be released tomorrow  morning .  We also host an annual \n                                                 \n3 Jason P.

This year’s conference focused on trends in world oil supply and demand, \nthe rising importance of energy trade, and the longer -term future of shale.  Overall, the \nconference atte ndees were relatively upbeat about the near -to-intermediate outlook for U.S. oil \nand gas, while recognizing that geopolitical risks could create volatility in the near term.4   \n \n \nConclusion  \n In closing , the U.S. economy is enjoying a long expansion . One particular bright spot in \nthe outlook is the strength of t he oil - and gas -producing sector.  As we assess the outlook for the \neconomy as a whole , it has becom e increasingly important to understand developments in the \nenergy sector to identify  industry -specific shocks and their possible spillovers to the broader \neconomy.   The Kansas City Fed and its Oklahoma City Branch in particular will continue to \nkeep tabs on these energy sector dynamics.  \n Looking ahead, there is good reason to expect continued moder ate growth, with a gradual \nslowing to more sustainable growth rates of both output and employment.  This outlook will \nlikely require further gradual increases in the FOMC’s target interest rate, although the pace and \nextent of future actions remain a key a spect of the Committee’s deliberations.   \n  \n                                                 \n4 See “ Energy and the Economy: Charting the Course Ahead ,” for presentations from the conference."

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJuly 17, 2018  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Agricultural Symposium  \nKansas City, Mo.  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers or representatives.   \n\n \n \n1 \n Good evening and welcome. Today ’s discussion  has been bot h interesting and \ninformative. I want to thank the presenters and discussants for participa ting in this year’s \nsymposium. Clearly, international trade is central to the performance of the ag ricultural sector, \nand uncertainty about trade policy  clouds the outlook. I look forward to continuing the \ndiscussion tomorrow.  \nThis evening I would like to focus my remarks on the outlook for the U.S. economy and \nthe role of monetary policy in supportin g sustainable economic growth. With the economy at or \nbeyond most estimates of full employment and inflation near the FOMC’s  2 percent objective, \nmonetary  policy  should be a neu tral influence on the economy. However, i n my view, policy is \nstill providing accommodation . Gradual further increases in our poli cy rate will be necessary to \nreturn policy to a  neutral stance , although there is considerable uncertainty about exactly how far \nor fast we need to go. Thus, policy must thread th e needle between moving too slowly  toward \nneutral , which could lead to an undesirable increase in inflation, and moving too aggressively , \nwhich could precipitat e an economic downturn.    \n \nCurrent economic conditions  \n Let me turn first to current econ omic conditions. The U.S. economy  is in excellent shape,  \noperating with tight labor markets and  low and stable inflation. The unemployment rate  at 4.0 \npercent  is well below most estimates of full employment . In addition , headline inflation as \nmeasured by the Fed ’s preferred indicator, the personal consumption e xpenditure price index , \nrecently reached 2 .3 percent , while the core measure excluding food and energy came in at 2 \npercent —consistent with the Fed’s inflation objective.  \n\n \n \n2 \n  Looking back at the first half of the year, real GDP —our broadest measure of economi c \nactiv ity—increased at a solid pace. In fact, it accelerated from a moderate 2 percent annual rate \nin the first quarter to an expected growth rate of around 4 percent in the second quarter, based o n \nvarious GDP tracking models. Looking ahead, we expect co ntinued economic growth at or above \nestimates of the economy’s longer -run potential growth rate of around 1¾ percent . \n Economic growth is broad based, and the economy appears to be firing on all cylinders.  \nConsumer spending has supported overall economic growth since the beginning of the \nexpansion, but more recently, we have seen a pickup in business sp ending on plant and \nequipment. In addition, we are beginning to see a n increase in the pace of wage gains . For \nexample, the employment cost index —a broad me asure of labor compensation that accounts for \nemployment shifts among occupations and industries —accelerated over the past couple of years \nto a 2.7 percent annual growth rate in the first quarter, after having hovered for s everal years \naround 2 percent. These wage gains along with ongoing increases in employment will continue \nto support increases in personal income and spending over the remainder of the year and on into \nnext year.  \nWith this strong performance and a legacy of low interest rates, financial st ress may be \nbuilding in some sectors . The corporate bond market and subprime borrowers  appear to be at \nsome risk shoul d interest rates rise sharply. In addition, asset prices remain elevated . \nNevertheless , regulators have judged the financial system to be stable , with manageable \nvulnerabilities . They point, for example, to the most recent assessment from the annual stress -\ntesting of the largest banks . That said, I am concerned that regulators are not doing more to build \nresilient capital buffers into the ba nking system at a time of cyclical strength.  \n \n\n \n \n3 \n The risks to the outlook  \n Aside from the possibility that we are misjudging the manageability of emerging  \nfinancial imbalances, the risks to the outlook appear balance d. Even so , the risks —both to the  \nupside and the downside —are significant.   \nThe predominant upside risk s in my view are a pro-cyclical U.S. fiscal policy and \nglobally accommodative monetary policies . While estimates of the stimulative effects vary, t he \nfederal government ’s actions  to cut taxes a nd increase spending have come during a business \ncycle expansion. These policies may have the short -run benefit of promoting spending and, \nperhaps, increasing the economy’s longer -run growth potential by increasing business \ninvestment, but they also carry a risk of pushing the economy beyond its productive capacity.  \nLikewise, accommodative monetary policies in the United States and other advance d economies \nencourag e risk-taking and incentiviz e spending over saving. At this point in the business cycle, \nsuch fiscal and monetary policies could lead to an undesirable increase in inflation or to a further \nbuildup of financial imbalances.  \nThe predominant downside risks come from uncertainty around trade policy.  To date, the \nimpact of new tariffs on the broad econ omy has been minimal, and I have not incorporated any \nsignificant effect into my baseline outlook for the broader U.S. economy. However, anecdotal \nreports from our business contacts suggest that some companies are taking a “wait and see” \napproach to new ca pital spending due to uncertainty about future trade policies . Whether this \nwill materially slow the economy over the next couple of years or threaten the sustainability of \nthe expansion i s something that I will be monitoring carefully . \n \n \n\n \n \n4 \n Monetary policy m ust thread the needle  \nBarring the realization of these risks to the outlook, I continue to believe the stance of \nmonetary policy will need to be gradually adjusted toward a more neutral position.  At a time of \nfull employment with price stability, policy sh ould be a neutral influence on economic activity.  \nBut navigating the path to neutral will be challenging.  \nIn the first place, there is considerable uncertainty about what the neutral policy rate is \nand, therefore, uncertainty about how many policy moves it will take to return to neutral. Various \nstructural changes —such as slower growth of the labor force and sluggish productivity growth —\nsuggest the neutral policy rate is lower than in the past . But other, cyclical, factors may be \npartially offsetting.  In addition, fi scal stimulus is likely raising the neutral rate , but it is not clear \nby how much.   \nLikewise, questions exist about the natural rate of unemployment and the slope of the \nPhillips curve —and whether these concepts remain relevant in today’s econ omy.  The fact that \ninflation has been relatively stable even as the unemployment rate has fallen well below \nestimates of its longer -run sustainable level suggest s that either the Phillips curve is unusual ly \nflat or, perhaps, obsolete. That said, monetary policy is currently testing the limits of how low   \nunemployment can go without causing an undesir able increase in inflation.  \nMonetary policy is further complicated by the extraordinary actions central banks took to \npromote growth during and after the global financial crisis.  When unemployment was high and \ninflation was low relative to our targets, the F ederal Open Market Committee (FOMC) greatly \nexpanded the Fed’s  balance sheet and provide d forward guidance to the public that policy rates \nwould be ke pt low for a prolonged period. I don’t dispute that some of these policies may have \nhelped  get us to where we are today. But now that the FOMC has largely achieved its objectives, \n\n \n \n5 \n the costs of these extraordinary policy actions are becoming apparent. Even tho ugh we have \nbegun to gradually normalize the size of the balance sheet, it remains exceptionally large by \nhistorical standards. It is still likely putting downward pressure on longer -term rates, working at \nodds with efforts  to achieve policy neutrality. In addition, keeping rates “low for long” has \nresulted in a policy stance that remains accommodative in the face of tight labor markets and \ninflation at the FOMC’s goal . \n   Moreover, t raditional signals of the stance of policy , such as the slope of the yield  curve, \nhave likely become  distorted. A yield curve inversion —that is, a situation where short -term rates \nrise above longer -term rates —has historically been a strong signal that the economy might dip \ninto recession sometime over the next six months to two years. Except for once1, such an \ninversion  has always  been followed by a recession. While the yield curve has not yet inverted, it \nis relatively flat by historical standards, raising the possibility that further increases in policy \nrates could move them ab ove longer -term rates.   \nIt’s not clear how concerned we should be about this possibility. As I mentioned , the \nFed’s large holdings of Treasury securities may be  keeping longer -term rates below where they \notherwise would be and, therefore, distorting th e signal from the yield curve. In addition, the \nlevel of interest rates , as well as that of the neutral policy rate , is below historical benchmarks.2   \nWhile economic conditions are quite positive right now, i t is important that monetary \npolicy be calibrat ed over time to sustain the expansion . The stakes are high since policymakers  \nwill have less scope to lower rates in a future downturn. Monetary policy cannot offset all of the \nshocks that affect  the economy , and recessions will happen. But recessions can also be caused by \n                                                 \n1 The one time when an inverted  yield curve (10 -year treasury yield/3 -month treasury yield) did not immediately \nprecede a recession was in September 1998.  \n2 Bauer, Michael, and Thomas M. Mertens, “Economic Forecasts with the Yield Curve,” FRBSF Economic Letter , \nMarch 5, 2018.  \n\n \n \n6 \n policy mistakes. The FOMC will need to monitor incoming data carefully to avoid moving too \naggressively and causing a downturn  or moving too slowly and allowing inflation to rise.   \nAllowing inflation to rise also can result in a recession  if the Fed must then raise rates \naggressively to return inflation to target.    \nAdding to the complexity of monetary policy is that it affects the real econom y with long \nand variable lags. Past policy actions have not yet had their full effect, and actions  taken today \nwill not have their full effect for many months into the future. This raises the risk of \novershooting. Like adjusting the thermostat in a hot room to cool it down , failure to account for \nlags can lead one to continue tinkering with the control s. Because i t takes time to reach the \ndesired temperature, if you’re not careful, it’s easy to overshoot, turning a room that is too hot \ninto one that is too cold.  \nAll of this suggests to me that  future policy actions  will increasingly need to be data \ndependent. And given the policy lags, our actions need to be forward looking. In this context, \ndata dependence means that policymakers should adjust their forecasts and associated policy \npaths as necessary based on the flow of incoming data. Therefore , I will be monitoring signs that \nmight indicate whether we are nearing neutral or ha ve further to go. For example, further \ndownward movements in the unemployment rate or upward momentum in inflation would \nsuggest to me  that we have more work to do. On the  other hand, stabilization of inflation and \nunemployment around their current levels might suggest  less urgency for further policy action.  \n \nConclusion  \n Notwithstanding these challenges , the U.S. economy is currently in very good shape ,  \nunemployment is well below most estimates of its longer -run level , and inflation has mov ed up \n\n \n \n7 \n to the FOMC’s objective. My baseline outlook is for the expansion to continue at a moderate \npace, while recognizing  there are signific ant upside and downside risks. With a long -run view t o \nsustain the expansion, monetary policy will need to move from an accommodative st ance to a \nmore neutral stance. Threading this needle will be challeng ing in the face of numerous \nuncertainties and the ongoing complexity of unwinding the extraordinar y policy actions taken in \nthe aftermath of the global financial crisis."

I app reciate  the Hoover Institution bringing together leading academics and monetary \npolicymakers to share ideas about the practical issues facing central banks today . We have much \nto learn from each other .  \nMy comments this afternoon  focus on some of the practical issues I think about as I \nformulate my own policy views . As I do so, y ou’ll hear me describe these issues with more \nquestions than answers , reflecting the nature of the policy landscape today .  \nBefore I continue, however, I want to note that these are my own views and are not \nnecessarily representative of others in the Federal Reserve System.  \n \nToday’s policy landscape  \nNine years after the financial crisis, the Fed has , at least for the moment,  achieved its \nobjectives of maximum employment and price stability . Yet the legacy of the crisis —through the \nresponse of the Fed and fiscal authorities —has left us in a very different place than before the \ncrisis  in a number of ways . The equilibrium nomina l policy rate is low  by historical standards . \nThe current target for the federal funds rate is considerably  lower than the Federal Open Market \nCommittee’s  (FOMC)  projection of its longer -run value . Our balance sheet is almost five times \nits pre -crisis size . The Fed’s footprint in financial markets is considerably larger than before the \ncrisis. The banking sector is consolidating, and big banks have gotten even bigger . Federal \ndeficits and debt are high and projected to rise to unprecedented levels .  \nDespite  this legacy,  many of the structural developments that dominate our thinking \ntoday  were well underway before the onset of the financial crisis and Great Recession . An a ging \npopulation, slowing productivity growth, rising globalization and declining equilib rium interest \n\n2 \n rates all pre -date the crisis. In this sense, things have not changed . Moreover, since the mid-\n1990s and through the financial crisis , Great Recession, and current expansion, core inflation —\nas measured by the personal consumption expenditure price index —has fluctuated in a relatively \nnarrow range of roughly 1 percent to 2 ½ percent .  \nGiven the structural changes that have been developing over the last several d ecades, it \nmay well be that we are in a low -growth, low -interest -rate environment . Yet, from a cyclical \nperspective, the economy appears to be operating at or beyond full employment with inflation \nexpected to rise over the medium term , while the FOMC’s funds rate target of 1½ percent to  1¾ \npercent remains well below the FOMC’s projection  of its longer -run level of about 3 percent . \nThe current gradual normalization of interest rates is geared toward removing accommodation at \na pace that is expected to sustain the expansion without generating undesired increases in \ninflation on the one hand , or creating  financial instability on the other . But there are clearly risks .  \nAnd there are still uncertainties about how the landscape will look once policy has \nachieved a “new normal.” In particular, questions remain to be answered about the Fed’s futu re \noperating framework , its strategic framework  and it s role in promoting financial stability . I’ll \ndiscuss each of these issues in turn .  \n \nDetermining a long-run operating framework  \n In 2016, the FOMC  held lengthy discussions about potential long -run frameworks for \nmonetary policy implementation . The Committee discussed  the merits of maintaining an \nabundance of reserves in the banking system versus returning to a framework of reserve scarcity . \nWith an abundance of reserves, the Fed would rely on interest on reserves and the overnight \nreverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) to maintain control over short -term market rates . With \n\n3 \n a scarcity of re serves , the open market desk at the New York Fed would  control market rates \nthrough its control over the supply of reserves . The discussion ended with agreement that \n“decisions regarding the long -run implementation framework were not necessary at this time.”1 \nSince that time, however, w e have begun to normalize our ba lance sheet  with an understanding \nthat the balance sheet will be smaller than it is today, but larger than it was in 2007 . As the \nbalance sheet continues its steady decline, I would suggest that we again need to consider the \nappropriate long-run size of th e balance sheet and our related operating framework .  \n While it may simply be a case of nostalgia on my part, I found our minimalist  pre-crisis \noperating framework to have a number of features that served us well for many years . We \nmaintained a small balan ce sheet with liabilities that were comprised almost entirely of currency \nin circulation with reserves averaging about $10 billion, compared with more than $2 trillion \ntoday . We maintained a Treasuries -only balance sheet with duration -matching Treasury iss uance \nto maintain a neutral influence on financial markets . We had a small number of counterparties, \nand we managed the supply of reserves to achieve the target federal funds rate . As a result, our \nfootprint in the financial markets was relatively small .  \nRelative to this pre-crisis framework, the current operating framework —made necessary \nby a large balance sheet —has had a number of undesirable consequences, some of which were \nunintended . The Fed now owns significant outstanding shares of Treasur ies and mortgage -\nbacked securities ( MBS ) and is no longer a neutral influence on financial markets . We have a \nlarge number of counterparties , including nonbanks , made necessary by the ON RRP facility . \nIncreases in the funds rate are achieved by raising an administ ered rate —the interest rate on \nexcess reserves  (IOER) . Some have expressed concern that  as IOER goes up, payments to \nbanks —including to foreign banks —go up . Finally, the nature of unconventional policies has \n                                                 \n1 Federal Open Market Committee Minutes, November 1 -2, 2016 . \n\n4 \n drawn both attention and criticism to the Federa l Reserve’s large balance sheet with conequences \nfor central bank independence and fiscal discipline . Congress has begun to  see the Federal \nReserve as a source for plugging spending gaps , drawing on the Fed  to fund the Consumer \nFinancial  Protection Bureau , finance highway spending , and more recen tly, to contribute $2.5 \nbillion to the federal government from its capital surplus as part of the budget deal passed in \nFebruary after the brief government shutdown .  \nGiven these developments, the current thrust of policy can become more difficult to \ngauge . At the same time the funds rate is being normalized , we have embarked on a program to \ngradually reduce the Fed’s security holdings by decreasing reinvestment of principal payments . \nWhile I support this policy —with balance sheet normalization occurring largely on auto -pilot \nand in the background —it does pose challenges as we try to understand the implications for the \nstance of policy . Is policy tighter than  we think because t he balance sheet is shrinking? Or is the \nstill-large balance sheet  putting downward pressure on longer -term rates making policy more \naccommodat ive than we think?   \nWhether  it is desirable or even possible to return to our pre-crisis operating framework  \nremains an open question for the FOMC . Can we  return to the corridor -like framework with \nscarce reserves, o r will we need to retain the current floor system?  If we maintain the current \nsystem, by how much can we reduce the supply of reserves ?  And what is the eventua l role of the \nON RRP facility? Can IOER guide the funds rate without reliance on the floor esta blished by the \nrate on ON RRPs?  Answers to these questions will be shaped by the FOMC’s future discussions.  \n \n \n \n\n5 \n Strategic f ramework  \nIn addition to uncertainties about the longer -run operating fra mework, a number of \nstrategic challenges and uncertainties  pose practical issues for policymakers . With little \ncountercyclical policy space available to respond to a future downturn , monetary policy options \nmust contemplate how interest rate an d balance sh eet policies will work before, during and after \na crisis . Aggressively purchasing assets in a downturn and only gradually allowing them to roll \noff once the economy has fully recovered suggests the possibility of a balance sheet th at grows \nbigger and bigge r over time .  \nThis dynamic , combined with varying degrees of uncertainty  about the efficacy of asset \npurchases , has led to calls for a discussion about future policy strategies for the next encounter \nwith the zero lower bound . Ideas like price -level targeting, a higher inflation objective  or \nnominal GDP targeting all offer worthwhile and intellectually stimulating debate . And certainly \nthe time is right to consider the trade -offs around various strategies , but determining if these \nideas might work in practice is challenging .  \n \nPromoting Financial S tability  \nThese uncertainties make it all the more important to ensure the current economic \nexpansion is sustained as interest rates rise and the balance sheet normalizes. We should take \nevery measure possible  to prevent  a crisis rather than hope that we can devise a monetary policy \ncure after the fact.  \n \n\n6 \n As the FOMC gradually mov es away from the zero lower bound, with a slowly shrinking \nbut still -large balance sheet and growing federal debt, maintaining financ ial stability  is \nparamount .  \nHere I would like to make two key points .  \n First, in contemplating a future bout of financial instability , we should be realistic \nabout the robustness of macroprudential tools with a good dose of humility \naround the necessary finesse to deploy  them  in a timely fashion .  \n Second, we should not waver in our aims t o bolster resilience in our banking \nsystem especially for the largest banks .2  \nThere is little dispute  that financial stability is a necessary condition for achieving the \nFOMC’s employment and price stability mandates . It is recognized in  the FOMC’s “Statement of \nLonger -Run Goals and Strategies ” as well as being the objective of macroprudential policies . \nHowever, there remains a tension as to the trade -off between macroecon omic goals and financial \nstability . The “lean or clean” debate is ongoing . Specifically, some argue that the output losses \nassociated with using monetary policy to lean against growing financial imbalances far outweigh \nthe possible benefits . Instead, they suggest that macroprudential policies are the appropriate \nresponse to financial instability . In my view , this approach might be more effective  in theory \nthan in practic e.  \nA few years ago , I participated with some of my colleagues in a tabletop exercise \ndesigned to assess the efficacy of certain macroprudential policy tools in responding to a \nhypothetical financial crisis . In the exercise, we examined the use of capital -based, liquidity -\nbased, and credit -based tools, along with stress testing and supervisor y guidance in mitigating \n                                                 \n2 The eight U.S. global systemically important banks (GSIBs) held $11 trillion in total assets at the end of 2017, an \namount equal to 57 percent of U.S. gross domestic product.  \n\n7 \n the effects of an overheating of the financial markets . What we discovered in conducting the \nexercise was that the effectiveness of the tools varied because  of realities like implementation \nlags and/or limited scope . In addition, m onetary polic y looked to be a relatively more attractive \noption than some  might have expected before the exercise.3  Obviously this particular exercise is \nnot conclusive in all scenarios, but rather a caution about becoming overly confident in relying  \non macroprudential tools to address growing financial imbalances .  \nIn thinking about the role of financial stability in the conduct of monetary policy, I find \nrecent research from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS)  to be compelling . This \nresearch sees financial market deregulation from the 1980s and 1990s as having increased the \nlikelihood of crises and posit s a growing financial cycle in which monetary policy responds \nasymmetrically over time to crises, easing rate s aggressively during the crisis bu t raising rates \nonly gradually  after the crisis has subsided . Their prescription  is for policymakers to break this \ncycle by making policy more attentive to financial imbalances and more symmetrical in the \nresponse.4  \nWe should take advantage of the current  economic conditions to bolster resilience in the \nfinancial system . Instead, the U.S. has yet to implement  a countercyclical buffer  and the banking \nagencies contemplate steps in the direction of relaxing capital requirements . Recently issued for \ncomment is a proposal to modify  the enhanced suppleme ntary leverage ratio on global \nsystemically important banks (GSIBs ) that would have the effect of lowering capital \nrequirements.5 With the U.S. ec onomy in a sustained expansion  and at risk of growing financial \n                                                 \n3 Tobias Adrian, Patrick de Fontnouvelle, Emily Yang, and Andrei Zlate, “ Macro -prudential Policy: A Case Study \nfrom a Tabletop Exercise ,” FRBNY Economic Policy Review , February 2017.  \n4 Claudio Borio, Piti Disyatat, Mikael Juselius, and Phurichai Rungcharoenkitkul, “ Monetary Policy in the Grip of a \nPincer Movement ,” BIS Working Paper No. 706.  \n5 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2018. “R ule Proposed to Tailor 'Enhanced Supplementary \nLeverage Ratio' Requirements .” Press release, April 11 .

And a number of long-running structural trends have become \nprominent considerations for understanding their  implications  for future growth . This landscape \nis accompanied by an economy growing at or above trend with full emp loyment , stable prices  \nand easy settings for monetary policy . Whatever the “new normal ” is, monetary policy is not yet \nthere . When times are good, as they are now, it is an opportune time to resolve some of the \nuncertainties around how we will implement mo netary policy in the future, what strategies we \nwill employ in response to the next downturn, and how can we best promote resilience and \nstability in our financial system . I hope we do so befor e we find ourselves cleaning up after the \nnext crisis ."

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMarch 8, 2018  \nEconomic Forum  \nLincoln, NE  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers or representatives.  \n  \n\n2 \n  I’m pleased to be in Lincoln with members of our Omaha B ranch office board of \ndirectors.  As a  regional Federal Reserve Bank president, I gain important insights about the \neconomic landscape of our District from visits like this one, where I have the opportunity to meet \nwith business and community leaders.  Your comments  and concerns about the econ omy, \ncombined with economic data and analysis, help inform my own views on monetary policy.  \n My remarks t his evening  will focus on the state of the economy and the current stance of \nmonetary policy.  In particular, I  want to highlight some key dynamics of the labor market, as we \nare experiencing the confluence of several cyclical and structural trends that are collectively \nreshaping the job market in Nebraska and the nation as a whole .   \nBefore I continue, however, I want to note that these are my own views  and are not \nnecessarily representative of others in the Federal Reserve System.  \n \nThe Nebraska Economy  \nAs we heard earlier tonight , the Nebraska economy  is relatively strong  and its \nunemployment rate is historically low.  I’d like to use the lens of the labor market to describe the \nopportunities and challenges that the state faces  as you collectively work to build and support a \nstrong economy.    \nRelative to th e nation, Nebraska has a strong  labor market with an unemployment rate \nbelow  the U.S. national average.  Just over a decade ago, prior to the financial crisis, Nebraska \nhad an unemployment rate of about 3 percent.  Following the financial crisis and during the \nrecession that ensued, Nebraska’s unemployment rate rose to about 5 percent , far less than the \nnational unemployment rate, which rose to 10 percent.  And at this current point in the ongoing \n\n3 \n economic expansion, Nebraska’s unemployment rate is 2.7 percent, suggesting that the labor \nmarket is tighter now across the state than it wa s back in 2007.  \nThis is very good news for the state as a whole, but it masks several underlying trends \nthat reveal that this improvement has not been experienced equall y across all parts of the state  \nand for all workers in the economy.   Within Nebraska, e mployment growth has been \nconcentrated in metro areas, particularly in Omaha and Lincoln, while the rural parts of the state \nhave struggled .  During the past four year s, employment in Nebraska ’s metro areas  has grown at \nan annual rate of 1.5 percent, while  in that same time there has been no empl oyment growth in \nnon-metro areas  of the state.  This widening divide of economic opportunities between rural and \nmetro areas represents a growing concern for our region and is a topic that the research staff at \nthe Kansas City Fed  will be analyzing . \nA second important trend that has broad implic ations for Nebraska’s economy is the \nongoing demographic shift in its  population.  During the past decade, Nebraska’s population of \nindividuals age 16 and above has grown by 8  percent.  But a large share of this population, the \nbaby boomers, are moving toward retirement, which implies that the labor force of available \nworkers may not be growing as quickly.  In fact, the number of prime -age individuals in \nNebraska, those aged 25  to 54, has actually declined by 3½ percent over the past decade.  If this \ntrend continues with an aging population that is not fully replaced by the next generation of \nworkers, this will create a significant headwind for growth prospects for the  state eco nomy .   \nAnd a third trend influencing the labor market is the ongoing shift in the types of skill s \nemployers demand .  In the past 40 years, advances in technology and computing , along with \nshifts toward an increasingly global economy , have dramatically alt ered the employment \nopportunities that firms are seeking to fill.  Jobs that were available in the past to workers with a \n\n4 \n high school degre e, such as assembly line work  in manufacturing plants and c lerical jobs  in \noffices, have  largely been automated.  As  those jobs ha ve gone away, new jobs have emerged, \nbut many require technical skills that workers need to obtain through training programs or \nadvanced education.   \nHow best to prepare our youth and young workers for success in this economy  is a \nchallenge facing Nebraska, along with the rest of the country .  In particular, young men are \nstruggling to adapt to this shift in employment opportunities .  A recent article in the Kansas City \nFed’s Economic Review  by Didem T üzemen describes how this  shift has contributed to an \nincrease d number of prime -age men who are leaving the labor force.1  Those men typically have \nonly a high school diploma and perhaps some college education.  For Nebraska, the share of \nprime -age men who are actively engaged in the labor force has declined by 1 percent during the \npast decade, which implies that approximately 10,000 men who would have been working in \nNebraska’s economy a decade ago are now sitting on the sidelines  and not looking for work \nbecause their skills are not in demand by employers.  \nBut this is also a national dilemma with no easy answers.  In addition to the slowdown in \nthe growth rate of the labor force due to the retirement of baby boomers , the missing prime -age \nmale workers are another  headwind on the n ational economy’s productive capacity.   \nLet me turn now to the outlook for the U.S. economy which, from a cyclical  perspective, \nlooks very robust, aside from this very challenging issue.  \n \nThe U.S. E conomic Outlook  \n                                                 \n1 Tüzemen, Didem. “ Why Are Prime -Age Men Vanishing from the Labor Force? ” Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas \nCity. Economic Review, First Quarter, 2018.  \n\n5 \n Almost nine years into the current expans ion, t he U.S. economy has, by most accounts, \nachieved full employment while maintaining a low and stable inflation rate. Preliminary \nestimates suggest that real GDP  — our broadest measure  of economic activity  — grew at an \nannual rate of just under 3 percent in the second half of last year .  Looking ahead, most \nforecasters expect continued moderate growth somewhat above the economy’s potential growth \nrate of roughly 1¾  percent  to 2 percent.  Such growth will likely lead to tighter conditions in \nlabor  and product  market s and, possibly, higher inflation.  As a result, the Federal Open Market \nCommittee —the Fed’s monetary policymaking body —has been g radually remov ing monetary \naccommodation by slowly increasing its target interest rate and allowing its balan ce sheet to \nshrink.   \nThat’s my outlook in a nutshell.  Let me now provide some detai ls in support of my \nperspective .   \nOne of the key drivers of the expansion has been consumer spending.  Consumers \nmaintained a moderate pace of spending during this econom ic expansion, generally in line with  \nthe moderate pace of income growth we have been seeing.  Looking forward, I expect consumers \nto continue providing a significant amount of support for this economic expansion, as jobs \ncontinue to be added and wage growt h is beginning to pick up in response to a tightening labor \nmarket. Recent changes to personal taxes will likely provide a modest boost to household \nspending this year and allow households to pay down debt , which has continued to grow \nthroughout the expans ion.  Over t ime, the contribution of the tax plan to consumer spending is \nlikely to fade , but still remain positive for spending as labor market conditions tighten . \nAdditional momentum to the economy has come from business spending on plant and \nequipment.  Business investment grew almost 6¼ percent in 2017, which represents a welcome \n\n6 \n step up from the negligible rate of growth during  the previous three years.  Equipment \ninvestment in particular has strengthened in re sponse to stronger global demand for U.S. \nmanufactured goods and commodities. In the last four quarters, it grew almost 9 percent.    \nLooking ahead,  the lower corporate tax rate and more favorable tax treatment of \ninvestment spending are expected to provide  a further modest boost to business spending  in the \ncoming years.  Longer -term factors, however, such as sluggish productivity growth and a \nsubdued rate of growth in the working -age population, are likely to remain a drag on investment \nspending going forwar d.  Intangible investment, such as in intellectual property and \ntechnological know -how, is likely to continue growing in importance relative to investment in \nphysical structures and machinery.   \nThe housing sector presents more of a mixed picture, with resi dential investment \nfluctuating around a moderate upward trend that is likely to persist.  Construction activity is \nconstrained by a shortage of qualified workers, difficulty obtaining financing by small builders, \nand the limited availability of undeveloped  land in desired locations.  Single -family sales are \nbeing significantly constrained by limited home listings. In contrast, demand for housing remains \nvery strong.  Many young adults who moved in  with their parents or found housemates following \nthe Great R ecession would now like to form their own househo lds but are finding  a lack of \nmoderately -priced apartments and houses. Similarly, f amilies who would like to upgrade from \nstarter single -family ho mes are also finding a  limited number of homes available for sale. With \nstrong demand but limited new supply, rents and sales prices are likely to continue to move up \nbriskly, even as mortgage rates normalize from the very low levels of recent years.  \n\n7 \n Finally, the national econo my will get a small boost in growth from federal government \nspending.  The  two-year budget agreement that Congress recently passed  raises spending caps \nfor fiscal year 2018 and 2019, allowing nearly $400 billion in additional spending.   \nWith this outlook,  I view inflation dynamics as broadly consistent with the Federal \nReserve’s goal of price stability.  Year -over-year inflation is currently running just under the \nFederal Reserve’s objective of 2 percent  as measured by the personal consumption expenditure \nprice index.  But I would expect to see inflation rising this year to around 2 percent.  This \nincrease r eflect s continued economic growth  at or above its long -run potential, a further \ntightening of labor markets, and rising import prices stemming from stro ng global demand.  \nRisks to the outlook appear to be predominately to the upside.  The sectors that were \nheadwinds on growth in the final quarter of last year suggest considerable momentum going into \nthe current year.  Imports, which subtracted almos t 2 pe rcentage points from the fourth  quarter \ngrowth rate, point to considerable domestic demand.  Likewise , inventories, which subtracted 0.7 \npercentage point from overall economic growth, should be a source of strength this year as \nproducers restock their shel ves. In addition, as I will discuss in a moment , monetary policy \nremains highly accommodative, and the recently enacted tax cuts and federal government \nspending increases suggest fiscal policy has turned more stimulative.  On top of these domestic \ndemand f actors, a synchronized global recovery , in which foreign demand for our goods and \nservices ,remain s quite solid , should contribute to the momentum going forward.  \n \nMonetary policy  \nLet me now turn to a review of monetary policy.  Although we have largely achieved our \nobjectives for maximum employment and price stability, the stance of monetary policy remains \n\n8 \n quite accommodative . The fed eral funds rate, which is  the overnight interest rate  the Federal \nReserve target s, remains well below estimates of its longer -run value of around 3 percent.  \nIn addition, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet remains extraordinarily large by \nhistorical standards due to  the FOMC’s large -scale purchases of longer -term Treasury and \nagency debt beginning in 200 8.  These programs , commonly referred as quantitative easing or \nQE, ended in October 2014 , and the process of shrinking the Fed’s balance sheet to reduce our \nholdings of Treasury and agency securities started last fall . By the end of this year, however, \nonly ab out a quarter of the increase to the Fed’s balance sheet resulting from the first round of \nlarge scale asset purchases will be unwound.   \nThese holdings of longer -term assets were intended to put downward pressure on  longer -\nterm interest rates.  Many inves tors responded, as would be expected, by purchasing riskier \nassets in a reach for higher yield.  As a result, asset prices may have become distorted relative to \nthe economic fundamentals.  The very slow pace of our balance sheet normalization may still be \ncontributing to a buildup of various financial imbalances.  While until r ecently, financial markets \nremained remarkably stable, it is not uncommon to see volatility rise when asset prices become \ninflated and investors struggle to find a new equilibrium.   \nWhat then should the stance of monetary policy be at this stage in the business cycle?  \nMonetary policy can be a useful tool to lean against the ups and downs of the business cycle, but \nit is not well suited to address structural problems in the economy such as job polarization. When \neconomic conditions reflect the combination of full employment, price stability and trend \neconomic growth —as they more or less do now —monetary policy should be a neutral influence \non the economy.  But the current setting of o ur target interest rate is still well below neutral.  I t \n\n9 \n is, therefore,  important that the FOMC continue on its current path of policy normalization with \ngradual increase s in the target federal funds rate.  \n \nConclusion  \n In closing, the good news is that th e U.S. economy is currently growing at a moderate \npace, with full employment and price stability.  As always, some regions and industries are doing \nbetter than others but, on the whole, economic conditions are good.  At the same time, monetary \npolicy remai ns accommodative.  To sustain the expansion without pushing the economy beyond \nits capacity limits and creating inflationary pressures, it will be important for the Federal Reserve \nto continue its gradual normalization of interest rates.  Given the current  momentum in the \neconomy, the FOMC will need to carefully calibrate its policy to lean against a potential buildup \nof inflationary pressure or financial market imbalances."

I appreciate the opportunity to join  you here this evening.  \nThe Tenth Federal Re serve Distric t covers a very large geography  and keeping tabs on \neconomic conditions in the region is an important aspect of my work .  Fortunately, I have a small \ngroup of economists at the Bank who  conduct research,  analyze data and survey key sectors of \nthe economy , but I also rely on individuals across the region who serve on our various boards \nand advisory groups.  The input and perspective of these individuals  and other contacts are key \nto our understanding of the economic conditions and emerging risks facing our region and the \nnation. The ir contributions  help to shape my views as I represent my region at the Federal Open \nMarket Committee (FOMC) .  In fact, t here are a number of individuals from the Wichita area \nwho assist th e Federal Reserve in this way,  and I would like to take a moment to acknowledge \nthem .  \nTrish Minard with Southwest National Bank here in Wichita, Kan. , recently joined the \nKansas City Fed’s Board of Directors. Although the Federal Reserve Board of Governor s in \nWashington, D.C., has oversight responsibilities  for the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks , each \nBank also  operate s under the leadership of a Board of Director s. This structure was designed by \nCongress to carefully balance public and private interests  in the oversight of the nation’s central \nbank.  The goal was to ensure broad representation in the Fed’s important policy deliberations \nwith ample opportunity for discussion and disagreement , while also providing insulation from \nthose who might seek to in fluence policy decisions for short -term political gain.  As a result, the \nindividuals who serve  on our board have a very important responsibility  within the Fed’s \nstructure .  \n\n3 \n Dan Solomon, chief financial officer  of Koch Chemical Technology Group, has been \ninvolved with our Ec onomic Advisory Council for several years , and I have appreciate d his \ninsights on regional, national and global economic trends .   \nI’d also like to recognize Michael DeBroeck, senior vice president with Intrust Bank , and \nBob Thurman, chief executive officer  of Credit Union of America, who have served on our \nPayments Advisory Group .  Additionally , Steve Radley, president of NetWork Kansas in \nAndover , serves  as a member of our Community Development Advisory Council – a group that \nregular ly informs and advises us on conditions in low-, and moderate -income communities . My \nthanks to each of these individuals for their service to the Kansas City Fed and for the \ncontributions they make to monetary policy deliberations.  \nWe have a lot going at t he Fed r ight now. At last week ’s FOMC meeting , we said our \nfarewells to Janet Yellen , whose term as Fed chair has ended. And on Monday  of this week , Jay \nPowell took the oath of office as the Fed’s new chairman .  He  is an experienced Fed governor \nwhose serv ice on the Board of Governors began in 2012.   Having worked with him the past \nseveral years, I think you can expect that Fed policy will continue along its current path , and I \nexpect a smooth transition.  \nOf course , this week’s headlines have been f ocused o n the market’s reaction to last \nFriday’s employment report and potential inflation  risks . So, this evening, I’ll share with you my \nviews on the outlook for the nation’s economy and the challenges ahead for the Federal Open \nMarket Committee over the near - and long er-term. I’ll plan to leave time a t the end of my \nremarks  to take your questions, comments or advice.  \n\n4 \n Before continuing, now would be a good time to remind you that the views I express this \nevening are my own and not those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market \nCommittee.   \n \nCurrent econom ic conditions  \nThe fundamentals of the U.S. economy are sound.  Preliminary estimates suggest that real \nGDP  — our broadest measure  of economic activity  — grew at an annual rate of just under 3 \npercent in the second half of last year  with robust consumer activity and  a solid increase in \nbusiness spending on fixed investment.   \nThis current expansion has been a long one and it has draw n millions of Americans into \nthe workforce as labor markets have strengthened.  The unemployment rate has fallen to a \nhistorically low 4.1 percent.  Here in Wichita, labor market conditions are somewhat tighter with \nthe unemployment rate at 3.8 percent.  \nHiring remains solid with payroll employment gains averaging 192,000 per month over \nthe last three months . But t he pace  of payroll gains has been gradually slow ing since the peak in \n2014, and I expect those numbers will decelerate further as labor markets continue to tighten and \nfirms find filling job openings increasingly difficult .  \nAs labor markets have tightened, compensation for workers has increased.  This is a \nwelcome development because wage growth has been fairly modest through muc h of the current \nexpansion.   \nAnother favorable aspect of the current expansion is that inflation has remained low even \nas the economy has experienced above -trend growth and a tightening job market.  This has \nhelped workers by allowing wage increases to out pace inflation.  Year -over-year inflation is \n\n5 \n currently running just under the Federal Reserve’s objective of 2 percent , although I expect it \nwill begin to rise as labor markets tighten further and global demand  pushes up import prices .  \nTaken together, the se current conditions and the near -term outlook appear quite rosy.  \nYou might think in a scenario like this, Federal Reserve policymakers would have  an opportunity \nto relax a bit. Unfortunately , that is not the case.  \n \nNear -term challenges  \nAlthough the fina ncial crisis is now well behind us, and we have largely achieved our \nobjectives for employment and inflation, the stance of monetary policy remains quite \naccommodative . The fed eral funds rate, which is  the overnight interest rate  we target , remains \nwell be low estimates of its longer -run value of around 3 percent.  \nIn addition, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet remains extraordinarily large by \nhistorical standards due to  the FOMC’s large -scale purchases of longer -term Treasury and \nagency debt beginning in 2007.  These programs , commonly referred to as quantitative easing or \nQE, ended in October 2014 and the process of shrinking the Fed’s balance sheet to reduce these  \nholdings started last fall . By the end of this year, only about a quarter of the increase to the Fed’s \nbalance sheet resulting from the first round of large scale asset purchases will be unwound.   \nAs monetary  policy accommodation is gradually withdraw n, the economy is getting  a \nboost from fiscal policy related to the recent tax bill . How much of a boost is hard to tell at this \nstage .  \nIn our surveys of manufacturers across our District , the expectations of future activity \nhave increased since the bill was signed. This is potentially good news for Wichita, where the \neconomy is heavily reliant on  manufacturing , a sector that  experienced a net job loss last year. \n\n6 \n Overall, I expect that l ower personal tax rates will boost aggregate demand, and that a lower \ncorporate tax rate and the more favorable tax treatment of investment spending will increase \naggregate supply, although it is difficult to predict exactly how and when consum ers and \nbusinesses will respond .  \nThe result is that an uncertain degree of fiscal stimulus is arriving at the same time the \neconomy is operating at or beyond full employment and monetary policy remains \naccommodative.   And because of that, it is important that the FOMC continue s on its current \npath of policy normalization with gradual increase s in the target federal funds rate. The median \nprojection from the FOMC’s Summary of E conomic Projections calls for about three, 25  basis \npoint hikes in the federal funds rate this year and about the same number next year. This is a \nreasonable basel ine unless the outlook changes  materially .  \n \nLonger -run challenges  \nWhile t hreading this policy needle will be a key challenge over the next couple of years, \nthere are also a number of structural developments that could pose challenges over the longer \nrun.  The nature of these structural issues is beyond the scope of monetary poli cy to address, but \nthey will nevertheless have implications for economic growth, employment and inflation and \ndeserve careful monitoring.  \nAmong these is the slowdown that we have seen over the last several years in the \neconomy’s potential growth rate. This  is the rate of growth consistent with maintaining the Fed’s \ndual mandate of price stability and full employment. By most estimates, this rate was falling \nbefore the financial crisis and is currently believed to be about one -half of what it was in the \n1990 s.  This slowdown in the economy’s potential growth stems from slower growth in the size \n\n7 \n of the potential  work force and the productivity  of that workforce .  Due largely to demographic \nchanges, especially  the retiring of the Baby Boom generation, the annual  growth rate of our labor \nforce is only a little better than one -third of what it was in the 1990s. At the same time, \nproductivity growth is about one -half what it was in the 1990s. Both of these unfavorable trends \nare projected to persist over the next de cade.  While these projections are highly uncertain, if they \nprove accurate, we can expect , among other things, a slower rate of improvement in living \nstandards relative to the pre -crisis period.   \nSlower potential growth also has some troubling implication s from a monetary policy \nperspective .  For one thing, it has led many economists to lower their estimate of the interest rate \nthat is consistent with full employment and price stability. Currently, the FOMC’s median \nprojection for the longer -run federal funds rate is around 3 percent, which is considerably below \nwhat it was only a few years ago . This means that a future FOMC may have substantially less \nroom to lower the federal funds rate should conditions warrant an increase in monetary stimulus.   \nIn such situation s, for example a future recession,  it might prove  helpful for fiscal policy to step \nin and provide a countercyclical stimulus.   \nBut that leads me to another structural challenge —the unsustainable trend of government \ndebt. This will make  it difficult for fiscal policy to play that countercyclical role.   \nThe federal budget deficit increased as a share of GDP for the third straight year in fiscal \n2017, and it was widely expected to creep higher over time even before the recent tax cuts.  \nDemographic trends will raise government spending as an increasing share of the population \nreceives retirement and health care benefits.  Additionally, health care costs are projected to \ngrow faster than the economy, as are the federal government’s net inte rest costs.   \n\n8 \n In all, federal debt held by the public, which was equal to about 35 percent of GDP \nbefore the recession, is now up to 7 5 percent of GDP.  It is projected to exceed its historical \n(WWII) peak of 106 percent by the 2030s , barring a shift in fis cal policy.  The nation remains far \nfrom a fiscal crisis, but changes will be necessary to put government debt on a sustainable \ntrajectory in the coming decades.  The sooner these changes can be made , the less drastic they \nwill need to be and the better po sitioned fiscal policy will be to take a more prominent counter -\ncyclical role in any future downturn.  \n \nConclusion  \nIn closing, over the longer run, demographic trends and sluggish productivity point to the \npossibility of slower economic growth and higher f iscal deficits.   These structural developments \nhave the potential to complicate monetary policy.  If the neutral rate of interest remains \nhistorically low, monetary policy may have less scope to stimulate the economy in a downturn \nwithout again resorting to unconventional policies such as asset purchases.  A natural response to \nsuch a situation would be to rely more heavily on fiscal policy.  However, the longer -run fiscal \noutlook suggests that fiscal policy may be similarly constrained.  Thus, it is criti cal that the \nlonger -run budget issues associated with our aging population be addressed sooner rather than \nlater.    \nIn the near term , the good news is that the U.S. economy is currently growing at a \nmoderate pace, with full employment and price stability.   As always, some regions and industries \nare doing better than others but, on the whole, economic conditions are good.  At the same time, \nmonetary policy remains accommodative.  To sustain the expansion without pushing the \n\n9 \n economy beyond its capacity limit s and creating inflationary pressures, it will be important for \nthe Federal Reserve to continue its gradual normalization of interest rates."
