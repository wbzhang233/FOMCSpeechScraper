It is my pleasure to be here to offer my observations on what may \nbe one of the most ambitious undertakings in the history of our national  payment \nsystem —the public -private engagement that is taking shape to improve the system’s \nspeed, efficiency  and security . This engagement is designed to meet the growing \ndemand s of American consumers and business es that continue to shift toward  e-\ncommerce and Internet -enabled technologies  in their da ily transactions .  \nTo some, it may seem like an unusual approach that we’ve taken , but it is not a \nnew one at its core . Based on a history of mutual cooperation on payments  issues  \nbetween the Federal Reserve and the private sector , we have seen public -private \nengagement s yield important gains for the country . Such collaboration in the past \nproduced outcomes that contributed to a more resilient payments system and provided \nsignificant benefits  to the public, such as  the development of routing numb ers, the growth \nof the automated clearing house network, and the crafting of Check 21 legislation.1 \nI’m encouraged by the recent progress that we’ve made  with the current effort , \nand it is my own conviction that the prospects for achieving the goals we’ve set out are \nbest realized by working together.  The organizers of this conference used the right word \nin naming it.  It is imperative  that we modernize the  payment s system, and also that the \nFederal Reserve and the industry join together  in this effort.  \nIn my remarks this morning, I will preface my observations about the status of our \nwork by reflecting on the nature of the challenge s we face  and the strategies that have \nbeen framed to address them . These strategies, as you know, are the product of the \nFederal Reserve ’s deliberate and broad consultation with a multitude of stakeholders \n                                                 \n1 See: Medley, Bill. Highways of Commerce: Central  Banking and the U.S. Payments System . Federal \nReserve Bank of Kansas City. 2014.  \n\n \n2 \n involved in  payment s system modernization . That input importantly shaped the paper \nissued in January of this year by the Federal Reserve Board and the Re serve Banks , titled \nStrategies for  Improving the U.S. Payment System .  \n \nThe challenge  \n  Since e -commerce took hold  in the United States more than  20 years ago , it has \ngrown rapidly in volume, speed and capability and has transformed retail and business -\nto-business commer ce. Among the most profound and pervasive changes has been t he \nrising  expectation of consumers and business es for continuous improvement s in speed \nand efficiency.  People who have come to expect regular upgrades in computers and \ncommunications  technology  have also come to expect more functionality from their \ncomputers , tablets  and smart phones to help them buy things.  And so, same -day delivery \nof almost anything , for example, has become a way of life  that most of us could not have \nimagined  even a few years ago.  \n It was also some  20 years ago  that online banking became common ly available , \nand here , too, there has been significant growth in speed, volume and the range of \nservices  that banks provide . Simply put, Americans who demand fast and dependable \ndelivery of wh at they buy and sell want their payments to keep up.  An analysis \ncommissioned by the Fed eral Reserve  found that each year there are 29 billion payments \nfor which real -time or near -real-time delivery would be desirable to end users.  One-third \nof consumers a nd fully three -fourths  of businesses want real -time payments , and they are \nnow willing to pay  for them . \n\n \n3 \n   The growth of e -commerce and advances in communication  have spurred \ninnovation  and new business opportunities in the United States.  Some o f the most  \nvaluable, innovative and admired  businesses in the world are technology companies  that \nwere founded here and remain here.  But the sizable and widespread economic gains from \nthese advances require a payment system that meets the demands of consumers and \nbusinesses.  We have seen a  number of other countries mov e forward with faster and \nmore -efficient payment systems to better serve their citizens and compete with the United \nStates for new and expanding business . With this advanced capability, however, has \ncome a significant and evolving threat to the s ecurity of banking and commerce . The \nneed to stay ahead of this threat alone is a compelling reason to modernize the payment \nsystem.  \n \nDesired outcomes  \nThese challenge s prompted the Federal Reserve to undertake careful study several \nyears ago and to seek extensive public input  about the need to improve the U.S. payment \nsystem.  By 2013, the Federal Reserve identified certain desired outcomes , based on its \nown analysis and private sector input .  \nLet me describe tho se desired outcomes as a way to remind  you of where we are \nheaded . First and foremost is the development of a  safe and  faster electronic solution for \nmaking a variety of business and personal payments  that is both ubiquitous and available \non demand.  Such a  system would be  supported by a flexible and cost -effective means for \npayment clearing and settlement that would be  rapid and final.   \n\n \n4 \n Our second  desired outcome is a payment  system that remains safe and resilient . \nAny enhancements to  speed and efficiency m ust maintain both the privacy and integrity \nof our system and allow for continuous improvements to security as threats emerge and \nevolve.  Specifically, w e anticipate  potential improvements to the Federal Reserve’s \npublicly  available payment fraud data as well as  additional payment security research.  \nWe also look forward to sharing our results with payment stakeholders because we \nbelieve they will help inform future industry actions and policy decisions.  \nEfficiency is a third desired outcome . A reliable alternative to th e 18 billion paper \nchecks  written each year  could reduce th e average end -to-end cost of payment \ntransactions  and allow innovative payment services to  deliver better  value to consumers \nand businesses alike.  \n Our fourth desired outcome focuses on access  and efficiency  in cross -border \npayments.  A new payment system should offer better choices for U.S. consumers and \nbusinesses to send and receive convenient, cost -effective and timely cross -border \npayments.  We hea rd widespread support for  this goal among stakeholders.  Although \nthere is a range  of views about the priority for such payments , few dispute that the cost \nand convenience of cross -border payments have not kept pace with the impact o f \nglobalization.   \nOur fi fth desired outcome is simple : We need to work together . The Federal \nReserve cannot implement meaningful payments improvement on its own , and the \ncompetitive forces driving industry inn ovation mean the private sector’s ability to meet \nthe public’s needs would benefit from the kind of coordination and collaboration that the \nFederal Reserve  is uniquely positioned to provide.  Working together, w e believe the \n\n \n5 \n private sector can and should be able to provide the innovat ion necessary to address the \nneeds of the market .  \n \nMaking progress toward these g oals  \nFollowing our review of public comments and lengthy consult ation with \nstakeholders, the Federal Reserve Board and the Reserve Banks issued in January of this \nyear a paper that outlined strategies  for improving the payment system .  \nThese strategies represent  the first steps in a roadmap for payments \nmodernization , and they define the appro ach for how the Fed eral Reserve  will work with \nthe private sector.  We expect and encourage private industry to advanc e these goals by \noffering its own ideas and plans . But we also expect to see cooperation and, at some \npoint, visible evidence of both commitment and progress from all stakeholders.  \n Since the strategies paper was published  early this year , active engagement has \ntaken shape  with the creation of two task forces . One is focused on faster payments and \nthe other on the security  of payments .  \nOne way of describing the breadth of this effort is that many in this audience  \nalready are  members themselves or part of organizations represented on one or both task \nforces . At last count, the faster payments task force has more than 320 members and the \nsecure payments task force more than 170.  There are represen tatives of technology \nproviders;  small, medium a nd large financial institutions; payments networks; t rade \nassociations; business end users and consumers;  and a small number of government \nofficials.  Each task force  has chosen a steering committee , and w ork streams are \nunderway .  \n\n \n6 \n The Faster Payments Task Force, with its large and diverse membership, began \nwork  on criteria that will describe the standards for effectiveness in delivering faster \npayments . Members of the Secure Payments Task Force and a work group of legal  \nsubject matter experts are providing specialized input to that work . When finalized, these  \ncriteria will serve as both a description of stakeholder needs that the market can use to \nguide  faster payments innovation and a tool for the task f orce itself to assess alternative \napproaches for faster payments  solutions . \n The task force also has developed  and approved  a decision -making framework . \nThis framework ensures  that its decisions and work  products have broad support of the \ntask force membership, including support within and across the different stakeholder \ngroups represented.  Just yesterday, the Faster Payments Task force posted to the \nFedPaymentsImprovement .org website the latest draft of the criteria along with a survey \nto gather even broader public input . This effort to finalize the faster payments  \neffectiveness criteria  in the coming months  remains on track .   \nTo prepare for the evaluation of different approaches to payment modernization, \nthe Faster Payments Task Force is currently working to carefully define a process for \nencouraging the best ideas to come forward and assessing them against the effectiveness \ncriteria . In addition to identifying effective solutions for faster payments, the task force \nwill note the foundational aspects of a faster payment system that no single  solution \nprovider can deliver independently, and when implemented , will enable those providers \nto interoperate and deliver to end users a consistent, accessible and universal faster \npayments experience.  Finally, the task f orce will highlight strategic issues and gaps that it \n\n \n7 \n believes must be addressed to pave the way for successful implementation and \nwidespread ado ption of these solutions.   \nTurning to t he Secure Payments Task F orce, its work has begun with a focus on \nthe security needed for faster payments solutions , including a high priority on identity \nmanagement and authentication and finding more effective ways to protect sensitive \ninformation that travels through the payment system.  Importantly, however, the work of \nthe Secure Payments Task Force extends beyond the security needed for new faster \npayments.  It is also focused on curren t payment networks and channels . As threats \nchange , they are considering better ways to share fraud and cyber -threat information and \nto analyze such data.  Finally, t he Secure Payments Task Force will advise the Fed eral \nReserve  on priorities related to paym ents security standards , research  and education in \norder to promote enhanced safety of payments systems old and new.  \nAs the task forces continue their work, the Federal Reserve  will do its part to \nensure  that the process is progressing smoothly toward the desired outcomes I noted \nearlier . Task force m embership will continue to be representative of diverse stakeholder \nperspectives and interests, and we will recruit when appropriate to fulfill that goal . We \nwant active task force participation that contributes to and takes ownership of work \nproducts and decisions.  We will facilitate interaction and ensure processes and tools are \nin place to support the development of high -quality work produc ts that achieve task force \nobjectives.  In all of this, we wa nt to promote a process that carefully considers the \ninterests of all stakeholders, objectively evaluates different proposals, and arrives at an \napproach that will have broad support.  The hallmark of this process will be transparency \nand good communication , which are essential to reaching consensus.    \n\n \n8 \n Let me conclude by emphasizing  that the progress achieved so far has been \nimpressive and encouraging.  I remain confident t hat this collaborative approach to \npayment  system reform maximizes  our chances for succ ess. I am also realistic.  The task \nforces have made s ubstantive progress, but there is some distance to go before realizing \nour goals.  I fully expect that we will face challenges along the way.  But I am convinced \nthe end is worth the journey , and the Federal Reserve is  committed to working with \nindustry stakeholders to get there for the public’s sake .",

        "content": "Weighing  the Costs  of Waiting  \n \n \n \n \nEsther  L. George  \nPresident  and Chief  Executive  Officer  \nFederal  Reserve  Bank  of Kansas  City \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJuly 9, 2015  \nOklahoma  Economic  Forum  \nStillwater,  Oklahoma  \nThe views  expressed  by the author  are her own and do not necessarily  reflect  those  of the Federal  Reserve  System,  \nits governors,  officers  or representatives.   \n\n1 \n Seven  years  ago, our economy  was dealt  a tremendous  blow.  The financial  crisis  and \ndeep  recession  required  massive  bailouts  and aggress ive, unconventional  monetary  policy  \nactions  to restore  financial  stability  and economic  growth.  And yet, seven  years  later,  uncertainty  \nlingers  about  the durability  and strength  of financial  reforms  and of the economy  itself.  Clearly , \nthe financial  crisis  of 2008  cast a long shadow.  \nIn my remarks  today,  I will offer  my own observations  about  the current  state of the \neconomy  and why I believe  the Federal  Reserve  should  start the process  of interest  rate \nnormalization  sooner  rather  than later.  I’ll close  with some  perspectives  on the state of key \nregulatory  reforms  affecting  the banking  industry  and, in particular , the nation’s community  \nbanks.   \nThese  are my own views  and not those  of the Federal  Open  Market  Committee  or the \nFederal  Reserve  System.  \n \nThe economic  outlook  \nIn 2013,  during  my first voting  rotation  on the Federal  Open  Market  Committee,  I did not \nsupport  additional  stimulus  in the form  of a third  round  of asset  purchases.  By then,  the \nimmediate  crisis  had passed,  the economy  was slowly  expandin g for its third  consecutive  year,  \nand monetary  policy  settings  remained  extraordinarily  accommodative.  At the end of my voting  \ncycle,  I fully  anticipated  that a return  to more -normal  interest  rates  would  require  a lengthy  and \ngradual  adjustment  process.  But, I did not imagine  that in 2015  we might  still have  the same  \npolicy  stance.  \nDuring  the past five years,  the U.S. economy  has grown  at a moderate  pace each year,  \nlabor  markets  have  healed—albeit  with scars  from  the recession—and inflation  has remained  \n\n2 \n low. This year,  the economy  had a slower -than-expected  start.  The soft GDP  report  for the first \nquarter  reflected  some  temporar y factors  that held down  growth  but are unlikely  to persist  going  \nforward.  Looking  ahead,  I expect  the economy  to resume  its expa nsion  at an above -trend  growth  \nrate through  the end of the year and labor  market  conditions  to continue  improving.   \nConsumer  spending,  the largest  part of our economy,  will likely  grow  at a healthy  rate in \nthe quarters  ahead  due to an improving  labor  marke t, rising  wealth  and lower  gasoline  prices  \nrelative  to where  they were  last year.  Moreover,  as the economy  continues  to heal and domestic  \ndemand  continues  to strengthen,  businesses  should  have  more  incentives  to increase  capital  \nexpenditures.  I also expect  housing  construction  to provide  a tailwind  to growth  as more  adults  \npack  up and move  out of their parents’ home  or away  from  living  with roommates  to start their \nown households.  Construction  of multi family  units,  in particular,  has been  strong  due to rising  \ndemand  from  younger  workers  and the decisions  of some  baby  boomers  to downsize .  \nIn terms  of the labor  market,  the economy  added  3 million  jobs over the past year. For \nperspective,  consider  that the economy  did not even  add this many  new jobs over a one-year \nperiod  at any point  during  the housing  bubble  years.  You would  need  to go back  to the late 1990s  \ntech-bubble  era to find a period  when  jobs were  being  added  at a similar  pace.  In addition  to the \nnumber  of jobs,  we are seeing  better  jobs.  For example,  work ers today  are flowing  into more -\nstable  employment  relationships , and workers  with a high-school  diploma  or some  college  are \nfinding  employment  in higher -skilled  occupations,  something  that was not occurring  in the years  \nfollowing  the crisis.1 \nTaken  together,  the economic  data generally  point  to an economy  that is moving  in the \nright  direction  and has consistently  sustained  growth  over the past five years.  This is not to say \n                                                 \n1 See “Opportunity  Knocks:  Improved  Matching  of Jobs and Workers” by Didem  Tuzemen  and Jonathan  Willis.  The \nMacro  Bulletin , Federal  Reserve  Bank  of Kansas  City,  May 13, 2015.  \n\n3 \n the economy  is issue -free. There  are pockets  of the labor  market  that continue  to struggle.  \nResearch  shows  that workers  who enter  the labor  force  during  the lean years  of a recession  and \nrecovery  experience  long-lasting  scarring  effects  on their earning  potential.2 Millions  of workers  \nhad difficulty  finding  employment  and missed  some  experience  needed  to jump -start their \ncareers,  resulting  in fewer  skills,  underdeveloped  resumes  and lower  earnings.  In addition,  \nproductivity  growth,  which  ultimately  drives  living  standards  higher,  has been  notably  soft in \nrecent  years.  And, global  economic  concerns  can pose unpredictable  risks  to our economy.  \nUnfortunately,  although  we might  wish  it so, monetary  policy  is not the proper  tool to \naddress  all of these  issues.  The aggressive  monetary  actions  over the past few years  were  \nintended  to support  economic  activity,  help labor  markets  heal and move  inflation  toward  the \nFed’s target.  I view  the considerable  progress  in labor  markets  and the relatively  steady inflation  \nrate as encouraging.  However,  keeping  interest  rates  near zero to achieve  still further  progress  \ntoward  labor  market  improvement  and higher  inflation  is risky  in my view.   \nIn a protracted  period  of exceptionally  low rates,  investors  seeking  out higher  returns  are \nwilling  to take on more  risk or seek out more  creative  financing  approaches.  When  the economy  \nis expanding  and rates  remain  low, adverse  events  may appear  less likely  or far into the future,  \npotentially  resulting  in the mispricing  of risk and financial  assets.  Waiting  too long to adjust  \nrates,  as we’ve seen in the past, can leave  policymakers  with few and possibly  poor options .  \n \nSeparating  the signal  from  the noise  \nThe FOMC  has been  talking  about  its exit strategy  since  2011.  And since  March  of this \nyear,  the Committee  has been  emphasizing  that a decision  to raise  interest  rates  would  be data \n                                                 \n2 See “Long -Term  Nonemployment  and Job Displacement ” by Jae Song  and Till von Wachter,  presented  at the \nFederal  Reserve  Bank  of Kansas  City’s  2014  Jackson  Hole  Economic  Policy  Symposium.  \n\n4 \n dependent.  In other  words,  economic  data that confirms  further  gains  in the economy’s \nperformance  will drive  the timing  of the Committee ’s action s.  \nSo, why hasn’t the FOMC  yet raised  rates?  There  are of course  different  views  on the \neconom ic data we receive  and analyze  that lead to legitimate,  differing  views  about  what  is best \nfor the economy.  The Federal  Reserve  is charged  with objectives  that take into account  \nemployment  and inflation  in order  to foster  stable  long-term growth  in the economy.  The FOMC  \nis committed  to pursuing  those  objectives , but policymakers  may differ  on the appropriate  path \nto achiev e these long-run goals.  \nOf course,  the economic  data we rely on can, and often  does in the short  run, send \nconflicting  signals,  and it is quite  challenging  to measure  economic  activity  in an $18 trillion,  \ndynamic  economy.  As a result, policymakers  are faced  with an unclear  path for moving  interest  \nrates.  Those  choices  are all the more  difficult  as we must  rely on backward -looking  data to frame  \na forecast  that takes  into account  the long lags of interest  rate changes.   \nUnder  such circumstances , the Federal Reserve  must  be especially  careful  to avoid  \nreacting  to the last data point  to determine  policy.  Instead,  it should  focus  on longer -run trends  as \nit seeks  to understand  the economy’ s future  course  and to map the best policy  to assure  it \nremains  on course.  The real challenge  when  the data disappoints  is discerning  whether  it is due \nto temporary  factors  or an early  signal  that underlying  momentum  in the economy  is changing.   \nTake  the first quarter  of this year as an example.  The current  estimate  is that the economy  \ncontracted  in the first quarter  after three  quarters  of relatively  strong  growth.  While  this headline  \nnumber  raises  caution  for policymakers,  other  factors,  as I mentioned  earlier,  suggest  the slowing  \nis likely  to be temporary.  Severe  winter  weather  and labor  negotiations  concerning  dock  workers  \nlikely  took a short -lived  toll on growth.  At the same  time,  however,  the economy  added  nearly  \n\n5 \n 600,000  new jobs in the first three  months  of this year.  So even  though  the economy  appeared  to \nslow  a bit in the first quarter,  businesses  kept hiring , and the data for the second  quarter  suggest  \nthe economy  is again  expanding.  Thus,  in the face of consistent  positive  trends,  delaying  actions  \nfor more  positive  data can be unwise.   \nConside r as another  example  measures  of inflation , which  have  been  running  below  the \nFed’s  stated  inflation  goal. Since  2012,  the Federal  Reserve  has defined  2 percent  inflation  as \n“most  consistent  over the longer  run with the Federal  Reserve’s statutory  mandate”  of price  \nstability.  Does  inflation  below  2 percent  justif y waiting  longer  to raise  rates?  The answer  \nrequires  a deeper  look at the data.  Much  of the decline  in inflation  comes  from  a dramatic  fall in \nenergy  prices  throughout  the second  half of 2014  and low import  prices  from  a strong  dollar.  The \nswings  in energy  and food prices  certainly  matter  for households  and are an important  \ncomponent  of the inflation  measure,  but sometimes  it’s also sensible  to look at price  changes  that \nexclude  these  volatile  goods.  Along  these  lines,  the core measure  of inflation  is running  at 1.2 \npercent  over the past year and has moved  up to a 1.7 percent  pace over the past three  months . \nThis data suggest  to me that we understand  why inflation  has been  low, and as some  temporary  \nfactors  fade,  it will likely  move  back  toward  the Fed’s  goal.  \nPart of our job is to look through  the noise  and act in the economy’s long-run best \ninterest.  Separating  the signal  from  the noise  is always  difficult  and is usually  clear  only with \nhindsight.  Because  monetary  policy  decisions  are made  in real time,  waiting  for more  data before  \ntaking  an action  can be a trap. More  data is always  on its way,  and waiting  for clarity  too often  \ncause s decisions  to be persistently  postponed.  \n \n \n\n6 \n Timing  is everything  \nThe continued  improvement  in the labor  market , combined  with low and stable  inflation , \nconvince  me that modestly  higher  short -term interest  rates  are appropriate.  Current  guideposts,  or \n“policy  rules,”  often  used to inform  monetary  policy  decisions  also have been  signaling  that \ninterest  rates  should  be higher.  \nI recognize  that a rate increase,  however,  would  be the first one in nearly  a decade.  So I \nam not suggesting  rates  should  be normalized  quickly  or that policy  should  be tight.  Although  \nthe economy  has improved,  economic  fundamentals  could  well mean  an accommodative  stance  \nof policy  is appropriate  for some  time.  I would  like to avoid  the cost of waiting  for more  \nevidence  and further  postponing  liftoff,  drawing  on a valuable  lesson  from  monetary  policy  \ndecisions  in 2003.   \nAt that time,  the federal  funds  rate was held at a very low level—1 percent—because  \npolicymakers  were  concerned  about  low inflation  and had postponed  initiating  the tightening  \ncycle  in response.  Inflation  excluding  food and energy  in late 2003  was running  at about  1.3 \npercent,  not dissimilar  from  today.  The unemployment  rate was slightly  below  6 percent , again,  \nnot dissimilar  from  today.   \nBy the middle  of 2004,  core inflation  increased  to 2 percent  as the unemployment  rate \ncontinued  to decline.  A gradual  tightening  cycle  began  in June of 2004.  Core  inflation  then \nmoved  persistently  above  2 percent,  and the labor  market  began  to overheat  amid  one of the most  \nhistoric  credit  bubbles  in U.S. history.    \nOf course,  many  would  argue  that we do not face a similar  buildup  of leverage  today  and \nthat the recov ery remains  fragile.  Perhaps  so, and perhaps  this time it's different.  However,  \n\n7 \n economic  trends  and experience  suggest  otherwise.  And we would  be wise to act modestly  but \nact now.   \n  \nProgress  on regulatory  reforms  \n In addition  to the lessons  for monetary  policy,  the recent  crisis  taught  us of the expanding  \nchallenges  following  from  an increasingly  concentrated  and fragile  financial  system.  While  the \nlargest  financial  institutions  are meant  to be engines  of growth,  they also pose outsized  risk to the \neconomy.  With  that in mind,  I take note that this month  marks  the fifth anniver sary of the \nsigning  of the Dodd -Frank  Act, the law that aimed  to remedy  problems  associated  with the 2008  \nfinancial  crisis and, in particular , sought  to end the status  of “too big to fail.” While  regulators  \nhave  worked  diligently  over the past five years  to implement  new rules,  debate  about  the law’s  \nvarious  provisions  continue s.  \nImplementing  rules  focused  on limiting  certain  risky  activities  has proved  difficult.  For \nexample,  the law prohibits  banks  from  conducting  proprietary  trading  and from  investing  in \nhedge  and private  equity  funds.  Regulators  have  struggled  with complexity  in writing  this rule, \nand banks  have  lobbied heavily  against  it. The final rule was not approved  until late 2013  and did \nnot go into effect  until April  of last year. The deadline  for fully  complying  with the rule could  \nextend  into 2017.    \nAnother  provision  aimed  at limiting  risky  activities  has already  been  repealed.  The so- \ncalled  push -out rule was designed  to move  trading  of credit  default,  commodity  and equity  swaps  \nout of federally -insured  depositories  to non-insured  operating  affiliates.  Congress  reversed  this \npart of the law last December , allowing  the nation’s largest  banks  to continue  their swaps  trading  \nwith the benefit  of public  safety  nets.   \n\n8 \n Also  core to the objectives  of the Dodd -Frank  reforms  was preventing  future  government  \nrescues  of big banks.  Last week,  another  round  of resolutio n plans,  referred  to as living  wills,  \nwas submitted  to the regulators.  It remains  open,  if not doubtful,  whether  a credible  resolution  \nprocess  can be codified  so as to eliminate—or even  minimize —the pressure  to rescue  a large  \ninsolvent  bank  with taxpayer  money.   \nOf course  many  point  to the progress  made  in strengthening  capital  levels  of the largest  \nbanks.  Today,  the 10 largest  banks  hold $8 of tangible  equity  for every  $100 of assets , far more  \nthan the $3 held in 2008 . However,  if the full value  of derivatives  is include d in assets,  as \nrequired  under  international  standards,  the ratio of capital -to-assets  is only 5 ½ percent. \nCompared  to more  than 10 percent  held by the nation’s community  banks , further  progress  is \nneeded.    \nFinally,  a large  segment  of the banking  industry  composed  of thousands  of community  \nbanks  faces a regulatory  overlay  intended  for those  engaged  in global  markets  and riskier  \nactivities.  Multiple  bills to provide  relief  from  certain  provisions  of the Dodd -Frank  Act have  \nbeen  proposed.  Most  practical  and promising  is a proposal  by FDIC  Vice  Chairman  Tom  Hoenig  \nthat focuses  on calibrating  regulation  according  to a bank’s activities  and complexity  rather  than \nsize. I hope  it is receiving  serious  consideration  in the interest  of a stronger  and more -stable  \nfinancial  system.  \n \nConclusion  \nThe U.S. economy  and its financial  system  have  made  notable  progress  over the past five \nyears.  Regulatory  reforms  and monetary  policy  have  been  necessary  ingredients  in achieving  this \nprogress.  But it is time to recalibrate  these  measures.   \n\n9 \n Our regulatory  efforts  must  remain  centered  on ending  too big to fail without  \nundermining  the health  and diversity  of the financial  system.  Likewise,  monetary  policy  must  \nstep back  and allow  market  forces  to resume  their critical  role of pricing  risk and allocating  \ncapital  to its best use. Although  an accommodative  stance  of policy  may be needed  for some  \ntime during  this transition,  monetary  policy  cannot  solve  every  economic  challenge  we face.  \nStarting  now to move  rates up slowly  and deliberately  will allow  the economy  to adjust  to a \nmore -normal  and, in my view,  appropriate  stance  of monetary  policy  that will lead to long-term \ngrowth.",

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConcluding Remarks  \n“The Puzzle of Payments Security”  \nInternational Payments Policy Conference  \nKansas City, Mo.  \nJune 26, 2015  \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers or representatives.   \n\n1 \n  \n I want to thank the program presenters and discussants for the insights they’ve brought to \nthis most important and timely issu e of retail payments security. The conference has highl ighted \nencouraging areas of progress , including  technology, information sharing and  collaborative \nefforts  among financ ial institutions , networks, consumers and regulators. It also has served as a \nreminder that sizeable challenges remain . \nThe Federal Reserve has a keen interest in promoting the safety and the security of the \nnation’ s payments system , given its impact on the broader economy and public trust . As both an \noperator and an overseer within the payments system, the Federal Reserve is prepared to \nleverage its central bank roles to bring about critical improvements for payments security . \nAlthou gh the Federal Reserve is relatively unique among c entral banks in terms of its \nretail payments operator role, public authorities around the world have become more active in \nraising concerns about  retail payments security. Some authorities play explicit ro les with public \nmandates, while others rely on leadership to induce volu ntary changes in the industry. In the \nUnited States , the central bank has chosen to serve as a leader for a collaborative approach , \ninvolving a wide range of payments participants  as the path toward improving the system.  \nThis is not a new role  for the Federal Reserve . Since its founding, the public has looked \nto the Federal Reserve to provide leadership on advancing the safety, efficiency and accessibility \nof the nation’s payment system. Congress initially designed the Fed to serve as a payments \nsystem operator through the regional Reserve Banks and as an overseer of the system through its \nsupervision of financial institutions. These roles give  the Fed relevant insights as we work with \nothers to address the security challenges we face today.  \n For its own part as an operator, the Fed must consider and ensure the security of its  own \nclearing and settlement activities , and thi s directly influence s a large segment of U.S. retail \n\n2 \n payments. The Fed’s financial services business also  provides resources to support development \nof payment standards, including those related to security.  And, there are  plans un derway to work \nwith the Fed’s financial  services  customers  to identify demand for enhanced risk -management \nproducts that complement the Federal Reserve’s suite of wire, automated clearinghouse  and \ncheck service offerings.  \nAs a payments system o verseer , the Federal Reserve and other agencies  ensure banks \nprotect their systems from unauthorized access to online banking systems and safeguard sensitive \npersonal or account information.  In the case of retail payment fraud, consumers have been \nprotected from significant losses by r egulations.  \nThese roles h ave informed the central bank and enhanced its credibility where it plays a \nless formal but equally important role —that of leader and  catalyst for change. The improvements \nwe seek for greater  security in the U .S. payments system do not stem from a specific  mandate \nfrom Congress , but rather from an interest in ensuring stability  and confidence in the payments \nsystem .   \nIn this role, t he Federal Reserve seeks to drive improvement in the payments system \nthrough a collaborative approach , which in the past has led to payments innovations that we take \nfor granted today. R outing numbers on paper checks, the development of the ACH , and the \nimplementation of Check 21 are all examples of diverse interests coming together to find a \nsolution to co mmon challenges.  \nIt is in this spirit that we recently established two task forces  to take on today’s \nchallenge s. These groups are comprised of diverse and committed membership, which will \nensure a broad range of perspectives are considered as we move forw ard. \n\n3 \n One task force will focus on identifying and evaluating approaches for implementing a \nsafe, ubiquitous and faster payments capability in the United States. The other task force will \nprovide input on security aspects of a faster payments capability, an d serve as a forum to advise \nthe Federal Reserve on how to address security matters and to identify and promote actions that \ncan be taken by payment system participants collectively or by the Federal Reserve System.  \n An important question is: H ow will we judge success  of these efforts ? Each task force \nwill be asked to identify the criteria by which they will measure success. In the near-term, we \nwill look to the secure payments task force to articulate key priorities . We will also be looking \nfor evidence o f commitment from payments system participants to take action on these priorities.  \nLong er-term, we hope to see this collaboration among industry participants continue,  \nresulting in progress on the development and adoption of effective security standards. We would \nalso hope to see robust r esearch and implementation of processes that result in better data and the \nability to closely monitor fraud and identify adverse trends, develop more effective responses, \nand track policy initiatives.  Success will mean p ayments modernization in the U nited States  is \nwell on its way , with adoption that reflects the public’s strong confidence in new capabilities.  \nTime will tell whether this collaborative approach  can be successful or whether the Fed \nneeds to take a different approach to foster a modern payments system that serves the needs of a \ndynamic economy .  \nIt was t en years ago , in 2005, that the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City hosted  its \nfirst payments confe rence titled, “Interchange Fees in Credit and Debit Card Markets.”  During \nthe two da ys of presentations, discussion  and debate among leading economists, industry leaders \nand policymakers, the need for intervention in the credit and debit markets was hotly contested. \nBy 2010, Congress intervened with regulation.   \n\n4 \n As we conclude this conference on payments security, I sense a greater degree of \nconsensus around the security challenges we face. As the Federal Reserve begins the work of \nconven ing and engag ing with stakeholders  to achieve a faster, more secure  and widely available \npayments system , the pieces of the puzzle li e before us. Putting them together in a way that \nmaintains the public’s confidence is both our challenge and our opportunity.",

        "content": "The Next Phase of Monetary Policy  \n \n \n \n \nEsther L. George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCentral Exchange  \nKansas City, Mo.  \nMarch 4, 2015  \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers or representatives.  \n  \n\n1 \n Good afternoon . I appreciate the opportunity to be here at the Central Exchange . The \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City has enjoyed a long and productive relationship with this \norganization, and I applaud the Central Exchange’s important contributions to supporting women \nin our community as it celebrates its 35th anniversary  this year.  \nAs the national economy continues to expand, the Federal Reserve has turned its attention \nto the issues associated with normalizing monetary policy after years o f unprecedented \naccommodation. Preparing for the next phase of monetary policy has involved consider ation of  \nthe mechanics for raising rates, clear principles supporting the normalization process, and  now,  \nthe discussion about the appropriate timing of the first rate increase. In my remarks today, I’ll \noffer my views on the economy’s pro gress and the appropriate stance of  monetary policy. I will \nclose by offering some observations about recent calls for further transparency and \naccountability for the Federal Reserve .   \nThese are my own views and not those of the Feder al Open Market Commit tee or the \nFederal Reserve System.  \n \nThe e conomic outlook  \nThe U.S. economy is expand ing at an above -trend growth rate , which I expect to continue \nthrough the end of the year. A strong dollar and certain aspects of the  foreign ou tlook pose some \nrisks, but the economy appears  well positione d to withstand such headwinds.  \nThe economic outlook is positive for both consumers and businesses. Consumer \nconfidence strengthened markedly in the second half of last year as gas oline  prices declined and \nthe labor market improved, and we have seen an increased willingness to spend on discretionary \ngoods and services , such as restaurants and recreational activitie s. Household balance sheets \n\n2 \n continue to strengthen, which should support c onsumer spending. Meanwhile, businesses \nare reporting that it’s a good time to expand, with industrial capacity utilization hitting its \npre-recession rate and spending on research and development accelerating.   \nImportantly, this improved outlook for consu mers and businesses suggest s that \nmomentum in the labor market will likely continue going forward. The economy added \nmore than 3 million jobs in 2014, the highest level since 1999 , and the rapid pace of job \ncreation has continued into the beginning of 2015 .  \nAlong with this  strong employment growth , we’ve seen  significant improvement \nin the unemployment rate , which has fallen from 6.7 percent in December 2013 to 5.7 \npercent in January of this year. The current level is less than one-half percentage point \naway from what many vi ew as the long -run normal rate. With more than 5 million job \nopenings currently posted, there are now fewer  than two unemployed people per job \nopening, down from nearly seven per job opening during the depths of the financial \ncrisis.  Evidence from the last business cycle indicates that as this balance tilts toward a \ntighter labor market, wage pressures are likely to increase.  \nAlready, the rates at which people voluntary leave their jobs are  increasing a s \nemployers look to recruit workers  from other firms and workers look to increase their \nwages. For example, research by my staff shows that in the second half of 2014, \nindividuals who switched jobs saw their wages increase more than 5 percent compared to \nwhat they earned in the prior quarte r—a notable rise compared to a few years earlier. As \nmore workers quit their jobs and seek out higher -paying employment, wage pressures are \nlikely to broaden and further increase.  \n\n3 \n Of course,  while  these positive indicators are encouraging , the labor market is not \ncompletely back to normal. For example, the share of “long -term” unemployed and the number \nnumber of individuals working part -time for economic reasons remains elevated . These aspects \nof our labor market are concerning . As the economy con tinues to expand and the labor market \ntightens further, job opportunities should become more available for those who have had \ndifficulty securing full -time employment.    \nTo evaluate the health of the labor market  in a way that takes into account  both strong \nemployment growth and job-finding challenges for many others , my staff developed an index of \nlabor market conditions that includes  a range of variables —something like a stock market index \nfor the labor market. Th is approach  show s that momentum  in the  labor market is near its highest \nrate in two decades.  If momentum continues at this pace , the labor market will return to its \naverage level of activity later this year.  This does not mean that all labor markets indicators will \nbe back to pre -crisis levels or even their historical average, but on a broad basis, the labor market \nwill be close to what can be considered normal.  \nTypically , a growing economy and tightening labor market would be accompanied by \nrising inflation . That has not been the case recently. In terms of consumer price inflation, the \nFed’s preferred measure is running at 0. 25 percent year -over-year—down from the 1.5 percent \npace at the middle of last year. The recent sharp declines in oil prices are positive for economic \ngrowth, but lower energy prices are dampening headline measures of inflation. However, the \nimpact of these transitory factors should fade later this year, particularly as oil prices stabiliz e.  \nLooking beyond these temporary factors, other important components of inflation are \nmoving higher. Rental prices for housing  have been strong , for example, and are likely to \ncontinue rising. The strength in the labor market  I just mentioned  is also likely to lead to more \n\n4 \n rapid wage  gains . So while inflation is somewhat below the Fed’s 2 percent goal, I am \nnot overly concerned with this shortfall . Instead, I see current and forecast ed inflation as \ngenerally consistent with price stability.  \nAgainst a b ackdrop of the ongoing economic expansion, a strengthening labor \nmarket and low but firming inflation, it is reasonable to contemplate a shift in the stance \nof monetary policy.  Moving to the next phase of policy entails judgment  on both the \ntiming of the first rate increase and then the pace of future increases —issues  that the \nFederal Open Market Committee will deliberate carefully.  \n \nThe liftoff decision  \nThe labor market, as I’ve highlighted, has experienced substantial improvement \nover the past year.  But in earlier stages of the recovery, much of the emphasis was on a \nweak labor market as the d river of accommodative policy. For example, we implemented \na number of bond -buying programs, commonly referred to as “QE 1, 2, and 3,”  held the \nfederal funds rate near  zero since the end of 2008, and relied on various iterations of \n“forward guidance” to signal our intentions that short -term rates would remain \naccommodative. Until March of last year, forward guidance for keeping short -term rates \nnear zero  hinged on a 6.5 percent unemployment rate threshold. In addition, the last \nlarge -scale asset purchase program was tied to achieving substantial improvement in the \noutlook for the labor market. This past October, we took the first steps towards \nnorma lization by ending the bond -buying program s.  \nNow with the economy approaching full employment , attention has turned to \nmoving inflation back towards the 2 percent goal. Rather than focusing solely on either \n\n5 \n employment or inflation,  policy needs to take a balanced approach, as is clearly codified in the \nFed’s Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy. The balanced approach \nsuggests that temporary deviations of unemployment and inflation  from their longer -run values  \ndo not necessarily warran t an extreme policy  setting . Instead, the stance of policy needs to take \ninto account the magnitudes of any deviations, as well as how long any deviation is expected to \nlast. Currently, unemployment is not far from its longer -run level , and the lower rate of headline \ninflation is expected to be temporary. And as I’ve mentioned, monetary policy should look \nthrough temporary factors, such as the oil price decline, as long as there is reasonable confidence \nthat inflation will be moving towards 2 percent within  the forecast horizon and that longer -term \ninflation expectations remain stable.  \nThis balanced approach framework supports  taking steps to remov e the extraordinary \namount of monetary accommodation currently in place . The next phase in this process is to move \nthe federal funds rate off its near -zero setting . While the FOMC has made no decisions about the \ntiming of this action , I continue to support liftoff  towards the middle of this year due to \nimprovement in the labor market, expectations of firmer inflat ion, and the balance of risks over  \nthe medium and longer run.  \nLiftoff in the middle of this year , in my view , would be fully consistent with the FOMC’s \nStatement on Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy , which reminds the public that “monetary \npolicy actions  tend to influence economic activity and prices with a lag. ” This means some time \nwill pass before we can see the effects of interest rate decisions, so mo netary policy must be \nforward -looking  and act  before the economy reaches full employment and 2 percen t inflation . \nWaiting until economic conditions are nearly  back to normal before raising rates  may put policy \nbehind the curve and require rates to rise rapidly in the future.  \n\n6 \n Another factor supporting liftoff in the near future is that many  of the benchmarks \npolicymakers use to assess the appropriate level of short -term rates  indicate  rates should \nbe above zero.  These benchmarks signal liftoff even after accounting for some possible \nchanges in the economy, such as a slower trend rate of grow th stemming from \ndemographic change and a more modest pace of productivity growth.   \n \nAfter l iftoff  \nAlthough considerable attention is now centered on the timing of raising rates, \nthis step is only one of many in the policy normalization process . Every interest rate  \ndecision depends on how the economy unfolds , so simply deciding to make the first \ninterest rate move b y no means puts interest rate decisions on autopilot.  At the same time, \npolicymakers can’t perpetually wait for just “one more dat a point,” so actions often must \nbe taken in anticipation of how economic conditions are expected to develop.  \nThe FOMC will need to be forward -looking in determining the pace of  remov ing \naccommodation. Unique to the extraordinary amount of monetary stimulus that exists \ntoday, it is important to emphasize these steps are a “removal of accommodation” and not \n“tightening .” I see r aising the federal funds rate off zero in the middle of this year as a \nstep to normalize financial conditions  alongside a strengthenin g economy , rather than an \nattempt to slow an overheating economy. The alternative of m oving rates off zero much \nlater, but raising them at a faster pace, risks disrupting financial market  and sharply  \nslowing economic activity . For that reason, I see more balanced risks under an approach \nthat raises rates sooner , such as in the middle  of this year, but  at a gradual pace. \n \n\n7 \n Conclusion  \nAs the Federal Reserve  contemplates its path to normalizing monetary policy, it does so \nat a time of tremendou s public scrutiny. There are c alls for more transparency and accountability \nrelated to its monetary policy  and its supervision and regulation of large financial institutions.  \nAs a result, changes to Fed structure and governance are being contemplated by C ongress.   \nTo be sure, accountability and the public’s scrutiny of the Federal Reserve are to be \nexpected and appropriate.  It is well understood that securing the public’s trust and confidence \ndepends on the  central bank’ s ability to meet its mandates from Congress. But contemplated \nchanges should be focused in a way that does not compromise the Federal Reserve’s key \nstrengths , including an independent FOMC and a decentralized structure. Broad-based \nrepresentation, public oversight and the ability of policymakers to bring independent views to the \ntable  have been enduring features of the system and have proven to be a source of strength for \nthe nation ’s central bank . It would be a mistake to alter that b alance without thoughtful and \ncaref ul consideration .",

        "content": "Monetary and Macroprudential Policy: Complements, not Substitutes  \n \nEsther L. George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFinancial Stability Institute/Bank for International Settlements  \nAsia-Pacific High -Level Meeting  \nManila, Philippines  \nFebruary 10, 2015  \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits gov ernors, officers or representatives.  \n \n\n \n1 \n Today’s program focuses on various aspects of reforms since the global financial crisis \nthat aim to address the risks posed to financial and economic stability.  Central banks have long \nrecognized that financial stabili ty considerations play a key role in achieving monetary policy \nobjectives.  Yet, there remains considerable debate about the role that monetary policy itself \ncontributes to financial stability and what steps a central bank should take with its policy regime .  \nIn my remarks today, I will review considerations on the interaction between financial \nstability and mone tary policy , as well as the post -crisis enthusiasm for the use of \nmacroprudential regulatory approaches  in addition to supervision of individual banking firms . I \nwill conclude with my own views on the role of monetary policy in assuring economic objectives \nare achieved in the context of financial stability.  \n \nThe relationship between monetary policy and financial s tability  \nPrior to the recent global financial crisis, a common view held that monetary policy \nshould not lean against apparent financial market imbalances —except to the extent they affected \nthe ou tlook for growth and inflation —but, instead , clean up after a bubble bursts . This line of \nthinking rested on t hree assumptions .  \nThe first is that spotting asset price bubbles or financial imbalances in real -time is \nnotoriously difficult —something that is just as true today as in the past. Knowing a t what point \nand how aggressively to intervene using monetary policy also poses a number of practical \nchallenges. A second assumption  is that monetary policy can be effective at limiting the damage \nto the broader economy after the bursting of an asset -price bubble . The pre -crisis consensus \nviewed  a collapse of asset prices as having the potential to inflict  sustained damage to the \nbroader economy, but also held that monetary policy could mitigate the fallout.  A third \n\n \n2 \n assumption  supporting the pre -crisis  consensus  is what  I will call “the separation principle,” in \nwhich regulators concern themselves with oversight of the financial sector  while monetary \npolicy makers  focus on macroeconomic objectives, such as inflation and , in some cases, \nemployment.  The goal of price stability was seen as largely complementary with that of financial \nstability, given a well -designed regulatory structure that monitored the risk exposure s of the \nfinancial sector.    \nGiven these assumptions, b roader discussions on the role of central banks in fostering \nfinancial stability were rare.  The bursting of the dot -com bubble of the 1990s , followed by the \nrelatively mild recession in 2001 only reinforced these views.  After many years of financial \nmarket stability  in advanced economies , policymakers seemed to have reason to view monetary \npolicy as appropriately focused on macroeconomic objectives —that is, until the onset of the \nglobal financial crisis that began in 2007 . \nThe collapse of the housing market in the United States a nd the global economic events  \nthat followed have posed fundamental challenge s to the thinking about the role of monetary \npolicy in maintain ing financial stability. And w ithout doubt, financial instability inflicted \ndamage that pulled many central banks far from their objectives  for a prolonged period . \n \nA macropr udential approach  \nToday , central banks are digesting a growing body of research on the appropriate roles  of \nmonetary and regulatory  policy  in fostering financial stability . The influence  of this research  on \nactual monetary policy decis ions has been only modest , although financial  stability concerns are \nbecoming more frequently discussed in the context of monetary policy. For example, the Federal \nReserve has adopted a Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy , which \n\n \n3 \n convey s to the public the objectives of monetary policy. The statement says  that “risks to the \nfinancial system” that threaten to impede attainment of the Committee’ s longer -run goals may \nwarrant a monetary poli cy response. No adjustment to policy has yet been made due to risks \nfrom the financial sector.  \nHowever, s ome countries over the past few years have raised financial stability concerns \nto a level sufficient to warrant a policy response. In most  cases, monetary policy was not altered. \nInstead, macroprudential tools were deployed to address overheating property markets or rising \nhousehold indebtedness.  Monetary policy has largely remained focused on inflation and \nemployment , leaving financial stability to  regulators and their macroprudential approaches ; in \nother words , the separation principle remains largely intact.  \nIn fact, the deployment of macroprudential tools  may be perceived as further removing \nthe need for monetary policy to be concerned with financial stability . For example, \ncountercyclical capital policy can be used to reduce the banking sector’s leverage and expand its \nloss-absorbing capacity  during an ex pansion. Calibrating t he appropriate timing and degree for \nusing this tool , however, poses  some  practical challenges  that are similar to those associated with \nmonetary policy . The Federal Reserve plans to  use a framework incorporating countercyclical  \ncapital adjustments , though details, such as when and by how much to releas e the buffer , will \nneed to be more fully developed.  \nIn addition to countercyclical capital, policymakers and regulators  have embraced \nmacroprudential approaches to liquidity requir ements . These steps are designed to guard against \nexcess ive maturity transformation , which in the past has led to asset fire sales and large swings \nin asset valuations.  With the new rules, banks must hold a minimum amount of highly liquid \n\n \n4 \n assets  under stre ssed conditions to ensure adequate funding and prevent fire sale losses and \nrelated externalities.    \nTo evaluate whether the capital and liquidity  positions of individual institutions aggregate \nto a stable banking system, s tress-testing has been used . In the United States, s tress-testing has \nlong been a microprudential tool aimed at ensuring the safety and soundness of individual \ninstitutions  and understanding , for example,  a bank’s interest rate risk exposure.  Since the crisis, \nit has also become an impor tant macroprudential tool that provides a  horizontal view of \nsystemically  important firms and their vulnerabilities to a wide variety of shocks to economic \nand financial conditions.  While stress -testing has proven to be a valuable tool, the results can be \nquite sensitive to a number of factors , such as model specifications and estimation periods.  For \nthese reasons, regulators should be cautious about taking too much reassurance from the tests.   \nRegulators also must remain focused on traditional microprudent ial, or firm -specific,  \nsupervision and regulation.  Sound execution of macroprudential regulation depends on sound \nmicroprudential regulation.  Ensuring that individual banking organizations are operating in a \nsafe and sound manner  is a prerequisite  to their ability to withstand the economic and financial \nshocks that can lead to financial instability.  In the U nited States , perhaps the most notable \nexamples were the declines in residential and commercial mortgage underwriting standards that \nemerged in the  years leading up to the crisis.  For commercial real estate, in particular, growing \nconcentrations led the banking agencies to issue supervisory guidance in 2006.  However, \nhighlighting such issues is of little value unless it is timely and accompanied by t argeted actions  \nto limit the risk exposure . From this standpoint, I see extremely strong complements between \nmicro - and macroprudential regulation.  \n \n\n \n5 \n Financial stability and monetary policy i nteractions  \nJust a s micro - and macroprudential polic ies play central role s in safeguarding financial \nstability, so does  monetary policy . I often hear t he view  that macroprudential policy should be \nthe “first line of defense” for maintaining financial st ability . Unfortunately , this approach  expect s \ntoo much of tools for which our understanding is imperfect . In addition,  a growing body of \nresearch shows monetary policy plays a key role in affecting risk appetite and risk premiums . \nAsking regulators to ensure  risk-taking is not endangering  financial stability places a large \nburden on our regulatory infrastructure , especially in an environment of highly accommodative \nmonetary policy . \n Indeed, central banks have used zero interest rates and large -scale asset purchases or \nquantitative easing as a type of monetary easing  that would affect  risk-taking , asset valuations \nand economic growth. While accommodative monetary policy can affect  economic activity via \nthis channel, it can also create financial market vulnerabilities , especially if  sustained  for a \nprolonged period. If financial imbalances in one sector turn out to have systemic consequences, \nthen a reliance on the risk-taking channel of monetary policy to stimulate economic activity \ncould prove more detrimental than beneficial over the longer run  for achieving stable inflation \nand employment .  \nIn particular, a  monetary policy that f ails to take into account building systemic or tail \nrisks exposes the economy to potential large setbacks in the future. Investors fluctuate between \nbeing more or less conc erned about  these  unlikely —but severe —economic  outcomes. These \nconcerns are often incorporated  in risk premiums , which  reflect investor concerns about the \ndegree and likelihood of severe events . For example,  a rise in risk premiums can indicate a \nrecession may be on the horizon, even when macro economic data may be providing no such \n\n \n6 \n signal.  Alternatively, u nusually low risk premiums, such as were experienced in 2003 -2005, \nreflected investors who were underestimating the severity and likelihood of a downturn in the \nhousing market.  \nResearch points to the effect monetary policy has on several aspec ts of risk -taking. For \nexample, after t aking into account economic conditions, low policy rates are correlated with \noverall easier financial conditions, as we see banks increase the share of risky assets they hold,  \ncredit quality  decline , risk premium s on syndicated  loans  fall, lending standards  soften , and \nfinancial institutions move towards shorter -term funding and higher  leverage.1 Many of these \nfactors manifest themselves in elevated asset valuations and rising credit growth. Once asset \nvalues or credit growth has risen to a level warranting concern, it is likely too late for monetary \npolicy to smoothly  unwind these imbalanc es without  triggering a sharp reversal that ultimately  \ninflict s damage on the real economy.  \nA focus on risk-taking and risk premiums in the context of monetary policy leads to two \nquestions. The first is whether risk premiums are useful for predicting economic activity. \nResearch from  the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  suggests they are, but they offer more \nof a signal about  the future when they are rising than when they are falling.2 That is, rising risk \npremiums signal poor economic performance in  the future, while declining risk premiums are not \nnecessarily a good indicator  of strong economic performance. Low risk premiums, however, may \nsow the seeds for future financial instability. The second question is whether monetary policy \ncan affect risk p remiums. This same line of r esearch also suggests monetary policy  does alter \nrisk premiums. As policy eases, risk premiums have a tendency to decline , suggest ing that \n                                                           \n1 See, for example, Rajan (2005); Jimenez et al (2012);  Santos (2012) ; Maddaloni and Peydo (2011) ; Stein (2012, \n2013); Adrian and Shin (2010);  Adrian, Moench and Shin (2009). Adrian and Laing (2014) provide a \ncomprehensive overview.  \n2 See Cao, Doh and Molling, “Should Monetary Policy Look at Risk Premiums in Financial Market s?” forthcoming \nin the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s Economic Review .  \n\n \n7 \n attempt s to lower  already low risk premiums will likely do little in te rms of future econ omic \nactivity  but may foster conditions that pose risks to  financial stability.  \nThis line of thinking suggests to me that modestly tighter policy earlier in the business \ncycle expansion could moderate risk -taking and the potential for destabilizing financial \nimbalances to build.  In reviewing financial stability reports for several countries prior to the \nglobal financial crisis, my staff found some countries effectively identified a number of  risks  that \nplayed  important roles in the crisis but underes timated their severity .3 Identifying “excess” risk -\ntaking always carries challenges, particularly in finding the right benc hmark with which to assess \nrisk-taking. Still, a number of these reports highlighted risks,  but late in the business cycle when \nthere was little monetary policy could do except wait to clean up. In addition,  using monetary \npolicy to prick bubbles  after they have developed , to slow elevated levels of credit growth, or to \nencourage firms to scale back on high levels of leverage are likely to end poorly.  \nThe bottom line is that it is difficult  to address stability concerns in particular sectors \nafter they have developed. Instead, it may be appropriate to adjust policy to address suppressed \nrisk premiums early in the expansion  rather than late. Once valuation pressures emerge, or \nunderwriting standards have been stretched, then it is often too late.  As a result, interest rate \npolicy used earlier in the cycle can foster a more stable financial land scape as a business cycle \nmatures.  \n \n \n \nRevisiting the pre -crisis c onsensus  \n                                                           \n3 Christensson, Spong, and Wilkenson, “Financial Stability Reports: How Useful During a Financial Crisis?” \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s Economic Review , 2010.  \n\n \n8 \n  The lessons of the financial crisis are many and warrant careful assessment of \nassumptions that have guide d the thinking about the proper relationship between monetary policy \nand financial stability. It remains true that w e can’t identify bubbles in real time, or at least don’t \nknow the proper time and manner to intervene to stem their rise. Following the collapse o f a \nbubble, monetary policy can be judiciously used to limit the damage inflict ed on the real \neconomy. However, monetary policy runs the risk of  remaining overly accommodative  following \na downturn , and lead to  future  instability . Importantly, policymakers should reassess the \nassumption that monetary policy and macroprudential regimes can be used independently.  This \n“separation principle” remains widely accepted  and continues to argue that macroprudential tools  \noffer the “first line of defense” against risks  to financial stability .  \nOur recent experience, combined with empirical evidence , suggests this view should be \nchallenged.  A comprehensive approach that views m onetary  and macroprudential policy as a \ncomplements, reinforced by sound microprudential underp innings , is the best approach to \nachiev e a stable financial system and the long -run objectives of central banks for sustainable \neconomic growth .",
