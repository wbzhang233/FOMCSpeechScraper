George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNovember 18 , 2016  \nOil and the Economy: Adapting to a New Reality  \nA Joint Conference of the Federal Reserve Banks of Dallas and Kansas City  \nHouston, Texas  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Feder al Reserve \nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.  \n \n\n1 \n Thank you . I am pleased to join Rob Kaplan for this conference co-sponsored by the \nDallas and Kansas City Federal Reserve Banks.  The oil and gas sector features prominently in \nthe economies of our respective regions, making the focus of this conference “Adapting to a New \nReality” highly relevant to our work as policymakers . \nUnderstanding the dynamics of this market  is critical.  As such, we have long studied \ntrends in the sector  and how they affect economic and banking c ondition s.  As the shale boom \nintensified this decade , and the  oil and gas industry grew to its largest share of regional econom ic \nactivity since the early 1980s, we have devot ed more resources to understanding th is important \naspect of the regional , nation al and global economy .   Additionally, and importantly, we rely on \nbusiness contacts – nearly 80  percent of the energy companies in the Fortune 1000 are located in \nour two Federal Reserve Districts .  Some of these  companies are represented in our surveys, \nparticipate in roundtables and serve as directors on our boards  of directors .  This k ey input is \nessential to our understanding of the broader economy and an important contribution to our \npolicy deliberations.  \nIn my remarks this morning, I’ll talk about how regional insight feed s into policymakers ’ \nunderstanding of the national economy.  I’ll also offer my perspective on the outlook for the U .S. \neconomy and the current stance of monetary policy.   \nThese are my view s – not Rob’s , nor others within the Federal Reserve System .   \n \nInsights from Fed Regional Surveys  \nThe Federal Reserve ’s Beige Book provides  the public and Fed policymakers  with \nregional views on the economy eight times a year.  In addition,  as it pertains to energy,  the \nFederal Reserve Banks  of Dallas and Kansas City  conduct quarterly surveys of oil and gas firms  \n\n2 \n headquartered in our Districts .  The survey s gather  information on current business  activity, \ncapital spending plans , employment, price expectations , and other key indicators.   The most \nrecent results, for the third quarter of 2016, were somewhat encouraging , showing an expansion \nof business activity  and expectations for increased capital spending , but still slight reductions in \nemployment.  \nA particularly useful piece of information has been the price  of oil  that firms tell us they \nneed to be  profitable and also what prices they need to  substantially  increase drilling  activity .  \nWe’ve asked question s along these lines  in the Kansas City survey  since 2014.  At that time, the \naverage price needed to be profitable was $79/barrel.  Since then, with reductions in services \ncosts , as well as  advancements in technology and productivity , firms’ average profitab le price \nhas fallen by a third , to $53/barrel in third quarter  2016.  That price is still slightly higher than \nrecently prevailing prices, but not considerably so.  With the most recent range of profitable \nprices reported by firms ranging from $40 to $7 5/barrel , drilling is now profitable for some \ncompanies in some places, which is evident in the recent uptick in rig counts.   \nBut what will it take to substantially  increase drilling activity?  The most recent  \nresponse s to the Kansas City Fed survey noted  $64/barrel on average , and for the Dallas Fed \nsurvey it was $60/barrel, bo th well above recent oil prices , although  some firms reported needing \nonly $50/barrel to sizably increase drilling .  We also asked firms in the Kansas City District \nabout the prices needed to significantly increase natural gas drilling , and  the results were \nsimilar ly above current levels .  Firms on average needed $3. 65/mbtu, considerably  higher than \nrecent prices, although some firms did say they could significantly increase drilling for  as low as \n$3.00 /mbtu.  Taken together, these results suggest increased drilling activity  is likely to be \nrelatively moderate until prices reach a nd sustain a  higher level.  \n\n3 \n Another key source of information about the energy sector  comes from insights  provided \ndirectly by  oil and gas executives , as I mentioned earlier .   Both Reserve Banks have energy \nexecutives on our Boards of Directors , several of whom are with us today.  In addition to their \nbroad oversight of R eserve Bank operations, t heir specific knowledge of key aspects of the \nenergy sector , including  the real activity and the financial perspective , provides us with greater \ninsights than we are able to gather from our surveys.  We also regularly host individual meetings \nand roundtable discussions with oil and gas executives . Our ability to directly and immediately \ninteract with this important sector of the global economy is one example of the role regional \nFederal Reserve Banks play in monitoring current economic activity and understanding \nexpectations for future activity. This type of insight is an especially important contribution to the \nFederal Reserve’s policy deliberations and our understanding of the individual components that \ninfluence the broad  economy .  \n \nThe E nergy Sector and  Broader E conomic Activity  \nTurning to the broad economy,  even though oil prices have risen from the lows we saw \nearlier this year , they are still considerably  below their mid -2014 peak.  Not surprisingly, given \nthe important role of the energy sector  in this part of the country, the decline  in oil prices had a  \nnegative effect on economic activity  from a regional perspective .   \nWhat is surprising, though, is that the decline in oil prices did not provide a significant  \nboost to the national economy. Although declining oil prices  did support  consumer spending and \nsectors that are heavily reliant on energy , some researchers have concluded these  benefit s may \nhave been offset by a reduction in investment and employment in the energy sector .    \n\n4 \n In general, the positive and negative effects appear to be largely offsetting, which has \noften not been the case in years past. One obvious reason for the difference is that the size of the \nenergy sector has increased significantly, s o a decline in activity is large enough  today  to be \nnotable on a national scale. In early 2014, the U.S. mining sector, comprised primarily of oil and \ngas, accounted for 2. 8 percent of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP), up from less than 1 percent \nin the l ate 1990s.  By early 2016, it had shrunk by about  half, to 1.2 percent of GDP . In terms of \nemployment, over 150,000  generally high -paying jobs have been lost in the U.S. oil and gas  \nsector since the fall of 2014, a decline of nearly 30  percent. There also have been thousands of \nassociated job losses in manufacturing, transportation, and other related sectors in energy -\nintensive areas of the country.  \nOn the demand side, it  is possible that  the benefits from lower oil prices are now  small er. \nFor example,  gasoline as a share of total consumption , has fa llen from about 4 percent in 1986 to \nabout 2 ¼ percent in 2015.  On net, today it does seem to be the case that the direct effects of oil \nprice swings are larger on the investment  and employm ent side, but  smaller on the consumer \nside. \nLooking forward, I continue to expect developments in the energy sector  to affect the \neconomic outlook.  If energy prices were to increase , then I would expect that new drilling \nactivities will expand, and the additional oil rigs will contribute to overall investment in \nstructures. While I now view business investment as being poised to make a modest contribution \nto growth over the medium -term, a potential retreat in energy prices  poses a downside risk. This \ncould occur if the OPEC deal expected at the end of the month does not materialize . \nIn terms of oil prices, I currently see the potential for new drilling activities within the \nU.S., as well as the potential to bring idle wells back online, which would alter the path of oil \n\n5 \n prices going forward. With a large amount of oil pr oduction ready to come online if prices were \nto advance through the mid -$50 range, I do not see as much room for price appreciation, \nespecially as global economic growth continues at a mode rate pace.   Among the anecdotes we’ve \nheard from directors and other executives this year is that there is a considerable amount of \n“money on the sidelines” looking to invest in oil and gas opportunities if prices continue to \nstabilize. This is despite som e of the profitability concerns that I noted  earlier , and may be \nreflective of a general “reach for yield” among investors, something we continue to monitor.  \n \nU.S. Economic Outlook  \nTurning to the national economic outlook , I continue to expect a moderate pace of \ngrowth, supported by consumer spending and stable business fixed investment. Consumers \ngenerally remain confident about the economy , and g oing forward, I expect continued job gains \nand increases in wages to support co nsumer spending . Overall, the labor market is near full \nemployment , and inflation is approaching the Federal Reserve’s 2  percent target . \nIndeed, over the past year we have seen a fast pace of growth in labor utilization that \nremoved a substantial amount of  labor market slack. For example, the U.S. economy added more \nthan 3 million people to the labor force since last September, which is the fastest pace of growth \nsince the year 2000. The additional workers joining the labor force in the past 12 months were \naccompanied by payroll growth that averaged 200,000 jobs per month, so that total employment \nhas grown by about 2.5 million jobs on net. With strong growth in the labor force accompanied \nby rapid employment, the jobless rate has remained at 4.9  percent , near my assessment of its \nnatural rate.  \n\n6 \n Although labor utilization has grown rapidly during the last year, the rising labor force \nparticipation rate does not suggest that a previously untapped group of workers has been pulled \nin from the sidelines. In fact,  since a year ago , the number of workers entering the labor force \neach month has remained flat, if not slightly  lower . Also , the number of people leaving the labor \nforce each month has fallen substantially. For example , the trend in the number of workers \nexiting the labor force each month fell from 6. 6 million to 6. 2 million  over the past year . These \ndevelopments indicate that workers are better attached to the labor force – that is, they appear \nless likely to get discour aged by spells of unemployment , and wage growth has encourage d them \nto remain active in the labor market.1  This attachment to the work force is a good sign . \nEven as labor markets have improved at a healthy pace, i nflation has been restrained , in \npart reflecting the downturn in oil prices.  Recently, these effects have begun to diminish.  As oil \nprices stabilized, inflation has increased from 0.2 percent to 1.3 percent over the past year .   \n \nMonetary Policy  \nConsidering  the rise in  the labor force participation  rate, increases in employment, and \nsigns of higher compensation, policymakers must judge what stance of monetary policy will \nsupport the substantial gains achieved in the last year  and keep the economy near its maximum \nsustainable employment level.  Interest rates have remained at historically low levels and the \nFederal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) has signaled a gradual path toward more normal \nsettings.  At its most recent meeting,  the FOMC statement noted that the case for an increase in \nthe federal funds rate has continued to strengthen but decided, for the time being, to wait for \nsome further evidence of continued progress toward its objectives.  \n                                                           \n1 Didem Tuzemen and Jon Willis , “What is Behind the Recent Increase in Labor Force Participation? ” Macro \nBulletin , Nov. 14, 2016 . \n\n7 \n As a voting member of the Committ ee, I dissented in favor of a modest 25 -basis point  \nincrease.  My view is that monetary policy should avoid deliberately stoking the risks that come \nwith overheating the U.S. economy and instead, slowly raise the federal funds rate to promote \nmaximum emplo yment commensurate with the economy’s long -run potential to increase \nproduction.     \nSupporting conditions that bring more people into the workforce is certainly a desirable \nobjective.  However,  over the last 55 years, there have been occasions where the u nemployment \nrate has fallen below a  level that is consistent with the maximum  sustainable level  of \nemployment.  In these cases,  the U.S. economy soon after faced a period of substantial and \nprolonged increases in unemployment. The effect of allowing the eco nomy to overheat  in these \ncases  produced short -term gains, but ultimately with longer -term costs.   Consequently, I see \nmoving sooner, rather than later, as taking into account the long and variable lags with which \nmonetary policy operates, and reduces the potential for “go -stop” types of policies that create \nvolatility, rather than subdue it.  \n \nClosing  \nDecisions about monetary policy, of course, ultimately depend on how the U.S. and \nglobal economies unfold.  Understanding the effects of lower oil prices  is critical in this regard , \nand I look forward to the important insights and perspectives  to be explored at today’s \nconference."

I am pleased  to be with you today  to discuss the work of our \npayments coalition to improve the  speed, efficiency and security  of the U.S. payment  \nsystem .  \nWhen we began this work nearly two years ago, we understood it would be  \nchallenging . We set forth  ambitious outcomes that called for  a new and different \nenvironment  in which payments  could be made on mobile platforms, on any day , in real \ntime, and with the certainty that  the high est level of security would  protect both the \nsender and the recipient in the transaction . We also understood the  need to act \ndeliberately, but on  an aggressive schedule , because we saw countries around the world \nmoving swiftly  to develop their own  real-time payments infrastructure.  \nToday, I would like to spend  some time updating you on the progress of this \nwork . I’ll discuss the approach we have taken to facilitate this activity and provide some \ndetail about the work being done by both our Faste r Payments and Secure Payments Task \nForces . I’ll conclude with a few thoughts  on where their efforts are headed  and what to \nexpect in the year ahead , including some of the challenges we will face . \n \nThe Case  for Faster Payments in the United States   \nThe U.S. payment s ystem effectively supports the largest economy in the world, \nand has a long history of evolving to meet changing needs . In early 2015 , the Federal \nReserve issued a call to action in the form of a paper, titled Strategies  for Improving the \nU.S Payment System , that outlined the collective thinking of U.S. payment system \nstakeholders and the Federal Reserve on ways to  improv e the system.  \n\n \n2 \n The vision set out in the paper  framed specific strategies  designed to meet the \ngrowing demands of American consumers and businesses that continue to shift  their daily \ntransactions  toward e -commerce and Internet -enabled technologies . The strategies are \nbased on five desired outcomes for improvements in the following areas:  speed, security, \nefficiency, cross -border payments and industry collaboration . We also committed to \nmake improvements to the payment  services provided by the Federal Reserve .  \nAs the central bank of the U nited States, the Fed eral Reserve is  uniquely \npositioned to facilitate the stakeholder collabo ration needed to provide widespread access \nand the adoption of n ew payment system capabilities . For at least the last 50 years, \nmutual cooperation on payment issues between the Federal Reserve and the private sector \nhave contributed to a more resilient pay ment system , yielding significant benefits to the \npublic an d the economy as a whole.  \nTo be sure, t his approach has had its detractors , including those who thought that \nany attempt to produce significant change in our diverse payments landscape  would be \nhampered  by proprietary interests and a lack of cooperation . But that thinking \nunderestimated the interest and willingness of industry participants to cooperate and to \nproduce a result that none could achieve on their own .  \nOver the past two years , we have  brought together hundreds of interested parties \nand stakeholders in a broad and highly -motivated coalition that is working together to \nidentify both the promise and the challenges of making end-to-end payment system \nimprovements  a reality . \n \n \n\n \n3 \n Faster Paymen ts Task Force    \nCentral  banks around the world  have used government mandates  to provide the \ncontrol and direction needed to complete large -scale national initiatives  such as payment \nsystem  improvement . Here in the United States , the absence of a government  mandate \nand the recognition that significant  investments in legacy systems were in place , led to a \ndifferent approach .  \nThe Faster Payments Task Force now has more than 320 members comprising a \nvariety of interests:  technology providers; small, medium an d large financial institutions; \npayment networks; trade associations; business end users; and a small number of \ngovernment officials. Importantly, and in many respects u nique to such initiatives, the \nTask F orce also includes the representation of consumer groups .  \nThe Task F orce has made remarkable progress and I’d like to give you a sense of \nwhat has been accomplished . Early on, the Task F orce committed to a framework that \nwould ensure decision s and work products would have the broad support of its \nmembers hip, both within and across the various groups represented . With this \nunderstanding, they were able to define detailed criteria for judging the effectiveness \nneeded to deliver faster payments  and assess alternative approaches for faster payments \nsolutions .  \nIn January, the Task F orce created  a portal -based forum where solution providers, \nfrom  both the general public and within the Task F orce, c ould showcase their payment s \ncapabilities . In this w ay, firms intending to create  full end -to-end payment solu tions were \nable to view technologies and services that might help fill gaps in their proposals. To \ndate, more than 30 firms — from small startups to large payments and technology \n\n \n4 \n companies  — have submitted product descriptions or short videos to the online  forum, \noffering a range of expertise.  \nSoon after the creation of the capability showcase  forum , the Task F orce solicited \nproposa ls for faster payment solutions . Those making submissions  were asked to \nillustrate what their solution would do at each stage of the end -to-end payments process, \nfrom the initiation of a transaction through the completion of a payment and \nreconciliation of account balances. An outside consultant , McKinsey & Company , was \nchosen  to conduct an independent  assessment of each proposal against the criteria  \ndeveloped by the Task F orce.  \nIn total, 22  proposals have been reviewed  in the first phase of the assessment \nprocess that occurred from  May through September  of this year . Just last week , the \nproposals were released to both the Faster Payments Task Force and the Secure Payments \nTask Force , for review  and critical feedback . After receiving c omments , those who \nsubmitted the proposals will decide whether to remain in the process and release their \nproposal s to the general public. The proposals that remain will be included in  the Task \nForce’s Final Report  to be published in 2017 , along with t he assessment results and Task \nForce commentary.  \nBeyond the evaluatio n of individual proposals, the Task F orce review will \nconsider broadly the structural challenges that could affect the implementation of faster \npayments solutions . In a session later today, you’ll hear more about how the Task F orce \nis considering these issues , but let me share some of my views now  for the challenges to \nbe addressed .  \n\n \n5 \n Given the nature of market -driven solutions, interoperability will be a key \nconcern . This is  one of the current payments system gaps that led to establish ing the \nFaster Payments Task Force . Markets have produced a number of fragmented solutions \nthat deliver desired functionality, but have failed to deliver a ubiquitous and seamless \nexperience for end users .  \nInteroper ability requires a careful consideration of rules, standards and \ngovernance . We take for granted the ubiquity of our current infrastructure as represented \nin the use of debit and credit cards, ACH and check transactions . But, t he interoperability \nwe enjoy with these systems today didn’t happen ov ernight . In fact, it took years and in \nsome cases was cobbled together piece by piece across multiple providers . As we \ncontemplate faster p ayment capabilities for the United States , the industry has an \nopportunity to take a more proactive approach on these issues  and consider a path to \nadoption  so that all consumers and businesses may benefit from these capabilities .  \nProgress on bring ing faster payments to the U nited States  must  keep in focus the \nfundamental responsibility to ensure the overall  safet y and integrity of the payment \nsystem . Real-time payments present  some new risks in addition to those with which we \nare already familiar .  \nExperiences around the world and here in our own system prove that these risks \ncan be effectively managed and real -time payments can be safely and securely provided . \nHowever, the  challenges we face in successfully achieving our desired outcomes for \nfaster payments will require the same industry collaboration that has brought us to this \npoint . I commend the efforts of t he Task F orce to anticipate these challenges and \nopportunities , and I look forward to their recommendations in this regard.  \n\n \n6 \n Secure Payments  \nRegarding the issue of security, t here should be no doubt that d ynamic, persistent \nand escalating threats are  challe nging public confidence in the U.S. payment  system . The \ngrowing scale, sophistication, and global nature of cyber threats , along with the \nproliferation in points of vulnerability , has made security a key priority for fina ncial \ninstitutions, payments providers, central banks and regulators around the world . \nMore than 170 individuals joined t he Secure Payments Task Force  in 2015 to  \naddress the most pressing challenges in our existing payment systems and to defin e the \ncriteria for a safe and secure faster payments future . Let me hi ghlight two areas where \nthis Task F orce is focused today .  \nPreventing and managing fraud is a key challenge given certain inherent \nlimitations and weaknesses in existing payment systems  and processes . Today , there is no \nuniversally accepted way to establish and verify the identity of a payment system \nparticipant . The Task F orce has begun to address this problem . Their work will consider \nthe identification and adoption of payment identity management practices, as well as the \nopportunities to share fraud and cyber -threat information and how to analyze related  data.  \nThese efforts all promise to produce valuable information, tools and insight for \nthe industry . Driving widespread adoption of s ecurity improvements , however , remains a \nconsiderable challenge. Fortunately, U.S. payment  system security  is strong . And \nalthough we remain vigilant, we must keep pace with the rapidly -evolving and expanding \nrisks that threaten the payments ecosystem . I commend the work of the Secure Payments \nTask Force and the collaboration it brings to these important issues . \n \n\n \n7 \n Beyond Task Force Efforts  \nIn addition to the work of these Task Forces, the Federal Reserve itself is \ninvolved in improving efficiency in the p ayment system . Through its longstanding  \npartnership  with the Business Payments Coalition , real progress has been achieved in \nterms of educating small businesses on electronic payments, advancing the developme nt \nand adoption of standards, and understanding and addressing the barriers to straight -and -\nthrough processing. Of note this year is the establishment of the Business Payments \nDirectory Association, which is working to create a business -to-business directory to \nfacilitate easy, electronic origination o f business payments.  \nAnd in discussing our collective accomplishments in improving the payment \nsystem, the industry realized an important milestone last month  to enhance the speed of \nthe ACH network with implementation of the first phase of SameDay ACH . Within the \nFed, we’ve invested in speeding check clearing  and ACH payments, enhancing \nsettlement services, and enriching information services to better support risk and \ncompliance management needs. In partnership with the industry, we are working to alig n \nwire transfer and ACH systems to global message standards to meet user needs, pave the \nway for greater domestic and cross -border interoperability, and ensure a U.S. payment \nsystem that is relevant and competitive in the global market.   \n \nLooking Ahead  \nAfter almost two years, I am pleased at the progress we’ve mad e. We expect to \nmark some significant developments next year . In the first half of 2017, the Faster \nPayments Task Force is scheduled to issue its report in two parts . The first is expected to \n\n \n8 \n lay out the case for faster payments in the United States, and to describe the process \nundertaken to evaluate proposals for improvements . The second part of its report will \ninclude their review of the specific proposals  submitted . It will outline what an end -to-\nend faster payment system could look like in the U nited States  and discuss the possible \neffectiveness of different proposals , while highlighting strategic issues deemed important \nto the successful development of faster payments and actions needed to adva nce \nimplementation and adoption .  \nLikewise, the Secure Payments Task Force is likely to publish its views on the \nkey issues it has identified , including  payment identity management, information sharing, \ndata protection, and other payment system security is sues sometime next year .  \nThese reports will mark important milestones, but I believe o ur greatest challenge  \ngoing forward is maintai ning the momentum we have achieved  so far . It’s also likely that \nsome of our most difficult tasks lay ahead . Much of our collective work to date might be \ndescribed as identifying or designing solutions . We all know that in a market place as \ncomplex as our payment  system, the real work comes in driving successful \nimplementation and adoption all the way from the c entral infrastructures through the \nbanking and technology spaces to the hundreds of millions of consumers and business \nwho use these services .  \nAs some of these first steps in our payments improvement journey draw to a close \nor reach major milestones over the next year, we look forward to further collaborating to \ndivine the way forward toward our desired outcomes. The Fed’s priority in this important \ninitiative  has been  to advance and support improvements that are in the public interest \nand will contribute to long -term financial stability and economic growth . We remain \n\n \n9 \n committed to achieving those outcomes so that consumers and businesses have access to \nan efficient, real time and highly secure payment  network  in the Unite d States . \nThank you."

George  \nPresident  \nFederal  Reserve  Bank  of Kansas  City \nbefore  the \nHouse  Subcommittee  on Monetary  Policy  and Trade  \nUnited  States  House  of Representatives  \n \nSept.  7, 2016  \nThe views  expressed  by the author  are her own and do not necessarily  reflect  those  of the Federal  Reserve  System,  its \ngovernors,  officers  or representatives.  \n \n\n2 \n Chairman  Huizenga,  Ranking  Member  Moore  and members  of the subcommittee,  thank  \nyou for this opportunity  to share  my views  on the role of regional  Federal  Reserve  Banks  as part \nof the Federal  Reserve  System . \nBecause  the Federal  Reserve  is an institution  that makes  decisions  of consequence  to the \nbroad  public,  a discussion  of these  matters  is worthwhile.   If changes  are to be considered,  the \npublic  should  understand  not only the Congressional  intent  for its current  design,  but also the \nstrong  safeguards  that assure  its accountability.    \nCentral  banks  are unique  institutions.   They  have  impo rtant responsibilities  for a nation’s  \nfinancial  system  and economy.   Congress,  as it contemplated  a central  bank  for the United  States  \nmore  than 100 years  ago, took note of central  bank  models  from  other  countries,  while  keeping  \nin mind  two earlier  attempt s at central  banking  in the United  States.   Ultimately,  it opted  for a \ndifferent  approach:   one that recognized  the public’s  distrust  of concentrated  power  and greater  \nconfidence  in decentralized  institutions.   The Federal  Reserve’ s unique  public/private  structure  \nreflects  these  strongly -held views  and is designed  to provide  a system  of checks  and balances.   \nChallenges  to this public/private  design  have  surfaced  throughout  the Federal  Reserve’s  history,  \nnot unlike  they have  today.   But in the end, our country  has remained  most  confident  in this \ndecentralized  governance  structure.  \nCriticism  of the quasi -private  nature  of the regional  Reserve  Banks  was anticipated  from  \nthe start.   Indeed,  the Federal  Reserve  Act leaves  no unchecked  power  in Reserve  Banks.   The \npolitically -appointed  members  of the Board  of Governors  have  oversight  authority  of the most  \nimportant  governance  aspects  of Reserve  Banks.   For example,  they appoint  the Chair  and \nDeputy  Chair  of a Reserve  Bank’s  board;  they vote to approve  the selection  of the Bank’s  \npresident  as well as its chief operating  officer;  and they approve  the Reserve  Bank’s  budget  and \n\n3 \n salaries.    The Board  of Governors  also meets  with each Banks’  Chair  and Deputy  Chair  annually  \nto review  the Bank’s  performance  and that of its president.   Finally,  the Reserve  Bank’s  \noperations  are reviewed  by the Board  of Governors  and an outside  independent  auditor.  \nNotwithstanding  this strong  public  oversight,  some  question  the role of commercial  banks  \nwithin  the Fed structure.   Here  too, important  safeguards  exist.   The supervision  and regulation  \nof the Federal  Reserve’s  member  banks  is a statutory  responsibility  of the Congressionally - \nconfirmed  Board  of Governors.   Bankers  who serve  on Reserve  Bank  boards  are prohibited  by \nlaw from  participating  in the selection  of the Bank  president,  and no director  can participate  in \nbank  supervisory  matters.   Finally,  all directors  are required  to adhere  to high ethical  standards  of \nconduct  and avoid  actions  that might  impair  the effectiveness  of the Federal  Reserve’s  operations  \nor in any way discredit  the reputation  of the System.  \nThe capital stock supplied by these member banks serves as the foundation for the \ndecentralized structure allowing for separate corporate entities.   Through the regional Res erve \nBanks, private citizens from diverse backgrounds and from the largest to the smallest \ncommunities, have input into national economic policy; strong and varied independent \nperspectives more easily emerge to engage in difficult monetary policy discussio ns; and the \ncentral bank is provided insulation from short -term political pressures . \nAltering  this public/private  structure  in favor  of a fully  public  construct  diminishes  these  \ndefining  characteristics  in my view.   It also risks  putting  more  distance  betw een Main  Street  and \nthe nation’ s central  bank.    \nFormer  Fed Chairman  Paul Volcker  understood  this well.   He experienced  first-hand  how \npublic  pressure  can be exerted  on a central  bank  when  it must make  unpopular  decisions  that he \nand the FOMC  judged  to be in the long-run best interest  of the economy.   In a 1984  speech,  he \n\n4 \n noted  the important  role of the structure  of the Federal  Reserve  System  in supporting  the central  \nbank’s  decision  making  by saying , “It was all quite  deliberately  done  by men of political  \nimagination  -- designed  to assure  a certain  independence  of judgment,  a continuity  and \nprofessionalism  in staff,  a close  contact  with economic  developments  and opinion  throughout  our \ngreat  land and a large  degree  of insulation  from  partisan  or passing  political concerns.”1 \nTo that end, I extend  a personal  invitation  for any of you to visit the Federal  Reserve  \nBank  of Kansas  City to see what  a regional  Federal  Reserve  Bank  provides  in support  of the \ncentral  bank’s  objectives  for economic  stability.    Thank  you.  I look forward  to taking  your \nquestions.   \n \n                                                \n1 Paul A.

The Act also \nplaced a cap of $10 billion on the aggregate surpl us funds of the Federal Reserve  and directed \nthat any exces s be transferred to  the Treasury general fund. The potential policy implications of \nmodifying dividends to member banks, or more generally, the requirement for member banks to \npurchase stock in a regional Federal Reserve Bank , should be studied carefully before altering \nthis long -standing institutional design  of public and private interests serving the American \npublic .   \nIn designing the governance structure more than a century ago, Congress accepted a \ncompromise proposal from President Woodrow Wilson to create a central bank with a combined \npublic and private structure with those roles filled respectively by the Board of Governors of the \nFederal Reserve System and the regional Reserve Banks. In this design, the st ock ownership of \nthe regional Reserve banks is a key component in a central bank design that provides representation for both the public and private interests with each acting as a potential limit on the \ncontrol of the other.  \nThe debate regarding the role of Federal Reserve stock in the Federal Reserve System \nstructure  is not a new one : In 1938, Congressman Wright Patman proposed that the government \nshould take over the Reserve Bank stock, effectively turning the r egional Reserve Banks into full  \ngovernment entities. At the heart of this issue is whether changes that aim to alter the \nprivate/public status of the central bank and potentially nationalize  the 12 regional Federal \nReserve Banks  could undermine the barriers carefully constructed by Congress to protect against \npolitical pressures on Federal Reserve policies .   \nThis analysis  offers historical perspective on these issues, as well as an  assessment of the \neffectiveness of the current governance and structure of the Federal Reserve System.  \n \nA LOOK BACK ON CENTRAL  BANKING IN THE UNITE D STATES  \nA careful reading of Federal Reserve history will find that proposals for increased \ngovernment authority over the Federal Reserve are often raised most pointedly during periods \nwhen government debt is high. Pressure on the Federal Reserve to implement policy supportive \nof government spending dates back almost to the 1913 founding of the Federal Reserve and the \n\n2 \n subservient role the Federal Reserve soon assumed related to government financing demands in \nconnection with World War I. Similar pressure continued during and after World War II. \nEventually, the Federal Reserve’s resistance to continually supporting gover nment spending led \nto a formal accord with the Treasury in 1951.  \nThe list of events that have occurred in these environments is long and includes such \nhigh-profile instances as pressure from President Lyndon Johnson to hold rates low as a means \nof support ing his proposals during the Vietnam War to calls for Federal Reserve Chairman Paul \nVolcker’s resignation during the Federal Reserve System’s successful, but painful, battle against high inflation. Beyond these major events, numerous legislative initiative s have met varying \ndegrees of success over the years but have overa ll led to what Duke University economics \nprofessor Thomas Havrilesky termed the “deterioration of traditional constraints on the political \nmanipulation of monetary policy” since the modern F ederal O pen M arket Committee (FOMC)  \nwas created in 1935.\n1   \n \nThe Failure  of Earlier Central Bank Designs  \nAt the time of the Federal Reserve’s founding, the U nited States  had already witnessed \ntwo unsuccessful attempts at establishing a central bank . Neither was able to outlast their initial \n20-year charter.  \nThere was intense political debate around the creation of both the First Bank of the \nUnited States , in 1791, and its successor, the Second Bank of the United States, in 1816. While \nrecogniz ing the n eed for the stability that a central bank could provide, many Americans with \nvivid memories of the fight to win independence from England were understandably leery of \ncreating another powerful institution. As a result, both the First and Second Banks were the focus of significant public distrust.  Both were h ighly centralized institutions that many Americans \nviewed as too closely aligned with powerful political and financial interests of the Northeast.  In \nthe early 1900s, after a series of financial cris es, a third effort was launched to create a central \nbank with a structure that com bined both government and private interests .  \nCarter Glass, the House sponsor of the Federal Reserve Act and the legislation’s key \nauthor, explained the challenges in a report to the 63\nrd Congress:  \n                                                \n1 T. Havrilesky, “ The Politicization of Monetary Policy: The Vice Chairman as the Administration’s Point Man .” Cato Journal , \nVol. 13, No. 1 (Spring/Summer 1993) . Copyright Cato Institute.  \n\n3 \n “In the United States, with its immense area, numerous natural divisions, still \nmore competing divisions, and abundant outlets to foreign countries, there is no \nargument either of banking theory or expediency which dictates the creati on of a single \ncentral banking institution, no matter how skillfully managed, how carefully controlled or how patriotically conducted.”  \nAs Glass’s comment suggests, the concern about centralization was not something that \ncould be addressed solely by geogra phy or the number of bank facilities. Nor was it simply a \nquestion about adjusting the bank’s ownership structure. While both of those are elements of a \ndecentralized structure, arguably the most important issue —and the glaring weakness of both the \nFirst and Second Bank— was the centralization, or the perceived centralization, of control. \nIndeed, both the First and Second Banks  were geographically diverse with branch offices \nlocated in the important financial centers of their eras. Additionally, both had a combined public/private ownership;  however , the ownership structure utilized in each case was problematic \nfor two key reasons:  the need for profits, and the homogeneity of ownership and centralization of \ncontrol. \n \n• The Risks of a Structure that Requires Profits  \nAlthough the nation’s first two central banks had slight differences, particularly in \ntheir size, they were alike in many key structural ways. In both cases, private investors held \nan 80 percent ownership stake while the government held the remaining 20 percent. Investors \nacquired their shares th rough an initial public offering (IPO) process that was  similar to other \npublic stock offering s. In the case of both banks, the IPO involved the immediate sale of \nsubscriptions, or “scrips,” that were essentially a down payment for a later stock purchase. \nScrip and stock purchases for the First Bank, which required the combined use of specie \n(gold or silver) and U.S. debt securities to complete the transaction, created what is now \nconsidered the nation’s first financial crisis when scrip prices soared on hi gh demand, \ncausing debt markets to become distorted. While this  distortion and the resulting U.S. \nfinancial  crisis was an early indication of one of the many potential risks in a profit -seeking \ncentral bank structure, the era’s more prominent international  example involved the \nprivately -held French central bank , Banque de France, which took actions in the 1880s to \n\n4 \n protect and increase profits —moves that had a negative impact on its effectiveness as a \ncentral bank.     \n \n• The C onsequences of a Homogeneous Leade rship S tructure  \nShares for both the First and Second Banks  were prohibitively expensive for most \nAmericans. Stock in the First Bank, for example, was initially offered at $400 per share ( the \nequivalent of about $10,000 in 2016 after accounting for inflation ). Stock in the Second Bank \nwas still pricey at about a quarter of that cost. As a result, U.S. central bank ownership was \nvested primarily in the hands of wealthy and powerful individuals (including —perhaps \nunexpectedly —a number of foreign invest ors). Similarly, the majority of the directors of the \nFirst and Second Banks  were elected from the ranks of the politically and financially \npowerful, including some members of Congress, who lived in and did business in the \nnation’s power centers. The lack of diversity of central bank leadership was a major criticism, especially from those living outside of the East Coast.   \n \nThe C ombination of Public and Private Components: Checks and Balances  \nEconomic historians sometimes note that the fundamental issue about a U.S. central bank \ncorrelates with the fundamental issue dividing America’s two chief political ideologies: the role \nof government versus the role of the private sector.  \nAt the time of the Fed eral Reserve’s founding, most of the world’s other centr al banks \nwere privately held institutions. In the United States , the Federal Reserve ’s congressional \ncreators recognized that a private structure would not work and instead devised a structure with checks and balances between the private sector and the gov ernment.\n2 \nBalancing  government authority over the central bank was  not solely about placating \npolitical ideologies that preferred  limited government. The primary motivation was to avoid the \nuse of monetary policy and inflation as the means of financing government debt. Related to this  \nconcern , of course, wa s the risk of Federal Reserve policy manipulation for political gain.  \n                                                \n2 T. Todd, The Balance of Power: The Political Fight for an Independent Central Bank, 1790 -Present , Federal R eserve Bank of \nKansas City, 2009 . \n\n5 \n To address concerns about national debt funding, the Federal Reserve Act expressly \nprohibited the direct financing of the Treasury. However, since  the Fed eral Reserve’s founding, \npolitical pressure to ease monetary policy  has surfaced .3  \nTo mitigate this  political pressure, the Fed eral Reserve’s creators made the Reserve \nBanks private entities  under the supervision and control of a board of directors with authority to \nperform all duties usually pertaining to directors of a banking association. This includes the \nappointment of the president and first vice president (directors affiliated with supervised entities \nare no longer involved in this process) , appointment of officers, prescribing by -laws, and \ndesignat ing a representative for the FOMC. As initially designed, the Reserve Banks were far \nmore autonomous  than they are today . While the Fed eral Reserve System ’s government \ncomponent has always been responsible for Reserve Bank  oversight, the Federal Reserve ’s key \nfunctions, including monetary policy, were under the purview of the Reserve Banks during the System ’s early history. Over time, the monetary policy function has become balanced between \nthe private and public components  with the Board of Governors holding the majority votes.  T he \nFOMC co nsists of 12 members :  seven members of the Board of Governors  and five Reserve \nBank presidents .   \n \nPrivate Sector Involvement  \nWhile private sector involvement through a network of separate and distinct  Reserve \nBanks located across the country expanded  leadership diversity  and help ed balance government \nauthority, on the surface it present ed another problem: how to engage the private sector while \npreventing risks associated with a pure -profit motivation. This aspect was addressed by putting \nrestrictions  on Reserve Bank stock  and establishing the Board of Governors ’ authority for \noversight of  the Reserve Banks . \nWhile  law requires stock ownership in Federal Reserve Banks as a condition of a \ncommercial bank’s membership in the Federal Reserve System , this stock is not like stock \navailable on public markets . It may not be sold, traded or pledged as security for a loan. It does \npay a dividend rate that is established by statute and, as a result, cannot be manipulated through \nthe use of Fed eral Reserve policy tools or otherwise. This design provides the Fed eral Reserve \n                                                \n3 T. Todd, Under Pressure: Politics and The Federal Reserve During the 1990 -1991 Recession , Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas \nCity, 2011 . \n\n6 \n System  with private ownership over the Reserve Banks, but without the profit motivation that \ncan distort policy.  \nStock ownership allows member banks to nominate and elect Class A and B directors  to a \nReserve Bank’s Board of Directors .  However, unlike traditional corporations which grant one \nvote per share, the Federal Reserve Act provides for class voting wherein each member bank \nreceives one vote as a member of one of three designated classes based on the t otal amount of \ncapital, surplus  and retained earnings of the member bank. There are further limitations on voting \nas each class elects only one Class A and one Class B director.    \nIn addition to these restrictions on Reserve Bank stock, the B oard of Governors plays an \nimportant oversight role , including its authority to:  \n• Examine at its discretion the account s, books  and affairs of each Reserve Bank ; \n• Suspend or remove any officer or director of a Reserve Bank ; \n• Order an annual independent audit of the financial statements of each Reserve \nBank ; \n• Approve compensation provided by Reserve Banks to dir ectors, officers, and \nemployees;  \n• Approve the president and first vice president appointed by the Reserve Bank \nClass B and C directors ; and  \n• Appoint three of the nine Reserve Bank directors, including the  Reserve Bank’s  \nchair and deputy chair . \n \nMEMBER BANKS  HELP RESERVE BANKS F ULFIL L THEIR MISSION  \nStockholders of the Federal Reserve System, also referred to as members, have some \nrights and obligations simila r to traditional corporate stockholders  in that they provide capital to \nthe Federal Reserve Banks , which are federally -chartered corporations . All national banks along \nwith state -chartered banks that choose the Federal Reserve as the bank’s primary federal \nregulator  are required to purchase Federal Reserve stock . By purchasing stock, members are \nentitled to a dividend fixed by statute as well as a role in Reserve Bank governance .4 Members \n                                                \n4 The dividend rate was set to 6 percent in the original 1913 Federal Reserve Act to provide a rate of return comparable  to \nalternative risky investments and to attract sta te-chartered banks as members. Investing in the Federal Reserve in 1913 was not \nrisk-free given that the previous two central banks in the United States had not survived and the short -term ability to pay a steady \ndividend was unclear. Today, however, Federal Reserve stock is essentially a risk -free perpetual bond as long as a bank chooses  \n\n7 \n are therefore  invested in the Reserve Banks’ and Federal Reserve System’s success and are \nintegral to the Federal Reserve’s mission. Member banks must buy stock in the Federal Reserve \nBank equal to 6 percent of the bank’s capital, 3 percent of which is held at the regional Reserve \nBanks . The other 3 percent is callable by the Bank in certain circumstances. Paid -in capital from \nmember banks was the initial funding mechanism for the Federal Reserve Banks, and the 3 percent on call remains available in the event it is needed by the Reserve Banks.  \n \nRole of M ember Banks  in Governance of Reserve Bank Activities  \nStockholding member banks elect  a portion of the Reserve Banks’ director seats,5 are \ncore to Reserve Bank corporate governance  and provide critical industry information and \nperspective on economic and banking conditions . At the same time, the structure includes shared \noversight with the politically appointed Board of Governors that prevents members from having undue influence on Federal Reserve System activities.  \nThe Federal Reserve Act states that every Reserve Bank “shall be conducted under the \nsupervision and control of a board of directors ,” and provides that t he nine director positions of \nthe Reserve Bank’s board of directors are filled through two met hods: election and appointment \n(12 U.S.C. 301). Only three of the nine directors on a Reserve Bank’ s board may be officers, \n                                                                                                                                                       \nto remain a member. While the dividend remained unchanged for over a century, analysis by the Bipartisan Policy Center found \nit was similar to the average return on the 10 -year U.S. Treasury note over that period (A. Klein, K. Readling, O. Weiss, A. Woff; \n“Federal Reserve Dividends Should Not Be a Piggy Bank for Congress .” Bipartisan Policy Center, 2015). The Fixing America’s \nSurface Transportation Act, 129 Sat. 1312 (“FAST Act”), effective Jan . 1, 2016, changed the dividend for stockholder banks with \nmore tha n $10 billion in total con solidated assets from a fixed 6 percent rate to a di vidend equal to the lesser of 6 percent  or the \nrate equal to the high yield of the 10-year Treasury note auctioned at the last auction held prior to the payment of the dividend.  \nThe 10-year Treasury bond rate is seen by some as a reasonable alternative because it is the benchmark risk -free rate used for \nmost long -term , fixed -rate investments and has a long history of continual issuance. The 30-year Treasury rate might also be an \noption because it is the longest maturity Treasury rate, but there is a risk that the Treasury could decide to stop issuing i t at some \npoint as it did from late 2001 to early 2006.   \n If a market rate is used as a reference rate, it should not be capped at  6 percent as it currently is for member banks with more than \n$10 billion in assets . Using a market rate only when it is below a threshold is economically inconsistent with the notion of tying \nreturns to the market, and it is inequitable to penalize member  banks when r ates rise above the threshold. In addition, changing \nthe dividend has raised questions about the appearance of\n breaking an agreement with members. The American Bankers \nAssociation asserts that the FAST Act’s dividend rate change amounts to an unconstitutional taking of member banks’ property \nwithout compensation.  See Letter dated April 28, 2016 from Rob Nichols, president and CEO of the American Bankers \nAssociation, to Robert de V. Frierson, secretary, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Attachment B).  An \nalternative would be to allow current members to retain the 6 percent dividend or elect the 10 -year Treasury rate and issue a new \nclass of stock for new members with the dividend tied to the 10-year Treasury rate.  \n \n5 Class A and B  directors are nominated and elected by member banks within their respective Federal Reserve District. Unlike \ntraditional corporations , which grant one vote per share, the Federal Reserve Act provides for class voting wherein each member , \nregardless of shares,  receives one vote as a member of one of three classes . The classes are designated based on the t otal amount \nof capital, surplus  and retained earnings of the member bank  within the class . Not every class votes each year, and each group \nwithin the class elects one Class A and one Class B director.    \n\n8 \n direct ors or employees of a bank. Those directors (Class A) are cho sen to represent member \nbanks. The remaining six directors (Class B and Class C) cannot be bankers, and are chosen to \nrepresent the public with “due but not exclusi ve regard to agriculture, commerce, industry, \nservices, labor and consumers” ( 12 U.S.C. 302). While member banks nominate and elect the \nClass A and Class B directors, this Reserve Bank’s staff plays an important role in considering \nrepresentation from local and regional organizations to identify  qualified candidates. Likewise, \nClass C directors are identified b y Reserve Bank leadership with appoint ment  by the Board of \nGovernors. The chair and vice c hair of the Reserve Bank board of directors must be selecte d \nfrom the Board of Governor s-appointed Class C directors. Reserve Bank directors come from \ndiverse backgrounds in the region and across industries . They m ust comply with legal \nrequirements and rules related to their eligibility and conduct.  \n \nBenefits of Banker  Directors  \nReserve Bank s are nationally chartered banks that serve as the operating arms of the \ncentral bank.  They function much like a banker’s bank or a clearing house. As such, banker directors ’ knowledge  of the payments system  complements the Reserve Bank s’ operational role \nin providing financial services to the industry . Indeed, corporate best practices recognize that \n“the key to effective board composition is ensuring that the people gathered around the board \ntable can leverage their experience to contribute in meaningful ways, to understand the issues, \nask the right questions, demand the right information, and make the best possible decisions.”\n6  \nClass A directors bring informed views related to banking, as well as to the industries of their \ncustomers, and act as consolidators of information. For instance, a banker director can provide \ndetails about lending trends , stresses in the financial system,  and other banking metrics, in \naddition to sharing insights into farming, commercial real estate, h ousing  and the auto industry. \nTheir reports at Reserve Bank board meetings offer input to economic analysis used by Res erve \nBank presidents  for monetary policy . \n \nLimitations  to Banker Influence  \nWhile Reserve Bank directors have important oversight responsibilities for the operation \nof their respective Reserve Bank, they have no involvement in the Federal Reserve’s supervision \n                                                \n6 D. Nadler, B. Behan, and M. Nadler, Building Better Boards  (Jossey -Bass 2006).   \n\n9 \n of depository institutions . By law, the Board of Governors of the Feder al Reserve System is \nresponsible for the supervision and regulation of banks , and any information or discussion \nrelated to supervisory issues is conducted directly between a regional Reserve Bank’s staff and \nthe Board of Governors . In addition, any supervi sory matter regarding a Class A director’s bank \nis handled by  the Board of Governors.  \nReserve Banks may not provide confidential supervisory information to any director ( 12 \nC.F.R. 261.2). Moreover, Reserve Bank directors may not participate in bank supervisory matters and may not be consulted regarding bank examination ratings, potential enforcement \nactions, application/approval matters, or similar supervisory matters. In regard to the Reserve \nBanks’ lending activity involving financial institutions, direc tors receive only aggregate \ninformation about loans extended  to ensure adequate knowledge of the Reserve Bank’s balance \nsheet per their oversight responsibilities.  Finally, i f a banker director wants to convert his or her \nbank to Federal Reserve membership or take any other actions that would involve Federal Reserve regulatory approval, the Board of Governors in Washington must act on the application \nwithout  Reserve Bank  invol vement .  \n \nStatutory and Policy Restraints  \nThe directors representing member banks are subject to other  restraints by statute and \nthrough System policy. As noted above , only Class B and Class C directors appoint, subject to \napproval by the Board of Governors, the Reserve Bank president and first vice pr esident. Class A \ndirectors are excluded from that process to eliminate the perception that they have a rol e in \nchoosing their regulator. Class A directors also are prohibited from participatin g in the selection, \nappointment  or compensation of Reserve Bank officers whose primary duties involve \nsupervision of banks for the same reason.   \nAll directors  are subject to the Guide to Conduct for Directors of Federal Reserve Banks \nand Branches , a policy implemented to ensure adherence to high ethical standards of conduct, \nand avoid actions that might impair the effectiveness of Federal Reserve System operations or in \nany way discredit  the reputation of the System. The policy details procedures when directors are \ninvolved in procurements as a means to avoid any actual or apparent conflicts of interest.  Further, while the policy allows for w aivers, it indicates waivers  are both highly unlikely and \n\n10 \n strongly discouraged except under the most exigent and extraordinary circumstances. This \nReserve Bank has never sought a waiver for a director.  \n CONCLUSION \nAltering the current structure and c haracter of the Federal Reserve System risks \ndiminishing the effectiveness of its o perations . \nFor more than a century, the structural design of the Federal Reserve System has \nfunctioned well in carrying out its mandates from Congress. It is possible that Reserve Banks \ncould operate as separate corporate entities without stock ownership, but altering the central banks ’ current design creates the potential to diminish its effectiveness.   \n• The private nature of the Reserve Banks through stock issuance to member banks \nprovides balance to the public  nature of the Board of Governors.  The public’s trust \nand confidence is enhanced by this “balance of power .”  \n• Requiring stock purchases through capital investment creates incentives for member \nbanks to s upport  success ful outcomes for the Reserve Banks .   \n• Rather than a Washington -centric voice for the Federal Reserve System, the \nstructure of 12 separate Reserve Banks encourages strong and varied perspectives \nfrom across the country as the System fulfill s its mission.   \n• The structure of the Reserve Banks as separate corporate entities allows private \ncitizens  from communities across the country to have input into national economic \npolicy.   \n• The current decentralized structure insulates the Federal Reserve System from certain political p ressures, as the Reserve Bank presidents are not political \nappointments, but instead chosen by Class B and Class C directors, with appr oval \nby the Board of Governors. \n \nNationalizing the Reserve Banks, and thereby making them essentially field offices of the \nBoard of Governors , would dramatically alter these defining characteristics."

First, the cons truction sector was slow to bounce back after the \nsevere downturn in the housing sector. The crisis left the state with high inventory  levels  \nand sharply lower prices. Then, austerity measures at the federal government level led to \ncutbacks that were sharp ly felt here . As neighboring states recovered  more quickly , New \nMexico saw workers move out of the state , exacerbating its challenges.  \nOver the past year, new concerns have emerged and growth has slowed once \nagain. Parts of the state that had been doing quite well are now facing sharp declines in \n\n2 \n activity due to weakness in the energy and agriculture sectors. Employment in the energy \nsector has declined 26 percent in New Mexico over the past year, and weakness is \nstarting to spread to related industries, with the transportation and wholesale trade sectors \nalso reporting employment losses. The drop in energy activity is also starting to wei gh on \nstate and local finances, which can lead to government spending cuts that can further \nweigh on  employment.  \nAt the same time, there are other sectors and areas of the state that are doing \nbetter . Employment growth in Albuquerque recently reached its fastest pace since mid -\n2013, and outside of energy and agriculture -dependent areas, it appears that the recovery \nis accelerating. Home inventor y levels have dropped significantly in the metro area, home \nprices have stabilized, and residential construction activity is finally picking up. The \nhealthcare sector  also continues to expand and tourism activity has picked up over the \npast couple of years. Yesterday, I had the opportunity to visit the Sandia Peak Tramway \nand the Anderson Abruzzo International Balloo n Museum with our Kansas City and \nDenver Branch Board s of Directors. We heard about the robustness of the tourism \nindustry in the state and the wonderful Balloon Fiesta that takes place here each fall. \nThen, this morning , we heard about another growing sec tor in the New Mexico economy \n—entrepreneurship.  \nOverall, h ealthcare, tourism, construction and entrepreneurship are po ised to drive \ngrowth in the Albuquerque area, though softness in  the energy, agriculture, and state and \nlocal government sectors  will li kely remain for some time .   \n \n \n\n3 \n The U .S. Economic Outlook  \n You may ask how the economic developments facing New Mexico fit into the \nlarger regional , as well as  national , picture. Throughout the Tenth  Federal Reserve \nDistrict, which covers  seven states, the fall in commodity prices ha s been a major \neconomic shock. While t he rece nt increase in the price of some  commodities offers a bit \nof relief, there is little doubt that lower prices will require some major adjustments. For \nexample, energy production will li kely continue to decline and workers in the sector will \nneed to look to other industries that are doing better, such as construction. In addition, the \nmanufacturing and export sectors have been contracting, reflecting both the decline in \nenergy activity an d the strong dollar.  \nEven as these sectors of our economy  face strains, other aspects of the regional \nand national economy show more robust growth. In fact, t he U.S. economy has proven \nitself to be quite resilient in recent years , and I expect the moderat e pace of growth \nexperienced during this recovery will continue. Granted, the economy is subject to some \nshort -term ups and downs . We saw GDP growth was rather weak during the first quarter, \nbut the growth rate over the past year is near 2 percent —a pace that is close to the \naverage during this recovery. More importantly, employment growth has remained \nstrong . The economy has added close  to 200,000 jobs on average each month  this year.  \nThe longer -term pace of job growth has also been quite robust . As a result, the \nunemployment rate currently stands at about 5  percent , compared to 10  percent  after the \nfinancial crisis in 2009 .  Of course, t he unemployment rate is an imperfect measure of the \nlabor market, so I also pay close attention to other data. For example, o ne development I \nfind promising is that many individuals who had dropped out of the workforce are finding \n\n4 \n jobs. After the crisis, the percentage of people participating in the labor market fell \nsharply. Some of this is because our population is aging, so people naturally work less as \nthey get older. However, some of the decline in labor force participation was due to \nworkers being discouraged about their job prospects. More recently , however, we have \nseen an upswing in people finding jobs who had previously stopped looking for one. For \nexample, close to 2 million workers return ed to the labor force over the past six months . \nThis pace of re -entry is close to the fastest pace in more th an 15 years.  \nDespite these positive developments,  wage growth has remained sluggish  and \nmany people still feel like they have limited options in the labor market.  That being the \ncase, let me spend some time on the labor market.  \n \nLabor Market Trends From Tw o Perspectives  \n As I travel around my region to meet with business, community, and labor \nleaders, I often hear the m describe the job market from two very different perspectives. \nOne perspective is of a booming labor market, rising wages and an abundance of \nopportunity. The other perspective is of stagnant wage growth, limited upward mobility \nand job insecurity.  \n How can these different views be reconciled? Looking at  general labor market \ndata, we have seen a steady improvement in employment over the past seven  years. In \nfact, 14 million net new jobs ha ve been created since the crisis . Along with an \nunemployment rate that is cur rently near normal , the economy appears to be close to full \nemployment. As a result , many business leaders  often discuss the challenge of  hiring \nworkers with the right skill s and say that numerous job openings remain unfilled. In fact , \n\n5 \n there are currently around 5. 8 million job openings in the U nited States,  which is near the \nhighest level on record. I often hear about the need to raise wages rapidly to retain these \nworkers, and as a result, the national data showing slow wage growth doesn’t ring true to \nmany business leaders.  But while this aspect of job growth looks  pretty good, there are \nunderlying trends that suggest that the recovery has not been evenly spread across all \ntypes of workers.  \nThe other perspective on labor market developments reflects a trend that has been \npresent over the past three decades. In particular,  the share of workers in middle -skill jobs \nhas fallen sharply. For decades, these jobs were the bedrock professions of the middle \nclass . If we look back to the 1980s, examples of middle -skill jobs that were much more \nprevalent than today include assembly -line manufacturing jobs , clerical and \nadministrative position s.  \nThe steady d ecline in these types of jobs is not a new story. However, demand for \nboth higher -skilled and lower -skilled workers is growing  faster  relative  to middle -skilled \nworkers . This employment phenomenon is called “job polarization.”  In 1983 , nearly 60 \npercent of all jobs wer e in middle -skill occupations. By 2016, that sha re has declined to \n44 percent. By current employ ment levels, this would be equivalent to a shift of 22 \nmillion jobs away from middle -skill occupations toward both high - and low -skill \noccupations.     \nThe decline in middle -skill jobs is the result of  a number of sweeping changes \naffecting the economy. With the adoption of computers and advanced technologies, \nbusinesses have fundamentally changed the way they operate and the types of workers \n\n6 \n that they require. At the same time , the rapid increase in globalization has provided new \nopportunities for some c ompanies , while increasing competition for others .  \nManufacturing , for instance , is a sector that has historically demanded a large \nnumber of middle -skilled jobs . However , both global forces and technological advances  \nhave had a profound effect on manufact uring employment . Today , fewer than 10 percent \nof workers in the U nited States  are employed in the manufacturing sector  compared to \nmore than 20 percent in 1980.  These trends are unlikely to reverse , and continued \ntechnological innovations will likely broaden their reach into both higher - and lower -\nskilled jobs.  \nThe dramatic shifts tied to job polarization offer some expla nation as to  why \nmany people feel that their economic prospects haven’t improved . On average, salaries \nfor middle -skill jobs are close to the m edian income for all workers.  As opportunities for \nworking in a middle -skill job, and thus a middle -class lifestyle, have dwindled, workers \nhave increasingly been faced with a choi ce between two distinct paths. For workers who \nacquire  the education and training required for high -skill jobs, they have the opportunity \nto pursue employment in jobs that typically pay 50 percen t more than the median salary. \nBut for those workers who do n ot have the needed training and skills, their options are \nincreasingly shifting toward low -skill jobs that typically pay 50 percent below the median \nsalary.  \nUnderstanding t hese trends helps to reconcile the two versions of the la bor market \nI described earl ier. Busine ss leaders trying to develop  new businesses and technologies \nrequire high -skilled workers, which remain in short supply . Alternatively, the m illions of \n\n7 \n other workers in traditional middle -skill occupations  may not have the option of spending \nmonths, or years, to update their skills . These workers  face insecurity  about their career .  \n \nThe Role of Monetary Policy  \n As the Federal Reserve considers these and other economic trends , it must weigh \na number of crosscurrents  to determine the appropriate interest rate policy . In the short -\nrun, I continue to monitor how the energy, agricultural and manufacturing sectors are \nadjusting relative to the national economy. And o ver the longer -run, I evaluate what \ntrends like job pola rization mean for monetary policy. These are challenging questions \nwith no easy answers.  For the most part,  monetary policy is limited in the support it can \noffer any particular sector. It is also limited in its ability to affect trends like job \npolarizati on.  \nInstead, monetary policy has the broad goals of promoting stable prices, full \nemployment, and moderate long -term interest rates . Since the crisis, conditions have \nimproved sufficiently that the  FOMC  deemed it appropriate to raise the  target range for \nthe federal funds rate by 25 basis points  last December. This was a significant step, as it \nwas the first increase in short -term interest rates sinc e the middle of 2006. No further \nadjustments have occurred this year, as the FOMC  weighs e conomic developments and \nmonitors risks to the outlook . The current setting for the federal funds rate is well below \nwhat the FOMC  expects will prevail in the longer  term. T he plan is to move gradually \nand in a way that is responsive to economic developmen ts.  \nI support a gradual adjust ment  of short -term interest rates toward a more normal \nlevel , but I view the current level as too low for today’s economic conditions.  The \n\n8 \n economy is at or near full employment and inflation is close to  the FOMC’s target of 2  \npercent , yet short -term interest rates remain near historic lows. Just as raising rates too \nquickly can slow the economy and push inflation to undesirably low levels, keeping rates \ntoo low can also create risks. Interest -sensitive sectors can take on too much debt in \nresponse to low rates and grow quickly, then unwind in ways that are disruptive. We \nwitnessed this during both the housing crisis and the current adjustments in the energy \nsector.  Because monetary policy has a  powerful effect on financial conditions, it can give \nrise to imbalances  or capital misallocation  that negatively affect s longer -run growth . \nAccordingly , I favor taking additional steps in the normalization process.  \nMoving rates to a more -normal level and at a gradual pace  is necessary to \nminimize distortions in the economy that can build over many years when rates are held \nso low. With gradual adjustments, the F ederal Reserve  is more likely in my view  to \nachieve its long -run goals and by doing so, foster conditions for steady growth that \nbenefit both New Mexico and the nation."

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApril 7, 2016  \nEconomic Forum  \nYork, Neb.  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve \nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.  \n\n 1 “It seems rather striking that one of the ideas now firmly imbedded in our articles \nof material faith, the concept of governmental responsibility for m oderating economic \ngyrations, is almost entirely a product of our own Twentieth Century.  \n “This concept, which is steadily being brought into sharper focus, has evolved \nfrom general reaction to a succession of material crises heavy in human hardship.  It \ngrew from mass desperation and demand for protection from economic disasters beyond \nindividual control.  \n “The Federal Reserve System, which I have the honor to represent, was our \nearliest institutional response to such a demand.  It emerged out of the urgen t need to \nprevent recurrences of such disasters as the money panic of 1907, and out of the thought \nthat the Government had a definite responsibility to prevent financial crises and should \nutilize all its powers to do so.  \n “Accordingly , … Congress entrusted  to the Federal Reserve System responsibility \nfor managing the money supply.  This was a historic and revolutionary step.  In framing \nthe Federal Reserve Act great care was taken to safeguard this money management from \nimproper interference by either priva te or political interests.  That is why we talk about \nthe overriding importance of maintaining our independence.  Hence we have our system \nof regional banks headed up by a coordinating Board in Washington intended to have \nonly that degree of centralized au thority required to discharge effectively a national \npolicy.  This constitutes, as those of you in this audience recognize, a blending of public \ninterest and private enterprise uniquely American in character.  Too few of us adequately \nrecognize or adequate ly salute the genius of the framers of our central banking system in \nproviding this organizational bulwark of private banking and business.  \n\n 2  “Since the Federal Reserve System came into being, the problems of inelasticity \nof currency and immobility of bank reserves -- which so often showed up as shortages of \ncurrency or credit in times of critical need -- have been eliminated, and money panics \nhave largely disappeared.  \n “In this specialized respect there can be no doubt that the System has made \nnotable progr ess, but in the more fundamental role of stabilizing the economy the record \nis not so clear.  All of us in the System are bending our best efforts to capitalize on the \nexperience of the past, and our current knowledge of money, so as to make as large a \ncontribution as possible in this direction.  But a note should be made here that, while \nmoney policy can do a great deal, it is by no means all powerful.  In other words, we \nshould not place too heavy a burden on monetary policy.  It must be accompanied by \nappropriate fiscal and budgetary measures if we are to achieve our aim of stable \nprogress.  If we ask too much of monetary policy we will not only fail but we will also \ndiscredit this useful, and indeed indispensable, tool for shaping our economic \ndevelopmen t.”1 \n I’ll pause here to give credit to former Federal Reserve Chairman William \nMcChesney Martin , who delivered these remarks on October 19, 1955.   His remarks \nmore than six decades ago remain relevant today and in particular echo my own concern \nthat the public has come to expect that monetary policy can solve for every problem that \nails the U .S. economy.  \nI am here in York, Nebraska , with members of our Omaha Branch office board of \ndirectors , who serve as important windows on the current economic landscape.  Those \n                                                        \n1 Addresss of William McChesney Martin , before the New York Group of the Investment Bankers \nAssociation of America, Waldorf A storia Hotel, New York City, Oct. 19, 1955  \n\n 3 insights are enormously valuable to me as I make my own assessments of the economy \nand form my policy views as a member of the Federal Open Market Committee  (FOMC) .  \nThis evening, I’ ll offer you my thoughts on the state of the economy and current \nstance of monetary policy.  As you may know, I did not agree with the Committee’s \ndecision to hold rates steady at the most recent policy meeting last month.  I’ll explain \nmy views about poli cy, noting these are my own views and are not necessarily \nrepresentative of others in the Federal Reserve System.  \n \nThe Economic Outlook  \nHere in Nebraska, a state with a significant agricultural profile, the economy has \nsoftened , as Nathan noted earlier in his remarks.  Across much of our region, the \ndowndraft in commodity prices, combined with a strong dollar, has had a chilling effect \non the regional economy.   \nFarm income is expected to weaken modestly in 2016, which would mark  a third \nconsecutive year in the current downturn. As lower income reduces cash flows, demand \nfor credit among farmers has continued to rise. At this stage, the delinquency rate on \nagricultural production loans remains well below levels from five years ago , and \nfarmland values, which are a significant contributor to the health of farm balance sheets, \nhave remained relatively stable. Should these values erode further, we might expect to \nsee further stresses on the agricultural sector.  \nLikewise, the dramatic  fall in oil and gas prices over the past 18 months has \nnegatively affected the region. The number of active oil and gas rigs in the U nited States  \nhas fallen by three -quarters, from almost 2,000 rigs at the peak to less than 500 today. \n\n 4 Weakness in energy -related investment has spread to upstream suppliers in \nmanufacturing sectors, resulting in broader signs of slowing capital investment  across the \nnation .  \nCredit conditions have tightened for energy -related companies , and s trains on the \nearnings are leading  to substantial job losses, particularly within our region, which \nincludes Oklahoma and Wyoming. The challenges facing those affected are substantial , \nalthough we do see that some of these workers are finding employment more easily than \nthey did during the  last oil price shock.2  \nBeyond these sectors, the U.S. economy as a whole has continued to expand , and \nit has been quite a long economic expansion by historical standards. Indeed, the FOMC \nviewed the economy a s sufficiently sound last December to warrant increasing short -term \ninterest rates.   \nSince the December meeting, economic data have largely confirmed an outlook \nfor further growth. We have received four strong labor reports as well as data showing \nthat inflation is moving higher.   \nUnfortu nately, however, the initiation of raising interest rates coincided with what \nappears to be a more vulnerable global economy, and a domestic economy that appears to \nbe slowing in the first quarter and is threatened by markets that are anxious, uncertain, \nand volatile. Faced with these dynamics, the Federal Reserve’s decisions to continue to \nnormalize its policy settings have become more difficult.   \nIn the face of such headwinds and uncertainty, the FOMC is guided by a focus on \nlonger -run objectives —those o bjectives outlined by Congress in the Federal Reserve Act \n                                                        \n2 Brown, Jason and Andres Kodaka , “The Reallocation of Energy -Sector Workers after Oil Price Boo ms \nand Busts ,” Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, The Macro  Bulletin, March 3, 2016.  \n\n 5 and expressed by the FOMC in its annual Longer Run Goals and Monetary Policy \nStrategy :  “The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Open \nMarket Committee shall maintain lon g run growth of the monetary and credit aggregates \ncommensurate with the economy's long run potential to increase production, so as to \npromote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices and moderate long -\nterm interest rates.”3 \nAlthough  financial markets were off to a volatile start this year, economic \nfundamentals remain relatively strong, particularly conditions in the labor market. More \njobs were added in both 2014 and 2015 than in any other year since the late 1990s .  This  \ntrend has conti nued  with the economy add ing an average of more than 200,000  net new \njobs per month  in 2016 . The ongoing  strength in job gains is well above the trend rate \nneeded to absorb new entrants into the labor force. As a result, we have seen people  who \nhad been on the sidelines and not working over the past five years  start to re -enter the \nlabor force. And even as people have returned to the labor market, job growth has been \nstrong enough so that the unemployment rate continued to fall  over the last  year. At 5.0 \npercent , the unemployment rate is quite close to the longer -run estimate of normal.  \nIn addi tion to a healthy labor market,  consumer spending has been supported by \nstronger household  balance sheet s. There are , of course , exceptions, but overall , \nhousehold budgets generally look far less extended today than they did in the mid -2000s. \nThe debt service ratio, which measures the burden of debt payments relative to income, is \nalso lower than at any other time since the Federal Reserve started collecting data on this \nmeasure in 1980.  \n                                                        \n3 Section 2A  of the Federal Reserve Act as amended by the Federal Reserve Reform Act of 1977.  \n\n 6 Household balance sheets also have benefited from housing prices . On a national \nbasis, prices are close to where they were prior to the crisis. The supply of homes remains \nquite limited , relative to the total number  of households, and is the lowest it’s been for \nmore than  40 years.4 This combination of limited inventory , robust job growth and low \ninterest rates  will likely support continued home price appreciation. Those positive \nconditions will remain tempered by other factors weighing on housing. Credit conditions \nremain tighter than before the crisis, and bankers tell me new mortgage application \nprocedures pose some challenges in moving borrowers through the finan cing process.  \nOverall, I view the health of household balance sheets and robust job growth as \nproviding a foundation for consumer spending to continue making steady contributions to \neconomic growth. This should allow G DP growth to continue near 2 percent,  which I \nview as  consistent with the economy’s  long-run potential.   \nWith an unemployment rate of 5.0 percent, the economy is near full employment. \nMeasures of inflation appear to reflect stable prices with upward movement in c ore PCE \ninflation year -over-year (from 1.3  percent  to 1.7  percent  over the past three  months) .  In \nthe interest of objectives to promote long -run sustainable growth with healthy \nemployment and price stability, I believe monetary policy should respond to these \ndevelopments by slowly removing accommodation.  \n \nThe Current Stance of Monetary Policy   \nToday, monetary policy can be viewed as  highly accommodative for three \nreasons. First, the current federal funds target range of between 0.25  percent to 0.5 \n                                                        \n4 Rappaport, Jordan, “ The Limited Supply of Homes,”  Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, The Macro  \nBulletin, March 23, 2016.  \n\n 7 percent  is quite far from the fed funds’ long -run level, which the FOMC views at around \n3.25% . Second, the FOMC has signaled that the fed funds rate will be raised only \ngradual ly. And third, the Fed continues to hold a $4.2 trillion balance sheet , which has \nthe effect of keeping longer -term interest rates low.  \nYears of experience, evidence and rese arch remind us that monetary policy is \nmost effective when used as a counter -cyclical tool . That means providing policy \naccommodation when deteriorating economic conditions threaten price stability and \nemployment. Conversely, it means unwind ing accommodati on as we see economic \nconditions improve . In other words, the Fed should cut rates when the economy stumbles \nor contracts, and raise rates as the economy recovers and grows .  \n \nThe Limits of Monetary Policy  \nWhile monetary policy can be an effective counter -cyclical tool, it is by no means \na counter -structural  tool. That is, monetary policy can work to smooth out some of the \nups and downs in economic activity, but can do little to push the trend rate of growth \nhigher. Any persistent attempts to do so will likely prove futile, as longer -run growth is \ndriven by real factors like population growth, productivity and the accumulation of \ncapital, both human capital from educational attainment and physical capital from \nbusiness investment .  \nThe FOMC  has ackno wledged that economic conditions will likely warrant a \ngradual pace of policy adjustments. I support that approach. A gradual path allows us to \ntake into account various headwinds and risks faced by the economy , and to proceed in a \n\n 8 manner that maintains po licy settings that are —and will continue to be for some time —\nvery accommodative.   \nWhile I view the gradual approach as appropriate, p ostponing the removal of \naccommodation  when the economy is near full employment and inflation is rising toward \nthe 2  percent  target could promote alternative risks that would decrease the likelihood of \nachieving our longer -run objectives. In the long run, a failure to keep interest rate policy \nin line with improving fundamentals can distort the allocation of capital tow ard less \nfruitful —or perhaps excessively risky —endeavors. Within the last two decades we have \nfaced episodes of accelerating equity prices, housing prices and, most recently, \ncommodity prices. Currently, commercial real estate markets, where prices have \ncontinued to drift higher , bear watching . When these types of imbalances tip, the entire \neconomy can face the consequences of their fallout, with some sectors and populations \nmore impacted than others.  My concern for some time has been that extending monetar y \npolicy too far beyond its scope of capability risks undesirable financial, economic and \npolitical distortions.  \nIn the current environment, w aiting to make additional adjustments to monetary \npolicy may seem costless in the face of benign inflation pressur es. Some argue that we \nhave the ability to make more rapid adjustments later if inflation moves higher than \ncurrently projected.  From a technical standpoint, it is true that the Fed has the ability to \nsteer short -term rates and could raise them quickly if needed. But such actions are likely \nto be costly, induc ing financial market volatility and slowing economic activity. \nHistorically, rapid increases in interest rates end poorly, resulting in economic recessions.  \n \n\n 9 Conclusion  \nStaying the course with a gradual path of policy normalization is warranted in my \nview. Removing accommodation i n small doses is consistent with the economy’s \nfundamentals, keeps policy accommodative  while global and domestic risks play out , and \ndoes not preclude pausing or respond ing if downside risks materialize."

Outlook and Monetary Policy  \n \n \nEsther L. George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFebruary 2, 2016  \nCentral Exchange  \nKansas City, M o. \n \n\n \n1 \n  \nThank you.  It’s a pleasure to be here at the Central Exchange. The Kansas City Fed has \nhad a long and productive relationship with the Central Exchange  and I always enjoy the \nopportunity to join you .  \nLast week, I participated in the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)  meeting where \nthe Committee decided to hold steady its target interest rate . I supported this decision and , in my \nremarks this afternoon , I will share my views on the economic outlook and monetary policy .  \nBefore we continue, I need to tell you that these comments represent my views and are \nnot necessarily reflective of others in the Federal Reserve System.  \n \nThe U .S. Outlook  \nSince the end of the financial crisis, the U.S. economy has grow n annually by about  2 \npercent and labor markets have made large strides toward healing. As a longer -term comparison, \nwe are now in the fifth -longest expansion in recorded U .S. history. Inflation has also remained \nlow and stable. While  there are always uncertainties about how the economy will perform in the \nfuture, it’s worth reflecting on the past and acknowledging the progress that has been made. \nRight now, I view the economy as being in a good spot, but I will also discuss some risks I am \nkeeping in m ind.   \nTurning first to recent data , economic growth slowed a bit  toward the end of last year , \nthough overall growth in 2015 was not too different than the past few years. Some of the softness \nreflected fewer exports and a modest step -down in the level of business investment in new \nstructures and equipment. Other factors, like inventory adjustments , also lowered the growth \nestimate.  \n\n \n2 \n While a single quarter of slower growth is important to watch, I take reassurance that the \neconomy remains on track due to strong job gains. In fact, j ob gains actually picked up  toward \nthe end of last year.  Looking at longer trends, employment growth has been quite strong over the \npast few years. More jobs were added in both 2014 and 2015 than in any year since the late \n1990s .  \nAt the same time, demographic changes are affect ing the labor market  outlook. For \nexample, U .S. population growth is slowing, which indicates not as many jobs need to be created \nas in the past to absorb new entrants into the labor force . As a result, I expect to see employment \ngrowth slow from its recent  pace and would not interpret a modest slowdown as a sign of trouble \nin the economy.   \nOverall, I see job gains as underpinning stronger consumer demand for goods and \nservices.  Low gasoline prices and signs of faster wage growth should  also add to consumers ’ \nability to increase spending.  And although financial markets have been volatile, household \nwealth remains at  a high level , and house prices have been rising over the past four years.  \nCertainly, the gains in jobs, wages and wealth have not been equally shared across households \nduring the recovery, but overall , the general health  of households’ financial situation s is much \nimproved since  the financial crisis.  \nEven as households  and consumers are doing better, some sectors of the economy are \nfacing headwinds. I mentioned earlier l ow gasoline prices, which o f course reflect low oil prices. \nBecause the energy sector is such an important part of the Kansas City Fed’s region al economy, \nwe monitor these developments closely. We know l ower oil prices benefit consumers, but also \nweigh on oil producers. We have certainly seen energy -intensive states affected. For example, \n\n \n3 \n we are seeing more  people every week filing claims for unemployment insurance in Oklahoma \nthan was the case a few years ago.  \nJust as d evelopments in the energy sector bear watching, so do challenges facing the \nmanufacturing sector. The rise in the foreign exchange value of the U .S. dollar, for example, has \nresulted in lower orders from abroad for many of our exporters. In addition, foreign growth in \nsome parts of the world has been uneven and slowing, which has  affected foreign demand for \nsome U .S. goods. Despite these headwinds , the U.S. economy has proven itself to be resilient to \na wide range of shocks in recent years, including sluggish growth abroad . \nFinally, i nflation has remained muted as a result of l ower oil prices and the strong U.S. \ndollar . Recent movements in each of thes e have been quite large by historical standards. Yet , \ndespite these headwinds, core measures of inflation have recently risen on a year -over-year basis.  \nAnd although inflation rates over the past few years have hovered below  the Fed’s goal of 2  \npercent , they have been positive and broadly consistent with price stability.  \n \nRisks to the Outlook  \nOutlooks are subject to change, and forecasts are imperfect predictions of the future.  As \na result, those , like me , who rely on forecasts,  must think about what could go wrong  and how \nincoming data might affect the outlook for the economy .  Gauging whether a temporary \nslowdown in growth, financial market volatility or foreign developments  is a harbinger of \nweaker growth or a reflection of temporary factors , can be  difficult and often require s assessing \nbroader trends and risks.   \nRight now, I view the U .S. economy as in a generally  good position. However, a few \ndevelopments bear watching. I mentioned the energy sector. We are certainly paying attention to \n\n \n4 \n any spillovers that energy job losses may have on the broader economy. Elevated inventories in \nsome sectors also  pose a risk  to the extent that manufacturing production slow s further to  better \nalign current inventory levels with final sales and shipments o f goods.  Finally, g lobal growth is \ncommonly pointed to as a risk. While I wouldn’t discount recent developments abroad, I also \nnote that many forecasts point to a modestly stronger foreign outlook this year than in 2015.  Still, \nsome emerging markets carry substantial debt, so a crisis in one area can transmit to others. But \ndespite these concerns , the fundamentals of the U.S. economy currently appear strong enough to \nsustain positive growth going forward.  \n \nThe Path for Monetary Policy  \nTurning to monetary po licy, for seven years, the FOMC maintained near-zero interest \nrates and undertook a  series of  large -scale asset purchase program s — a policy stance re sponding \nto a historic financial and economic emergency  in 2008 .  Accordingly, the FOMC’s decision to \nalter that policy stance in December garnered a great deal of attention when the benchmark \ninterest rate was increased by 25 basis point s.  I supported this decision , although I viewed it as a \nlate start to what is likely to be  a gradual  path toward  normalizing interest rates .   \nAfter such a prolonged period of low rates, the FOMC is understandably cautious.  \nMoving rates gradually may avoid unnecessarily jolting the economy or causing excessive \nfinancial market volatility. Even looking at developments so far this year, financial markets have \nbeen quite volatile. While taking a signal from such volatility is warranted, monetary policy \ncannot respond  to every blip in financial markets . Instead, a focus on economic fundamentals, \nsuch as labor markets and inflation, can help guard against monetary policy over - or under -\nreacting to swings in financial conditions . To a great extent , the recent  bout of  volatility is not all \n\n \n5 \n that unexpected, nor necessarily worrisome, given that the Fed’s low interest rate and bond -\nbuying policies focused on boosting asset prices as a means of stimulating the real economy.  As \nasset prices adjust to the shift in monetary policy , it is to be expected that the pricing of risk will \nrealign to this different rate environment . \nOverall, it is important to remember  that e ven after th is first rate hike, monetary policy \nremains  highly accommodative .  Real interest rates continue to be negative and the Federal \nReserve ’s large portfolio of Treasury and mortgage -backed securities  keep s downward pressure \non longer -term rates .  \nIn communicating its intentions for further rate increases, t he Committee has noted that it \nexpects economic conditions will warrant only  gradual increases in the fed funds rate , although \nadjustments ultimately depend on the incoming data .  My own view is that a pickup in economic \ngrowth, steady job gains and modestly higher core rates of inflation will warrant further \nincreases .   \nThe exact timing of each move, however, is subject to the economic environment.   \nBecause  monetary  policy affects the economy with lags , decisions must necessarily rely on \nforeca sts and their associated risks — not waiting until desired objectives are realized.   \nIf we wait for the data to provide complete confirmation before making a policy decision, \nwe may well have waited too long.  Likewise, policy may be faced with altering its trajectory if \nthe economy’s p rogress points to a different outlook.  But in the absence of any substantial shift \nin the outlook, my view is that the Committee should continue the gradual adjustment of moving \nrates higher to keep them aligned with economic activity and inflation. These actions are often \ndifficult, but also necessary to keep growth in line with the economy’s long -run potential and to \nfoster price stability.   \n\n \n6 \n  \nInstitutional Challenges  \nAs the Federal Reserve contemplates the appropriate path of normalizing its monetary \npolicy, it naturally does so with considerable public attention.  One source of this attention \ncomes from Congress itself.  Calls for legislative reforms of the Federal Re serve have persisted \nover the past five years, ranging from its structure and governance to its monetary policy \napproach and decision making.  Additionally, Congress has shown its willingness to tap the \nFederal Reserve to fund fiscal activities ranging fro m new government agencies to highway \nconstruction.   \nI understand that Fed actions during the crisis have raised a number of questions about \nthe institution and its scope. When Congress established the Federal Reserve more than a century \nago, it designed t he institution to be apolitical but with accountability to Congress. This construct \nwas designed to protect the stewards of the nation’s money supply from the vulnerabilities \nassociated with short -term political agendas.  It includes important checks and b alances that are \noften misunderstood, but nonetheless critical to the functioning of the institution.   \nDuring my 33 years at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, the primary focus of \nthousands of dedicated Federal Reserve employees has been the health  of the economy, \nsupported by an efficient and accessible banking and payments system. To the extent that there is \nany doubt in the minds of Congress or the public about this, it is incumbent on the Federal \nReserve to work with Congress in a direct and tra nsparent way until we satisfy any remaining \nquestions about the execution of our mission.  Such dialogue would provide the highest \nprobability for outcomes that best serve the public interest.  \n In that spirit, I look forward to 2016 and the promise it hol ds."
