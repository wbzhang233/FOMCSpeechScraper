Hoenig \nPresident \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n \n      \n \n            \nNational Association of Realtors Conference \nNew Orleans, La. \nNovember 5, 2010 \n   \nThe views expressed by the author are his own and do not necessa rily reflect those of the Fede ral Reserve System, its governors , \nofficers or representatives.\n\n \nIntroduction \nMy position on the current stance of our  nation’s monetary policy is well known, \nespecially to those who closely follow the Federal Reserve. The Federal Open Market \nCommittee has met seven times this year, and at each of those meetings I have cast a dissenting \nvote against the majority opinion of keeping the federal funds rate target at  its current level near \nzero for an “extended period.” \nI realize that advocating an interest rate in crease is not the best  applause line at a \nRealtors’ conference. However, I believe that moving rates modestly off of zero, where they \nhave been since December 2008, still represents highly accommodative monetary policy. More \nimportantly, such action is necessary if we are to  ensure a more stable economy that can thereby \nfoster a more sustainable housing market.   \nHow Can We Revive Housing? \nWe have all suffered through the worst colla pse in housing prices since the 1930s, and \nthe situation we face will not be easily corrected. \nThe housing collapse can be characterized as a classic asset-price bubble spurred by low \ninterest rates, easily accessible and often-unsound  financing, over-optimism about housing price \ntrends, and a high—and difficult to control—leve l of subsidies that flowed into housing. \nAlthough we may have experienced a few excepti onal years of housing activity, those years do \nnot come close to making up for the economic r ecession, foreclosures, erased wealth and slow \nrecovery that we now are experiencing. \n2 \n \n\nGiven this experience, the question that now confronts us is, “What can we do to create \nmore stable housing markets and lessen the boom -bust cycles in housing?” These cycles have \nunfortunately become all too familiar over the past few decades.  \nSome argue that our housing and mortgage mark ets will not recover in a timely fashion \nwithout extensive public support.  Among the suggested solutions are expanding Federal Housing \nAdministration lending and the role of the Fede ral Home Loan Banks and allocating whatever \nfunds are needed to bring the tw o housing agencies, Fannie Mae a nd Freddie Mac, back to their \npre-crisis role for housing. Other ideas include a renewal of tax credits for home purchases and \nmore extensive programs for mortgage restructur ings. From the Federal Reserve, some want a \ncontinuation of near-zero interest rates for an extended period and greater investments in \nmortgage instruments. \nIn sharp contrast to that vi ew, others suggest that the fi nancial crisis has exposed a \nnumber of critical flaws in our housing policie s and mortgage finance system that call for a \nsignificant “re-look” at how we finance this industry. For inst ance, Paul Volcker, who was \nchairman of the Federal Reserve during a porti on of the 1980s real estate crisis, recently \ndescribed the U.S. mortgage indus try as “dysfunctional” and a “creature of the government” that \nneeds reform.  \nThe options seem to fall out to either re building a system backed by extensive public \nsupport, subsidies and other prot ections, or build a new framework that returns housing finance \nto greater reliance on private market forces.  \nI support a policy path that re turns the housing industry toward  greater market discipline \nand greater long-run stab ility. This path requires a great ly reduced role for governmental \nintervention and public subsidies that have di storted the market over recent decades. The \n3 \n \n\nAmerican public, including as piring homeowners and those of you employed in the housing \nindustry, might be best served, over time, by reduci ng or removing these subsidies as part of our \nnational policy. \nThere are several factors that argue for making such a change in policy. First, the crisis \nclearly shows that a mortgage finance sy stem based on expanding the incentives and \nopportunities to take on more debt with little equity places hous eholds at significant financial \nrisk and creates unsustainable trends in housing expansion.  \nSecond, such policies create harmful distor tions within the economy, and they are \nenormously expensive in terms of both their e xplicit and implicit costs, to both taxpayers and \nhomeowners, especially when things go badly. Many of the subsidies directed toward housing \nhave been extremely inefficient, with other par ties capturing most of the benefits rather than \nhomeowners. \nMoreover, with the growing federal budget defi cits and the many interests that will be \nintensely competing for public funds, it is unrealis tic to expect that all can be accommodated or \nthat housing can continue to command the same portion of public funds and levels of taxpayer \nsupport and exposure. In brief, housing policy is  badly flawed, and today’s budget environment \nrequires reform. \n \nFix Freddie and Fannie \nWhat specific steps should we take? The first and most obvious step is to reform the two \nhousing finance vehicles of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These two institutions were \nresponsible for more than half of all U.S. mortgages passed thr ough the system at the height of \nthe housing boom. These government-sponsored enterprises were assigned goals around \n4 \n \n\naffordable housing that contributed dramatically to the growth in subprime credit and the decline \nin lending standards that led to the crisis. Fannie and Freddie clearly  fit the pattern of what Paul \nVolcker said we must avoid: “Private when things are going well and public when things are \ngoing badly.”  \nSeveral studies have found that the vari ous subsidies received by Fannie and Freddie \nhave done little to lower mortgage rates. Instead, the vast majority  of such benefits accrued to \nFannie and Freddie’s stockholders or was used to gain political  favor. For example, only two \nmonths before Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were  put into conservatorship in September 2008, \nmedia accounts detailed how both had made the list of Washington’s top 10 lobbying spenders \nover the previous decade. Together, they had spent a total of $170 million.1 At that time, Fannie \nemployed 51 lobbyists and Freddie paid 91, with  both counting former members of Congress \namong their hired guns. This was only two years af ter the Federal Election Commission levied a \n$3.8 million penalty against Freddie related to char ges it was illegally involved in 85 political \nfundraisers.  \nConsidering the high level of political activ ism on the part of these GSEs, it should not \nsurprise you to learn that both Fannie and Freddie are considered “heavy hitters” on the Center for Responsive Politics’ website, OpenSecrets.or g, which provides a wide range of data on \nmoney’s influence on U.S. elections and policy. Th at designation means that both are among the \nbiggest donors to federal-level politics since 1989.  \nSo, while Fannie and Freddie have spent m illions on lobbying and building influence in \nWashington, their losses could cost taxpayers as much as $363 billion, according to recent \nestimates—and those are just the direct losses. Th e overall losses that could be attributed to the \nGSEs are likely to be several multiples higher when we consider that without their implied \n                                                \n \n1 USA Today, July 17, 2008. \n5 \n \n\n“federal guarantee” and related incentives around ris k, the markets might have been far more \ncautious and the financial crisis far less prolific . More stunning perhaps, had these institutions \nbeen held to stricter financial standards, far fewer households would have suffered the tragedy of \nforeclosures, the lost home equity and the lo ss of personal savings a nd wealth that today \ncontinues to hold back our economic recovery.   \nGiven the costs and market distortions these government-supported institutions brought \nwith them, we should be confident that they shou ld not be allowed to operate in the future as \nthey have in the past. We cannot afford to igno re that through their us e of implicit government \nfunding guarantees, they held a significant compet itive advantage in the marketplace, and that \nthis in turn encouraged excessive risk on their balance sheets, w ith tragic outcomes. \n Given past errors, how might we approach the need for some modest support for future \nfinancing within the housing indus try? I see two basic options. \nFirst, if we judge that some public support is  needed, we could esta blish public  entities \nthat focus solely on the secu ritization of conventional, c onforming mortgages with strong \nunderwriting standards, tight public oversight and balance sheets limited to holding amounts \nnecessary for warehousing loans to be securiti zed. This makes the government a conduit only, \nfacilitating the flow of capital but not providi ng the implicit guarantees on funding and assets \nheld that contributed to this cr isis. The market remains the fina l arbiter of standards and funding. \nA second option would be to give private en tities sole authority to securitize pools of \nconforming mortgages—similar to what is now done  with jumbo mortgages. If the Congress was \ndisposed to provide some favor to housing, a federal guarantee could be given to certain \nsecurities backed by mortgages meeting strict co nforming loan standards. However, such favored \nstatus should be based on some limiting factor, such as need or special purpose.  \n6 \n \n\nEither of these two options would address many of the problems associated with Fannie \nand Freddie in this crisis and would create a mo re transparent and competitive marketplace. The \nlatter option involving privately owned entities would offer the a dditional benefits of greater \nmarket discipline and insulation from political influence and control.  \n \nEnforce Sound Lending Standards  \nRegardless of these actions, we must as a nati on insist on the return to sound real estate \nlending standards. We know today that countries th at avoided the worst of this most recent real \nestate meltdown did a better and more consistent job in maintaining an effective and consistent \nset of standards for loan-to-value and debt-to-in come ratios. Some count ries, such as Canada, \neven tightened mortgage lending requirements when  real estate markets heated up. In the United \nStates, the oppos ite occurred. \nWhile sound credit standards are a key respons ibility of individual lenders, public policy \nalso played an important role in the deteriora tion of loan quality in the United States. This \noccurred largely through public efforts to prom ote and subsidize homeownership and increase \naccess to housing credit. During the crisis, politic ians, regulators and market participants were \nsingled out for blame. In reality, it was a group effort. \n In the years leading to this most recent crisis, a common theme emerged at all levels: \nHouseholds can accommodate more debt relative to income. A report titled The 1994 National \nHomeownership Strategy: Partners in the American Dream  stated: “Financing strategies fueled \nby the creativity and resources of the private and public sect ors should address…financial \nbarriers to homeownership [and]…reduce downpa yment requirements and interest costs by \nmaking terms more flexible.” In other word s, the key to homeownership from a political \n7 \n \n\nperspective is to promote more creative and flexib le lending standards, or  what, in hindsight, we \nmight more correctly call high leverage. \nThis political desire for creative and flex ible lending was hardly new in 1994, though. It \nwas also a central fixture in the real estate collapse of the 1980s. A Senate report on a 1982 \nlegislative provision to remove national bank loan-t o-value limits on real estate lending provides \na powerful insight into the causes of financial cris es. According to this re port, the purpose of the \nlegislative change was “to provide national banks with the ability to engage in more creative and \nflexible financing, and to become stronger pa rticipants in the home financing market.” \nAlthough creative and flexible financing mi ght remain a goal in housing, sound lending \nstandards cannot be ignored if we are to have sustainable housing growth. With this in mind, the \nFederal Reserve in 2008 revised rules implemen ting the Home Ownership and Equity Protection \nAct. These rules simply prohibit lenders from  making loans without co nsidering a borrower’s \nability to repay the loan from income and asse ts other than a home’s value. Who would have \nthought it necessary to write rules that  are otherwise nothing but common sense? \nWe should also take a closer look at the loan-to-value guidelines that depository \ninstitutions are required to follow in making real estate loans. We should review guidelines to \nensure they are adequate, and we should apply them equitably to other lenders. Other lending \nprovisions, subsidies and public policies directed toward the housing sector and home financing \nalso need to be examined. These would incl ude the risk weights for mortgage loans and \nmortgage-backed securities under th e Basel capital requir ements, state and federal tax deductions \nfor mortgage interest, reliance on credit rati ng agencies’ assessments  of mortgage-backed \nsecurities, and the wide variety of other public policies related to housing. Given current housing \n8 \n \n\nconditions and the way a number of subsidies have become embedded in our housing system, \nsome policy reforms would have to be phased in  gradually and after ma rkets have recovered.  \nA key point in reviewing U.S.  housing finance policies should  be to consider whether \nthey encourage homeownership in a cost-eff ective manner without put ting homeowners at \nunacceptably high financial risk. The 2005 Presiden t’s Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform, \nfor instance, concluded that the federal tax deduction for mortgage interest provided an \n“incentive to take on more debt,” involved large subsidies that encouraged “overinvestment in \nhousing” and was “not shared equally among a ll taxpayers,” with higher-income households \nreceiving “a disproportionate be nefit.” Accordingly, the panel recommended replacing the \ndeductions with tax credits and placing a cap on the benefits as a means of distributing the \nbenefits more evenly and limiting the incentive s to take on excessive  amounts of debt.  \nWith regard to promoting housing through in terest rate policies, I have many times \npublicly expressed my views about the dangers  of using monetary tools and the Federal \nReserve’s balance sheet to pursue low interest rates and fund mortgage-b acked securities. The \nonly additional point that I would repeat is that  for home financing to follow a path that is \nsustainable over time, the Federal Open Market  Committee must begin ta king steps to normalize \nmonetary policy. \n \nConclusion \nEconomists Hyman Minsky, Charles Kindleberge r, and, more recently, Carmen Reinhart \nand Kenneth Rogoff have all writ ten extensively about how high credit growth and the financial \nimbalances that develop during economic upturns sow the seeds fo r future financial instability. \nIn a similar manner, a Norwegian economist looked  at banking and financial crises in Norway \n9 \n \n\n10 \n going all the way back to the early 1800s. She f ound that every major cris is was preceded by a \nrapid run-up in real housing prices. Consequently , it is apparent that uns ustainable trends in \nhousing prices and home financing have been a major contributor to financial crises. \nThe United States stands virtually alone in its use of GSEs and significant subsidies to \npromote homeownership. Fannie Mae, Freddie M ac and their political supporters have long \nattempted to justify this system by saying that  “American housing finance is the envy of the \nworld.” Few would believe that today. \nIt is time for a significant change. We must move toward a system with fewer subsidies \nand misdirected incentives. Furthermore, to ensure  accountability, any hous ing subsidies that we \ndecide to keep should be made explicit, voted on transparently and carefully targeted to the \nintended beneficiaries: potential homeowners most in need and fo r whom such support will bring \nsuccess. \nMany of you might question whether a system w ith greatly reduced subsidies will work. \nA partial answer to this question can be found in international comparisons. A recent study, for \ninstance, found that in terms of homeownership rates, the United  States ranked only 17th out 26 \neconomically advanced countries . Many countries have achieve d higher homeownership rates \nwithout—and perhaps because they don’t have—many of the special privileges of U.S. housing \nfinance, such as GSEs, minimal down payments, 30-year fixed-rate loans and mortgage interest \ntax deductions. To this list, we could also add non-recourse debt instruments, government \npromotion of “creative and flexible financing,” th e ability to prepay loans, affordable housing \ngoals and similar government housing programs. \nIn making these remarks, I am not suggesting we do away with all support for housing. I \nam saying it is time for change.",

        "content": "Hard Choices \n \n \n        \nThomas M. Hoenig \nPresident \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n           \nTown Hall Meeting \nLincoln, Nebraska \nAugust 13, 2010 \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n The views expressed by the author are his own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers or representatives.  \n\n \nThese are trying times for the U.S. econom y.  The unemployment rate is almost 10 \npercent, our financial system remains under stress, community bank failures have become \nweekly news and the central bank is printing money to such an extent that zero interest rates \nbring little return to t hose who choose to save.  \nNot in decades has the Federal Reserve seen such challenges in how it conducts monetary \npolicy.  With this in mind, this morning I will give you my sense of the issues we face and the \nhard choices that must be made.  I'll begin by focusing on financial reform  legislation, including \nmy observations about where we are with too-bi g-to-fail.  Then I'll turn to the economy and \nmonetary policy. \n \nRegulatory Choices  \n \nOn March 6, 2009, I gave a speech in Omaha called “Too Big Has Failed.”  I shared my \nthoughts about the financial crisis and my c oncern for the long-run effects of bailing out \ninvestors of the largest financial institutions .  That speech hit a nerve by stating what many \nconsidered a simple truth, which is that taxp ayers should not subsidiz e our largest financial \nfirms. With our very important Federal Reserv e Branch office in Omaha, I have been in \nNebraska many times since then, but this is my first trip back after the passage of financial \nreform legislation, so it seems an  appropriate time to review some of the implications of enacting \nthe 2,300-page law.   \nOverall, important steps were taken in an e ffort to strengthen and enhance the regulatory \nframework and accountability of fina ncial institutions.  However, th e success of this legislation \nentirely depends on how well regulatory authorities implement the new requirements. \nThere is, for example, a provision called the Volcker Rule, which will limit \na large firm’s ability to set up speculative activit ies.  So-called “proprietary” trading and the \nsponsorship of hedge funds that engage in hi gher-risk activities must be done outside of \ncommercial banks and bank holding companies, away  from direct access to insured funds and \nthe Federal Reserve’s discount window. This is an important provision.  However, there are exceptions to the rule and, again, whether it work s as intended will depend on how strongly  the \nrules are written, and how well they  are interpreted and enforced. \n\nThe legislation also sets up a new consumer bureau to address the gaps in unregulated \nand under-regulated financial firms, including mortgage finance companies, payday lenders and \ncredit card issuers.  Its success will depend on whether it can appropriately identify those \ninstitutions exploiting those gaps and bring them into accepted sta ndards of behavior.  If the new \nbureau merely directs its resources to the already heavily regulated community banks, its \nbeneficial effects will be minor.  A targeted implem entation program is critical if the consumer is \nto experience the hoped-for benefits. \nThe legislation primarily hoped to address th e public’s concerns about too-big-to-fail \ninstitutions—that is, those that are so large a nd interconnected that th ey will be bailed out by \ntaxpayers no matter what risks a nd bad decisions they make because they are too “systemically \nimportant” to be allowed to fail.  Whether or not  too-big-to-fail is addr essed by this legislation \ndepends on the leadership at the regulatory agenci es when the next crisis occurs.  The law now \nrequires that the FDIC take into receivership an  institution that is designated as “in default or \ndanger of default” for which the regular bankrupt cy process would have systemic consequences.  \nThe process for taking this action is complex, requ iring multiple regulatory parties to agree, the \nTreasury Secretary making the final determination with the President’s concurrence, and a court \nruling that the action isn’t arbitrar y and capricious.  This will be an incredible challenge for the \nregulatory agencies.  Recent experience tells us that  time is of the essence in a national liquidity \ncrisis. It will be extremely difficult in practice to  designate the largest institutions as insolvent, \ntake them over and liquidate.  The simple trut h is “too-big-to-fail” wi ll not go away easily. \nOur largest institutions, even after their poor performance during this last crisis, remain \nfinancially and politically powerful institutions.  It gives me pause, for example, that after the recent devastating experience of the global bank ing crisis, regulatory au thorities are already \nbacking off initial attempts to strengthen in ternational capital requirements for these largest \nbanks and financial firms.  The Basel Committee just announced an agreement to establish for our largest global banks a Tier 1 ca pital-to-asset ratio of 3 percent.   This is a 33-to-1 leverage \nratio.  Bear Stearns entere d this crisis and failed with a 34-to-1  leverage ratio.  It leaves a small \ncushion for error and is a level of  risk that I judge unacceptable.  \nAs I consider the outlook for financial regu lation, I am hopeful but realistic re garding  \nwhether next time things will be different.   Regulatory agencies have been given a mandate and authority to strengthen oversight of the larges t firms.  Success will depend on whether we choose \nto make hard calls and to use the new author ity with integrity, fairness and resolve.   \n\n \nMonetary Choices  \n \nI want to spend my remaining time on mone tary policy.  I acknowledge that there are \ndifferent perspectives on the array of economic data we receive and analyze, and therefore there \nare legitimate, differing views a bout what is best for the econo my. The Federal Reserve has a \ndual mandate to pursue stable prices and stab le long-term growth.  The entire FOMC is \ncommitted to pursuing those goals, but there are differing views on the causes and fixes to our current situation.   \nI have been at the Fed through past swings in the business cycle.  There is today a \nfamiliar theme as I listen to the media, various economists and “market experts.”  They say we are entering the era of a “new normal” in whic h we have to accept high unemployment and low \nincome growth and that interest rates will remain at  zero indefinitely.  They warn that deflation is \na serious risk and that the U.S. could become another Japan, which must be avoided at all costs.  Before this week’s FOMC meeting, The Wall Street Journal wrote that the Fed would add more \nstimulus into the economy—including the purchase of long-term treasuries.  It turns out that \nreporter was remarkably prescient.  \nI share these concerns about our econo my.  Economic conditions are far from \nsatisfactory, unemployment is simply too high, and we  want a stronger recovery.  But as much as \nI want short-term improvement, I am mindful of possible longer-term consequences of zero \ninterest rates and further easing actions.  Rather than improve economic outcomes, I worry that \nthe FOMC is inadvertently adding to “uncerta inty” by taking such actions.  Remember, high \ninterest rates did not cause the financial crisis or the recessi on.  Let me summarize four key \npoints that I judge releva nt in choosing among moneta ry policy options.   \n \nTrend data show modest recovery \n \nThe recovery is proceeding as many economists ear lier this year outlined  that it would.  It \nis a modest recovery, with mixed results.  Yet,  GDP is likely to expand at somewhere around a 3 \npercent rate through the re mainder of the year.  Month-to-month data will be mixed, as is typical \nduring recovery.  For example, industrial pr oduction was down 0.3 percent for April, up 1.3 \npercent for May, and up 0.1 per cent for June.  New orders for non-defense capital goods \n\nexcluding aircraft were down 2.8 percent in Ap ril, up 4.7 percent in May, and up 0.6 percent in \nJune.  Durable goods orders were up by 2.9 percen t in April, down 0.7 percent in May and down \n1.2 percent in June.  Corporate profits are bei ng reported as consistently strong, month after \nmonth.  What these data points tell me is that  volatile monthly data should not drive policy \nactions. \nWhile monthly data may be mixed, the trend data are consistently positive. Private job \ngrowth has been less than hoped for but positiv e nonetheless.  Private payrolls increased 630,000 \nsince January 1.  In the first half of the year, private labor income incr eased in all components: \nhours worked, employment and wages.  Hours worked have risen more rapidly than \nemployment, which is typical for the early stages of an economic  recovery.  In fact, we are \nexperiencing a better pace of rec overy this time than at this po int in our previous two economic \nrecoveries.    \nIn addition, since the second quarter of 2009, personal income growth has increased 2.8 \npercent, consumption is up 1.6 percent, investment  in equipment and software is up 15 percent, \nand housing is up 5.3 percent.  Year-over-year, in dustrial production is up 8.2 percent, high tech \nis up 20 percent and manufacturing is up 8.3 percen t.  Corporate profits are up 57 percent since \nthe fourth quarter of 2008. While we are not where we want to be, the economy is recovering \nand, barring specific shocks and bad policy, it shoul d continue to grow over the next several \nquarters. \n \nCorrections take time \n \nWe are recovering from a horrific set of shocks, and it will take time to “right the ship.”  \nMoreover, the financial and economic shocks we have experienced did not “just happen.”  The \nfinancial collapse followed years of too-low in terest rates, too-high leverage, and too-lax \nfinancial supervision as pres cribed by deregulation from both Democratic and Republican \nadministrations.  In judging how we approach this recovery, it seems to me that we need to be \ncareful not to repeat those policy patterns that followed the recessions of 1990-91 and 2001.  If \nwe again leave rates too low, too long out of our uneasiness over the strength of the recovery and \nour intense desire to avoid recessi on at all costs, we are risking a repeat of past errors and the \nconsequences they bring. \n\nHere are some important figures regarding just how out of balance our economy became \nand what might have contributed to these im balances between the early ‘90s and today: \n• The real fed funds rate averaged 1.6 percent between 1991 and 1995, 0.37 percent \nbetween 2001 and 2005 and -1.0 percent from 2008 to the present, hardly a tight \npolicy environment. \n•  Gross federal debt increased from 60 percent to 75 percent of nominal GDP \n•  Consumer debt increased from 63 pe rcent to 94 percent of nominal GDP \n•  Nonfinancial debt increased from 189 pe rcent of nominal GDP at the start of the \ndecade to 234 percent by December 2008. \n• Between 1993 and 2007, the average leverage of the 20-largest financial \ninstitutions in the U.S. (total assets-to- tangible equity capital) increased from 18-\nto-1, to over 25-to-1, reac hing as high as 31-to-1. \n• The U.S. increased its debt to the rest of  the world dramatically from 4.87 percent \nto 24.32 percent of nominal GDP. \n \nObviously, the effect of these trends on our  economy has been significant and we must \naccept that they will not be corrected quickly. \n \nIt is not time for tight policy \n \nIn my view, maintaining an accommodative mone tary policy is necessary at this time, but \na clear policy path toward a less highly accommodative policy will encourage a more sustained \nrecovery.  Under such a policy, financial dele veraging will evolve slowly and many of the \nremaining economic imbalances will rebalance.   Under such a policy, the economy will expand \nat a sustainable moderate pace with similar mode rate job growth, but job growth that will be \nstable and resilient.  There may be ways to  accelerate GDP growth, but in my view, highly \nexpansionary monetary policy is not a good option.   \nTo be clear, I am not advocating a tight monetary policy.  I am a dvocating a policy that \nremains accommodative but slowly firms as the economy itself expands and moves toward more \nbalance.  I advocate dropping the “extended peri od” language from the FOMC’s statement and \nremoving its guarantee of low rates.  This tells the market that it must again accept risks and lend \nif it wishes to earn a return.  The FOMC would announce that its policy rate will move to 1 \n\npercent by a certain date, subject to current conditions.  At 1 per cent, the FOMC would pause to \ngive the economy time to adjust and to gain c onfidence that the recovery remains on a reasonable \ngrowth path.  At the appropriate time, rates would be moved further up toward 2 percent, after \nwhich the nominal fed funds rate will depend on how well the economy is doing. \nIf such a path were chosen, then how mi ght GDP and important components perform?  \nLet me start with consumption, which for d ecades amounted to about 63 percent of GDP.  \nDuring the boom it rose to 70 percent.  It seem s reasonable that the consumer will most likely \nreturn toward more historical levels relative to  GDP and then grow in line with income.  If so, \nthe consumer will contribute to growth but is unli kely to intensify its contribution to previously \nunsustainable levels. \nTo view the role of the consumer from a nother perspective, I w ould note that personal \nsavings declined from nearly 10 percent of dis posable income in 1985 to less than 2 percent in \n2007.  It is now closer to 6 percent, better in  many ways, but still below historical norms. \n Assuming it stabilizes and pe rsonal incomes grows as it has so  far this recovery, you get a \nclearer sense of how consumption will contribute to the economy’s expansion but also why it is \nunlikely to play a dominant role as it did in this past decade. \nWhile businesses need to rebalance as well, they are essential to the strength of the \nrecovery.  Fortunately, they are in the early stages of doing just  that.  Profits are improving and \ncorporate balance sheets for the nonf inancial sector are strengtheni ng and are increasingly able to \nsupport investment growth as confidence in the economy rebuilds.  Also, although credit supply \nand demand may be an issue impeding the recovery  to some extent, a shortage of monetary \nstimulus is not the issue.  There is enormous liquidity in the market, and it can be accessed as \nconditions improve. \nFinally, the federal government needs to rebala nce its balance sheet as well.  Federal and \nstate budget pressures are enormous, and uncertain tax programs surely are a risk to the recovery.  \nThis adds harmful uncertainty upon both busine sses and consumers.  However, while these \nburdens are a drag on our outlook, they are not new to the U.S. and, by themselves, should not \nbring our economy down unless they go unaddressed. \nI believe the economy has the wherewithal to rec over.  However, if, in an attempt to add \nfurther fuel to the recovery, a zero interest rate is  continued, it is as likely to be a negative as a \npositive in that it brings its own unintended cons equences and uncertainty.  A zero policy rate \n\nduring a crisis is understandable, but a zero rate after a year of recovery gives legitimacy to \nquestions about the sustainability of the recovery and adds to uncertainty. \n  \nMarket motives \n \nWe were reminded of the critic al nature of our financial ma rkets when they locked up \nduring the crisis.  We need mark ets to function smoothly.  However, market participants should \nnot direct policy.  When mixed data are reported as systematically negative results, and the more \npositive, long-term growth trends fail to be adeq uately acknowledged, it is an invitation to hasty \nactions.  Of course the market wants zero rates to continue indefinitely: They are earning a \nguaranteed return on free money from the Fe d by lending it back to the government through \nsecurities purchases.   \nThe current recovery in its fi rst year saw GDP grow an average of 3.2 percent.  The GDP \ngrowth rate for the 1991 recovery was 2.61 percent; and for the 2001 recovery, it was 1.92 \npercent.  We would all like to see a stronger recovery, but slow gr owth is not a decline in growth \nand we should not react hastily.   The summer of 2010 has seemed strikingly familiar to me.  I recently went back and looked at news reports for the spring and summer of 2003, just prior to when the FOMC lowered \nthe fed funds rate to 1 percent, where it rema ined until 2004.  I’ll provide just two examples. \nIn June 2003, one prominent economist noted in USA Today:   “The Federal Reserve Board \nrecently warned that America faces a risk of [deflation].  Japan has been suffering from it for \nmore than a decade.  Europe may be heading toward it.  The entire world economy could succumb to it.  …This could be the first r ound in a deflationary cycle.  The Commerce \nDepartment reports orders to U.S. factories slip ped 2.9% in April from March, the largest decline \nin 17 months.  …With fewer jobs and stagnant wa ges, Americans won’t be able to buy enough to \nkeep the economy going.” \nAlso in June 2003, a Boston Globe  columnist noted:  “On the surface, one can make the \ncase that the Fed doesn’t have to do anything at al l. Interest rates are incredibly low….Still, the \nFed will not sit on its hands.  Chairman Alan Greenspan and his deputies have done everything \nbut advertise the coming rate cut on the Goodyear blimp.  Their mo tivation is to avoid deflation. \n  …Another rate cut, even a cut of one-half poi nt, doesn’t guarantee that there won’t be an \neconomic collapse.  But it makes that collaps e less likely—hence the no tion of rate cut as \n\ninsurance policy.  As insurance, a rate cut is pr etty cheap.  Lower rates aren’t going to trigger a \nburst of inflation, and if they give the economy an extr a boost, well, who is going \nto complain about that?” \nIn the third quarter of 2003, immediately foll owing these and many similar articles, GDP \nexpanded at what turned out to be nearly a 7 perc ent annual rate, yet rates were left at 1 percent \nfor several months.  With the low rates very lo w for a considerable period, credit began to \nexpand significantly and set the stage for one of the worst economic crisis since the great \ndepression.  In my view, it was a very expensiv e insurance premium.  Unemployment today is \n9.5 percent.  I fully acknowledge that I was on the FOMC at that time.  That’s why I believe that \nzero rates during a period  of modest growth are a dangerous gamble. \nThe Great Depression of the 1930s was a traumatic event.  We need to be aware of its \nlessons.  We need to avoid its mistakes.  For example, the Fed should never again double reserve \nrequirements overnight.  However, I urge us not to forget other more-recent lessons from the \ngreat inflation and the financial crisis of 2008: R eal interest rates that are negative 40 percent of \nthe time create severe consequences.   \nOne final note about deflation: The consumer price index was a mere 18 in 1945 but was \n172 at the start of this century.  Today, despite our most recent crisis, the CPI is over 219.  Not \nonce during more than half a cen tury has the index sy stematically declined.  I find no evidence \nthat deflation is the most serious threat to the recovery today.  \nConclusion \n \nI agree that the Federal Reserve needs to keep  its policy rate accommodative.  For a while \nlonger, it should remain even below the long-run equilibrium rate.  However, the economy is \nimproving and is growing at a rate faster than the last two recoveries.  Importantly, the recent \nfinancial crisis and recession was not caused by high interest rates but by low rates that \ncontributed to excessive debt and leverage among consumers, businesses and government.  We \nneed to get off of the emergency rate of zero, move rates up slowly and deliberately.  This will \nalign more closely with the economy’s slow, deliberate recovery so that policy does not lag the recovery.   \nMonetary policy is a useful tool, but it cannot solve every problem faced by the United \nStates today.  In trying to use policy as a cure -all, we will repeat the cycle of severe recession \n\nand unemployment in a few short years by keeping rates too low for too long.  I wish free money \nwas really free and that there was a painless way to move from severe recession and high \nleverage to robust and sustainable econo mic growth, but there is no short cut.",

        "content": " \n \nAre Community Banks Important? \n \n    \nThomas M. Hoenig \nPresident \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n \n \n \n        \n \n   \nAmerican Bankers Association Government Relations Summit \nWashington, D.C. \nMarch 18, 2010 \n \n \n \n \n\nAs a Federal Reserve Bank president, I am  occasionally asked outrageous questions \nregarding central banking and commercial banks.  “Is the Federal Reserve owned by a European \nbanking cabal?”  “How much owne rship of the Federal Reserve do the Rockefellers hold?”  But \nover the past few days, the questions  have become truly outrageous:  \n“Will the regional and community bank model survive in the future?”  Are community \nbanks important? \n“Shouldn’t the Federal Reserve supervise only the very largest bank s and not community \nbanks?” \nWhat’s more, it is particularly bothersome to me that these last two questions are most \noften asked by individuals who ha ve not been in or know what a community bank does. So let \nme answer the question.  \nWhether you are here today representing JP  Morgan or the First State Bank of \nHometown, Kansas, the answer is  the same.  When you cut thr ough the fog, there is no question \nas to the need for and the importance of commun ity banks in our nation’s  financial system. The \nmaps on the screen behind me show that banks w ith less than $10 billi on in total assets hold \nsubstantial market share in much of the United States and hold the majority of deposits in 16 \nstates. Bank subsidiaries of bank holding companie s with less than $50 billion hold the majority \nof deposits in 26 states.   \nAs you can see from these maps, regional and community banks serve local markets, and \nin turn, support local economic  growth. These banks rely on knowing their customer, and \nmanaging those relationships to work with bo rrowers through good times and bad. Regional and \ncommunity banks are also typically locally ow ned and managed, which means they have an \nimmediate and vested interest in th e success of their local communities.  \nYes, regional and community banks also are under pressure from this crisis, and it will be \na struggle for them to regain their footing; but, certainly no more so than that for our largest institutions that received significant government support. Commercial real estate will be a drag \non earnings for some quarters yet, and there w ill be bank failures.  But this segment of the \nindustry will recover and its model, with its focus on relationship banking, will prosper as the \neconomy recovers and expands.   \nInterestingly, looking at prelimin ary data, I suspect future analys is of this crisis will find \nthat regional and community banks during the cr isis actually may have done a better job of \n\nserving their local markets and maintaining lendi ng standards. While this group of banks has a \nhigher concentration of commercial real estate to capital, there is evidence that they are working \neffectively, and in some inst ances, more cooperatively than  the largest ba nks with their \nborrowers to work out or reduce losses, base d on their knowledge a nd active monitoring of \ncustomers.  \nSome of our largest banks would be well-served to take a lesson. \nIt is also no coincidence that with breakdow ns in other parts of the marketplace, a \nsubstantial portion of regional an d community banks have increase d their loans to businesses. \nDuring 2009, 45 percent of the banks  with under $1 bi llion in assets increased their business \nlending. \nAnd while it may make some of the largest banks uncomfortable to hear this, regional \nand community banks have managed all this while  operating at a competitive disadvantage.  For \nit is the largest financial firms that have an implicit, recently made explicit, guarantee that taxpayer dollars will be used to pr otect them from failure, regardless  of what risks they assume.  \nIt is only now that we are discussing legislation to address the issue of a special class of the \nlargest firms that we have deemed too-big-to-fail.  This is the one item that must be addressed if \nwe are to have any real competitive equity among all financial institutions.  What is proposed \nmay need to be strengthened, but it is a start.  \nLet me end my remarks by quickly commen ting on the Federal Reserve’s role as a \nsupervisor of regional and community banks, some thing that will soon come under debate in the \nSenate and perhaps again in the House. The strong opposition to removing the Federal Reserve \nfrom regional and community bank supervision, voiced by myself and ot hers from the Federal \nReserve, is not driven by the idea of simply pr otecting our “turf” or saving Federal Reserve jobs. \nThe record very clearly shows that the Fe deral Reserve System has made important \nchanges to its operations when such moves bene fit the country as a whole regardless of the \nimpact on the Federal Reserve. Most notably , the Federal Reserve was among the strongest \nsupporters of Check 21 legislati on, while realizing it would mean the eventual loss of thousands \nof Federal Reserve check processing jobs. The legislation improved the efficiency of our \npayments system, and while it was painful for me  personally to see the elimination of hundreds \nof jobs in my District, it was a step we  had to take to best serve the nation. \n\nIn this case, however, serving the best intere st of the nation does not mean reducing the \nFederal Reserve’s supervisory role. \nGiven the importance of 6,800 re gional and community banks lo cated in almost as many \ncommunities across this country, it  is inconceivable to me that  the Central Bank of the United \nStates would not have a role in  their oversight, through the supe rvision of state member banks \nand bank holding companies.   \nThe Federal Reserve System was designed by its  founders with the go als of it supervising \na broad cross section of U.S. banks, assuring eq uitable access to the Federal Reserve liquidity \nfacilities regardless of institutional size or lo cation, and contributing to  the stability of the \nfinancial system – not only on Wall Street but on America’s Main Street.  It does this job well.  \nIn the crisis of the ’80s, which affected bot h large and small banks, banks supervised by the \nFederal Reserve proportionately imposed the leas t losses on the FDIC when they failed relative \nto banks supervised by other Federal agencies.   \nIn addition, the Federal Reserve’s role in supervision of banks and bank holding \ncompanies provides it critical information on lo cal economies in places such as Muskogee, \nOkla.; Santa Fe, N.M. and Scotts bluff, Neb.  And to answer th e question: yes, our role in \nregional and community bank supe rvision supports our responsib ilities as members of the \nFederal Open Market Committee, by expandi ng our understanding of local and regional \neconomies.   \nStripping the Federal Reserve of its resp onsibility for supervising regional and \ncommunity banks and bank holding companies should be unacceptable to anyone who cares \nabout equity in the nation’s banking system, la rgest to smallest bank, and the nation’s regional \nand local economies. Confining the Federal Reserv e’s supervisory role to  only the largest firms \nwill, I fear, inadvertently make the Federal Reserve the Central Bank to the largest firms while disenfranchising the other 6800 bank s.  The map tells the story.  \nWhen Congress created the Federal Reserve nearly a century ago, it gave us a \ndecentralized system that spanned the continent. The explicit purpose for this structure was to better balance the interest of Main Street ag ainst those of Wall Street.  Recent experience \nconfirms that this structure is as important today as then, perhaps more so. Community banks are important to the banking system and to the econo my, and therefore continue to be important to \nthe Federal Reserve. I have said be fore but it deserves repeating: It would be a tr agic irony if the \n\noutcome of this crisis is a gain in power for the largest firms at the expense of the other 6,800 \nregional and community banks. If so, it would be a win for Wall Street.  \n\nGeographic  Market Share of Banks in the U.S. \n \n \nGeographic  market share of banks over $10 billion \n \nSource:  FDIC Summary  of Deposits (June 2009) \n  \n \n  \nGeographic  market share of bank subsidiaries  of BHCs over $50 billion \n \nSource:  FDIC Summary  of Deposits (June 2009) \n• 69% of total deposits are held at \nbanks with greater than $10 \nbillion in total assets. \n \n• Banks with less than $10 billion in \ntotal assets make up the majority \nof deposits in 16 states. \n• 60% of total deposits are held \nat bank subsidiaries  of BHCs \nwith greater than $50 billion \nin total assets. \n \n• These BHCs own the majority \nof deposits in 24 states. \n \n• Total assets of the largest \nBHCs constitute  83% of all \nBHC assets in the U.S.; \nhowever,  represent  less than \n1% of the total population  of \nBHCs. ",

        "content": "Comments on the Volcker Rule  Activity Restrictions \n \nThomas M. Hoenig \nPresident \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \nMarch 2, 2010 \n \n \n On January 21, 2010, President Obama announced the “Volcker Rule,” as an additional \nreform to his financial reform plan.\n1  Under the Volcker rule, bank holding companies and \nfinancial services holding companies would “no longer be allowed to ow n, invest, or sponsor \nhedge funds, private equity funds, or proprieta ry trading operations for their own profit, \nunrelated to serving their customers.”  The Pres ident indicated the rule is designed to prevent \ncostly risks that could destab ilize the banking system, preclude unfair advantages, and prevent \nconflicts of interest.  This document discusses th e rationale for the Volcker rule and suggests its \neffectiveness could be strengthened by supplemen ting it with traditional, simple, and proven \nregulatory rules, such as higher capital requ irements and concentration limits on nonbanking \nactivities. \n \nHow Volcker rule activities affect banks  \n \nThe Volcker rule is based on the idea that banks have a special role in the financial \nsystem.  They are integral to providing credit and operating the payment system.  As a result, the \nfailure of banking institutions ca n destabilize the financial syst em and damage the economy.  \nThis special role provides the justification for regulating bank and bank-related activities. \n \nSome supporters of the Volcker rule have mistakenly claimed th at restricting these \nactivities is necessary because th ey cause bank losses directly or that banks use insured deposits \nto fund proprietary tradi ng activities.  However, these claims  fail to distinguish between banks \nand holding companies that own banks.  Specifi cally, Volcker rule activities can only be \nundertaken in holding company subsidiaries, a nd the Federal Reserve’s Regulation W places \nbarriers between banking and holding compa ny activities that woul d preclude, among other \nactivities, using deposits to fund Volcker rule activities. \n Although the Volcker rule activities do not affect banks dire ctly, there are at least three \nchannels through which losses due to these activ ities might affect a holding company’s bank \nindirectly.  The channels exist because large holding companies manage activities along business \nlines that traverse legal entities.\n2  The 3 channels are: \n \n                                                             \n1 The transcript is available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/th e-press-office/remarks-president-financial-reform .  In \nthe same presentation, President Obama also proposed caps  on the percentage of financial institution liabilities that \ncould be held by any one firm to limit further consolidation in the financial system. \n2 For example, the investment banking business line at JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America all do \nunderwriting, market making in securities and derivatives, and lending. \n\n2 \n  Reputation effects – if a holding company's tr ading subsidiary fails, creditors may lose \nconfidence in the holding company’s bank.  As  a result, creditors could withdraw their \nfunding from the bank. \n Withdrawal of customers that prefer a variet y of services – holding companies are run along \nbusiness lines (as opposed to legal entity lines) to  more easily market to large customers that \nneed a range of services.  Failure of a holding company subsidiary may allow a large customer to be wooed away by a company that o ffers a full line of services.  In such a case, \nthe large customer may wit hdraw business and funding from  the banking subsidiary.  \n Funding from subsidiaries – A holding comp any’s nonbank subsidiaries will deposit their \nfunds and customers’ idle balances in the ba nk.  The failure of the nonbank subsidiary could \ncause a sudden withdrawal of a significant amoun t of funding.  Due to reputation effects, the \nsubsidiary’s failure may make it difficult for the bank to raise replacement funding.  \n \nRisk, conflicts of interest, a nd expansion of the safety net  \n \nAs noted above, banks play a special role in  the economy because they provide financial \nintermediation services and are the critical compone nt of the payments system.  As the financial \nsystem has evolved, banking services also have  evolved beyond the trad itional services of \nlending and deposit taking to other financial intermediation and client service activities.  These \ninclude such services as brokerage and market  making, underwriting new issues of stocks and \nbonds, merger acquisition and advice, and invest ment advice.  However, many large banking \ncompanies have gone beyond intermediation services  to proprietary invest ment activities, which \nare the activities prohibited by the Volcker rule .  These investment activities use the firm’s \ncapital to take greater financial risks that are expected to earn more at tractive returns.  With \nclient service activities, transa ctions are undertaken for the firm ’s clients, while with Volcker \nrule activities, transact ions are undertaken directly for the firm itself. \n \nThe proprietary investment activ ities not only tend to be risk ier than client intermediation \nservices, but when conducted with client activities in a single firm, they can cause conflicts of \ninterest.  For example, a firm that does client trading and proprietary tr ading has incentives to \n“front run” client trades.  In addition, the financial system safety  net (deposit insurance, discount \nwindow lending, etc.) has traditionally been provid ed for activities in th e intermediation/client \nservices category.  Allowing a sing le firm to engage in both cate gories of activities extends the \nsafety net’s coverage.  An important rationale fo r the Volcker rule is to prevent or reduce the \npotential for conflicts of interest and expansion of the safety net. \n \nA modified Volcker rule proposal  \nThe Volcker rule has many advantages.  It  prohibits holding companies from conducting \nrisky activities that can lead to losses for subs idiary banks, create conflicts of interest, and \nexpand coverage of the safety net.  In addition, it reflects, in part, con cerns that deregulatory \nefforts may have gone too far, allowing too much discretion and e rring on the side of \npermissiveness.  While the activities targeted by th e Volcker rule were not a direct cause of the \nfinancial crisis, they contributed to the overall ri sk level in the financial system.  Now that we \nhave seen how destructive a financial crisis can be , many people are ready to be more restrictive.  \nThe Volcker rule can help ensure that the restrict ed activities are not the trigger that sets off the \nnext financial crisis. \n\n3 \n  \nThe Volcker rule should be strengthened, however, by supplementing it with traditional, \nsimple, and proven regulatory rules, such as hi gher capital requirements and concentration limits, \nor additional supervision for nonbank holding compa ny activities.  Some critics have claimed \nthat prohibiting proprietary trading would not be effective because it is difficult to distinguish \nfrom other trading and hedging activities.  Thes e critics argue that holding companies would \nsimply continue to conduct these activities am ong other business lines, such as market making or \nprime brokerage, where the activity (and potentially the risks) are not as easy to identify and \nmanage.  Requiring these other act ivities to be conducted in sepa rately capitalized subsidiaries \nsubject to strict capital and concentration limits  would strengthen the Volcker rule by offsetting \nsuch attempts to “hide” proprietary trading.   \n Providing regulators the authority to im pose capital requirements and activity \nconcentration limits on nonbanking s ubsidiaries would also reduce the amount of activities that \nneed to be prohibited.  Specificall y, private equity investments do not  create conflicts of interest \nand may not be significantly riskier than some ac tivities that banks are allowed to conduct, such \nas leveraged lending.  In addition, given that private equity firms are allowed to purchase banks, \nit seems inconsistent to prevent bank hol ding companies from making private equity \ninvestments.  Strict capital requirements and c oncentration limits on priv ate equity investments, \ntherefore, may be sufficient to  protect the financial system. \n \nConclusion\n \n \nConducting activities such as hedge fund sponsorship and in vestment and proprietary \ntrading in a bank holding company can create problems for affiliated banks and the financial system.  The activities have a risk profile that  can lead to losses in affiliated banks, create \nconflicts of interests among various holding compa ny business lines, and lead to an expansion of \nthe safety net.  The Volcker rule is a reas onable approach for cont rolling problems created by \nthese activities, and it can be strengthened by allowing regulators to im pose capital requirements \nand concentration limits on the nonbanking subsidiaries of holding companies.",
