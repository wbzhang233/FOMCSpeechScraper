It is my pleasure  to welcome you to the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas \nCity and our first ever “ Workshop on the Future of Banking.”  I am  pleased to be joined today by \nbank executives from the Tenth D istrict and across the nation as well as a number of  esteemed \nacademics and industry representatives. It is my  hope that together we will have a productive \nconversation about  the key issues affecting the banking industry , whose success is vital to our \neconomy . I would also like to recognize that m any of you here today represent community \nbanks . Your  local ly focused  banks  are integral to our financial system  as service providers and  \nour society  more broadly because of  your  enduring commitment to civic engagement.  I hope to \nhear more  in our conversations today about how your  banks  strengthen local communities a s \nwell as the challenges and opportunities  you fac e.  \nOur discussion this morning will take an in- depth look at how banks are positioning \nthems elves for the future . In particular,  I am  interested in learning more about how banks will \nharness emerging  technologies to increase efficiencies and develop new product s to serve thei r \ncustomers. However, our conversation will also focus on the challenges banks  face  and the tools \nthey will require to persevere  and thrive in today’s dynamic economy . Overall, I  hope to get a \nkeen sense of the role that policymaking can play  in helping banks navigate an evolving financial \nlandscape while always ensuring a safe and sound U .S. financial system .  \nThrough today’s panel discussions, I also hope to better understand the barriers \nconfronting prospective entrants to the banking industry . New bank owners and managers can \nbring innovative ideas and promote changes that improve efficiency and  access to financial \nservices for  businesses and consumers . Such changes may be particularly impactful to banking \ncustomers in rural or otherwise underserved areas that have historically had  relatively  limited \n\n2 \n financial services  offerings . Indeed, financial services access is a particularly important topic to \nthe Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  because our district contains many rural and low -to-\nmoderate -income communities. Innovati on can also create a more efficient financial system  that \nbenefits service providers by lowering costs and increasing profitability . Despite the potential \nbenefits,  however, new charter issuance has declined substantially since the Global Financial \nCrisis.  Today’s discussion will illuminate the reasons why this decline has occur red and the \npolicy changes  that might be necessary to  enable new charter ing activity . \nOutside of new charters, entry into the banking industry can occur through the acquisition \nof existing bank charters  as well . Allowing fresh , innovative owners  to acquire existing banks  \ncan enhanc e system resiliency and increase new product offerings  in much the  same way that de \nnovo chart ering can . In fact, under certain circumstances, investors might be indifferent between \nacquiring an existing bank and setting up a new bank, as my colleague Governor Bowman has \npointed out in the past . However, in practice, there has been a clear  preference  for charter \nacquisition over de novo formation  among recent market participants . Therefore, I think it is \nreasonable for policymakers to ask , what  tradeoffs are involved when entry occurs via  \nacquisition rather than  de novo chartering ?  \nRelatedly, I am  interested in how consolidation across banks can affect  the future \nstructure of our community banking network. For the past 40 years, banks have steadily consolidated , resulting in fewer bank charters and increased institutional size and complexity.  \nWhile increased size and complexity has brought substantial challenges for both bank managers and supervisors, many argue th at the prolonged period of consolidation has resulted in a more \nefficient system that better meets  the needs of borrowers. At the same time, having fewer banks  \nmay decrease competition and  reduce access to financial services for some communities. I \n\n3 \n believe policymakers  have a n obligation to ensure financial services remain  reasonably \naccessible across a diverse range of localities  and communities . In turn, it makes sense to ask  if a \ncontinuation of the current consolidation trends will help or hinder this goal.  \nWe will also explor e questions surrounding bank competit ion today . Financial market \ncompetition has been fierce in recent years both  among traditional banks and  between  banks and \nnon-banks . In particular, nonbank competition has  increased substantially due to both greater  \ncompetition from traditional finance , such as credit unions  and the farm credit system , as well as \na rise in innovative financial startups such as fintechs. Policymakers should continually \nreevaluate whether the lens through which they view competition accurately  reflects the world in \nwhich modern banks operate .   \nOverall, the main objective of today’s workshop is to have  a conversation with an \nimportant set of stakeholders that will be  directly affected by ongoing market changes . However, \nI also understand there  are other  groups  who  have a vested interest in  the matters we will discuss . \nTo that end, I am hopeful that today’s event will be the starting  point for a larger conversation \namong all stakeholders . Ultimately, my goal  is to encourage  inform ed policy choices that lead to \na better financial system for the country  — one  that meets the needs of both modern financial \nservices  providers and the American people.  \nPersonally, I am very excited to host this event because these are issues that are near and \ndear to me. As a former community  banker myself , I ha ve ha d the opportunity to both operate \nestablished  banks  and to engage in mergers and acquisition s. So needless to say, I have sat where \nyou sit , and I have experienced  many of the challenges you face. I also have a deep passion for \nthe benefits that  community banks bring to our nation as both financial service s providers and as \npillars of our  local communities. As the lender of choice for many small businesses, community \n\n4 \n banks ensure  our local economies continue to thrive by meet ing businesses’  essential  financi al \nneeds . Community banks  have also continually demonstrated  an ability to understand the unique \nchallenges households and businesses face in their communities . It is my hope  that policymakers \ncan maximize the  benefits th at community bank s provide to our local communities while \nenhancing the ir health and resiliency.  For this reason, I look forward to hearing your views and \ndiscussing the many issues on the table today.   \nI would now like to introduce my Federal Reserve colleague, Governor Michelle \nBowman. Governor Bowman has been a member of the Federal Reserve Board since 2018. Prior \nto her Federal Reserve appointment, she served as Kansas state banking commissioner for t wo \nyears and as an executive of Farmers & Drovers Bank in Kansas. She also held staff positions in \nthe U.S. House and Senate as well as FEMA and the Department of Homeland Security. It is with great pleasure that I welcome Governor Bowman.",

        "content": "The Importance of Prices  and Price Stability  \n \nJeff Schmid  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas Cit y \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApril 12, 2024  \nThe 2024  Agricultural Commodity Futures Conference  \nOverland Park, Kansas  \n \n \nThe views expressed by the author are his own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal \nReserve System, its governors, officers or representatives.   \n\n1 \n Thank you for the opportunity to speak today at the 2 024 Agricultural Commodity \nFutures Conference  hosted by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Center for \nRisk Management Education Research a t Kansas State University.  A special thank you to our \nhosts, Joe Parcell and Emily Garwood from Kansas State , and Chuck Marv ine and Russ Behnam \nfrom the CFTC. Russ was kind enough to provide the keynote for the Kansas City Fed’s National \nAg Credit Conference last month . These types of cross -institution events are crucial for helping \nus understand key economic issues in the agricultural sector.   \nAgriculture plays an important role  in the economy, especially  in this part of the country . \nWhile locally important , the factors that influence  the ag economy  are often  global . Commodity \nmarkets  are subject to  shifting weather  patterns , swings in global growth , and geopolitical \ndevelopments . Commodity prices adjust quickly to these influences and  provide a real -time \nsignal  on the balance between  supply and demand . Commodity futures markets help \ncommunicate supply and demand conditions to a wider audience  and allow users and producers \nto hedge price risk . The CFTC plays an important role in promoting the integrity and resilience \nof these markets through effective regulation.   \nJust as  in commodity markets, price s and inflation  in the broader economy  also reflect  the \nbalance between  supply and demand . And, as we  have  witnessed in recent years,  a persistent \nimbalance  between the two  can lead to prolonged episodes  of elevated price inflation.   \nIn my remarks this afternoon, I  will offer my thoughts on the evolution of  imbalances in \nour economy and the ir implications for our progress towards low and stable inflation  as well as \nfor the appropriate path of monetary policy .  \n \nInflation and Wages  \nCongress  has provided the Federal Reserve with two monetary policy mandates : price \nstability  and maximum employment . The Fed interprets price stability to be consistent with a 2 \npercent inflation objective as measured by the annual change in the  personal consumption \nexpenditures (PCE) price index . This measure  aims to capture price movements  across the vast \narray of  goods and services purchased by consumers.  \nDuring the post -pandemic economic recovery, inflation surged  above 7 percent,  a 40-year \nhigh, as robust demand ran up against supply bottlenecks and constraints on production . \nAlthough inflation has stepped down significantly  since the F ed began raising interest rates in \n\n2 \n 2022, it remains above the 2 percent  definition of price stability . Inflation has surprised to the \nupside since the beginning of the year  and has run  at roughly a 4 percent annual rate  during the \nfirst quarter . This recent data underscores what I believe is the need for the Federal Reserve to be \npatient as we wait  for clear and convincing evidence that inflation is on track to sustainably \nreturn to 2 percent .  \nLooking ahead , I will be watching three factors to monitor progress towards our inflation \ngoal:  \n• First, the tightness of the labor market and consequent upward pressure on labor -\nintensive service prices . \n• Second,  the potential for an increased supply of labor to relieve labor market \ntightness .  \n• And t hird, the risk that renewed supply chain challenges could provide an unwelcome \nboost to inflation .       \n \nElaborating further  on the first factor : Elevated services price inflation is now the primary \ndriver of  overall  inflation in the economy.1  For example, higher prices for healthcare services \ncontributed significantly to the rebound in inflation  since the beginning of the year . The \nproduction of many services tends to be labor intensive . As a result , strong services prices are \nbeing supported by the tightness of the  labor market and the ongoing imbalance between the  \neconomy’s  demand for workers and the available  supply of labor .    \nAnd t he demand for labor continues to be strong . This is  evidenced by robust hiring and \nelevated wage growth . So far this year , firms added an average of 2 70,000 jobs per month to \ntheir payrolls , far above the historical norm . Postings for new positions  also remain elevated, \nwhile initial claims for unemployment insurance have remain ed low for some time now .  \nIndirectly, the ongoing tightness in the labor market has also pushed up the cost of \nhousing , an important contributor to the current strength of overall inflation . New work \narrangements and changing preferences increased the demand for living space during and after \nthe pandemic, leading to  a rapid increase in house prices and rents . After peaking near 9 percent  \nin 2022, rent inflation moderated significantly last year . However, the contribution of rents to \n \n1 See Supercore PCE Inflation Surged in January to Its Highest Monthly Level in More than Two Years , by  \nJordan Rappaport, A. Lee Smith, and Shu -Kuei X. Yang .  \n\n3 \n overall inflation remains well above its the pre-pandemic rate . Research by staff at the Kansas \nCity Fed suggests that the ongoing tightness in the labor market could keep rent inflation \nelevated for some time.2 Job gains and wage increases put upward pressure on rents and housing \nprices as income growth increases household demand for additional and higher -quality living \nspaces . \nA second factor I will be watching  is the outlook for the supply of labor . Last year, the \neconomy experienced  a large increase in the workforce , especially among women  aged 25 -55. In \naddition, the economy experienced a post -pandemic rebound in immigration  over the  last year. \nThis improvement in the economy’s ability to supply labor helped to ease tightness in the labor \nmarket .  \nDespite  these improvements in the supply of labor, wage growth  continues to signal an \nimbalance between  labor  demand and the number of available workers to meet that demand . \nWhile wage growth has moderated from its recent peak, it remains elevated compared to early \nperiods and likely is continuing to put upward pressure on services prices .  \nLooking beyond wages, t he Kansas City Fed’s Labor Market Conditions Indicators \n(LMCI) provide another  way to measure th e ongoing tightness in the labor market . These \nindicators, which are published monthly  on the Kansas City Fed’s website, summarize  many  \ndifferent labor market variables into measures of activity and momentum .3 According to the  most \nrecent  LMCI,  activity in the labor market remains well above its longer -run average level , \nsuggesting that the labor market remains tight  relative to its historical norm . \nA third thing I will be keeping an eye on is a  potential reacceleration in goods inflation . \nAs robust demand for goods ran up against supply bottlenecks during the post -pandemic  \nrecovery, prices for many goods rose rapidly and contributed significantly to the overall increase \nin inflation . While prices for goods have been roughly flat over the past year, recent disruptions \nto global shipping  imply some upside risk to goods prices going forward . Relatedly,  energy \nprices are also up significantly since the beginning of the year , which pose s an additional \nheadwind to sustainably low and stable inflation .             \n \n \n2 See A Tight Labor Market Could Keep Rent Inflation Elevated , by Brent Bundick, A. Lee Smith, and Luca Van der \nMeer .  \n3 See https://www.kansascityfed.org/data -and-trends/labor -market-conditions -indicators/ . \n\n4 \n Ultimately, achieving better balance in the labor market will likely be necessary for \nFederal Reserve policymakers to deliver on our price stability mandate and achieve 2 percent \ninflation . However, uncertainty  remains as to the role that improvements in  labor supply will \nplay versus slower labor demand in rebalanc ing labor markets . While I welcome the  significant \ngrowth  witnessed  in the economy’s  workforce last year , it remains unclear  whether this rapid \npace of supply improvement will continue going forward .  \n \nThe Outlook for Monetary Policy  \nWith inflation  still running above 2 percent and labor markets still tight, it is appropriate \nthat monetary policy remain restrictive . Over the past two years , the FOMC has raised  the \nfederal funds rate by over 500 basis points and has started to unwind the  large portfolio of  \nsecurity holdings it amassed on its  balance sheet . All of this is  an effort to help rebalance demand \nand supply in the economy and restore price stability .  \nEven with these actions , the demand for goods and services has displayed remarkable \nresilience to higher interest rates . The economy continues to grow  at a pace well above its \nlonger -run trend . Much of this  increase in overall growth has been driven by strong consumer \nspending . With increasing house prices and equity market s near all -time highs , the strength of \nhousehold balance sheets appears to be  encouraging households to spend rather than save despite \nthe high interest rates . Accordingly, the household savings rate remains near historic lows .  \nSimilarly, in the agricultural sector, although farm incomes are expected to be down this \nyear, they remain above their pre -pandemic levels . While higher interest expenses and reduced \nincomes may be weighing on some highly leveraged producers, the overall financial picture in \nagriculture remain s strong. Most lenders report that the credit qual ity of their farm portfolio has \nbeen strong, loan delinquencies are still historically low, and profits of recent years continue to \nsupport strong balance sheets. In addition, despite the increase in interest rates over the past  two \nyears, farmland value s remain  firm alongside relatively strong global demand for agricultural \nproducts. The strength of global demand for agricultural products is a topic we will explore \nfurther in a n event next month in Omaha , where we will look forward to connecting with a \nvariety of businesses tied to agriculture to hear their thoughts on longer -term factors shaping \ncommodity markets.  \n \n\n5 \n This ongoing resilience in the economy c reates  some uncertainty about the path of  the \nfederal  funds rate that will be needed to restore price stability . With inflation running above \ntarget, economic growth continuing to show momentum , and elevated prices across a range of  \nasset markets , the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate . Therefore, r ather than \npreemptively adjust the policy rate , I would prefer  to be patient and wait for  clear and  convincing \nevidence that  inflation is on track  to hit our 2 percent  target before adjusting the stance of policy .  \n \nThe Outlook for the Fed eral Reserve’s  Balance Sheet  \nNow, I’d like to turn to another one of the Fed’s policy tools: its balance sheet. While  the \nlevel of the federal funds rate  has held  steady  since  July of last year, the Fed has continued to \nshrink the size of its balance sheet . As I see it, reducing  the Fed’s  balance sheet is important for \ntwo reasons. First, balance sheet reduction  helps reduce  the overall degree of policy \naccommodation  at time  when policy should remain restrictive . And second, moving towards a \nsmaller balance sheet is important to lessen the Fed’s footprint in financial markets.  \nFor some context, the balance sheet grew significantly as the Fed responded forcefully to \nthe COVID -19 pandemic. To help stabilize the economy , the Federal Reserve purchased large \nquantities of Treasuries and agency mortgage -backed securities . These purchases were carried \nout to reduce long -term interest rates  and ensure financial markets continue d to function  amid \nlockdowns and historic uncertainty . Consequently , the Fed’s balance sheet more than doubled  \nfrom just under $ 4.5 trillion in 20 19 to nearly $9 t rillion in 2022 . To fund these purchases, the \nFederal Reserve  expanded the quantity of reserves in the banking system .      \nSince June of 2022, the FOMC has reduced its holdings  by more  than $1.5 trillion . \nHowever,  the balance sheet remains large and continues to put downward pressure on long -term \ninterest rates . With inflation running above target, a tight labor market, and historically high \nequity valuations, the economy and financial markets no longer require support from a  large \ncentral bank balance sheet . Rather, given the state of the economy, m y preference is for a much \nsmaller balance sheet with a shorter average maturity .  \nThe Fed’s large  balance sheet and footprint can also obscure price signals  and distort \nfinancial markets . Our holdings put downward pressure on longer -term rates and flatten the yield \ncurve . This stresses  the traditional model of borrowing and lending  central to the health of  many \ncommunity banks . In addition, the Federal Reserve continues to hold a large fraction of the total \n\n6 \n outstanding stock of agency mortgage -backed securities . These significant holdings could distort \nthe allocation of credit  and lead to future imbalances . As the Committee discussed in its \nPrinciples for Reducing the Size of the Balance sheet ,4 I believe our balance sheet should \nprimarily be composed of Treasury securities to minimize the effect of the Fed’s holdings on the \nprice and allocation of credit in the economy.  \nThe Fed’s large balance sheet is also suppressing  price signals  in funding markets.  \nFluctuations in interbank lending rates  provide timely signals to market participants about \nliquidity conditions in funding markets . For some time  now, the federal funds rate has traded \nconsistently 7 basis points below the interest rate on reserve balances and shown no sensitivity to \nfluctuations in reserves . This suggests  that liquidity remains abundant . These price signals imply \nthat our current pace of balance sheet reduction is not creating strains in funding markets .  \nHowever, unlike our previous balance sheet normalization in  2019, the Federal Reserve \nhas established the Standing Repo Facility , and banks have shown a greater willingness to use \nthe discount window . If runoff began to unexpectedly stress funding markets and the spreads in \nthe interbank market rose significantly, these liquidity tools would be available to prevent a \nsignificant  increase in short -term market interest rates . As we learn about broader liquidity \ndemand in the system through these price signals, I believe it will be important to tolerate some \nmore normal volatility in interest rates .  \nTolerating some interest rate volatility during runoff could improve the longer -term \nhealth of funding markets , which may all ow the financial system to operate with fewer reserves . \nWith a constantly evolving financial system, the appropriate amount of reserves needed to \nefficiently conduct monetary policy will not be defined by a fixed quantity but rather the ability \nof the financial system to redistribute that liquidity as needed .  \nConsistent with the theme of my remarks today , price signals from markets will be \nnecessary to help properly allocate this liquidity . Stopping balance sheet runoff too early poses  a \nrisk of further weakening the channels of liquidity redistribution . Along these lines, completely \nsmothering  rate volatility could make the interbank market less resilient and sow the seeds of \nfuture financial market instability.      \n \n \n \n4 See https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20220126c.htm  \n\n7 \n Conducting Policy Under Uncertainty  \nWith various unknowns surrounding the macroeconomic outlook, knowing the exact \nfuture course of monetary policy is always difficult . Jim Collins , the author , has been influential \nin my thinking as a leader  throughout my career . In his book, Great By Choice , he says that, \n“None of us can predict with certainty the twists and turns our lives will take.” In a rapidly \nevolving economic and financial landscape  only four years after the outbreak  of a global \npandemic , this statement resonates with me .  \nAs a policymaker though, I am certain that my colleagues and I on the FOMC will take \nnecessary actions to restore price stability and achieve maximum employment . For now, I view \nthe current stance of monetary policy as appropriate to achieve those objectives . Going forward, \nI’ll be watching for further  signs of progress in returning inflation sustainably back to our 2 \npercent target .",

It is an honor  to participate in the Kansas Bankers Association \nannual meeting . You have quite a lineup  of speakers , and I am pleased to be part of such an \nesteemed group.  \nToday, I will speak to some issues of importance to the industry before turning to a \ndiscussion of the outlook for the economy and monetary policy.  \n \nBanking and the 10th District  \nIt is exciting  to see you once again . We were fortunate  to host many of you  in April at the \nKansas City Fed for a Workshop on the Future of Banking , which was also attended by Gov. \nBowman . That event was a recognition  of the importance of banking to the nation’s economy, \nbut even more so  a recognition of  the importance of banks to the Tenth District.  I will say here \nthat the banking industry as a whole in the Tenth District, and specifically in Kansas, is in sound \ncondition as a result of your leadership.   \nOur District is home to a large number of banks,  most of which are small community \nbanks.  An understanding of and connection with community banks has long been part of the \nKansas City Fed’s DNA.  As a former community banker myself, I will continue this tradition.   \nLocally focused banks, with their unique understanding of the challenges and \nopportunities of their communities , play a key financial and civic role across the country, and \nparticularly in the rural geographies that make up much of the Tenth  District.  In serving the \npublic, the Fed has an interest in the health of community banks.  This includes understanding  the \nunique issues facing community banks and work ing to prevent such banks from being \ndisadvantaged relative to other financial institutions.    \nFor this reason, it is important that bank regulators and supervisors take a tailored \napproach to manage the unique risks posed by different institutions. Effective supervision and \nregulation should ensure that the hundreds of regional and community banks in the Tenth District \nare safe and sound. But supervisory and regulatory frameworks should also acknowledge that a \none-size-fits-all approach can come with significant compliance costs and threaten the ability of \ncommunity banks to supply credit and deposi t services to rural households, agricultural \nproducers, and small businesses.  \nIt is also important that regulation not disadvantage smaller banks.  Small banks already \nmaintain, on average, higher capital ratios than larger , more systemic banks.  However, large \n\n2 \n banks continue to enjoy implicit funding subsidies that convey an unfair competitive advantage. \nIt is important that we continue efforts to level the playing field  to enable effective competition \nbetween small banks and larger more systemic institutions . Overall, adequate capital is at the \nheart of the resilience of the banking system.  Since the 2008 financial crisis, the system has \nbecome much better capitalized.  However, given the importance of capital , we should always \nwork to make sure that capital is c ommensurate to the risk, especially for larger systemic \norganizations.   \nThe Fed should also be aware of the challenges that smaller institutions face, especially \nin the context of rapid technological change , which has implications for cost and accessibility . \nOne important development here is the launch of FedNow, the Federal Reserve’s new 24/7/365 \npayment rail.  FedNow is the Fed’s first major new payment rail in over 40 years and aims to \nbring instant payments technology to all financial institutions, no matter their size or location.  \nOur continued commitment to discount window lending modernization is also helpful in \nreducing risks related to bank funding. I applaud the progress we have made to improve banks’ \noperational readiness regarding  discount window access. But I also agree with Dallas Fed \nPresident Lorie Logan’s recent remarks that technological advancements and policy changes can \nfurther assist us in achieving our goal of making the discount window an effective liquidity risk \nmanagement tool.  Bankers also have a role to play and should prioritize their discount window \nreadiness.  A diversified funding stack is essential , and the discount window has a role to play.    \n \nEconomic Outlook and Monetary Policy  \nI would like to turn now to an update on the  current state of the economy  and the outlook \nfor monetary policy.  Next year will be my first rotation as a voting member on the Federal Open \nMarket Committee (FOMC) , which has  responsibility for setting the Fed’s policy interest rate  \ntarget . With that responsibility comes a need for transparency.  It is important that I explain how I \nview the economy and how that view informs my take on appropriate policy.   \nOf course, my view of the economy is important ly shaped by my connection s and \nconversation s with individuals in the 10th District.  The structure of the Fed, with 12 independent \nregional banks, was designed to collect views and information from across the country . This \ndesign, which has worked well for over 100 years, makes sure that the whole country has a voice \n\n3 \n in monetary policy . The vote on the FOMC is my responsibility, but it is n ot a decision I take in \nisolation . \nIt is helpful to  review where we are now before turning to a more uncertain view of \nwhere we might be going.  Following recent sharp movements in financial markets , it is \nimportant to stress that all discussions of  monetary  policy must be rooted in Congress’s \ninstruction that the Fed pursue a dual mandate of price stability and full employment.  Of course, \nfinancial conditions can both reveal important information on the trajectory of the economy and \ncan also spillover to impact  the real economy.  However, t he Fed has to remain focused on  \nachiev ing its dual  mandate , and i n recent years we have had our work cut out for us.  \nPrice stability is defined as an inflation rate of 2 percent . Inflation at this pace is thought \nto be modest enough not to affect people’s day -to-day decision making . The target is not zero so \nthat the economy has some flexibility for relative prices to adjust over time.  Since 2021 , the Fed \nhas been missing on this part of its mandate , with inflation peaking at a 40 -year high in the \nmiddle of 2022 . Accordingly , the Fed reacted, and quite strongly, increasing the policy interest \nrate 525 basis points over a short period of time  and holding it there for the past year.  \nThe inflation that we have seen over the past few years was caused by an imbalance in \nthe economy, with demand for goods and services outpacing the economy’s ability to supply \nthose goods and services.  In a market economy, when demand exceeds supply, prices go up.    \nBy tightening monetary policy, the Fed’s goal has been to slow the pace of demand \ngrowth to allow supply to catch up, closing the imbalance in the economy and relieving price \npressure.   Demand has eased  and supply has increased, in part as pandemic -related disruptions to \nproduction cleared up.  And inflation has come down, falling from over 7 percent  at its peak to \n2½ percent  by the middle of this year , much closer to our 2 percent objective .  We are close , but \nwe are still not quite there.   \nThe most recent monthly price numbers have also been encouraging, with inflation \neasing across a wide cross section  of goods and services.  Given this data, I am more  confident \nthat inflation is on a path  to return to our target.  But the price data can be volatile, and it is \nstandard practice to look at inflation over longer periods of time to smooth through the monthly \nups and downs.  Given the multi -decade shock to inflation that we have experienced, we should \nbe looking for the worst in the data rather than the best.  However, if inflation continues to come \n\n4 \n in low, my confidence will grow that we are on track to meet the price stability part of our \nmandate, and it will be appropriate to adjust the stance of policy .  \nThe outlook only gets more uncertain from there . My view, as outlined earlier this year  in \nremarks at the Kansas City Fed’s Agricultural Symposium in Omaha ,1 is that while the current \nstance of policy is restrictive, it is not that restrictive.  \nThis view is based in part on the resilience of the economy and growth over the past two \nyears  even as interest rates climbed sharply higher.  Of course, last week’s employment report for \nJuly led many to question this resilience.  But it is important to note that many other indicators \npoint to continued strength.  Real GDP increased over 3 percent last year, faster than any year but \none in the decade prior to the pandemic, notwithstanding the low interest rates of that era.  More \nrecently, real GDP increased a  further 2¾ percent in the second quarter , supported by the \ncontinued strength of consumer demand and solid investment spending , and while it is \nadmittedly early , indicators for the third quarter show these trends continuing . Even more \nimportant, as I t alk to contacts in the region, I continue to hear a general tone of optimism and \nresilience . \nReturning to last week’s labor market data  for July . The rise in the unemployment rate to \n4.3 percent has certainly refocused attention on the employment side of the Fed’s mandate.  \nAcross many indicators, there has been a  noticeable cooling of the labor market from the \nhistorically tight  conditions  of 2023 and 2022 . But overall , the labor market still appears healthy .  \nAt the Kansas City Fed , we combine information from 26 labor market indicators into \nwhat we call the KC Labor Market Conditions Indicator (or LMCI) .2 Looking much broader than \nthe unemployment rate alone, the labor market still appears to be quite strong by this measure.  \nThis aligns with my discussions with district contacts, which generally acknowledge a cooling of \nthe market but not a sense of widespread disruptions or declines.  At this point, the cooling of the \nlabor market can be viewed as  a necessary condition for the easing of inflation that we have \nexperienced.  Imbalances in the labor market were a key factor keeping inflation high , and a \nlooser market was needed to bring inflation down . However, this story could change if \nconditions were to weaken considerably more . \n \n1 See https://www.kansascityfed.org/Speeches/documents/10168/2024 -Schmid-Omaha-05-14.pdf.  \n2 See https://www.kansascityfed.org/data -and-trends/labor -market-conditions -indicators/ .  \n\n5 \n The path of policy will be determined by the data and the strength of the economy.  With \nthe tremendous shocks that the economy has endured so far this decade, I would not want to \nassume any particular path or endpoint for the policy rate.  This is to say the data and the \nperformance of the  economy should guide  policy rather than a presumption that we must return \nto some pre -pandemic perception of normal.  I will be carefully watching the data and gathering \ninformation on growth, jobs, and inflation as I judge the appropriate path for policy . Thank you.",

        "content": "The Outlook for the Economy and Monetary Policy  \nRem arks by  \nJeff Schmid  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMay 14, 2024  \nAgricultural Summit hosted by  \nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \nOmaha, Nebraska  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are his own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers or representatives.  \n \n\n1 \n Welcome to the Kansas City Fed’s Agricultural Economic Summit.  Omaha Branch \nExecutive and Senior Vice President Nate Kauffman has organized an impressive gathering , and \nI thank each of you for being here . As leaders in your field, I recognize  the value of your time , \nand I appreciate your commitment in attending this event.  Likewise, my Fed colleagues and I are \ncommitted  to listening and learning  from the discussion today and tomorrow . Events like these \nplay a critical role in the Fed’s mission.  By engaging with a wide cross section  of industry and \nsociety , the Fed receives necessary information and input to guide the nation’s monetary policy.  \nThe strength of this network has helped make the  Federal Reserve one of the most successful \ncentral bank s in the world.   \nThe Federal Reserve’s effectiven ess is rooted in its 12-district  regional structure.  Having \n12 geographically defined Federal Reserve regions, each represented by a different Bank, allows \nfor the efficient and effective collection of diver se views on the economy  while also \nstrengthening  relationships with the communities we serve  and ensur ing that all segments of the \neconomy have a voice in monetary policy.  The system  continues to work very well and is a credit \nto the vision of  its creators.    \nFor the Kansas City Fed , agriculture is an important element  of our distinct voice , as is \nenergy, the theme of this year’s summit . Agriculture touches all 12 Fed eral Reserve  districts, but \nits imprint is particularly large in  the seven -state region covered by  the Kansas City Fed . We \ndevote  a fair amount of time, led by Nate Kauf fman, to analyzing and reporting on the sector  and \nevents like this further strengthen our bond.   \nThe agricultural economy in our region, and nationally, has gone through significant \nchanges over the past 10 to 15 years, with many of those changes tied to evolving global demand \nfor agricultural products. Growth in emerging economies, such as China, and  the rise of biofuels \nare two examples of factors that have shaped long -term demand for key agricultural commodities \nin the U.S. and globally. As we look ahead to factors that may further shape agriculture over the \nnext decade, we recognize that demand for  energy, and renewables in particular, will continue to \nplay a significant role.  \nAs we look to understand how the structure of agriculture might evolve in the years \nahead , I am here as an information  consumer, to listen  and learn from the experts in the room.  \nHowever, since now is my time on the agenda to be a produce r, I will turn to my views on the \noverall economy and the outlook for monetary policy.   \n\n2 \n  \nSubstantial Progress but Challenges Remain  \nAt the end of 2022, with inflation running near a 40-year hig h and the Fed in the middle \nof a historic tightening cycle, almost everyone was asking how much of a  slowdown  was it going \nto take to bring inflation back down towards the Fed’s 2 percent objective.  The consensus answer  \nat the time  was quite a bit . The majority of professional forecasters predicted  a recession in 2023.  \nBut we didn’t have a recession.  Instead , the pace of economic growth more than doubled even as \ninflation halved, all while the unemployment rate remained near all -time lows.      \nDespite this relative  success,  challenges remain.  Primarily, inflation is still  too high.  The \nFed is committed to bringing inflation back to its 2 percent objective.  So far this year, prices \nhave been increasing at about twice that pace, suggesting that the Fed has more work to do.   \nWe have seen a substantial shift in the underlying drivers of inflation over the past two \nyears.  Goods price inflation has eased considerably , as pandemic -related production disruptions \nfaded  and supply chains healed.  In contrast, services price inflation has remained firm , supported \nby a tight labor market .  \nPart of the strength of services inflation has been rents and the cost of housing . Rents \nhave been supported by strong income growth and the healthy labor market.  When a worker  gets \na job, they often want to upgrade their living space , and a tight labor market has historically \ndriven higher rents and housing costs.1 \nHowever, the strength of services price inflation has been broader than rents alone.  \nServices tend to be very labor intensive, so a tight labor market can be an important driver of \ninflation in this area.  And it is not just that the cost of labor tends to increase with labor market \ntightness.  If businesses are not able to hire sufficient labor, increas ing prices is one way to \nbalance supply and demand for their products and services independent of what they are doing \nwith wages.    \nTo recap, inflation is too high on account of a continued imbalance between the strength \nof demand and the economy ’s ability  to produce enough  supply to meet that demand.  Whereas \nwith the start  of the recent inflation , this imbalance was most apparent for goods . Now the \nimbalance has moved to  services and housing.   \n \n1 “A Tight Labor Market Could Keep Rent Inflation Elevated .” Lee Smith, Brent Bundick, and Luca Van Der Meer. \nEconomic Bulletin . Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. March 1, 2023.  \n\n3 \n Though elevated inflation is always painful, it is important to note that inflation ary \nperiods  are not the same.  The high inflation of the 1970s and early 1980s was rooted less in a \nstrong economy  than in the  psychology of price setting.  During that period, prices increased \nbecause firms and workers expected prices to go up, even though the economy was not \nparticularly strong .  \nToday , inflation expectations remain relatively low and anchored . The inflation we are \nseeing is coming from strong demand and an imbalance in the economy.  It is important that the \nFed act to preempt  inflation from becoming ingrained into the price -setting process, a \ndevelopment that would make lowering inflation all the more difficult.   \n \nThe Path Forward  \nWith the current imbalance -driven inflation, the Fed’s approach is relatively \nstraightforward.  The Fed must hold back  demand growth until supply can catch up and the \nimbalance that is driving inflation closes.  This is what the Fed is doing . By increasing the policy \nrate by 5¼ percentage points over the past two years , the Fed has tightened financial conditions \nand slowed demand growth.   \nWhile the overall economy remains strong, there are signs that  the imbalances driving \ninflation are easing.  The labor market has come off a historic boil by many measures.  At the \npeak, there were over two available job postings for every person reporting themselves as \nunemployed.  More recently, this number has fallen below 1½  postings for every unemployed \nperson , which is still high but is easing back.  We have also seen a decline in the  rate at which \nworkers are quitting their jobs.  When the labor market was very tight, workers were quitting at a \nhistoric rate , either as they found new jobs or expected to find them quickly . \nThe Fed works on inflation by easing demand, but our job is made easier by increases in \nsupply . An increased  supply of goods and services can also close imbalances and lower price \npressure.  Recently the supply outlook has improved, with solid growth and increased \nproductivity. The decline in the quits rate has been one factor  boosting  labor productivity and the \nsupply side of the economy.  Worker churn during the peak of labor market tightness and the \nassociated high  hiring and training costs were a drag on the productive capacity of the economy.  \nAs the labor market cools, this drag on productivity has dissipate d, boosting supply and easing \ninflation .  \n\n4 \n Over time , I expect inflation to ease back towards the Fed’s 2 percent objective.  I am \nprepared to be patient as this process plays out.  This will require a data -dependent approach that \nlooks at the data over time rather than loading too much weight on any one release . Although \nthere is an eagerness to spot turning points, I prefer a steady approach to policy, and one that \ndampens the volatility in financial markets rather than contributes to it.  \n \nInterest Rates Could Stay Higher for Longer  \nThat said, my own view is that interest rates could remain high for some time.  The \neconomy has undergone seismic shifts so far this decade . I have no certainty that we  are headed \nback to the low interest rate environment  that prevailed in the decade prior to the pandemic.   \nOne factor that I view as  particularly important here is the prospect of continued large \nfiscal deficits and the tremendous expansion of government debt, both in the United States and \nthroughout the world.  Prior to the pandemic, one often -cited explanation for the relatively low \ninterest rates of the period was high demand for  safe assets, including government  debt, relative \nto the supply of those assets.  Increased demand from financial institutions  as well as strong \ngrowth in China and emerging markets had boosted demand for such assets , bidding up their \nprice and holding down interest rates across the yield curve .  \nHowever, now this demand has cooled even as the supply of government debt has jumped \nand is expected to continue growing at a very rapid rate.  As such, it is possible that the balance of \ndemand and supply for government debt will shift from a factor holding down interest rates to a \nfactor boosting interest rates.  \nImportantly, shifts in supply and demand for safe assets influence interest rates \nindependent of the Fed’s actions. Though the Fed is not a passive bystander and plays a role in \nsetting short -term interest rates, it can’t perpetually deviate rates from mar ket forces without \nrisking its mandates for maximum employment and price stability. In this way, the Fed takes \nfiscal decisions as given and steers monetary policy in the appropriate direction to achieve its \ndual mandate.  \nIn the end, large fiscal deficits will not be inflationary because the Fed will do its job  and \nachieve its inflation objective , through  in doing so the outcome  could be persistently higher  \ninterest rates.  This relationship is also at the crux of the rationale for the political independence \nof the central bank.  Political authorities could very well  prefer that deficits not lead to higher  \n\n5 \n interest rates, but history has shown that  following through on  this impulse has often resulted in \nhigher inflation.  An independent central bank insulated from immediate political pressure and \nguided by a clear inflation objective has historically been an effective means for achieving and \nmaintaining low and stable inflation.   \n \nThe Fed’s Balance Sheet  \nIn part, c entral bank independence also motivates my position on another aspect of Fed \npolicy, the size and composition of the Fed’s balance sheet.  As part of the policy response to the \npandemic , the Fed embarked on a historic expansion of its balance sheet, purchasing trillions of \ndollars of Treasurys and mortgage -backed securities.  With the short -term policy interest rate \nstuck at zero, the purpose of these purchases w as to depress longer term interest rates  and \nstimulate economic activity . With the econo my recovering and price pressure s growing , the Fed \nappropriately started to reverse  these purchases in the middle of 2022, allowing maturing \nsecurities to roll off  and shrinking its balance sheet by $1.5 trillion relative to its peak.   \nAt the FOMC meeting two weeks ago, the committee announced that it would slow the \npace of this run off starting in June . The idea is that a slower pace will allow for a safer and less \ndisruptive approach to the balance sheet’s ultimate size  as determined by bank demand for \nreserves, the Fed’s primary liability.   \nWhile I understand this rationale  does not imply that the balance sheet will end up being \nany larger in the end , I would still reconfirm my preference to shrink the balance sheet as much \nas possible consistent with the Fed’s current operating framework . While a larger balance sheet \nlowers the risk of sharp movements in money market interest rates, maintaining a large balance \nsheet is not without cost . I am focused on three costs in my preference for a  relatively aggressive \napproach to balance sheet reduction:  \n \n1. First, a large balance sheet weighs on longer -term yields, distorting the price of duration  \nin financial markets  and potentially leading to distortions in the allocation of credit.  A \nsmaller balance sheet concentrated in shorter duration securities would lessen this \ndistortion.   \n\n6 \n 2. Second, a large balance sheet increases the Fed’s footprint in financial markets, \npotentially diminishing and weakening other mechanisms and markets for distributing \nliquidity across financial institutions and leading to a more brittle  financial  syste m.   \n3. And t hird, as I alluded to earlier, maintaining a large balance sheet can give the \nuncomfortable impression that monetary and fiscal policy are intertwined. Maintaining an \nexcessively large Treasury portfolio can give  the impression that the Fed’s balance sheet \nis supporting government debt markets.  \n \n In conclusion , I believe policy is in the correct place , and with patience we are on a path \nto achieve our policy objectives.  However, nothing is certain and continued vigilance and \nflexibility are necessary.   \nThank you again for joining us in Omaha , and I look forward to our discussion.",

        "content": "How Far and How Fast?  \n \n \nJeff Schmid  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOctober 21, 2024  \nDelivered to the C hartered  Financial Analysts Society of Kansas City  \nKansas City, Mo.  \nThe views expressed by the author are his own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers or representatives.  \n\n1 \n Thank you for inviting me to speak today.  I will offer some remarks on the outlook for \nthe economy and monetary policy , and then I look forward to any questions you may have.  \nAt its meeting in September, the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) lowered its \npolicy interest rate by ½ percentage point to a range between 4¾ percent and 5 percent.  This was \nthe first change in the policy rate in over a year and came about five years after the Fed last \nstarted a rate cutting cycle . But a lot has happened in those five years . After gradually lowering \nrates in the second half of 2019, the Fed  quickly dropped rates to zero  with the outbreak of the \npandemic . Only two years later, with inflation on its way to a  multi -decade high, the Fed \nembarked on the fast est tightening cycle of the modern era, pushing up rates 525 basis points \nover the course of a year -and-a-half. In the context of these outsized  moves, one may wonder \nwhat the future holds now that monetary policy has reached a new inflection point .  \nMy hope is for what I might call a more normalized cycle.  A cycle where the Fed engages \nin modest adjustments to  policy to keep the economy on an even keel of steady growth, stable \nprices, and full employment.  Absent any major shocks , I am optimistic that we can achieve such \na cycle, but I believe it will  take a cautious and gradual approach to policy.  While I support \ndialing back the restrictiveness of policy, my preference would be to avoid outsized moves, \nespecially given uncertainty over the eventual destination of policy and my desire to avoid \ncontributing to financial market volatility. In the remainder of my remarks, I will first discuss \nwhy now is the right time to start lowering rates . Then I will turn  to how low  rates might  go and \nhow quickly they should get there.   \n \nHow We Got Here  \nIn my view, it only bec ame appropriate to lower the policy rate after inflation \nconvincingly appeared to be on a persistent path towards the Fed’s 2 percent objective . Since \n2022, inflation has been the main plotline in the monetary policy narrative , and understandably \nso as prices surged at a pace not seen since the 1980s . More recently, we have seen considerable \nprogress in returning inflation to the Fed’s objective, with prices increasing  2.2 percent in the \nyear ending in August . I would not be comfortable lowering the policy rate if I w ere not \nreasonably confident that inflation was heading  in the right direction.   \nThere are a couple of factors that have considerably improved the outlook for inflation in \nrecent months.   \n\n2 \n First, the pandemic -related disruptions  that led to  the initial burst of inflation now appear \nto be largely behind us . This is especially true for the price of goods. It was a jump in goods \nprices  that provided much of the initial impetus for the surge in inflation,  but that impulse has \nbeen absent for over a year now.  In fact, over the past 12 months , goods prices have declined  \nalmost 1  percent.   \nThe fading of goods inflation reflects  developments in  both supply and demand . During \nthe pandemic, the supply of goods was lowered by production disruptions and logistical snarls . \nAt the same time , demand for goods surged as homebound consumers shifted spending away \nfrom services.  This imbalance between  low supply and high demand led to rapid price increases.  \nHowever  more recently , supply chains have recovered, the mix between goods and services \nconsumption has returned to pre -pandemic patterns, and goods prices are no longer a source of \ninflation.   \nA second factor increasing my confidence that the  easing of inflation will persist is the  \nloosening of the labor market.  The pandemic led to severe disruptions in the labor market, \ncontributing to historic tightness, and increasing pressure on labor -intensive services prices . \nMore recently , the labor market has cooled.  The vacancy ratio  has fallen to about 1 posting per \navailable worker from a historic high of 2 postings per available worker  at the height of labor \nmarket tightness in 2022 . We have also seen the unemployment rate creep up to 4. 1 percent from \n3.4 percent at the start of last year.   \nWhile the loosening of the labor market has led to some concern that the economy is on  \nshaky ground, my read is  that we are seeing a normalization rather than a significant \ndeterioration of conditions.  It might not be surprising that a historically tight labor market would \nbe followed by a period of relatively slack hiring.  When markets were tight and workers were \nquitting positions at a record pace, employers made every effort to retain existing workers and \nhire new workers, fearful that they would be caught short -handed.  Now that employers are \nconfident in their ability to fill  open  positions, they are no longer hoarding labor, easing retention \nefforts, and likely turning back the dial a bit on the aggressiveness of their hiring.  All of this will \nat least temporarily slacken the labor market as employers make these adjustments.   \nWith a variety of data sources and many different ways to view the labor market, I find it \nhelpful to reference the Kansas City Fed’s Labor Market Conditions Indicator s (LMCI)  for an \noverall view of the health of the labor market.  The LMCI combines 2 4 separate  labor market data \n\n3 \n series into two easy -to-interpret indexes.  Recently the LMCI has been trending down, suggesting \na loosening, but it remains  above its historical average, suggesting the overall labor market \nremains quite healthy.1 \n \nAdjusting Rates: How Low and How Fast?  \nWith the data suggesting inflation is heading in the right direction , there is a compelling \nargument that the policy interest rate should come down . Less certain is how low rates should go  \nand how quickly adjust ment s need to occur .  \nStarting with the first question  of how low interest rates will go, there is ample  evidence \nthat the current stance of monetary policy , and the level of interest rates,  is restrictive, but less \nevidence that it is very restrictive.  Growth remains strong  and the economy has shown continued \nmomentum . Real GDP increased 3 percent in the second quarter  and appears to be poised to \nincrease a similar amount in the third quarter.  Not bad, considering growth average d a little over  \n2 percent in the decade before the pandemic when interest rates were far lower.   \nThe economy has been supported by strong consumer spending, which in turn has been \nsupported by growing labor income and relatively healthy household balance sheets in the \naggregate.  Of course,  not all household balance sheets are healthy, and the aggregate numbers \nmask all the differences across actual households . But to summarize , if the economy does not \nappear to be very restricted, then it seems unlikely that monetary policy is all that restrictive.  \nIt is my belief that interest rates could  settle well above the levels we saw in the decade \nbefore the pandemic.  There are several  reasons why this may be true. One favorable, and some \nmay say optimistic, scenario is that continued strong productivity gains boost economic growth, \nstrengthen investment and support consumption.  Such a combination would increase the demand \nfor investable savings and hence push up interest rates.   \nA less favorable scenario, and one I discussed at length in a speech in May, is that the \ntremendous increase in government debt coming out of the pandemic , not just in the United \nStates  but around the world , maintains upward pressure on  interest rates across the economy.2 \n \n1 More information about the Kansas City Fed’s LMCI is available at https://www.kansascityfed.org/data -and-\ntrends/labor -market-conditions -indicators/ .  \n2 See “The Outlook for the Economy and Monetary Policy” at \nhttps://www.kansascityfed.org/Speeches/documents/10168/2024 -Schmid-Omaha-05-14.pdf.  \n\n4 \n However, there are some long -run structural factors that likely contributed to the low \nlevel of interest rates before the pandemic , and these factors have not gone away . In particular, \ndemographic trends point to aging populations in the United States and around the world.  As \nolder populations  age into retirement, they  tend to work less, which reduces demand for  physical  \ncapital and invest ment , depressing interest rates . Older populations also  save more,  particularly \nin fixed -income assets, which can further push down interest rates.  Though it is hard to know \nwhich of these factors will dominate  — productivity, debt, or demographics — we must be open \nto the possibility that interest rates will settle higher than we observed before the pandemic.     \nNow let’s turn to the question of timing.  If the Fed is to further lower interest rates, at \nwhat pace should it be done?  Given the uncertainties I just outlined about our eventual \ndestination, a cautious and deliberate course of action seems appropriate. Lowering rates in a \ngradual fashion would provide time to observe  the economy’s reaction to our interest rate \nadjustments  and give us the space to assess at what level interest rates are neither restricting nor \nboosting the economy.  \nA cautious approach will also work to minimize the Fed’s contribution to financial \nmarket volatility.  Outsized policy moves can provoke  outsized financial market reactions to data \nsurprises.  The data are messy and subject to large revisions as we have seen in recent months.  \nOur policy must be linked to the flow of data, but we should avoid putting  too much weight on \nany single  data point . As policymakers we should be flexible , but being nimble can come with a \nprice.  Reacting quickly builds expectations of f urther quick reactions . This  widens the scope for \nfinancial market expectations to diverge from the intent  of the Committee , potentially \ncontributing  to heightened financial market volatility.  Already, we have seen large swings in \nTreasury yields over the past few months  as markets assess and reassess the potential course of \npolicy interest rates.  \n \nThe Impact on the Balance Sheet  \nV olatile interest rates could potentially complicate another aspect of Fed policy , which is  \nour work  to decrease the size of our balance sheet . Following a tremendous expansion during the \npandemic, the Fed has been shrinking its balance sheet since the middle of 2022.  My preference \nis to shrink the balance sheet as much as possible while remaining consistent with the Fed’s \ncurrent operating framework.  While a larger balance sheet lowers the risk of sharp movements in \n\n5 \n money market interest rates, maintaining a large balance sheet is not without cost s. I am focused \non three costs in my preference for a relatively aggressive approach to balance sheet reduction . \nFirst, a large balance sheet weighs on longer -term yields, d epressing the price of duration \nin financial markets and potentially leading to distortions in the allocation of credit.  It is my view \nthat one factor contributing to the flatness of the yield curve is the large size  and elevated \nduration  of our balance sheet.  The long -term health of the traditional banking industry, which is \nwell represented in my Federal Reserve district , requires a positive slope to the yield curve.  A \nsmaller balance sheet conce ntrated in shorter duration securities would lessen our impact on the \nslope of the yield curve.  Recent research from the Kansas City Fed reviews some of the \nconsiderations around the eventual composition of the Fed’s balance sheet.3 \nSecond, a large balance sheet increases the Fed’s footprint in financial markets, \npotentially diminishing and weakening other mechanisms and markets for distributing liquidity \nacross financial institutions and leading to a more brittle financial system.    \nAnd third, maintaining a large balance sheet can give the uncomfortable impression that \nmonetary and fiscal policy are intertwined. Maintaining an excessively large Treasury portfolio \ncan give the impression that the Fed’s balance sheet is supporting gover nment debt markets.  \nAs we move past the post -pandemic surge in inflation, we have the prospect of \ntransitioning to a more normalized cycle where the Fed regularly recalibrates monetary policy to \nmeet  its dual mandate of price stability and full employment.  I am optimistic the Fed can achieve \nsuch an outcome, but it will take a careful approach that is attentive to the data and signals from \nthe economy.  My beli ef is that a cautious and gradual approach to policy adjustments would be \nbest suited for this uncertain environment.    \n \n \n3 See Sengupta and S mith (2024).  “Considerations for the Longer -Run Maturity Composition of the Federal \nReserve’s Treasury Portfolio” .",
