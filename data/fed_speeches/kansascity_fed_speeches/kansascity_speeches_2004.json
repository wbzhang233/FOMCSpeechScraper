Hoenig  \nPresident  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMeeting for Heads of Supervision  \nBank for International Settlements  \nBasel, Switzerland  \nApril 27, 2004  \n \n\n2 \nI. Introduction  \n \nI am pleased to be here today to talk about a subject that is of great interest to me, as I am \ninvolved in both financial supervision and monetary policy .  This subject –how our supervisory \nframework can contribute to a stable financial sy stem that fully supports sustainable economic \ngrowth –is important for several reasons.   \nIn recent years, in developing as well as developed countries, financial crises have \noccurred all too often, and have imposed great costs to the countries they have af fected.  In fact, \nin recent decades very few countries have escaped some form of financial distress or crisis.  A \n1996 survey by the IMF, for instance, found that 73 percent of their member count ries had \nexperienced significant banking problems during the preceding 15 years .  Many of these \nproblems led to substantial declines in GDP, serious disruptions in credit and capital markets, \nand adversity  for the banking industry  and its customer base .  This historical record provides a \nclear picture of the importa nce of the supervisory issues we are discussing today –and of the need \nfor careful thought regarding any effort to assure financial stability . \nThese r ecent financial crises have also coincide d with and been influenced by a period of \nrapid and pathbreaking c hanges in our financial markets .  While banks are still a critical part of \nthe financial picture, they are now just one highlight on the financial landscape.  Sharing the \nspotlight are an ever -expanding set of capital markets and the financial instruments and firms \nassociated with them.  In the U nited States at least, these developments are reintegrating banking \nand capital markets to a degree we have  not seen since the Great Depression.  These changes in \nour financial structure are , in turn , altering the n ature of the financial crises we experience.  \nIncreasingly , crises originate in capital markets and are characterized by asset -price volatility and \ndisruptions in market liquidity.   \n\n3 \nBecause  these developments and their effects on the supervisory framework  are far from \nover, I would like to begin with a  review  of the major changes evident in the financial sector .  \nThen I will review some of the supervisory steps already taken to address recent crises within  the \nchanging financial system.   And f inally, I wil l look at what the appropriate role might be for \nmacro -prudential supervision and what could reasonably be accomplished under this framework, \nincluding shifting more attention to capital markets and the need to prevent costly financial crises \nthere.   \nI sho uld mention  again , though, that as I am involved both with financial  supervis ion and \nmonetary policy, I have a natural tendency to think of supervisory issues  in terms of our ultimate \npolicy objectives  of financial stability, sustainable economic growth, a nd customer protection , \nrather than  in terms  of micro - versus macro -prudential supervision.   Thinking of it th is way, I \nwill explain why,  despite all the changes we have observed in financial markets, the problems \npolicymakers face today are the same ones we have always faced.  They are perhaps more \nchallenging today, however, because our financial system  is so much more complex  than it used \nto be .   \n \nII. The Changing Financial System  \n \nAny assessment of t oday ’s financial system –both domes tically and worldwi de–must \nrecognize tha t, in its detail, the system is much different than it was a few  decades ago .  \nTechnology lies a t the heart of much of this change .  Technolog y has greatly reduc ed the cost of \ngathering, processing, and transmi tting information , and thus has allow ed a wide range of new \nfinancial instruments, rapidly growing competition across industry segments, and new methods  \n\n4 \nof conducting financial business and managing risk.   In some ways, this change is revolution ary, \na development of the informatio n age.  In other respects, however, it is just another stage in a n \nevolution that has long been under way , driven in earlier periods by such development s as the \ntelegraph , the telephone , and improved methods of transportation .  From this longer -term \nperspe ctive, what is most novel about this stage of technological change is not that changes are \ntaking place, but that they are occurring at an ever -increasing pace.   \nFrom any perspective, the declin e in transaction and information costs  made possible by \ntechn ology is allowing capital markets to operate more efficiently and to assum e a much broader \nrole in the economy .  One notable  outgrowth of this development is  the disappearance of \npreviously segmented  financial system s.  Today we see  the emergence of a fram ework in which \na wide variety of institutions and markets now compete directly for the same business .  With  this \ncross -industry competition and the rising importance of capital markets , we can no longer view \nprudential  supervision  and systemic risk as bank ing industry issues alone.  \nAnother significant change is the variety  of financial products and services available.  \nInnovative  financial instruments , electronic banking services, securitization,  and the rapid \ngrowth of the derivatives market are now  giving financial customers broader choices and \nallow ing risks to be partitioned and distributed to those most willing to assume them .  As a \nresult, financial institutions and investors now have a multitude of options for controlling and \ndiversifying their risk e xposure .  \nEmerging a long with these developments  have been the institutional consolidation and \nglobalization of financial markets .  This trend is spawning increasing ly large and more complex \norganizations  with activities spread across many countries .  This  development, in turn, is \nincreas ing the interdependencies among major organizations and creating additional systemic \n\n5 \nlinkages . \nIn considering these developments, I w ant to  emphasize two very striking but divergent \npatterns.  First, of course, major financ ial institutions and other market participants have a wide r \nrange of opportunities to diversify risk  through financial engineering and a broader  range of \nactivities.  But at  the same time, the complex web of connections across  institutions,  markets , \nand co untries  is likely  leading to new sources of systemic risk  and financial instability .  We must \nbe prepared to deal with t he effects of these risks .  These patterns are not unique to this recent \nperiod of financial market innovation.  Rather, they have alway s characterized change in \nfinancial markets.  \nClearly , it can be useful to look to the past to inform ourselves regarding  how to better \napproach the future .  But  I would stress that  we need to be careful not to presume too much or to \nrely on past experience  in an indiscriminate way.  It is always tempting to assume that if we can \nlearn how to prevent the crises of the past, we might be able to anticipate future crises.  I will \nargue , instead,  that future crises will always  differ  somewhat from past crises.  This is \nparticularly so because supervision and the role of the market continue to change –in part to \nprevent a replay of the crises of the past.  Consequently, a strict reliance  on past experience s and \nhistorical models is likely to provide limited help in  anticipating the answers we need  in this \nchanging financial landscape .    \n \nIII. A Changing Supervisory System  \n \nThese many and varied developments in the financial system are influencing  how we \nthink about  supervis ing institutions to accomplish our public policy objectives.  Our objectives \n\n6 \nremain the same as always –preventing a  systemic crisis , protecting financial customers , and \npromoting a competitive and efficient financial system  that supports economic growth .  But the \nsteps we use to accomplish these o bjectives are undergoing significant change .  And in pursuing \nthese objectives, we find ourselves, as always, having to consider a n even  broader range of \ninstitutions, activities, and markets . \nTo illustrate how our  supervisory framework  is changing , let me  remind you of one of the \ngreatest  financial  crises in modern  history –the Great Depression of the 1930s .  The public lost \nconfidence in banks  and financial markets , and many banks failed in a period of contagion.  \nQuite naturally, a restrictive regulatory and supervisory system was put in place that focused on \npreventing individual banks from failing , protecting s mall depositors , and increasing  the integrity \nof financial markets .    \nThe financial revolution of the last few decades , however, has  made signifi cant parts of \nthis regulatory framework no longer workable.   Rising competition across different segments of \nthe financial industry –both in the United States and worldwide –has forced us to remove  many \nregulatory  barriers .  Bank interest rate ceilings, limi ts on geographic expansion, and activity \nconstraints, which once served to protect particular segments of the industry, are rapidly \nbecoming things of the past.   Also, recent financial crises have revealed moral -hazard problems \nand loss exposures under public safety nets .  These risks  have forced many countries to take a \ncloser look at the explicit and implicit guarantees they provide and, in some cases, to reduce  or \nrechannel such support.   \nAs an outgrowth of these changes , the marketplace is also playing a greater role in \ndetermining how financial resources will be used  and which institutions and products will \nsurvive and prosper in a more competitive environment .  In turn, t he rising complexity of \n\n7 \nfinancial instruments and institutions is changing the sup ervisory system.  Large institutions are \nnot only conducting a much wider range of activities than before, but they can now more readily \nshift their risk profile s.  These changes, consequently , have  led to greater supervisory focus on an \ninstitution’s risk  management practices and internal controls –that is, to a greater focus on an \ninstitution’s ability to measure, manage, and control its risk exposures .  Associated with this shift \nin focus, banking supervisors have placed less emphasis on a bank’s  balance sheet condition  at a \nsingle point in time.   Also, through “continuous supervision,” as well as “risk matrix” profiles \nand other tools, supervisors are directing closer  attention to the largest organizations, especially \nthose that could pose systemic concer ns.  \nOther significant changes encompass supervisory efforts to control interbank exposures , \nas well as exposures among banks and other financial institutions and markets .  With major \ninstitutions consolidating and becoming even larger, more supervisory at tention is necessarily \nbeing devoted to relationships across institutions and to the systemic risks the se linkages  could \npose.  Some steps supervisors  and institutions have taken include limits on interbank deposits, \nFed daylight overdraft fees and caps, a nd various clearinghouse standards, such as collateral \nrequirements, loss -sharing agreements, and exposure limits.   Marketplace standards and practices \nare further developing to control  counterparty risk in the derivatives market and a cross  many  \ntrading , clearing, and settlement  activities.  \nWithin the capital markets,  a number of regulatory changes have occurred in response to \nmarket disruptions, investor demands, and other events.  T he 1987 stock market crash in the \nUnited States , for example,  brought forth a variety of changes to help ensure that trading would \nhenceforth occur in a controlled and orderly fashion.   Several commercial paper defaults in 1989 \nand 1990  prompted the SEC to  tighte n the  restrictions on the quality , maturity , and \n\n8 \nconcentrations  of commercial paper and securities th at money market mutual funds could hold .  \nIn the wake of Enron , WorldCom, and other recent accounting scandals in the United States, \nseveral steps have been taken  to provide for better corporate governance, more accurate p ublic \ndisclosures, and stronger oversight of public accounting firms.   These include passage of the \nSarbanes -Oxley Act of 2002 and the institution of stricter  stock exchange standards for listed \nfirms.  \nThis is only a brief summary of the changes we are see ing in financial supervision in \nresponse to the revolution in financial services and the recent financial crises that have plagued \nmany countries.  We are , by no means , through with the process of financial reform, which \nbring s us to the issue of how macro -prudential supervision best fits in our supervisory \nframework.  \n   \nIV. The Role for Macro -Prudential Supervision  \n \nIn the context of the aforementioned  framework, I want to focus the rest of my remarks \non the appropriate role for macro -prudential supervisio n in today’s financial environment.  In my \ndual role as a financial supervisor and a monetary policymaker, I am constantly reminded of the \nimportance of having a macro -prudential supervisory focus.  As a supervisor, I have had to deal \nwith the banking and credit problems that arose from the energy , real estate,  and agricultural \ncollapse s in the United States during the 1980s.   And , as a monetary policymaker, I am \nconstantly exposed to many credit and capital market issues regarding the possible buildup of \ndebt and investment imbalances.   Addressing these types of financial stress  is a key challenge for \nmacro -prudential supervision.  \n\n9 \nBased on my experiences, I doubt we will ever predict financial crises very well.  We \nhave never  predict ed them well in the pa st.  If we could have foreseen them  then , we would have \ntaken steps to prevent them , or at least  greatly minimize their consequences.  At our Jackson \nHole Symposium last year, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan stated that “Uncertainty \nis not just an important feature of the monetary policy landscape; it is the defining \ncharacteristic.”  The same comment could be made about financial markets and supervisory \npolicy.   \nThere are many examples of this:  the Asian financial crisis, the Latin American curre ncy \ncrises, the Scandinavian real estate collapse, the U .S. stock market crash of 1987, and the 1998 \nRussian debt crisis and resulting problems with LTCM.  In each case, to varying degrees  we \nwere aware of potential problems and exposures, but problems failed to arise  as expected –until \none day they did  arise .  Often, an economic downturn, high interest rates, or exchange rate \nmovements stressed markets and institutions that once appeared sound to the point of crisis or \nfailure.  Ex post the source of each c risis became  obvious .  Still , we were caught by surprise.  \nConversely, many problems predicted by financial analysts, investors, and supervisors have \nnever materialized.  That is why  we inevitably come back to such basic supervisory and financial \nconcepts as capital adequacy, risk diversification, and limits on interbank and market exposures.   \nWith this said , let me now  address three questions that I believe we should be asking \nourselves when thinking about a macro -prudential supervisory framework.  First, are market \ndiscipline and self -regulation sufficient to prevent systemic crises?  Second, how can supervisory \npolicy better address systemic crises and macroeconomic disturbances?  And third, can monetary \npolicy supplement macro -prudential supervision?   My comments further reflect the importance I \nplace o n having a central bank active in both monetary and supervisory matters.  \n\n10 \n \nAre market discipline and self -regulation sufficient to prevent systemic crises?    \nA factor that is becoming more prominent in a m acro-prudential supervisory framework \nis market discipline  and the role that it could play in making financial market participants more \nresilient to shocks .  With the removal of many regulatory barriers, the market now has greater \ninfluence  in determining the operating parameters for financial institutions and markets.  In fact, \nmany recent financial market developments have occurred precisely out of a desire by market \nparticipants to better share and control risks.  Examples include the growth of the deriv atives \nmarket , increased equity support in U.S. real estate markets , and ongoing investor efforts to \npenalize  financial firms with poor risk management practices and inadequate capital.  \nFor market discipline to work effectively and efficiently, a necessary  ingredient is t imely, \nappropriate, and accurate information.  Both investors and p olicymakers can play an important \nrole in demanding and helping to establish information disclosure standards for financial \ninstitutions and other market participants.  I ha ve also advocated that financial supervisors play \nan active role in helping to ensure financial institutions adequately disclose significant \ninformation to the market, including significant supervisory findings.  \nOur recent past further indicates that the m arketplace  can impose the most effective and \nstrongest form of discipline on financial institutions .  This  discipline  should help reinforce \nmacro -prudential supervision and, when markets are properly structured, contribute to the \nstrength of the overall ec onomy.   However, I believe that financial external ities will prevent \nmarkets from providing all the discipline needed to reduce the risk of contagion to desirable \nlevels.  The complexity of linkages among market participants is making it difficult for the \nmarket to assess true risk exposures , and in spite of recent improvements in public disclosures, \n\n11 \nmarket participants are unlikely to have the full set of data necessary for such assessments .  In \naddition , institutions and investors  generally will have no r eason to internalize the effects that \nthey m ight have on others during a crisis.  \n \nHow can supervisory policy better address systemic crises and macroeconomic disturbances?  \nFrom a supervisory standpoint, many of the steps we have taken during  the last few \ndecades and will be taking in the near term are closely aligned with macro -prudential \nsupervision.  This macro -prudential focus is being driven by the changing financial system.  \nWith larger institutions, greater competition across market seg ments  and the g rowing importance \nof capital markets, supervisors will have to  pay increasing  attention to the interrelationships \namong institutions and markets and to the risk that the largest institutions pose to the overall \nsystem.  In terms of macro -prudential supervi sion, there are three basic concerns for supervisors .  \nThey are to promot e good risk management practices at large institutions that might pose a  \nsystemic risk, to limit exposures between institutions and the markets they serve, and to ensure \nthat supervis ory policies do not have adverse or ill -timed effects over the economic cycle.  \nRisk-focused supervision  is becoming  a cornerstone in supervisory efforts  to address risk \nmanagement practices at large and small institutions.  Under risk -focused supervision, \nsupervisors channel the vast majority of their attention to the areas and activities that create the \ngreatest risk exposure to an individual institution.  For larger institutions, this implies an \nawareness of  risk exposures that pose a potential  threat to other firms  and to the general \neconomy, including any significant risk concentrations in individual markets .  While risk \ndiversification  is nothing new , we should remind ourselves that it is a critical point of emphasis, \nhelping to ensure that institutions  are stable across the economic cycle.   U.S. banks, in fact, have \n\n12 \nperformed remarkably well in a trying environment during  the last few years, and a prime factor \nbehind this performance is improved risk diversification and management.  \nRisk management  is ju st as important for investment banking firms and other market \nparticipants.  While securities firms and some other capital market participants may focus more \non trading activities and less on maintaining a portfolio of assets, it is still essential that t hese \ninstitutions diversify their counterparty risk and thoroughly check the reputation of potential \ntrading parties.  Likewise, merchant banks  and others with a portfolio of  investments are wise to \ndiversify their investment risk.  So , whether you view ris k-focused supervision as micro - or \nmacro -prudential, this form of supervision, along with the related efforts of banks and other \nmarket participants, will help make the financial system less vulnerable to economic \ndisturbances.  \nIn addition to continuing to  rely on risk -focused supervision for individual institutions , \nwe must continue to work to limit interbank exposures and improve the overall resiliency of our \nfinancial system .  In the United States, for example, major institutions and bank and securities \nsupervisors are taking steps in the post -9/11 environment to ensure that core clearing  and \nsettlement systems and other critical financial market roles can be resumed in the event of \ndisasters or key systems failures.  \nA final element  in macro -prudential su pervision is that  our supervisory policies and rules \nhave consistent and appropriate effects over the business cycle, including our accounting rules, \ncapital standards, provisioning requirements, risk-management practices, and supervisory \nattitudes and app roaches.   Capital and provisioning standards, for example, should reflect a \nlonger -term picture of risk rather than just the most recent  experience or a very optimistic or \npessimistic view of near -term events.   While some have suggested that supervisory po licy could \n\n13 \nbe used more on a countercyclical basis to deal with credit and other market imbalances, I \nbelieve our inability to accurately foresee the future and our need to maintain  consistency \nthroughout the entire supervisory process will leave superviso rs playing a neutral role, at best, \nover the cycle.  \n  \nCan monetary policy supplement macro -prudential supervision?  \nFrom a central bank and monetary policy standpoint, I believe the most important thing \npolicymakers can do is pursue a stable, low -inflation  environment.  Unexpected inflation or \ndeflation clearly disrupts the agreements inherent in longer -term debt contracts and the \ninvestment objectives and plans of individuals and businesses .  If extreme enough, it can spark a \nfinancial crisis.   \nSome, incl uding many at the BIS, have argued that financial crises often stem from \nfinancial imbalances  that build up in the economy, and that there is a role for monetary policy to \nact preemptively to prevent or contain such imbalances.   I would like to comment on that \nposition . \nFirst, as I have suggested, financial crises are by their nature difficult if not impossible to \nanticipate  with any real degree of certainty .  In hindsight , each crisis involves analysis  and an  \nunderstanding of its causes, as well as changes  and corrective steps  that supervis ors and market \nparticipants pursue  to prevent its recurrence .  This means that a similar crisis is unlikely to re-\noccur anytime soon .  However, as the financial system evolves, new vulnerabilities are \nuncovered for which we are not prepared.  If history is any guide, there are scant reasons to \nbelieve that we will be much better prepared at spotting these emerging vulnerabilities than we \nhave been in the past.  Not that we should not try, of course.  But if we grow too sec ure in the \n\n14 \nbelief that we can foresee and prevent crises before they occur, we risk becoming complacent \nprecisely when we should be more vigilant.  For th ese reason s, early  warning models of financial \ncrises based on historical data are unlikely to extrapo late well to future periods, particularly with \nthe rapid changes we are seeing in credit markets.  Indeed, the past few decades have been a \nunique experience  with substantial deregulation in many countries and a relaxation of previous \nconstraints on foreig n capital flows, combined with slow progress in building a new supervisory \nframework.  It is thus not surprising that financial imbalances and crises developed  during this \ntime.  But going forward, in the face of further dramatic changes in the financial s ector, they may \nbe even harder to identify and address in a timely fashion.    \nSecond, even if we have a sense that  financial imbalances  may be emerging , preemptive \nmonetary policy is a very broad tool to be applying effectively to the imbalance.   Most perc eived \nfinancial imbalances occur in a  particular financial market or segment of a market.  For example, \nwhen housing  price  bubbles have occurred in the United States, they have appeared only in a few \nselect cities.  I am unaware of there having been a bubb le in the national housing market.  And \neven in the late 1990s, the “bubble” in equity markets was concentrated in the high-tech sector .  \nThe rest of the stock market did not appear to be overvalued.  Raising interest rates to reduce \nliquidity  is an extrem e response to the possibility of an imbalance in a single segment of our \nfinancial system.  It would risk slowing the economy  when attempting to address a unique \nsegment within it , which is a sizable  risk.  A better response would be more targeted, but suc h \nresponses are beyond the scope of our monetary policy tools.   \nFinally, monetary policy itself is always formed with incomplete information and , given \nthe lag effects of policy actions , could sometimes contribute to imbalances or other \ncircumstances that  aggravate a crisis.  Identifying such circumstances is usually only possible \n\n15 \nwith the benefit of hindsight  and with knowledge of the economy that no one, including \npolicymakers, will have when  policy actions are first taken .  My point here is that the bet ter we \nget at pursuing our long -term monetary policy objectives , the less likely we are to unknowingly \ncontribute to crises .  And  any crises that do arise are likely to be smaller and less damaging.   \nThus, I believe the best we may be able to do to preven t financial crises from a monetary \npolicy standpoint is to aim for stable economic conditions  that will make market imbalances less \nlikely to occur or less severe should they occur.   This is not to ignore the important function of \nmonetary authorities to use open  market or discount  window operations to quell liquidity crises \nand threats to market confidence , much as occurred after the 1987 stock market crash, the 1998 \nRussian debt crisis, and 9/11.       \n \nV. Closing Comments   \n \nI certainly concur with those w ho stress the need to take a systemwide or macro -\nprudential view of financial market supervision.   This has always been important.  And it \nremains important today as we move toward a more market -driven financial system and witness \nrapid growth in capital m arkets.   The l arger institutions, more extensive linkages across \ninstitutions and markets, and more complex financial instruments that inevitably follow these \ndevelopments will further contribute to the need to look at supervision and financial risk on a \nsystemwide basis.  \nI think we have already come far in improving the overall resiliency of our financial \nsystem and limit ing the buildup of common and significant exposures both system wide and \nbetween individual institutions and markets.   In the coming years , we must continue down this \n\n16 \npath.  Monetary policy must also continue playing  a significant  role in ensuring a stable \nenvironment in which the expectations of debtors, creditors, and investors can be realized.  Yet, I \nbelieve that monetary policymakers an d bank supervisors working independently will not be \nenough.  T o accomplish our objectives, they, along with supervisory authorities from all other \nparts of the financial system , will have to work together to share information about risks \ndeveloping in the  institutions and markets under their review.  More than ever before, we will \nneed better communication and coordination to  ensure the financial stability needed to fully \nsupport sustainable economic growth."
