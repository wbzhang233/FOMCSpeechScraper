George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApril 7, 2016  \nEconomic Forum  \nYork, Neb.  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve \nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.  \n\n 1 “It seems rather striking that one of the ideas now firmly imbedded in our articles \nof material faith, the concept of governmental responsibility for m oderating economic \ngyrations, is almost entirely a product of our own Twentieth Century.  \n “This concept, which is steadily being brought into sharper focus, has evolved \nfrom general reaction to a succession of material crises heavy in human hardship.  It \ngrew from mass desperation and demand for protection from economic disasters beyond \nindividual control.  \n “The Federal Reserve System, which I have the honor to represent, was our \nearliest institutional response to such a demand.  It emerged out of the urgen t need to \nprevent recurrences of such disasters as the money panic of 1907, and out of the thought \nthat the Government had a definite responsibility to prevent financial crises and should \nutilize all its powers to do so.  \n “Accordingly , … Congress entrusted  to the Federal Reserve System responsibility \nfor managing the money supply.  This was a historic and revolutionary step.  In framing \nthe Federal Reserve Act great care was taken to safeguard this money management from \nimproper interference by either priva te or political interests.  That is why we talk about \nthe overriding importance of maintaining our independence.  Hence we have our system \nof regional banks headed up by a coordinating Board in Washington intended to have \nonly that degree of centralized au thority required to discharge effectively a national \npolicy.  This constitutes, as those of you in this audience recognize, a blending of public \ninterest and private enterprise uniquely American in character.  Too few of us adequately \nrecognize or adequate ly salute the genius of the framers of our central banking system in \nproviding this organizational bulwark of private banking and business.  \n\n 2  “Since the Federal Reserve System came into being, the problems of inelasticity \nof currency and immobility of bank reserves -- which so often showed up as shortages of \ncurrency or credit in times of critical need -- have been eliminated, and money panics \nhave largely disappeared.  \n “In this specialized respect there can be no doubt that the System has made \nnotable progr ess, but in the more fundamental role of stabilizing the economy the record \nis not so clear.  All of us in the System are bending our best efforts to capitalize on the \nexperience of the past, and our current knowledge of money, so as to make as large a \ncontribution as possible in this direction.  But a note should be made here that, while \nmoney policy can do a great deal, it is by no means all powerful.  In other words, we \nshould not place too heavy a burden on monetary policy.  It must be accompanied by \nappropriate fiscal and budgetary measures if we are to achieve our aim of stable \nprogress.  If we ask too much of monetary policy we will not only fail but we will also \ndiscredit this useful, and indeed indispensable, tool for shaping our economic \ndevelopmen t.”1 \n I’ll pause here to give credit to former Federal Reserve Chairman William \nMcChesney Martin , who delivered these remarks on October 19, 1955.   His remarks \nmore than six decades ago remain relevant today and in particular echo my own concern \nthat the public has come to expect that monetary policy can solve for every problem that \nails the U .S. economy.  \nI am here in York, Nebraska , with members of our Omaha Branch office board of \ndirectors , who serve as important windows on the current economic landscape.  Those \n                                                        \n1 Addresss of William McChesney Martin , before the New York Group of the Investment Bankers \nAssociation of America, Waldorf A storia Hotel, New York City, Oct. 19, 1955  \n\n 3 insights are enormously valuable to me as I make my own assessments of the economy \nand form my policy views as a member of the Federal Open Market Committee  (FOMC) .  \nThis evening, I’ ll offer you my thoughts on the state of the economy and current \nstance of monetary policy.  As you may know, I did not agree with the Committee’s \ndecision to hold rates steady at the most recent policy meeting last month.  I’ll explain \nmy views about poli cy, noting these are my own views and are not necessarily \nrepresentative of others in the Federal Reserve System.  \n \nThe Economic Outlook  \nHere in Nebraska, a state with a significant agricultural profile, the economy has \nsoftened , as Nathan noted earlier in his remarks.  Across much of our region, the \ndowndraft in commodity prices, combined with a strong dollar, has had a chilling effect \non the regional economy.   \nFarm income is expected to weaken modestly in 2016, which would mark  a third \nconsecutive year in the current downturn. As lower income reduces cash flows, demand \nfor credit among farmers has continued to rise. At this stage, the delinquency rate on \nagricultural production loans remains well below levels from five years ago , and \nfarmland values, which are a significant contributor to the health of farm balance sheets, \nhave remained relatively stable. Should these values erode further, we might expect to \nsee further stresses on the agricultural sector.  \nLikewise, the dramatic  fall in oil and gas prices over the past 18 months has \nnegatively affected the region. The number of active oil and gas rigs in the U nited States  \nhas fallen by three -quarters, from almost 2,000 rigs at the peak to less than 500 today. \n\n 4 Weakness in energy -related investment has spread to upstream suppliers in \nmanufacturing sectors, resulting in broader signs of slowing capital investment  across the \nnation .  \nCredit conditions have tightened for energy -related companies , and s trains on the \nearnings are leading  to substantial job losses, particularly within our region, which \nincludes Oklahoma and Wyoming. The challenges facing those affected are substantial , \nalthough we do see that some of these workers are finding employment more easily than \nthey did during the  last oil price shock.2  \nBeyond these sectors, the U.S. economy as a whole has continued to expand , and \nit has been quite a long economic expansion by historical standards. Indeed, the FOMC \nviewed the economy a s sufficiently sound last December to warrant increasing short -term \ninterest rates.   \nSince the December meeting, economic data have largely confirmed an outlook \nfor further growth. We have received four strong labor reports as well as data showing \nthat inflation is moving higher.   \nUnfortu nately, however, the initiation of raising interest rates coincided with what \nappears to be a more vulnerable global economy, and a domestic economy that appears to \nbe slowing in the first quarter and is threatened by markets that are anxious, uncertain, \nand volatile. Faced with these dynamics, the Federal Reserve’s decisions to continue to \nnormalize its policy settings have become more difficult.   \nIn the face of such headwinds and uncertainty, the FOMC is guided by a focus on \nlonger -run objectives —those o bjectives outlined by Congress in the Federal Reserve Act \n                                                        \n2 Brown, Jason and Andres Kodaka , “The Reallocation of Energy -Sector Workers after Oil Price Boo ms \nand Busts ,” Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, The Macro  Bulletin, March 3, 2016.  \n\n 5 and expressed by the FOMC in its annual Longer Run Goals and Monetary Policy \nStrategy :  “The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Open \nMarket Committee shall maintain lon g run growth of the monetary and credit aggregates \ncommensurate with the economy's long run potential to increase production, so as to \npromote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices and moderate long -\nterm interest rates.”3 \nAlthough  financial markets were off to a volatile start this year, economic \nfundamentals remain relatively strong, particularly conditions in the labor market. More \njobs were added in both 2014 and 2015 than in any other year since the late 1990s .  This  \ntrend has conti nued  with the economy add ing an average of more than 200,000  net new \njobs per month  in 2016 . The ongoing  strength in job gains is well above the trend rate \nneeded to absorb new entrants into the labor force. As a result, we have seen people  who \nhad been on the sidelines and not working over the past five years  start to re -enter the \nlabor force. And even as people have returned to the labor market, job growth has been \nstrong enough so that the unemployment rate continued to fall  over the last  year. At 5.0 \npercent , the unemployment rate is quite close to the longer -run estimate of normal.  \nIn addi tion to a healthy labor market,  consumer spending has been supported by \nstronger household  balance sheet s. There are , of course , exceptions, but overall , \nhousehold budgets generally look far less extended today than they did in the mid -2000s. \nThe debt service ratio, which measures the burden of debt payments relative to income, is \nalso lower than at any other time since the Federal Reserve started collecting data on this \nmeasure in 1980.  \n                                                        \n3 Section 2A  of the Federal Reserve Act as amended by the Federal Reserve Reform Act of 1977.  \n\n 6 Household balance sheets also have benefited from housing prices . On a national \nbasis, prices are close to where they were prior to the crisis. The supply of homes remains \nquite limited , relative to the total number  of households, and is the lowest it’s been for \nmore than  40 years.4 This combination of limited inventory , robust job growth and low \ninterest rates  will likely support continued home price appreciation. Those positive \nconditions will remain tempered by other factors weighing on housing. Credit conditions \nremain tighter than before the crisis, and bankers tell me new mortgage application \nprocedures pose some challenges in moving borrowers through the finan cing process.  \nOverall, I view the health of household balance sheets and robust job growth as \nproviding a foundation for consumer spending to continue making steady contributions to \neconomic growth. This should allow G DP growth to continue near 2 percent,  which I \nview as  consistent with the economy’s  long-run potential.   \nWith an unemployment rate of 5.0 percent, the economy is near full employment. \nMeasures of inflation appear to reflect stable prices with upward movement in c ore PCE \ninflation year -over-year (from 1.3  percent  to 1.7  percent  over the past three  months) .  In \nthe interest of objectives to promote long -run sustainable growth with healthy \nemployment and price stability, I believe monetary policy should respond to these \ndevelopments by slowly removing accommodation.  \n \nThe Current Stance of Monetary Policy   \nToday, monetary policy can be viewed as  highly accommodative for three \nreasons. First, the current federal funds target range of between 0.25  percent to 0.5 \n                                                        \n4 Rappaport, Jordan, “ The Limited Supply of Homes,”  Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, The Macro  \nBulletin, March 23, 2016.  \n\n 7 percent  is quite far from the fed funds’ long -run level, which the FOMC views at around \n3.25% . Second, the FOMC has signaled that the fed funds rate will be raised only \ngradual ly. And third, the Fed continues to hold a $4.2 trillion balance sheet , which has \nthe effect of keeping longer -term interest rates low.  \nYears of experience, evidence and rese arch remind us that monetary policy is \nmost effective when used as a counter -cyclical tool . That means providing policy \naccommodation when deteriorating economic conditions threaten price stability and \nemployment. Conversely, it means unwind ing accommodati on as we see economic \nconditions improve . In other words, the Fed should cut rates when the economy stumbles \nor contracts, and raise rates as the economy recovers and grows .  \n \nThe Limits of Monetary Policy  \nWhile monetary policy can be an effective counter -cyclical tool, it is by no means \na counter -structural  tool. That is, monetary policy can work to smooth out some of the \nups and downs in economic activity, but can do little to push the trend rate of growth \nhigher. Any persistent attempts to do so will likely prove futile, as longer -run growth is \ndriven by real factors like population growth, productivity and the accumulation of \ncapital, both human capital from educational attainment and physical capital from \nbusiness investment .  \nThe FOMC  has ackno wledged that economic conditions will likely warrant a \ngradual pace of policy adjustments. I support that approach. A gradual path allows us to \ntake into account various headwinds and risks faced by the economy , and to proceed in a \n\n 8 manner that maintains po licy settings that are —and will continue to be for some time —\nvery accommodative.   \nWhile I view the gradual approach as appropriate, p ostponing the removal of \naccommodation  when the economy is near full employment and inflation is rising toward \nthe 2  percent  target could promote alternative risks that would decrease the likelihood of \nachieving our longer -run objectives. In the long run, a failure to keep interest rate policy \nin line with improving fundamentals can distort the allocation of capital tow ard less \nfruitful —or perhaps excessively risky —endeavors. Within the last two decades we have \nfaced episodes of accelerating equity prices, housing prices and, most recently, \ncommodity prices. Currently, commercial real estate markets, where prices have \ncontinued to drift higher , bear watching . When these types of imbalances tip, the entire \neconomy can face the consequences of their fallout, with some sectors and populations \nmore impacted than others.  My concern for some time has been that extending monetar y \npolicy too far beyond its scope of capability risks undesirable financial, economic and \npolitical distortions.  \nIn the current environment, w aiting to make additional adjustments to monetary \npolicy may seem costless in the face of benign inflation pressur es. Some argue that we \nhave the ability to make more rapid adjustments later if inflation moves higher than \ncurrently projected.  From a technical standpoint, it is true that the Fed has the ability to \nsteer short -term rates and could raise them quickly if needed. But such actions are likely \nto be costly, induc ing financial market volatility and slowing economic activity. \nHistorically, rapid increases in interest rates end poorly, resulting in economic recessions.  \n \n\n 9 Conclusion  \nStaying the course with a gradual path of policy normalization is warranted in my \nview. Removing accommodation i n small doses is consistent with the economy’s \nfundamentals, keeps policy accommodative  while global and domestic risks play out , and \ndoes not preclude pausing or respond ing if downside risks materialize.",

            "content": "The views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers or representatives.  \n  \n \n \n \n \nThe U .S. Outlook and Monetary Policy  \n \n \nEsther L. George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFebruary 2, 2016  \nCentral Exchange  \nKansas City, M o. \n \n\n \n1 \n  \nThank you.  It’s a pleasure to be here at the Central Exchange. The Kansas City Fed has \nhad a long and productive relationship with the Central Exchange  and I always enjoy the \nopportunity to join you .  \nLast week, I participated in the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)  meeting where \nthe Committee decided to hold steady its target interest rate . I supported this decision and , in my \nremarks this afternoon , I will share my views on the economic outlook and monetary policy .  \nBefore we continue, I need to tell you that these comments represent my views and are \nnot necessarily reflective of others in the Federal Reserve System.  \n \nThe U .S. Outlook  \nSince the end of the financial crisis, the U.S. economy has grow n annually by about  2 \npercent and labor markets have made large strides toward healing. As a longer -term comparison, \nwe are now in the fifth -longest expansion in recorded U .S. history. Inflation has also remained \nlow and stable. While  there are always uncertainties about how the economy will perform in the \nfuture, it’s worth reflecting on the past and acknowledging the progress that has been made. \nRight now, I view the economy as being in a good spot, but I will also discuss some risks I am \nkeeping in m ind.   \nTurning first to recent data , economic growth slowed a bit  toward the end of last year , \nthough overall growth in 2015 was not too different than the past few years. Some of the softness \nreflected fewer exports and a modest step -down in the level of business investment in new \nstructures and equipment. Other factors, like inventory adjustments , also lowered the growth \nestimate.  \n\n \n2 \n While a single quarter of slower growth is important to watch, I take reassurance that the \neconomy remains on track due to strong job gains. In fact, j ob gains actually picked up  toward \nthe end of last year.  Looking at longer trends, employment growth has been quite strong over the \npast few years. More jobs were added in both 2014 and 2015 than in any year since the late \n1990s .  \nAt the same time, demographic changes are affect ing the labor market  outlook. For \nexample, U .S. population growth is slowing, which indicates not as many jobs need to be created \nas in the past to absorb new entrants into the labor force . As a result, I expect to see employment \ngrowth slow from its recent  pace and would not interpret a modest slowdown as a sign of trouble \nin the economy.   \nOverall, I see job gains as underpinning stronger consumer demand for goods and \nservices.  Low gasoline prices and signs of faster wage growth should  also add to consumers ’ \nability to increase spending.  And although financial markets have been volatile, household \nwealth remains at  a high level , and house prices have been rising over the past four years.  \nCertainly, the gains in jobs, wages and wealth have not been equally shared across households \nduring the recovery, but overall , the general health  of households’ financial situation s is much \nimproved since  the financial crisis.  \nEven as households  and consumers are doing better, some sectors of the economy are \nfacing headwinds. I mentioned earlier l ow gasoline prices, which o f course reflect low oil prices. \nBecause the energy sector is such an important part of the Kansas City Fed’s region al economy, \nwe monitor these developments closely. We know l ower oil prices benefit consumers, but also \nweigh on oil producers. We have certainly seen energy -intensive states affected. For example, \n\n \n3 \n we are seeing more  people every week filing claims for unemployment insurance in Oklahoma \nthan was the case a few years ago.  \nJust as d evelopments in the energy sector bear watching, so do challenges facing the \nmanufacturing sector. The rise in the foreign exchange value of the U .S. dollar, for example, has \nresulted in lower orders from abroad for many of our exporters. In addition, foreign growth in \nsome parts of the world has been uneven and slowing, which has  affected foreign demand for \nsome U .S. goods. Despite these headwinds , the U.S. economy has proven itself to be resilient to \na wide range of shocks in recent years, including sluggish growth abroad . \nFinally, i nflation has remained muted as a result of l ower oil prices and the strong U.S. \ndollar . Recent movements in each of thes e have been quite large by historical standards. Yet , \ndespite these headwinds, core measures of inflation have recently risen on a year -over-year basis.  \nAnd although inflation rates over the past few years have hovered below  the Fed’s goal of 2  \npercent , they have been positive and broadly consistent with price stability.  \n \nRisks to the Outlook  \nOutlooks are subject to change, and forecasts are imperfect predictions of the future.  As \na result, those , like me , who rely on forecasts,  must think about what could go wrong  and how \nincoming data might affect the outlook for the economy .  Gauging whether a temporary \nslowdown in growth, financial market volatility or foreign developments  is a harbinger of \nweaker growth or a reflection of temporary factors , can be  difficult and often require s assessing \nbroader trends and risks.   \nRight now, I view the U .S. economy as in a generally  good position. However, a few \ndevelopments bear watching. I mentioned the energy sector. We are certainly paying attention to \n\n \n4 \n any spillovers that energy job losses may have on the broader economy. Elevated inventories in \nsome sectors also  pose a risk  to the extent that manufacturing production slow s further to  better \nalign current inventory levels with final sales and shipments o f goods.  Finally, g lobal growth is \ncommonly pointed to as a risk. While I wouldn’t discount recent developments abroad, I also \nnote that many forecasts point to a modestly stronger foreign outlook this year than in 2015.  Still, \nsome emerging markets carry substantial debt, so a crisis in one area can transmit to others. But \ndespite these concerns , the fundamentals of the U.S. economy currently appear strong enough to \nsustain positive growth going forward.  \n \nThe Path for Monetary Policy  \nTurning to monetary po licy, for seven years, the FOMC maintained near-zero interest \nrates and undertook a  series of  large -scale asset purchase program s — a policy stance re sponding \nto a historic financial and economic emergency  in 2008 .  Accordingly, the FOMC’s decision to \nalter that policy stance in December garnered a great deal of attention when the benchmark \ninterest rate was increased by 25 basis point s.  I supported this decision , although I viewed it as a \nlate start to what is likely to be  a gradual  path toward  normalizing interest rates .   \nAfter such a prolonged period of low rates, the FOMC is understandably cautious.  \nMoving rates gradually may avoid unnecessarily jolting the economy or causing excessive \nfinancial market volatility. Even looking at developments so far this year, financial markets have \nbeen quite volatile. While taking a signal from such volatility is warranted, monetary policy \ncannot respond  to every blip in financial markets . Instead, a focus on economic fundamentals, \nsuch as labor markets and inflation, can help guard against monetary policy over - or under -\nreacting to swings in financial conditions . To a great extent , the recent  bout of  volatility is not all \n\n \n5 \n that unexpected, nor necessarily worrisome, given that the Fed’s low interest rate and bond -\nbuying policies focused on boosting asset prices as a means of stimulating the real economy.  As \nasset prices adjust to the shift in monetary policy , it is to be expected that the pricing of risk will \nrealign to this different rate environment . \nOverall, it is important to remember  that e ven after th is first rate hike, monetary policy \nremains  highly accommodative .  Real interest rates continue to be negative and the Federal \nReserve ’s large portfolio of Treasury and mortgage -backed securities  keep s downward pressure \non longer -term rates .  \nIn communicating its intentions for further rate increases, t he Committee has noted that it \nexpects economic conditions will warrant only  gradual increases in the fed funds rate , although \nadjustments ultimately depend on the incoming data .  My own view is that a pickup in economic \ngrowth, steady job gains and modestly higher core rates of inflation will warrant further \nincreases .   \nThe exact timing of each move, however, is subject to the economic environment.   \nBecause  monetary  policy affects the economy with lags , decisions must necessarily rely on \nforeca sts and their associated risks — not waiting until desired objectives are realized.   \nIf we wait for the data to provide complete confirmation before making a policy decision, \nwe may well have waited too long.  Likewise, policy may be faced with altering its trajectory if \nthe economy’s p rogress points to a different outlook.  But in the absence of any substantial shift \nin the outlook, my view is that the Committee should continue the gradual adjustment of moving \nrates higher to keep them aligned with economic activity and inflation. These actions are often \ndifficult, but also necessary to keep growth in line with the economy’s long -run potential and to \nfoster price stability.   \n\n \n6 \n  \nInstitutional Challenges  \nAs the Federal Reserve contemplates the appropriate path of normalizing its monetary \npolicy, it naturally does so with considerable public attention.  One source of this attention \ncomes from Congress itself.  Calls for legislative reforms of the Federal Re serve have persisted \nover the past five years, ranging from its structure and governance to its monetary policy \napproach and decision making.  Additionally, Congress has shown its willingness to tap the \nFederal Reserve to fund fiscal activities ranging fro m new government agencies to highway \nconstruction.   \nI understand that Fed actions during the crisis have raised a number of questions about \nthe institution and its scope. When Congress established the Federal Reserve more than a century \nago, it designed t he institution to be apolitical but with accountability to Congress. This construct \nwas designed to protect the stewards of the nation’s money supply from the vulnerabilities \nassociated with short -term political agendas.  It includes important checks and b alances that are \noften misunderstood, but nonetheless critical to the functioning of the institution.   \nDuring my 33 years at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, the primary focus of \nthousands of dedicated Federal Reserve employees has been the health  of the economy, \nsupported by an efficient and accessible banking and payments system. To the extent that there is \nany doubt in the minds of Congress or the public about this, it is incumbent on the Federal \nReserve to work with Congress in a direct and tra nsparent way until we satisfy any remaining \nquestions about the execution of our mission.  Such dialogue would provide the highest \nprobability for outcomes that best serve the public interest.  \n In that spirit, I look forward to 2016 and the promise it hol ds.",

George  \nPresident  and Chief  Executive  Officer \nFederal  Reserve Bank  of Kansas  City  \n \n \nJuly 2016  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \nThe views  expressed  by the author  are her own and do not necessarily  reflect  those  of the Federal  Reserve  System,  \nits governors,  officers  or representatives.  \n\n1 \n INTRODUCTION   \nThe Fixing America’s Surface Transportation ( FAST ) Act changed the Federal Reserve \nBank stock dividend rate for member banks with as sets of more than $10 billion. The Act also \nplaced a cap of $10 billion on the aggregate surpl us funds of the Federal Reserve  and directed \nthat any exces s be transferred to  the Treasury general fund. The potential policy implications of \nmodifying dividends to member banks, or more generally, the requirement for member banks to \npurchase stock in a regional Federal Reserve Bank , should be studied carefully before altering \nthis long -standing institutional design  of public and private interests serving the American \npublic .   \nIn designing the governance structure more than a century ago, Congress accepted a \ncompromise proposal from President Woodrow Wilson to create a central bank with a combined \npublic and private structure with those roles filled respectively by the Board of Governors of the \nFederal Reserve System and the regional Reserve Banks. In this design, the st ock ownership of \nthe regional Reserve banks is a key component in a central bank design that provides representation for both the public and private interests with each acting as a potential limit on the \ncontrol of the other.  \nThe debate regarding the role of Federal Reserve stock in the Federal Reserve System \nstructure  is not a new one : In 1938, Congressman Wright Patman proposed that the government \nshould take over the Reserve Bank stock, effectively turning the r egional Reserve Banks into full  \ngovernment entities. At the heart of this issue is whether changes that aim to alter the \nprivate/public status of the central bank and potentially nationalize  the 12 regional Federal \nReserve Banks  could undermine the barriers carefully constructed by Congress to protect against \npolitical pressures on Federal Reserve policies .   \nThis analysis  offers historical perspective on these issues, as well as an  assessment of the \neffectiveness of the current governance and structure of the Federal Reserve System.  \n \nA LOOK BACK ON CENTRAL  BANKING IN THE UNITE D STATES  \nA careful reading of Federal Reserve history will find that proposals for increased \ngovernment authority over the Federal Reserve are often raised most pointedly during periods \nwhen government debt is high. Pressure on the Federal Reserve to implement policy supportive \nof government spending dates back almost to the 1913 founding of the Federal Reserve and the \n\n2 \n subservient role the Federal Reserve soon assumed related to government financing demands in \nconnection with World War I. Similar pressure continued during and after World War II. \nEventually, the Federal Reserve’s resistance to continually supporting gover nment spending led \nto a formal accord with the Treasury in 1951.  \nThe list of events that have occurred in these environments is long and includes such \nhigh-profile instances as pressure from President Lyndon Johnson to hold rates low as a means \nof support ing his proposals during the Vietnam War to calls for Federal Reserve Chairman Paul \nVolcker’s resignation during the Federal Reserve System’s successful, but painful, battle against high inflation. Beyond these major events, numerous legislative initiative s have met varying \ndegrees of success over the years but have overa ll led to what Duke University economics \nprofessor Thomas Havrilesky termed the “deterioration of traditional constraints on the political \nmanipulation of monetary policy” since the modern F ederal O pen M arket Committee (FOMC)  \nwas created in 1935.\n1   \n \nThe Failure  of Earlier Central Bank Designs  \nAt the time of the Federal Reserve’s founding, the U nited States  had already witnessed \ntwo unsuccessful attempts at establishing a central bank . Neither was able to outlast their initial \n20-year charter.  \nThere was intense political debate around the creation of both the First Bank of the \nUnited States , in 1791, and its successor, the Second Bank of the United States, in 1816. While \nrecogniz ing the n eed for the stability that a central bank could provide, many Americans with \nvivid memories of the fight to win independence from England were understandably leery of \ncreating another powerful institution. As a result, both the First and Second Banks were the focus of significant public distrust.  Both were h ighly centralized institutions that many Americans \nviewed as too closely aligned with powerful political and financial interests of the Northeast.  In \nthe early 1900s, after a series of financial cris es, a third effort was launched to create a central \nbank with a structure that com bined both government and private interests .  \nCarter Glass, the House sponsor of the Federal Reserve Act and the legislation’s key \nauthor, explained the challenges in a report to the 63\nrd Congress:  \n                                                \n1 T. Havrilesky, “ The Politicization of Monetary Policy: The Vice Chairman as the Administration’s Point Man .” Cato Journal , \nVol. 13, No. 1 (Spring/Summer 1993) . Copyright Cato Institute.  \n\n3 \n “In the United States, with its immense area, numerous natural divisions, still \nmore competing divisions, and abundant outlets to foreign countries, there is no \nargument either of banking theory or expediency which dictates the creati on of a single \ncentral banking institution, no matter how skillfully managed, how carefully controlled or how patriotically conducted.”  \nAs Glass’s comment suggests, the concern about centralization was not something that \ncould be addressed solely by geogra phy or the number of bank facilities. Nor was it simply a \nquestion about adjusting the bank’s ownership structure. While both of those are elements of a \ndecentralized structure, arguably the most important issue —and the glaring weakness of both the \nFirst and Second Bank— was the centralization, or the perceived centralization, of control. \nIndeed, both the First and Second Banks  were geographically diverse with branch offices \nlocated in the important financial centers of their eras. Additionally, both had a combined public/private ownership;  however , the ownership structure utilized in each case was problematic \nfor two key reasons:  the need for profits, and the homogeneity of ownership and centralization of \ncontrol. \n \n• The Risks of a Structure that Requires Profits  \nAlthough the nation’s first two central banks had slight differences, particularly in \ntheir size, they were alike in many key structural ways. In both cases, private investors held \nan 80 percent ownership stake while the government held the remaining 20 percent. Investors \nacquired their shares th rough an initial public offering (IPO) process that was  similar to other \npublic stock offering s. In the case of both banks, the IPO involved the immediate sale of \nsubscriptions, or “scrips,” that were essentially a down payment for a later stock purchase. \nScrip and stock purchases for the First Bank, which required the combined use of specie \n(gold or silver) and U.S. debt securities to complete the transaction, created what is now \nconsidered the nation’s first financial crisis when scrip prices soared on hi gh demand, \ncausing debt markets to become distorted. While this  distortion and the resulting U.S. \nfinancial  crisis was an early indication of one of the many potential risks in a profit -seeking \ncentral bank structure, the era’s more prominent international  example involved the \nprivately -held French central bank , Banque de France, which took actions in the 1880s to \n\n4 \n protect and increase profits —moves that had a negative impact on its effectiveness as a \ncentral bank.     \n \n• The C onsequences of a Homogeneous Leade rship S tructure  \nShares for both the First and Second Banks  were prohibitively expensive for most \nAmericans. Stock in the First Bank, for example, was initially offered at $400 per share ( the \nequivalent of about $10,000 in 2016 after accounting for inflation ). Stock in the Second Bank \nwas still pricey at about a quarter of that cost. As a result, U.S. central bank ownership was \nvested primarily in the hands of wealthy and powerful individuals (including —perhaps \nunexpectedly —a number of foreign invest ors). Similarly, the majority of the directors of the \nFirst and Second Banks  were elected from the ranks of the politically and financially \npowerful, including some members of Congress, who lived in and did business in the \nnation’s power centers. The lack of diversity of central bank leadership was a major criticism, especially from those living outside of the East Coast.   \n \nThe C ombination of Public and Private Components: Checks and Balances  \nEconomic historians sometimes note that the fundamental issue about a U.S. central bank \ncorrelates with the fundamental issue dividing America’s two chief political ideologies: the role \nof government versus the role of the private sector.  \nAt the time of the Fed eral Reserve’s founding, most of the world’s other centr al banks \nwere privately held institutions. In the United States , the Federal Reserve ’s congressional \ncreators recognized that a private structure would not work and instead devised a structure with checks and balances between the private sector and the gov ernment.\n2 \nBalancing  government authority over the central bank was  not solely about placating \npolitical ideologies that preferred  limited government. The primary motivation was to avoid the \nuse of monetary policy and inflation as the means of financing government debt. Related to this  \nconcern , of course, wa s the risk of Federal Reserve policy manipulation for political gain.  \n                                                \n2 T. Todd, The Balance of Power: The Political Fight for an Independent Central Bank, 1790 -Present , Federal R eserve Bank of \nKansas City, 2009 . \n\n5 \n To address concerns about national debt funding, the Federal Reserve Act expressly \nprohibited the direct financing of the Treasury. However, since  the Fed eral Reserve’s founding, \npolitical pressure to ease monetary policy  has surfaced .3  \nTo mitigate this  political pressure, the Fed eral Reserve’s creators made the Reserve \nBanks private entities  under the supervision and control of a board of directors with authority to \nperform all duties usually pertaining to directors of a banking association. This includes the \nappointment of the president and first vice president (directors affiliated with supervised entities \nare no longer involved in this process) , appointment of officers, prescribing by -laws, and \ndesignat ing a representative for the FOMC. As initially designed, the Reserve Banks were far \nmore autonomous  than they are today . While the Fed eral Reserve System ’s government \ncomponent has always been responsible for Reserve Bank  oversight, the Federal Reserve ’s key \nfunctions, including monetary policy, were under the purview of the Reserve Banks during the System ’s early history. Over time, the monetary policy function has become balanced between \nthe private and public components  with the Board of Governors holding the majority votes.  T he \nFOMC co nsists of 12 members :  seven members of the Board of Governors  and five Reserve \nBank presidents .   \n \nPrivate Sector Involvement  \nWhile private sector involvement through a network of separate and distinct  Reserve \nBanks located across the country expanded  leadership diversity  and help ed balance government \nauthority, on the surface it present ed another problem: how to engage the private sector while \npreventing risks associated with a pure -profit motivation. This aspect was addressed by putting \nrestrictions  on Reserve Bank stock  and establishing the Board of Governors ’ authority for \noversight of  the Reserve Banks . \nWhile  law requires stock ownership in Federal Reserve Banks as a condition of a \ncommercial bank’s membership in the Federal Reserve System , this stock is not like stock \navailable on public markets . It may not be sold, traded or pledged as security for a loan. It does \npay a dividend rate that is established by statute and, as a result, cannot be manipulated through \nthe use of Fed eral Reserve policy tools or otherwise. This design provides the Fed eral Reserve \n                                                \n3 T. Todd, Under Pressure: Politics and The Federal Reserve During the 1990 -1991 Recession , Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas \nCity, 2011 . \n\n6 \n System  with private ownership over the Reserve Banks, but without the profit motivation that \ncan distort policy.  \nStock ownership allows member banks to nominate and elect Class A and B directors  to a \nReserve Bank’s Board of Directors .  However, unlike traditional corporations which grant one \nvote per share, the Federal Reserve Act provides for class voting wherein each member bank \nreceives one vote as a member of one of three designated classes based on the t otal amount of \ncapital, surplus  and retained earnings of the member bank. There are further limitations on voting \nas each class elects only one Class A and one Class B director.    \nIn addition to these restrictions on Reserve Bank stock, the B oard of Governors plays an \nimportant oversight role , including its authority to:  \n• Examine at its discretion the account s, books  and affairs of each Reserve Bank ; \n• Suspend or remove any officer or director of a Reserve Bank ; \n• Order an annual independent audit of the financial statements of each Reserve \nBank ; \n• Approve compensation provided by Reserve Banks to dir ectors, officers, and \nemployees;  \n• Approve the president and first vice president appointed by the Reserve Bank \nClass B and C directors ; and  \n• Appoint three of the nine Reserve Bank directors, including the  Reserve Bank’s  \nchair and deputy chair . \n \nMEMBER BANKS  HELP RESERVE BANKS F ULFIL L THEIR MISSION  \nStockholders of the Federal Reserve System, also referred to as members, have some \nrights and obligations simila r to traditional corporate stockholders  in that they provide capital to \nthe Federal Reserve Banks , which are federally -chartered corporations . All national banks along \nwith state -chartered banks that choose the Federal Reserve as the bank’s primary federal \nregulator  are required to purchase Federal Reserve stock . By purchasing stock, members are \nentitled to a dividend fixed by statute as well as a role in Reserve Bank governance .4 Members \n                                                \n4 The dividend rate was set to 6 percent in the original 1913 Federal Reserve Act to provide a rate of return comparable  to \nalternative risky investments and to attract sta te-chartered banks as members. Investing in the Federal Reserve in 1913 was not \nrisk-free given that the previous two central banks in the United States had not survived and the short -term ability to pay a steady \ndividend was unclear. Today, however, Federal Reserve stock is essentially a risk -free perpetual bond as long as a bank chooses  \n\n7 \n are therefore  invested in the Reserve Banks’ and Federal Reserve System’s success and are \nintegral to the Federal Reserve’s mission. Member banks must buy stock in the Federal Reserve \nBank equal to 6 percent of the bank’s capital, 3 percent of which is held at the regional Reserve \nBanks . The other 3 percent is callable by the Bank in certain circumstances. Paid -in capital from \nmember banks was the initial funding mechanism for the Federal Reserve Banks, and the 3 percent on call remains available in the event it is needed by the Reserve Banks.  \n \nRole of M ember Banks  in Governance of Reserve Bank Activities  \nStockholding member banks elect  a portion of the Reserve Banks’ director seats,5 are \ncore to Reserve Bank corporate governance  and provide critical industry information and \nperspective on economic and banking conditions . At the same time, the structure includes shared \noversight with the politically appointed Board of Governors that prevents members from having undue influence on Federal Reserve System activities.  \nThe Federal Reserve Act states that every Reserve Bank “shall be conducted under the \nsupervision and control of a board of directors ,” and provides that t he nine director positions of \nthe Reserve Bank’s board of directors are filled through two met hods: election and appointment \n(12 U.S.C. 301). Only three of the nine directors on a Reserve Bank’ s board may be officers, \n                                                                                                                                                       \nto remain a member. While the dividend remained unchanged for over a century, analysis by the Bipartisan Policy Center found \nit was similar to the average return on the 10 -year U.S. Treasury note over that period (A. Klein, K. Readling, O. Weiss, A. Woff; \n“Federal Reserve Dividends Should Not Be a Piggy Bank for Congress .” Bipartisan Policy Center, 2015). The Fixing America’s \nSurface Transportation Act, 129 Sat. 1312 (“FAST Act”), effective Jan . 1, 2016, changed the dividend for stockholder banks with \nmore tha n $10 billion in total con solidated assets from a fixed 6 percent rate to a di vidend equal to the lesser of 6 percent  or the \nrate equal to the high yield of the 10-year Treasury note auctioned at the last auction held prior to the payment of the dividend.  \nThe 10-year Treasury bond rate is seen by some as a reasonable alternative because it is the benchmark risk -free rate used for \nmost long -term , fixed -rate investments and has a long history of continual issuance. The 30-year Treasury rate might also be an \noption because it is the longest maturity Treasury rate, but there is a risk that the Treasury could decide to stop issuing i t at some \npoint as it did from late 2001 to early 2006.   \n If a market rate is used as a reference rate, it should not be capped at  6 percent as it currently is for member banks with more than \n$10 billion in assets . Using a market rate only when it is below a threshold is economically inconsistent with the notion of tying \nreturns to the market, and it is inequitable to penalize member  banks when r ates rise above the threshold. In addition, changing \nthe dividend has raised questions about the appearance of\n breaking an agreement with members. The American Bankers \nAssociation asserts that the FAST Act’s dividend rate change amounts to an unconstitutional taking of member banks’ property \nwithout compensation.  See Letter dated April 28, 2016 from Rob Nichols, president and CEO of the American Bankers \nAssociation, to Robert de V. Frierson, secretary, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Attachment B).  An \nalternative would be to allow current members to retain the 6 percent dividend or elect the 10 -year Treasury rate and issue a new \nclass of stock for new members with the dividend tied to the 10-year Treasury rate.  \n \n5 Class A and B  directors are nominated and elected by member banks within their respective Federal Reserve District. Unlike \ntraditional corporations , which grant one vote per share, the Federal Reserve Act provides for class voting wherein each member , \nregardless of shares,  receives one vote as a member of one of three classes . The classes are designated based on the t otal amount \nof capital, surplus  and retained earnings of the member bank  within the class . Not every class votes each year, and each group \nwithin the class elects one Class A and one Class B director.    \n\n8 \n direct ors or employees of a bank. Those directors (Class A) are cho sen to represent member \nbanks. The remaining six directors (Class B and Class C) cannot be bankers, and are chosen to \nrepresent the public with “due but not exclusi ve regard to agriculture, commerce, industry, \nservices, labor and consumers” ( 12 U.S.C. 302). While member banks nominate and elect the \nClass A and Class B directors, this Reserve Bank’s staff plays an important role in considering \nrepresentation from local and regional organizations to identify  qualified candidates. Likewise, \nClass C directors are identified b y Reserve Bank leadership with appoint ment  by the Board of \nGovernors. The chair and vice c hair of the Reserve Bank board of directors must be selecte d \nfrom the Board of Governor s-appointed Class C directors. Reserve Bank directors come from \ndiverse backgrounds in the region and across industries . They m ust comply with legal \nrequirements and rules related to their eligibility and conduct.  \n \nBenefits of Banker  Directors  \nReserve Bank s are nationally chartered banks that serve as the operating arms of the \ncentral bank.  They function much like a banker’s bank or a clearing house. As such, banker directors ’ knowledge  of the payments system  complements the Reserve Bank s’ operational role \nin providing financial services to the industry . Indeed, corporate best practices recognize that \n“the key to effective board composition is ensuring that the people gathered around the board \ntable can leverage their experience to contribute in meaningful ways, to understand the issues, \nask the right questions, demand the right information, and make the best possible decisions.”\n6  \nClass A directors bring informed views related to banking, as well as to the industries of their \ncustomers, and act as consolidators of information. For instance, a banker director can provide \ndetails about lending trends , stresses in the financial system,  and other banking metrics, in \naddition to sharing insights into farming, commercial real estate, h ousing  and the auto industry. \nTheir reports at Reserve Bank board meetings offer input to economic analysis used by Res erve \nBank presidents  for monetary policy . \n \nLimitations  to Banker Influence  \nWhile Reserve Bank directors have important oversight responsibilities for the operation \nof their respective Reserve Bank, they have no involvement in the Federal Reserve’s supervision \n                                                \n6 D. Nadler, B. Behan, and M. Nadler, Building Better Boards  (Jossey -Bass 2006).   \n\n9 \n of depository institutions . By law, the Board of Governors of the Feder al Reserve System is \nresponsible for the supervision and regulation of banks , and any information or discussion \nrelated to supervisory issues is conducted directly between a regional Reserve Bank’s staff and \nthe Board of Governors . In addition, any supervi sory matter regarding a Class A director’s bank \nis handled by  the Board of Governors.  \nReserve Banks may not provide confidential supervisory information to any director ( 12 \nC.F.R. 261.2). Moreover, Reserve Bank directors may not participate in bank supervisory matters and may not be consulted regarding bank examination ratings, potential enforcement \nactions, application/approval matters, or similar supervisory matters. In regard to the Reserve \nBanks’ lending activity involving financial institutions, direc tors receive only aggregate \ninformation about loans extended  to ensure adequate knowledge of the Reserve Bank’s balance \nsheet per their oversight responsibilities.  Finally, i f a banker director wants to convert his or her \nbank to Federal Reserve membership or take any other actions that would involve Federal Reserve regulatory approval, the Board of Governors in Washington must act on the application \nwithout  Reserve Bank  invol vement .  \n \nStatutory and Policy Restraints  \nThe directors representing member banks are subject to other  restraints by statute and \nthrough System policy. As noted above , only Class B and Class C directors appoint, subject to \napproval by the Board of Governors, the Reserve Bank president and first vice pr esident. Class A \ndirectors are excluded from that process to eliminate the perception that they have a rol e in \nchoosing their regulator. Class A directors also are prohibited from participatin g in the selection, \nappointment  or compensation of Reserve Bank officers whose primary duties involve \nsupervision of banks for the same reason.   \nAll directors  are subject to the Guide to Conduct for Directors of Federal Reserve Banks \nand Branches , a policy implemented to ensure adherence to high ethical standards of conduct, \nand avoid actions that might impair the effectiveness of Federal Reserve System operations or in \nany way discredit  the reputation of the System. The policy details procedures when directors are \ninvolved in procurements as a means to avoid any actual or apparent conflicts of interest.  Further, while the policy allows for w aivers, it indicates waivers  are both highly unlikely and \n\n10 \n strongly discouraged except under the most exigent and extraordinary circumstances. This \nReserve Bank has never sought a waiver for a director.  \n CONCLUSION \nAltering the current structure and c haracter of the Federal Reserve System risks \ndiminishing the effectiveness of its o perations . \nFor more than a century, the structural design of the Federal Reserve System has \nfunctioned well in carrying out its mandates from Congress. It is possible that Reserve Banks \ncould operate as separate corporate entities without stock ownership, but altering the central banks ’ current design creates the potential to diminish its effectiveness.   \n• The private nature of the Reserve Banks through stock issuance to member banks \nprovides balance to the public  nature of the Board of Governors.  The public’s trust \nand confidence is enhanced by this “balance of power .”  \n• Requiring stock purchases through capital investment creates incentives for member \nbanks to s upport  success ful outcomes for the Reserve Banks .   \n• Rather than a Washington -centric voice for the Federal Reserve System, the \nstructure of 12 separate Reserve Banks encourages strong and varied perspectives \nfrom across the country as the System fulfill s its mission.   \n• The structure of the Reserve Banks as separate corporate entities allows private \ncitizens  from communities across the country to have input into national economic \npolicy.   \n• The current decentralized structure insulates the Federal Reserve System from certain political p ressures, as the Reserve Bank presidents are not political \nappointments, but instead chosen by Class B and Class C directors, with appr oval \nby the Board of Governors. \n \nNationalizing the Reserve Banks, and thereby making them essentially field offices of the \nBoard of Governors , would dramatically alter these defining characteristics.",

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMay 12, 2016  \nBusiness and Community Leaders Luncheon  \nAlbuquerque, N.M.  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve \nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.  \n  \n\n1 \n I’m pleased to be in Albuquerque  with our Kansas City and Denver office boards \nof directors.   \n As a regional Federal Reserve Bank president, I gain important insights about the \nregional and national economy from visits like this one , where I have the opportunity to \nmeet with b usiness and community leaders. Their perspectives and concerns, combined \nwith economic data and analysis, help shape my own views on monetary policy.   \n In my remarks today, I’ll talk about the economic issues we see  in New Mexico \nand the nation. I’ll also note the current stance of interest rate policy, and why, as a \nvoting member of the Federal Open Market Committee  this year, I have argued that \ninterest rates should gradually return to more normal levels.  Before I continue, however, I \nwant to note that these are my own views and are not necessarily representative of others \nin the Federal Reserve System.  \n \nThe New Mexico Economy  \nNew Mexico has stru ggled to recover from the  recession  that ended nearly seven \nyears ago . Although employment has increased , the gains have been modest and  held \nback by several factors . First, the cons truction sector was slow to bounce back after the \nsevere downturn in the housing sector. The crisis left the state with high inventory  levels  \nand sharply lower prices. Then, austerity measures at the federal government level led to \ncutbacks that were sharp ly felt here . As neighboring states recovered  more quickly , New \nMexico saw workers move out of the state , exacerbating its challenges.  \nOver the past year, new concerns have emerged and growth has slowed once \nagain. Parts of the state that had been doing quite well are now facing sharp declines in \n\n2 \n activity due to weakness in the energy and agriculture sectors. Employment in the energy \nsector has declined 26 percent in New Mexico over the past year, and weakness is \nstarting to spread to related industries, with the transportation and wholesale trade sectors \nalso reporting employment losses. The drop in energy activity is also starting to wei gh on \nstate and local finances, which can lead to government spending cuts that can further \nweigh on  employment.  \nAt the same time, there are other sectors and areas of the state that are doing \nbetter . Employment growth in Albuquerque recently reached its fastest pace since mid -\n2013, and outside of energy and agriculture -dependent areas, it appears that the recovery \nis accelerating. Home inventor y levels have dropped significantly in the metro area, home \nprices have stabilized, and residential construction activity is finally picking up. The \nhealthcare sector  also continues to expand and tourism activity has picked up over the \npast couple of years. Yesterday, I had the opportunity to visit the Sandia Peak Tramway \nand the Anderson Abruzzo International Balloo n Museum with our Kansas City and \nDenver Branch Board s of Directors. We heard about the robustness of the tourism \nindustry in the state and the wonderful Balloon Fiesta that takes place here each fall. \nThen, this morning , we heard about another growing sec tor in the New Mexico economy \n—entrepreneurship.  \nOverall, h ealthcare, tourism, construction and entrepreneurship are po ised to drive \ngrowth in the Albuquerque area, though softness in  the energy, agriculture, and state and \nlocal government sectors  will li kely remain for some time .   \n \n \n\n3 \n The U .S. Economic Outlook  \n You may ask how the economic developments facing New Mexico fit into the \nlarger regional , as well as  national , picture. Throughout the Tenth  Federal Reserve \nDistrict, which covers  seven states, the fall in commodity prices ha s been a major \neconomic shock. While t he rece nt increase in the price of some  commodities offers a bit \nof relief, there is little doubt that lower prices will require some major adjustments. For \nexample, energy production will li kely continue to decline and workers in the sector will \nneed to look to other industries that are doing better, such as construction. In addition, the \nmanufacturing and export sectors have been contracting, reflecting both the decline in \nenergy activity an d the strong dollar.  \nEven as these sectors of our economy  face strains, other aspects of the regional \nand national economy show more robust growth. In fact, t he U.S. economy has proven \nitself to be quite resilient in recent years , and I expect the moderat e pace of growth \nexperienced during this recovery will continue. Granted, the economy is subject to some \nshort -term ups and downs . We saw GDP growth was rather weak during the first quarter, \nbut the growth rate over the past year is near 2 percent —a pace that is close to the \naverage during this recovery. More importantly, employment growth has remained \nstrong . The economy has added close  to 200,000 jobs on average each month  this year.  \nThe longer -term pace of job growth has also been quite robust . As a result, the \nunemployment rate currently stands at about 5  percent , compared to 10  percent  after the \nfinancial crisis in 2009 .  Of course, t he unemployment rate is an imperfect measure of the \nlabor market, so I also pay close attention to other data. For example, o ne development I \nfind promising is that many individuals who had dropped out of the workforce are finding \n\n4 \n jobs. After the crisis, the percentage of people participating in the labor market fell \nsharply. Some of this is because our population is aging, so people naturally work less as \nthey get older. However, some of the decline in labor force participation was due to \nworkers being discouraged about their job prospects. More recently , however, we have \nseen an upswing in people finding jobs who had previously stopped looking for one. For \nexample, close to 2 million workers return ed to the labor force over the past six months . \nThis pace of re -entry is close to the fastest pace in more th an 15 years.  \nDespite these positive developments,  wage growth has remained sluggish  and \nmany people still feel like they have limited options in the labor market.  That being the \ncase, let me spend some time on the labor market.  \n \nLabor Market Trends From Tw o Perspectives  \n As I travel around my region to meet with business, community, and labor \nleaders, I often hear the m describe the job market from two very different perspectives. \nOne perspective is of a booming labor market, rising wages and an abundance of \nopportunity. The other perspective is of stagnant wage growth, limited upward mobility \nand job insecurity.  \n How can these different views be reconciled? Looking at  general labor market \ndata, we have seen a steady improvement in employment over the past seven  years. In \nfact, 14 million net new jobs ha ve been created since the crisis . Along with an \nunemployment rate that is cur rently near normal , the economy appears to be close to full \nemployment. As a result , many business leaders  often discuss the challenge of  hiring \nworkers with the right skill s and say that numerous job openings remain unfilled. In fact , \n\n5 \n there are currently around 5. 8 million job openings in the U nited States,  which is near the \nhighest level on record. I often hear about the need to raise wages rapidly to retain these \nworkers, and as a result, the national data showing slow wage growth doesn’t ring true to \nmany business leaders.  But while this aspect of job growth looks  pretty good, there are \nunderlying trends that suggest that the recovery has not been evenly spread across all \ntypes of workers.  \nThe other perspective on labor market developments reflects a trend that has been \npresent over the past three decades. In particular,  the share of workers in middle -skill jobs \nhas fallen sharply. For decades, these jobs were the bedrock professions of the middle \nclass . If we look back to the 1980s, examples of middle -skill jobs that were much more \nprevalent than today include assembly -line manufacturing jobs , clerical and \nadministrative position s.  \nThe steady d ecline in these types of jobs is not a new story. However, demand for \nboth higher -skilled and lower -skilled workers is growing  faster  relative  to middle -skilled \nworkers . This employment phenomenon is called “job polarization.”  In 1983 , nearly 60 \npercent of all jobs wer e in middle -skill occupations. By 2016, that sha re has declined to \n44 percent. By current employ ment levels, this would be equivalent to a shift of 22 \nmillion jobs away from middle -skill occupations toward both high - and low -skill \noccupations.     \nThe decline in middle -skill jobs is the result of  a number of sweeping changes \naffecting the economy. With the adoption of computers and advanced technologies, \nbusinesses have fundamentally changed the way they operate and the types of workers \n\n6 \n that they require. At the same time , the rapid increase in globalization has provided new \nopportunities for some c ompanies , while increasing competition for others .  \nManufacturing , for instance , is a sector that has historically demanded a large \nnumber of middle -skilled jobs . However , both global forces and technological advances  \nhave had a profound effect on manufact uring employment . Today , fewer than 10 percent \nof workers in the U nited States  are employed in the manufacturing sector  compared to \nmore than 20 percent in 1980.  These trends are unlikely to reverse , and continued \ntechnological innovations will likely broaden their reach into both higher - and lower -\nskilled jobs.  \nThe dramatic shifts tied to job polarization offer some expla nation as to  why \nmany people feel that their economic prospects haven’t improved . On average, salaries \nfor middle -skill jobs are close to the m edian income for all workers.  As opportunities for \nworking in a middle -skill job, and thus a middle -class lifestyle, have dwindled, workers \nhave increasingly been faced with a choi ce between two distinct paths. For workers who \nacquire  the education and training required for high -skill jobs, they have the opportunity \nto pursue employment in jobs that typically pay 50 percen t more than the median salary. \nBut for those workers who do n ot have the needed training and skills, their options are \nincreasingly shifting toward low -skill jobs that typically pay 50 percent below the median \nsalary.  \nUnderstanding t hese trends helps to reconcile the two versions of the la bor market \nI described earl ier. Busine ss leaders trying to develop  new businesses and technologies \nrequire high -skilled workers, which remain in short supply . Alternatively, the m illions of \n\n7 \n other workers in traditional middle -skill occupations  may not have the option of spending \nmonths, or years, to update their skills . These workers  face insecurity  about their career .  \n \nThe Role of Monetary Policy  \n As the Federal Reserve considers these and other economic trends , it must weigh \na number of crosscurrents  to determine the appropriate interest rate policy . In the short -\nrun, I continue to monitor how the energy, agricultural and manufacturing sectors are \nadjusting relative to the national economy. And o ver the longer -run, I evaluate what \ntrends like job pola rization mean for monetary policy. These are challenging questions \nwith no easy answers.  For the most part,  monetary policy is limited in the support it can \noffer any particular sector. It is also limited in its ability to affect trends like job \npolarizati on.  \nInstead, monetary policy has the broad goals of promoting stable prices, full \nemployment, and moderate long -term interest rates . Since the crisis, conditions have \nimproved sufficiently that the  FOMC  deemed it appropriate to raise the  target range for \nthe federal funds rate by 25 basis points  last December. This was a significant step, as it \nwas the first increase in short -term interest rates sinc e the middle of 2006. No further \nadjustments have occurred this year, as the FOMC  weighs e conomic developments and \nmonitors risks to the outlook . The current setting for the federal funds rate is well below \nwhat the FOMC  expects will prevail in the longer  term. T he plan is to move gradually \nand in a way that is responsive to economic developmen ts.  \nI support a gradual adjust ment  of short -term interest rates toward a more normal \nlevel , but I view the current level as too low for today’s economic conditions.  The \n\n8 \n economy is at or near full employment and inflation is close to  the FOMC’s target of 2  \npercent , yet short -term interest rates remain near historic lows. Just as raising rates too \nquickly can slow the economy and push inflation to undesirably low levels, keeping rates \ntoo low can also create risks. Interest -sensitive sectors can take on too much debt in \nresponse to low rates and grow quickly, then unwind in ways that are disruptive. We \nwitnessed this during both the housing crisis and the current adjustments in the energy \nsector.  Because monetary policy has a  powerful effect on financial conditions, it can give \nrise to imbalances  or capital misallocation  that negatively affect s longer -run growth . \nAccordingly , I favor taking additional steps in the normalization process.  \nMoving rates to a more -normal level and at a gradual pace  is necessary to \nminimize distortions in the economy that can build over many years when rates are held \nso low. With gradual adjustments, the F ederal Reserve  is more likely in my view  to \nachieve its long -run goals and by doing so, foster conditions for steady growth that \nbenefit both New Mexico and the nation.",

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNovember 18 , 2016  \nOil and the Economy: Adapting to a New Reality  \nA Joint Conference of the Federal Reserve Banks of Dallas and Kansas City  \nHouston, Texas  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Feder al Reserve \nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.  \n \n\n1 \n Thank you . I am pleased to join Rob Kaplan for this conference co-sponsored by the \nDallas and Kansas City Federal Reserve Banks.  The oil and gas sector features prominently in \nthe economies of our respective regions, making the focus of this conference “Adapting to a New \nReality” highly relevant to our work as policymakers . \nUnderstanding the dynamics of this market  is critical.  As such, we have long studied \ntrends in the sector  and how they affect economic and banking c ondition s.  As the shale boom \nintensified this decade , and the  oil and gas industry grew to its largest share of regional econom ic \nactivity since the early 1980s, we have devot ed more resources to understanding th is important \naspect of the regional , nation al and global economy .   Additionally, and importantly, we rely on \nbusiness contacts – nearly 80  percent of the energy companies in the Fortune 1000 are located in \nour two Federal Reserve Districts .  Some of these  companies are represented in our surveys, \nparticipate in roundtables and serve as directors on our boards  of directors .  This k ey input is \nessential to our understanding of the broader economy and an important contribution to our \npolicy deliberations.  \nIn my remarks this morning, I’ll talk about how regional insight feed s into policymakers ’ \nunderstanding of the national economy.  I’ll also offer my perspective on the outlook for the U .S. \neconomy and the current stance of monetary policy.   \nThese are my view s – not Rob’s , nor others within the Federal Reserve System .   \n \nInsights from Fed Regional Surveys  \nThe Federal Reserve ’s Beige Book provides  the public and Fed policymakers  with \nregional views on the economy eight times a year.  In addition,  as it pertains to energy,  the \nFederal Reserve Banks  of Dallas and Kansas City  conduct quarterly surveys of oil and gas firms  \n\n2 \n headquartered in our Districts .  The survey s gather  information on current business  activity, \ncapital spending plans , employment, price expectations , and other key indicators.   The most \nrecent results, for the third quarter of 2016, were somewhat encouraging , showing an expansion \nof business activity  and expectations for increased capital spending , but still slight reductions in \nemployment.  \nA particularly useful piece of information has been the price  of oil  that firms tell us they \nneed to be  profitable and also what prices they need to  substantially  increase drilling  activity .  \nWe’ve asked question s along these lines  in the Kansas City survey  since 2014.  At that time, the \naverage price needed to be profitable was $79/barrel.  Since then, with reductions in services \ncosts , as well as  advancements in technology and productivity , firms’ average profitab le price \nhas fallen by a third , to $53/barrel in third quarter  2016.  That price is still slightly higher than \nrecently prevailing prices, but not considerably so.  With the most recent range of profitable \nprices reported by firms ranging from $40 to $7 5/barrel , drilling is now profitable for some \ncompanies in some places, which is evident in the recent uptick in rig counts.   \nBut what will it take to substantially  increase drilling activity?  The most recent  \nresponse s to the Kansas City Fed survey noted  $64/barrel on average , and for the Dallas Fed \nsurvey it was $60/barrel, bo th well above recent oil prices , although  some firms reported needing \nonly $50/barrel to sizably increase drilling .  We also asked firms in the Kansas City District \nabout the prices needed to significantly increase natural gas drilling , and  the results were \nsimilar ly above current levels .  Firms on average needed $3. 65/mbtu, considerably  higher than \nrecent prices, although some firms did say they could significantly increase drilling for  as low as \n$3.00 /mbtu.  Taken together, these results suggest increased drilling activity  is likely to be \nrelatively moderate until prices reach a nd sustain a  higher level.  \n\n3 \n Another key source of information about the energy sector  comes from insights  provided \ndirectly by  oil and gas executives , as I mentioned earlier .   Both Reserve Banks have energy \nexecutives on our Boards of Directors , several of whom are with us today.  In addition to their \nbroad oversight of R eserve Bank operations, t heir specific knowledge of key aspects of the \nenergy sector , including  the real activity and the financial perspective , provides us with greater \ninsights than we are able to gather from our surveys.  We also regularly host individual meetings \nand roundtable discussions with oil and gas executives . Our ability to directly and immediately \ninteract with this important sector of the global economy is one example of the role regional \nFederal Reserve Banks play in monitoring current economic activity and understanding \nexpectations for future activity. This type of insight is an especially important contribution to the \nFederal Reserve’s policy deliberations and our understanding of the individual components that \ninfluence the broad  economy .  \n \nThe E nergy Sector and  Broader E conomic Activity  \nTurning to the broad economy,  even though oil prices have risen from the lows we saw \nearlier this year , they are still considerably  below their mid -2014 peak.  Not surprisingly, given \nthe important role of the energy sector  in this part of the country, the decline  in oil prices had a  \nnegative effect on economic activity  from a regional perspective .   \nWhat is surprising, though, is that the decline in oil prices did not provide a significant  \nboost to the national economy. Although declining oil prices  did support  consumer spending and \nsectors that are heavily reliant on energy , some researchers have concluded these  benefit s may \nhave been offset by a reduction in investment and employment in the energy sector .    \n\n4 \n In general, the positive and negative effects appear to be largely offsetting, which has \noften not been the case in years past. One obvious reason for the difference is that the size of the \nenergy sector has increased significantly, s o a decline in activity is large enough  today  to be \nnotable on a national scale. In early 2014, the U.S. mining sector, comprised primarily of oil and \ngas, accounted for 2. 8 percent of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP), up from less than 1 percent \nin the l ate 1990s.  By early 2016, it had shrunk by about  half, to 1.2 percent of GDP . In terms of \nemployment, over 150,000  generally high -paying jobs have been lost in the U.S. oil and gas  \nsector since the fall of 2014, a decline of nearly 30  percent. There also have been thousands of \nassociated job losses in manufacturing, transportation, and other related sectors in energy -\nintensive areas of the country.  \nOn the demand side, it  is possible that  the benefits from lower oil prices are now  small er. \nFor example,  gasoline as a share of total consumption , has fa llen from about 4 percent in 1986 to \nabout 2 ¼ percent in 2015.  On net, today it does seem to be the case that the direct effects of oil \nprice swings are larger on the investment  and employm ent side, but  smaller on the consumer \nside. \nLooking forward, I continue to expect developments in the energy sector  to affect the \neconomic outlook.  If energy prices were to increase , then I would expect that new drilling \nactivities will expand, and the additional oil rigs will contribute to overall investment in \nstructures. While I now view business investment as being poised to make a modest contribution \nto growth over the medium -term, a potential retreat in energy prices  poses a downside risk. This \ncould occur if the OPEC deal expected at the end of the month does not materialize . \nIn terms of oil prices, I currently see the potential for new drilling activities within the \nU.S., as well as the potential to bring idle wells back online, which would alter the path of oil \n\n5 \n prices going forward. With a large amount of oil pr oduction ready to come online if prices were \nto advance through the mid -$50 range, I do not see as much room for price appreciation, \nespecially as global economic growth continues at a mode rate pace.   Among the anecdotes we’ve \nheard from directors and other executives this year is that there is a considerable amount of \n“money on the sidelines” looking to invest in oil and gas opportunities if prices continue to \nstabilize. This is despite som e of the profitability concerns that I noted  earlier , and may be \nreflective of a general “reach for yield” among investors, something we continue to monitor.  \n \nU.S. Economic Outlook  \nTurning to the national economic outlook , I continue to expect a moderate pace of \ngrowth, supported by consumer spending and stable business fixed investment. Consumers \ngenerally remain confident about the economy , and g oing forward, I expect continued job gains \nand increases in wages to support co nsumer spending . Overall, the labor market is near full \nemployment , and inflation is approaching the Federal Reserve’s 2  percent target . \nIndeed, over the past year we have seen a fast pace of growth in labor utilization that \nremoved a substantial amount of  labor market slack. For example, the U.S. economy added more \nthan 3 million people to the labor force since last September, which is the fastest pace of growth \nsince the year 2000. The additional workers joining the labor force in the past 12 months were \naccompanied by payroll growth that averaged 200,000 jobs per month, so that total employment \nhas grown by about 2.5 million jobs on net. With strong growth in the labor force accompanied \nby rapid employment, the jobless rate has remained at 4.9  percent , near my assessment of its \nnatural rate.  \n\n6 \n Although labor utilization has grown rapidly during the last year, the rising labor force \nparticipation rate does not suggest that a previously untapped group of workers has been pulled \nin from the sidelines. In fact,  since a year ago , the number of workers entering the labor force \neach month has remained flat, if not slightly  lower . Also , the number of people leaving the labor \nforce each month has fallen substantially. For example , the trend in the number of workers \nexiting the labor force each month fell from 6. 6 million to 6. 2 million  over the past year . These \ndevelopments indicate that workers are better attached to the labor force – that is, they appear \nless likely to get discour aged by spells of unemployment , and wage growth has encourage d them \nto remain active in the labor market.1  This attachment to the work force is a good sign . \nEven as labor markets have improved at a healthy pace, i nflation has been restrained , in \npart reflecting the downturn in oil prices.  Recently, these effects have begun to diminish.  As oil \nprices stabilized, inflation has increased from 0.2 percent to 1.3 percent over the past year .   \n \nMonetary Policy  \nConsidering  the rise in  the labor force participation  rate, increases in employment, and \nsigns of higher compensation, policymakers must judge what stance of monetary policy will \nsupport the substantial gains achieved in the last year  and keep the economy near its maximum \nsustainable employment level.  Interest rates have remained at historically low levels and the \nFederal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) has signaled a gradual path toward more normal \nsettings.  At its most recent meeting,  the FOMC statement noted that the case for an increase in \nthe federal funds rate has continued to strengthen but decided, for the time being, to wait for \nsome further evidence of continued progress toward its objectives.  \n                                                           \n1 Didem Tuzemen and Jon Willis , “What is Behind the Recent Increase in Labor Force Participation? ” Macro \nBulletin , Nov. 14, 2016 . \n\n7 \n As a voting member of the Committ ee, I dissented in favor of a modest 25 -basis point  \nincrease.  My view is that monetary policy should avoid deliberately stoking the risks that come \nwith overheating the U.S. economy and instead, slowly raise the federal funds rate to promote \nmaximum emplo yment commensurate with the economy’s long -run potential to increase \nproduction.     \nSupporting conditions that bring more people into the workforce is certainly a desirable \nobjective.  However,  over the last 55 years, there have been occasions where the u nemployment \nrate has fallen below a  level that is consistent with the maximum  sustainable level  of \nemployment.  In these cases,  the U.S. economy soon after faced a period of substantial and \nprolonged increases in unemployment. The effect of allowing the eco nomy to overheat  in these \ncases  produced short -term gains, but ultimately with longer -term costs.   Consequently, I see \nmoving sooner, rather than later, as taking into account the long and variable lags with which \nmonetary policy operates, and reduces the potential for “go -stop” types of policies that create \nvolatility, rather than subdue it.  \n \nClosing  \nDecisions about monetary policy, of course, ultimately depend on how the U.S. and \nglobal economies unfold.  Understanding the effects of lower oil prices  is critical in this regard , \nand I look forward to the important insights and perspectives  to be explored at today’s \nconference.",

I am pleased  to be with you today  to discuss the work of our \npayments coalition to improve the  speed, efficiency and security  of the U.S. payment  \nsystem .  \nWhen we began this work nearly two years ago, we understood it would be  \nchallenging . We set forth  ambitious outcomes that called for  a new and different \nenvironment  in which payments  could be made on mobile platforms, on any day , in real \ntime, and with the certainty that  the high est level of security would  protect both the \nsender and the recipient in the transaction . We also understood the  need to act \ndeliberately, but on  an aggressive schedule , because we saw countries around the world \nmoving swiftly  to develop their own  real-time payments infrastructure.  \nToday, I would like to spend  some time updating you on the progress of this \nwork . I’ll discuss the approach we have taken to facilitate this activity and provide some \ndetail about the work being done by both our Faste r Payments and Secure Payments Task \nForces . I’ll conclude with a few thoughts  on where their efforts are headed  and what to \nexpect in the year ahead , including some of the challenges we will face . \n \nThe Case  for Faster Payments in the United States   \nThe U.S. payment s ystem effectively supports the largest economy in the world, \nand has a long history of evolving to meet changing needs . In early 2015 , the Federal \nReserve issued a call to action in the form of a paper, titled Strategies  for Improving the \nU.S Payment System , that outlined the collective thinking of U.S. payment system \nstakeholders and the Federal Reserve on ways to  improv e the system.  \n\n \n2 \n The vision set out in the paper  framed specific strategies  designed to meet the \ngrowing demands of American consumers and businesses that continue to shift  their daily \ntransactions  toward e -commerce and Internet -enabled technologies . The strategies are \nbased on five desired outcomes for improvements in the following areas:  speed, security, \nefficiency, cross -border payments and industry collaboration . We also committed to \nmake improvements to the payment  services provided by the Federal Reserve .  \nAs the central bank of the U nited States, the Fed eral Reserve is  uniquely \npositioned to facilitate the stakeholder collabo ration needed to provide widespread access \nand the adoption of n ew payment system capabilities . For at least the last 50 years, \nmutual cooperation on payment issues between the Federal Reserve and the private sector \nhave contributed to a more resilient pay ment system , yielding significant benefits to the \npublic an d the economy as a whole.  \nTo be sure, t his approach has had its detractors , including those who thought that \nany attempt to produce significant change in our diverse payments landscape  would be \nhampered  by proprietary interests and a lack of cooperation . But that thinking \nunderestimated the interest and willingness of industry participants to cooperate and to \nproduce a result that none could achieve on their own .  \nOver the past two years , we have  brought together hundreds of interested parties \nand stakeholders in a broad and highly -motivated coalition that is working together to \nidentify both the promise and the challenges of making end-to-end payment system \nimprovements  a reality . \n \n \n\n \n3 \n Faster Paymen ts Task Force    \nCentral  banks around the world  have used government mandates  to provide the \ncontrol and direction needed to complete large -scale national initiatives  such as payment \nsystem  improvement . Here in the United States , the absence of a government  mandate \nand the recognition that significant  investments in legacy systems were in place , led to a \ndifferent approach .  \nThe Faster Payments Task Force now has more than 320 members comprising a \nvariety of interests:  technology providers; small, medium an d large financial institutions; \npayment networks; trade associations; business end users; and a small number of \ngovernment officials. Importantly, and in many respects u nique to such initiatives, the \nTask F orce also includes the representation of consumer groups .  \nThe Task F orce has made remarkable progress and I’d like to give you a sense of \nwhat has been accomplished . Early on, the Task F orce committed to a framework that \nwould ensure decision s and work products would have the broad support of its \nmembers hip, both within and across the various groups represented . With this \nunderstanding, they were able to define detailed criteria for judging the effectiveness \nneeded to deliver faster payments  and assess alternative approaches for faster payments \nsolutions .  \nIn January, the Task F orce created  a portal -based forum where solution providers, \nfrom  both the general public and within the Task F orce, c ould showcase their payment s \ncapabilities . In this w ay, firms intending to create  full end -to-end payment solu tions were \nable to view technologies and services that might help fill gaps in their proposals. To \ndate, more than 30 firms — from small startups to large payments and technology \n\n \n4 \n companies  — have submitted product descriptions or short videos to the online  forum, \noffering a range of expertise.  \nSoon after the creation of the capability showcase  forum , the Task F orce solicited \nproposa ls for faster payment solutions . Those making submissions  were asked to \nillustrate what their solution would do at each stage of the end -to-end payments process, \nfrom the initiation of a transaction through the completion of a payment and \nreconciliation of account balances. An outside consultant , McKinsey & Company , was \nchosen  to conduct an independent  assessment of each proposal against the criteria  \ndeveloped by the Task F orce.  \nIn total, 22  proposals have been reviewed  in the first phase of the assessment \nprocess that occurred from  May through September  of this year . Just last week , the \nproposals were released to both the Faster Payments Task Force and the Secure Payments \nTask Force , for review  and critical feedback . After receiving c omments , those who \nsubmitted the proposals will decide whether to remain in the process and release their \nproposal s to the general public. The proposals that remain will be included in  the Task \nForce’s Final Report  to be published in 2017 , along with t he assessment results and Task \nForce commentary.  \nBeyond the evaluatio n of individual proposals, the Task F orce review will \nconsider broadly the structural challenges that could affect the implementation of faster \npayments solutions . In a session later today, you’ll hear more about how the Task F orce \nis considering these issues , but let me share some of my views now  for the challenges to \nbe addressed .  \n\n \n5 \n Given the nature of market -driven solutions, interoperability will be a key \nconcern . This is  one of the current payments system gaps that led to establish ing the \nFaster Payments Task Force . Markets have produced a number of fragmented solutions \nthat deliver desired functionality, but have failed to deliver a ubiquitous and seamless \nexperience for end users .  \nInteroper ability requires a careful consideration of rules, standards and \ngovernance . We take for granted the ubiquity of our current infrastructure as represented \nin the use of debit and credit cards, ACH and check transactions . But, t he interoperability \nwe enjoy with these systems today didn’t happen ov ernight . In fact, it took years and in \nsome cases was cobbled together piece by piece across multiple providers . As we \ncontemplate faster p ayment capabilities for the United States , the industry has an \nopportunity to take a more proactive approach on these issues  and consider a path to \nadoption  so that all consumers and businesses may benefit from these capabilities .  \nProgress on bring ing faster payments to the U nited States  must  keep in focus the \nfundamental responsibility to ensure the overall  safet y and integrity of the payment \nsystem . Real-time payments present  some new risks in addition to those with which we \nare already familiar .  \nExperiences around the world and here in our own system prove that these risks \ncan be effectively managed and real -time payments can be safely and securely provided . \nHowever, the  challenges we face in successfully achieving our desired outcomes for \nfaster payments will require the same industry collaboration that has brought us to this \npoint . I commend the efforts of t he Task F orce to anticipate these challenges and \nopportunities , and I look forward to their recommendations in this regard.  \n\n \n6 \n Secure Payments  \nRegarding the issue of security, t here should be no doubt that d ynamic, persistent \nand escalating threats are  challe nging public confidence in the U.S. payment  system . The \ngrowing scale, sophistication, and global nature of cyber threats , along with the \nproliferation in points of vulnerability , has made security a key priority for fina ncial \ninstitutions, payments providers, central banks and regulators around the world . \nMore than 170 individuals joined t he Secure Payments Task Force  in 2015 to  \naddress the most pressing challenges in our existing payment systems and to defin e the \ncriteria for a safe and secure faster payments future . Let me hi ghlight two areas where \nthis Task F orce is focused today .  \nPreventing and managing fraud is a key challenge given certain inherent \nlimitations and weaknesses in existing payment systems  and processes . Today , there is no \nuniversally accepted way to establish and verify the identity of a payment system \nparticipant . The Task F orce has begun to address this problem . Their work will consider \nthe identification and adoption of payment identity management practices, as well as the \nopportunities to share fraud and cyber -threat information and how to analyze related  data.  \nThese efforts all promise to produce valuable information, tools and insight for \nthe industry . Driving widespread adoption of s ecurity improvements , however , remains a \nconsiderable challenge. Fortunately, U.S. payment  system security  is strong . And \nalthough we remain vigilant, we must keep pace with the rapidly -evolving and expanding \nrisks that threaten the payments ecosystem . I commend the work of the Secure Payments \nTask Force and the collaboration it brings to these important issues . \n \n\n \n7 \n Beyond Task Force Efforts  \nIn addition to the work of these Task Forces, the Federal Reserve itself is \ninvolved in improving efficiency in the p ayment system . Through its longstanding  \npartnership  with the Business Payments Coalition , real progress has been achieved in \nterms of educating small businesses on electronic payments, advancing the developme nt \nand adoption of standards, and understanding and addressing the barriers to straight -and -\nthrough processing. Of note this year is the establishment of the Business Payments \nDirectory Association, which is working to create a business -to-business directory to \nfacilitate easy, electronic origination o f business payments.  \nAnd in discussing our collective accomplishments in improving the payment \nsystem, the industry realized an important milestone last month  to enhance the speed of \nthe ACH network with implementation of the first phase of SameDay ACH . Within the \nFed, we’ve invested in speeding check clearing  and ACH payments, enhancing \nsettlement services, and enriching information services to better support risk and \ncompliance management needs. In partnership with the industry, we are working to alig n \nwire transfer and ACH systems to global message standards to meet user needs, pave the \nway for greater domestic and cross -border interoperability, and ensure a U.S. payment \nsystem that is relevant and competitive in the global market.   \n \nLooking Ahead  \nAfter almost two years, I am pleased at the progress we’ve mad e. We expect to \nmark some significant developments next year . In the first half of 2017, the Faster \nPayments Task Force is scheduled to issue its report in two parts . The first is expected to \n\n \n8 \n lay out the case for faster payments in the United States, and to describe the process \nundertaken to evaluate proposals for improvements . The second part of its report will \ninclude their review of the specific proposals  submitted . It will outline what an end -to-\nend faster payment system could look like in the U nited States  and discuss the possible \neffectiveness of different proposals , while highlighting strategic issues deemed important \nto the successful development of faster payments and actions needed to adva nce \nimplementation and adoption .  \nLikewise, the Secure Payments Task Force is likely to publish its views on the \nkey issues it has identified , including  payment identity management, information sharing, \ndata protection, and other payment system security is sues sometime next year .  \nThese reports will mark important milestones, but I believe o ur greatest challenge  \ngoing forward is maintai ning the momentum we have achieved  so far . It’s also likely that \nsome of our most difficult tasks lay ahead . Much of our collective work to date might be \ndescribed as identifying or designing solutions . We all know that in a market place as \ncomplex as our payment  system, the real work comes in driving successful \nimplementation and adoption all the way from the c entral infrastructures through the \nbanking and technology spaces to the hundreds of millions of consumers and business \nwho use these services .  \nAs some of these first steps in our payments improvement journey draw to a close \nor reach major milestones over the next year, we look forward to further collaborating to \ndivine the way forward toward our desired outcomes.

George  \nPresident  \nFederal  Reserve  Bank  of Kansas  City \nbefore  the \nHouse  Subcommittee  on Monetary  Policy  and Trade  \nUnited  States  House  of Representatives  \n \nSept.  7, 2016  \nThe views  expressed  by the author  are her own and do not necessarily  reflect  those  of the Federal  Reserve  System,  its \ngovernors,  officers  or representatives.  \n \n\n2 \n Chairman  Huizenga,  Ranking  Member  Moore  and members  of the subcommittee,  thank  \nyou for this opportunity  to share  my views  on the role of regional  Federal  Reserve  Banks  as part \nof the Federal  Reserve  System . \nBecause  the Federal  Reserve  is an institution  that makes  decisions  of consequence  to the \nbroad  public,  a discussion  of these  matters  is worthwhile.   If changes  are to be considered,  the \npublic  should  understand  not only the Congressional  intent  for its current  design,  but also the \nstrong  safeguards  that assure  its accountability.    \nCentral  banks  are unique  institutions.   They  have  impo rtant responsibilities  for a nation’s  \nfinancial  system  and economy.   Congress,  as it contemplated  a central  bank  for the United  States  \nmore  than 100 years  ago, took note of central  bank  models  from  other  countries,  while  keeping  \nin mind  two earlier  attempt s at central  banking  in the United  States.   Ultimately,  it opted  for a \ndifferent  approach:   one that recognized  the public’s  distrust  of concentrated  power  and greater  \nconfidence  in decentralized  institutions.   The Federal  Reserve’ s unique  public/private  structure  \nreflects  these  strongly -held views  and is designed  to provide  a system  of checks  and balances.   \nChallenges  to this public/private  design  have  surfaced  throughout  the Federal  Reserve’s  history,  \nnot unlike  they have  today.   But in the end, our country  has remained  most  confident  in this \ndecentralized  governance  structure.  \nCriticism  of the quasi -private  nature  of the regional  Reserve  Banks  was anticipated  from  \nthe start.   Indeed,  the Federal  Reserve  Act leaves  no unchecked  power  in Reserve  Banks.   The \npolitically -appointed  members  of the Board  of Governors  have  oversight  authority  of the most  \nimportant  governance  aspects  of Reserve  Banks.   For example,  they appoint  the Chair  and \nDeputy  Chair  of a Reserve  Bank’s  board;  they vote to approve  the selection  of the Bank’s  \npresident  as well as its chief operating  officer;  and they approve  the Reserve  Bank’s  budget  and \n\n3 \n salaries.    The Board  of Governors  also meets  with each Banks’  Chair  and Deputy  Chair  annually  \nto review  the Bank’s  performance  and that of its president.   Finally,  the Reserve  Bank’s  \noperations  are reviewed  by the Board  of Governors  and an outside  independent  auditor.  \nNotwithstanding  this strong  public  oversight,  some  question  the role of commercial  banks  \nwithin  the Fed structure.   Here  too, important  safeguards  exist.   The supervision  and regulation  \nof the Federal  Reserve’s  member  banks  is a statutory  responsibility  of the Congressionally - \nconfirmed  Board  of Governors.   Bankers  who serve  on Reserve  Bank  boards  are prohibited  by \nlaw from  participating  in the selection  of the Bank  president,  and no director  can participate  in \nbank  supervisory  matters.   Finally,  all directors  are required  to adhere  to high ethical  standards  of \nconduct  and avoid  actions  that might  impair  the effectiveness  of the Federal  Reserve’s  operations  \nor in any way discredit  the reputation  of the System.  \nThe capital stock supplied by these member banks serves as the foundation for the \ndecentralized structure allowing for separate corporate entities.   Through the regional Res erve \nBanks, private citizens from diverse backgrounds and from the largest to the smallest \ncommunities, have input into national economic policy; strong and varied independent \nperspectives more easily emerge to engage in difficult monetary policy discussio ns; and the \ncentral bank is provided insulation from short -term political pressures . \nAltering  this public/private  structure  in favor  of a fully  public  construct  diminishes  these  \ndefining  characteristics  in my view.   It also risks  putting  more  distance  betw een Main  Street  and \nthe nation’ s central  bank.    \nFormer  Fed Chairman  Paul Volcker  understood  this well.   He experienced  first-hand  how \npublic  pressure  can be exerted  on a central  bank  when  it must make  unpopular  decisions  that he \nand the FOMC  judged  to be in the long-run best interest  of the economy.   In a 1984  speech,  he \n\n4 \n noted  the important  role of the structure  of the Federal  Reserve  System  in supporting  the central  \nbank’s  decision  making  by saying , “It was all quite  deliberately  done  by men of political  \nimagination  -- designed  to assure  a certain  independence  of judgment,  a continuity  and \nprofessionalism  in staff,  a close  contact  with economic  developments  and opinion  throughout  our \ngreat  land and a large  degree  of insulation  from  partisan  or passing  political concerns.”1 \nTo that end, I extend  a personal  invitation  for any of you to visit the Federal  Reserve  \nBank  of Kansas  City to see what  a regional  Federal  Reserve  Bank  provides  in support  of the \ncentral  bank’s  objectives  for economic  stability.    Thank  you.  I look forward  to taking  your \nquestions.   \n \n                                                \n1 Paul A.

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApril 6 , 2017  \nFederal Reserve Bank of New York Community Banking Conference  \nNew York, N.Y.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve \nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.  \n  \n\n2 \n Community banks have an important connection with the Federal Reserve . Across the 12 \nFederal  Reserve Banks, some 68 bankers serve as directors on either Reserve Bank or  Branch \nboards and nearly all of them are community bankers . These individuals bring important \nperspectives to our work . I appreciate their contributions as well as  the core function that \ncommunity banks  serve in thousands of communities across  the United States.  \nI hope you’ll indulge me as I briefly preface my remarks this morning with some \npersonal history . Yesterday marked a milestone for me:  35 years of service with the Federal \nReserve . When I came to work for the Kansas City Fed as a bank examiner in 1982 , I was also a \nfirst-time homeowner. I was delighted to have a job that would help me pay my bills, especially \nmy mortgage . At that time, I thought I’d made a s teal to have assumed a n existing  mortgage at \nthe low rate  of 12 percent.  \nWorking at  the Fed, I soon came to appreciate that it was a particularly challenging year \nfor the banking industry . Our  region was hard hit by the trifecta of downturn s in commercial real \nestate , energy and ag riculture . That year, the failure of a small bank in Oklahoma triggered the \nfailure and eventual government bailout of one of the largest bank s in the U .S. Meanwhile, \nhundreds of banks failed in the Tenth District. This was the en vironment in which I was trained \nto be a bank supervisor .  \nThis also was the year that a former N ew York Fed president , Gerald Corrigan , wrote an \nessay  titled  “Are Banks Specia l?”1  It proved to be a foundational piece that has been \noccasionally revisited  by others in the 35 years  since . Today, I would like to return to the theme \nof Mr. Corrigan’s essay by looking at the role of banks while asking a slightly different question, \n“Do traditional banks still matter to the U.S. economy? ”    A spoiler alert: M y answer is a \n                                                 \n1 E. Gerald  Corrigan served as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis from 1980 to 1984 and \npresident of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York from 1985 to 1993.  \n\n3 \n definitive “yes.” I’ll use the remainder of my time today outlining why this is so , and why I \nbelieve this key component of the U .S. economy may be at risk.  \nBefore going further, I should note that my comments today are my views only and not \nthose of the Federal Reserve System or its Board of Governors.  \n \nThe Banking Landscape  in 1982  \nIn an interview some years later, Mr. Corrigan recalled the reason he wrote the 1982 \nessay. Simply put, t he competitive position of traditional banks was rapidly eroding, and \npolicymakers were contemplating the implications.  \nIn the early 1980s , the combination of high interest rates and deposit rate ceilings made it \ndifficult for banks to  compete with alternatives that were not subject to the same restrictions, \nincluding savings and loan NOW accounts and money market mutual funds . By the time interest \nrate ceilings were eliminated  on most deposits , money market f unds were well established .  \nIn credit markets, the seeds of greater capital market competition for bank loans were \nalso planted in the early 1980s . The development of government and age ncy mortgage -backed \nsecurities were  followed by private  label mortgage and other asset -backed securities . Another \nmajor innovation was funding new credits with high -yield bond s, which previously had been \nused only to refinance companies whose debt had been downgraded below  investment grade .  \nGiven the dramatic nature of these changes, questions arose about whether the role of \nbanks had been diminished.  W ould these new nonbank entrants  supplant their role?  Did it \nmatter?   \nWith reflection on these questions, Mr. Corrigan  concluded that banks were different and \nunique in three ways :   \n\n4 \n  Only banks offered transaction deposits payable on demand at par and readily \ntransferable;   \n Banks served as the primary and ultimate source of liquidity for all other classes and \nsizes of institutions, both financial and nonfinancial;  \n Banks served as the transmission mechanism for monetary policy which , combined \nwith operating the payments mechanis m, facilitates efficient markets and ord erly end \nof day settlement – a particularly important role in periods of financial stress .  \nAt that time, these special characteristics of banks had three important implications for \nthe structure of our financial sys tem and its regulation :   \n No other type of financial company had its funding protected by the public safety net \nof federal deposit insurance and the Federal Reserve discount window .  \n Banks were regulated and supervised because of th is safety net and th eir key role in \nthe economy . At that time, the separation of commercial banking from investment \nbanking and commerce was an important part of the prudential regulatory structure .  \n Only banks had direct access to the Federal Reserve’s payments rails .  \nFrom 1982  to 1999, the financial system continued to evolve, aided by regulatory \ninterpretation and court decisions . And the banking industry began to experience rapid  \nconsolidation . Much of the consolidation reflected mergers of smaller banks as intrastate and \ninterstate restrictions were relaxed . However, the most significant effect for the banking system \nwas an increase in the market share of the largest banks, driven by their efforts to create \nnationwide operations and enhance global competitiveness . During this  period, the market share \nof the ten largest banking companies increased from 28  percent  to 51 percent of total banking \nassets.  \n\n5 \n The scale of these firms made it profitable to operate securities dealing and underwriting \nsubsidiaries under the Glass -Steagal l Act’s Section 20 authority . This was the first major crack in \nthe wall between commercial and investment banking.  In 1999, Glass -Steagall gave way to the \nGramm -Leach -Bliley Act (GLBA) , which  invited bank holding companies to adopt investment \nbanking activities  with important safety net advantages .  \nWith the  addition of these nonbanking activities , the 10 largest bank ing organization s \nsaw their market share rise further to 55 percent  in 2007. Meanwhile, the composition of their \nassets changed dramatica lly. The average portfolio share of nonbanking assets  rose from only 13 \npercent in 1997 to 25 percent in 2007 .  \nThis summer marks the tenth  anniversary of the financial crisis . That event brought to \nlight what had previously only been conceptually understo od:  the largest banking organizations \nwere highly interconnected and indeed  too big to fail (TBTF) . The safety net designed  to cover \nonly commercial banking activities  was stretched well beyond the insured depository \nsubsidiaries to the ir parent companies and nonbanking subsidiaries . However, only commercial \nbanks truly retained the unique characteristics that Mr. Corrigan argued made them special.  \nAs a practical matter, t he largest banks were the only firms that could acquire other large \nand troubled investment banks, commercial banks, and savings associations . The remaining large \nindependent investment banks became bank holding companies . As a result, the 10 largest \nbank ing organizations  now account for 67 percent of industry assets, whil e the average \nnonbanking -asset share of their portfolios has climbed to 29 percent .  \nAs I look through the lens of the past 35 years, the financial system landscape has \ncertainly changed. There are three  features that I find particularly striking  over this period . \n\n6 \n  Banking system assets as a share of financial system assets have fallen from 37 to 19 \npercent .  \n The number of banks has significant ly decline d from more than 18,000 to around  \n5,000, largely reflected in fewer community banks with less than $100 million of \nassets .  \n Community banks’ market share  fell from 45 percent in 1982 to just 13 percent today .  \nWhat has emerged within the banking system are two very different kinds of commercial \nbank ing firm s:  a small number of very large bank ing o rganization s with significant nonbanking \nactivities and sufficient scale to pose systemic risk to the economy , and thousands of traditional \nbanks generally referred to as community banks.  \n \nDo Traditional Banks M atter to the U .S. Economy in 2017 ? \nDespite such monumental shifts in the financial system landscape, one could reach the \nsame conclusion today as Mr. Corrigan did in 1982 . Namely, that the banking system retains a \nunique role in our economy . Banks are still the only type of financial firm t hat can provide \nliquidity whenever needed, ensure payments are readily transferable, and aid the implementation \nof monetary policy .  \nYet, the differences  between the largest banks and community banks are significant and \nthose differences pose important challenges for setting effective regulatory policy . This l eads me \nto ask a slightly different question  than Mr. Corrigan asked :  Are traditional banks , or \ncommunity banks , still important to the U.S. economy in 2017?   \nI answered this questi on affirmatively at the beginning of my remarks.   Indeed, \ntraditional banks are essential to thousands of communities across the country . In contrast to the \n\n7 \n large st banks, community banks still rely primarily on relationship lending, with a focus on \nfundin g local loans with core deposits . Their heterogeneous customer base and credit decisions \ninclude not only quantitative but qualitative aspects including judgments about the repayment \nability of their Main Street customers. These bankers serve on the boards  of local schools, \nhospitals  and other civic organizations, providing a key source of leadership in the community . \nThey serve their communit ies and are part of their communit ies.  \nBut do they matter to the U.S. economy as a whole?  Can o nline banking and scale satisfy \nthe credit needs on Main Street s and in rural areas ?  I am reminded that a lthough we often refer \nto “the U.S. economy ” in aggregate , as though it were a single  monolithic  entity , there are in fact \nthousands of micro -economie s that taken together make up the $19 trillion U.S. economy . In \nthese micro -economies, community banks are a critical source of financing for small businesses, \nincluding startups . While community banks account for just 13 percent of industry assets, they \nare responsible for some  40 percent of bank lending to small businesses . In turn, small \nbusinesses with less than 500 employees account for about 50 percent of U.S. private \nemployment .2 Moreover, recent research shows that small startups with 20  to 499 empl oyees \nplay a large role in net job creation that continues for up to five years after their formation.3  \nThis evidence indicates  community banks are still extremely important to our economy, \nalthough, their competitive position is under stress . Market forces of technology and innovation  \nare everywhere  and c ommunity banks will need to b e responsive to customer demand  for new \nservices and methods of banking . But these are not the forces that particularly concern me . The \nrisk I see stems from a misal igned regulatory environment that poses a threat in my view to the \n                                                 \n2 “United States Small Business Profile, 2016,” U.S. Small Business Administration, Office of Advocacy.  \n3 See Robert Jay Dilger, “Small Business Administration and Job Creation,” Congressional Research Service, \nFebruary 8, 2017.  \n\n8 \n diversity of the U.S. banking system and healthy competition  that has long served the country \nwell.  \n \nPolicy Implications  \nToday , the nation stands at a crossroads of policy choices . As policymakers consider \nregulatory  reform , the special role of banks in our economy  and particularly the role of \ncommunity bank s, must factor into their decisions .  \nWe witnessed the tremendous cost of a financial crisis . The regulatory response that \nfollowed  was well  intended and even justified in its aims to end TBTF and protect consumers.  \nHowever,  while the aim was specific to the large st banks, the regulatory net has ensnared \nthousands of community banks . Regulators have applied supervisory approaches and protections \nthat often fail to take into account the incentives  and risk profile associated with relationship \nlending models  of community banks .  \nFor example, international capital standards , which formed the basis to reduce leverage in  \nthe biggest banks , layer on unnecessary reporting requirements and complexity for banks that \nalready held high levels of capital . Appraisal standards aimed to ensure independent valuations \nsupport new loans create  challenges for thousands of smaller banks that are portfolio  lenders . \nThese small institutions, often located in more rural markets, struggle  to find  knowledgeable \nappraisers with sufficient  comparable propert y sales to comply with the rules, and i n some cases, \nconclude that qualified borrowers ’ credit needs can’t be met .  \nFinally, rules aim ed at  protect ing consumers and other customers from unfair and \ndeceptive practices are important .  However, l ong-term relationship lending also aligns the \nincentives that protect community bank customers . Unfortunately, the compliance burden for \n\n9 \n community banks introduces costly processes along with fear and confusion as  they struggle to \napply  narrow  legal interpretations and opaque statistical models to the fair credit needs of their \nborrowers .  \nUltimately , communities suffer when access to credit is unnecessarily limited , and so \ndoes the larger economy .  Rules that aim to address the business models and incentives of the \nlargest banks may unintentionally put t he diversity of the banking system at risk , and the lack of \nnew bank  charter s over the past decade suggest s the barriers to entry may be high.   \n \nConclusion  \nThe regulatory remedy for today’s banking system will not be easily prescribed . But it \nwill need to recognize that the institutions we  collectively refer to as  “commercial banks” have \ndrifted apart over the past 35 years . At one end of the spectrum are banks that engage in global \nfinancing with systemic implications for failure and impact to the broader economy . At the other \nend are bank s that engage in traditional lend ing and deposit -taking , whose impact on small \nbusiness and small communities translates to real economic outcomes . \nToday, t he federal safety net supports both models and it is sagging , stretched by ever -\nlarger and more complex firms with significant nonbanking activities . Banking r egulation must \ndo its best to offset the very real exposures for taxpayers and the risk to economic and financial \nstability . Nurturing incentives that reward success and punish failure are key . Aligning regulation \nthat effectively addresses risk at both ends of this spectrum will require that regulators either \nclose the gap between their differences or embrace the two models and attempt to apply very \ndifferent supervisory frameworks  and approach es.  \n\n10 \n Market forces will continue to reshape the industry as they have for the past 35 years and \nlonger . And community bankers are no strangers to those market forces or a challenging \noperating environment . But the banking industry has evolved in very diffe rent ways and rules \nthat inhibit market forces without offsetting gain warrant scrutiny .  \nAs a highly concentrated banking system takes hold  in the U.S. , the issue of today’s \nbanking landscape poses a slightly different but important question about the abi lity of regulation \nto differentiate its aim . It will matter to thousands of communities served by you in the years \nahead , and by extension to the U.S. economy.",

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nApril 18, 2017 \n26\nth Annual Hyman P. Minsky Conference  \nLevy Economics Institute of Bard College  \nAnnandale -on-Hudson, N.Y. \n \n      The views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, its governors, officers or representatives. \n\n1 \n I’d like to thank the organizers of this year’s Mins ky C onference for inviting me to speak. \nThe topics to be addressed at this event highlight a number of policy choices facing our nation \ntoday . The implications of those choices are far -reaching not only to the Main Streets of this \ncountry but also to economies  around the world. Central bank monetary policies loom large \namong those policy choices .  \nOver the past 15 months, the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) has begun the  \nprocess of gradually removing nearly a decade of monetary accommodation. Th at \naccommodation came in the form of both conventional interest rate policy , which lowered short -\nterm rates to near zero, and a series of more unconventional policy actions  – namely , large -scale \nasset purchases  and forward guidance . The actions  were both lauded and critic ized. Indeed, in \nMarch 2009, one member of the FOMC commented  on the very difficult situation of determining \nan appropriate policy response  at that time , noting “we’re in a position where doing the right \nthing is not obvious.”1    \nIf doing “the right thing” was not obvious at that time , then the path to unwinding these \nextraordinary policy actions  and returning to more conventional policy approaches is no less \nfraught with questions about the FOMC’s decision -making framework . How will conventional \nand unconventional policy accommodation be removed and what are the implications ? Is the \nprocess of normalizing policy “behind the curve ?” What linkages exist between balance sheet \nadjustment s and interest rates ? What level of interest  rates  best supports long -run price stability ? \nMy r emarks today will not attempt to answer many of these important questions . Instead, \nI will focus on the process of policy normalization and its challenges , particularly as it relates to \nunwinding the Federal Res erve’s balance sheet . I’ll begin with the economic backdrop under \nwhich the FOMC is considering these policy adjustments.  \n                                                           \n1 Donald Kohn, FOMC meeting transcript, March 17- 18, 2009.  \n\n2 \n The views I express are my own and are not necessarily shared by other participants on \nthe FOMC.  \n \nThe U.S. Economic Outlook  \nFor the most part, t he economy looks to be on solid footing. Consumers are confident and \nthey are spending , household balance sheets are in better shape , and house prices are rising . \nEmployment has gained traction, bringing the unemployment rate down to 4.5 percent . Business \ninvestment and productivity growth ha ve been somewhat sluggish for most of the recovery, but \nprofitability has again increased . The energy and manufacturing sectors also are bouncing back \nwith the stabilization in oil prices and the fore ign exchange value of the U .S. dollar . In general, \nthe economy has come a very long way since the financial crisis that began nearly a decade ago  \nand has weathered a number of shocks over the course of this lengthy  expansion.  \nDespite the apparent health of the economy, r isks are always on the horizon. Today, \nhowever, there is a sense that outcomes could actually  be better than expected, rather than worse. \nFor example, in the FOMC’s latest Summary of Economic Projections, more participants now \nsee risks th at real GDP growth and inflation could  be higher than forecast, rather than lower. \nThis shift in risk assessment is in sharp c ontrast  to the more pessimistic view s that dominate d \npast projections . Such an outlook has allowed the  FOMC to continue  the proces s of \nnormalization.  \n \nUnwinding the B alance S heet \nPrior to the financial crisis, the business of setting monetary policy involved few moving \nparts . FOMC decisions could be steered with a fair amount of precision by the Federal Reserve’s \n\n3 \n Open Market Desk and with a relatively modest amount of intervention in financial markets. \nThere were other aspects to the process, but the tools and considerations were generally well \nunderstood and relatively  straightforward . \nToday, conducting monetary policy is consider ably more complicated , owing in part  to \nthe size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet . Prior to the financial crisis  and \nrecession , the Fed’s balance sheet was slightly less than $1 trillion with a portfolio of short -term \nTreasuries . Over  the period from 2009 to 2014, a series of large- scale asset purchases swelled the \nbalance sheet to nearly  $4.5 trillion, and the portfolio shifted to include mortgage -backed \nsecurities and long -term Treasur ies.  \nThese unprecedented actions were carefully considered with a desire to boost economic \nactivity . Faced with the prospect of potential nearer -term benefits, the associated costs  were \ngenerally difficult to quantify and viewed to be well into the future, perhaps making them easier \nto discount . As a voting member who dissented in 2013, I believed these costs outweighed the \nbenefits  at that time . \nThe key challenge for monetary policy today  is to unwind this large balance sheet  in the \nleast disruptive manner . It is an important step and one that  the FOMC a nticipated  going back to \nJune 2011 when exit strategy principles were initially framed . Following decisions to expand the \nbalance sheet further, the  FOMC revisited the exit strategy principles in 2014 and outlined its \napproach to monetary policy  normalization  in September of that year .  \nIt is difficult to know with a high degree of confidence just how the economy and \nfinancial markets will react once the FOMC announces and then takes steps to reduce the size of \nits securities holdings . Some believe that the benefits of the actions that swelled the balance sheet \nwere modest, and as a result, the costs of its unwinding  also could be of little consequence to the \n\n4 \n broader economy . Others believe that t he eff ects on the economy were substantial  and that  \nactions to reduce its size need to be taken with a great deal of care and caution . Of course, it is \nalso possible that any  benefits gained from the balance sheet  expansion w on’t reverse when it \nshrinks . While evidence from a variety of  sources and studies will inform decisions about \npossible effects and how to proceed, the implications for the economy are uncertain.  \nIn addition, balance sheet actions have the potential to complicate interest rate policy. \nThere is likely some tradeoff between adjusting interest rates and shrinking the balance sheet, but \nthe specifics of the tradeoff are hard  to quantify. This uncertainty and additional complexity \nraises the risk of a policy error or could spark a bout of financial market volatility .  \nBeyond the mechanics of shrinking a large balance sheet, establishing a sound framework \nfor the timing of balance sheet adjustments will be important. To that end, the FOMC discussed at its most recent meeting in March various aspects of a n appropriate decision- making \nframework to guide its actions . \nBalance sheet adjustments will need to be gradual  and smooth, which is an approach that \ncarries the least risk in terms of a strategy to normalize its size . Importantly, once the process \nbegins, it should continue without re consideration at each subsequent FOMC meeting . In other \nwords, the process should be on autopilot and not necessarily vary with moderate movements in the economic data . To do otherwise would amount to using the balance sheet as an active tool of \npolicy outside of periods of severe financial or economic stress , and would increase uncert ainty \nrather than reduce it .  \n   \n\n5 \n Avoiding Monetary “Fine Tuning”  \nBased on economic conditions, I would support beginning the process of reducing the \nbalance sheet this year . This would further normalize the stance of policy and leave more highly  \nliquid, safe securities available to the market . I do not favor prolonging action for the purpose of \nallow ing inflation  to overshoot the 2 percent goal or to press labor markets into a condition \nwhere they are overheating .  \nAt the time the FOMC adopted the 2 percent  inflation target in 2012, the unfamiliar \nnature and unknown consequences of large scale asset purchases had piqued concerns about the \nimplications for inflation expectations . Anchoring these expectations with a  more  explicit \ncommitment to price stability  was appropriate. I supported that decision. In the years following, \nhowever, i nflation ran below the  stated target  – although at times only slightly below – and only \nrecently has it moved above the target to 2.1 percent .  \nIn its annual S tatement on Longer -Run G oals and Monetary Policy S trateg y, the FOMC \ntalks about the nature of its inflation objective . Specifically, inflation that persistently deviates \nabove or below the 2 percent objective would be cause for concern, but monetary policy  need not \nreact to  temporary deviations . Importantly, I do not interpret the strategy as calling for inflation \nto linger above 2 percent to make up for past shortfalls, but rather for inflation to move toward 2 percent in the long run without any deliberat e overshooting . Continuing highly accommodative \npolicy or adjusting monetary policy in response to modest shortfalls or overshoots from the inflation goal is an attempt at  monetary fine tuning that is often not practical and may ultimately \nprove costly .  \nAlthough inflation is running close to 2 percent today and is expected to remain there, the \nprices of different goods and services rise at very different rates . For example, services inflation \n\n6 \n has been running well above 2 percent, and housing rents in part icular have been playing a key \nrole in moving inflation higher . By several measures, rents are rising faster than aggregate \nwages . Keeping monetary policy easy to achieve higher inflation has the potential to push rents \nstill higher, negatively affecting a  large percentage of households. Consequently, I am not as \nenthusiastic or encouraged as some when I see inflation moving higher, especially when it has \nbeen driven by a sector like housing . Inflation is a tax and t hose least able to afford it  generally \nsuffer the most .  \nSuch concentration and persistently rising prices in one area suggests the economy is \nstruggling to reallocate resources . For housing, it could reflect several factors such as tight \nlending standards faced by home builders and scarcity of skilled craftsmen needed to construct homes. I expect the market to eventually solve  for, or at least adapt  to, such factors . Using \nmonetary policy however to compensate for them  could easily end up hurting the population the \npolicy is intended to help. \n \nConclusion  \nOverall , I am encouraged by the sta rt of the normalization process and want to see it \ncontinue . Resisting the temptation to react to near -term fluctuations in the data  will be necessary . \nLooking ahead, w e should expect inflation to move up and down around 2 percent . A modest \ndecline in inflation  or an overshoot  may not necessarily warrant  the monetary policy  \nnormalization process to slow or accelerate. Such attempts at monetary fine -tuning can easily \nbackfire, so a more forward looki ng view of inflation is needed . This is not uncommon and it is \nwhy many economists and policymakers emphasize the importance of inflation expectations . In \n\n7 \n fact, t he FOMC also has long -emphasized their importance , typically with specific mention in \neach FOMC statement .  \nThe important factor is that the public, markets, and policymakers see the setting for \nmonetary policy supporting the 2 percent inflation goal in the long run, rather than expect a \npolicy that  tries  to keep inflation squarely pinned at 2 percent under all circumstances.  \nWhile both the inflation rate and the unemployment rate are in range to meet the FOMC’s \nobjectives, the federal funds rate is  far from its longer- run level  and the balance sheet remains \nlarge with reinvestment of maturing securities . Continuing along the path of normalization  even \nin the face of uncertainty is necessary to achieving long -run objectives for the economy , \nincluding price stability and full employment on a sustained basis.",

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFebruary 28 , 201 7 \nStanford Institute for Economic Policy Research  \nStanford, Calif.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve \nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.  \n  \n\n1 \n Thank you . It is a pleasure to join you today , and  I am especially delighted that  Mylan \nGray , deputy chair of the Associated Students of Stanford University , is here this evening . Mylan \nis a Kansas Citian and an alum of the Kansas City Fed’s Student Board of Directors  program . \nFor the past two summe rs he has worked at the Bank as a “camp counselor ” at our Summer at \nthe Fed student program . That program introduces young students to banking, the economy and \npersonal finance . Last year, Mylan was the progr am’s activities director . \nThe mission of the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research  is an important one . \nEconomic analysis and policy research  offers a critical foundation for policy deliberations . As a \nparticipant on the Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee  (FOMC) , our decision \nmaking and policy judgments  depend heavi ly on quality analysis to set a long -run course for \nmonetary policy , particularly when uncertainty dominates the landscape .  \nIn my remarks this evening , I’ll offer my view on the U.S. economy and  will talk a bit \nabout some of the challenges we have faced in the post -crisis environment . I’ll also  share my \nthoughts on what I believe to be the most appropriate action for policy moving forward . As \nalways, the views I express here are my own and are no t necessarily shared by others on the \nFOMC.  \n \nThe U.S. Economic Outlook  \nThis month (Feb . 2017) marks the 92nd consecutive month of the economic expansion  in \nthe United States , which is the third -longest U.S. expansion on record going back to about 1850. \nSince the end of the financial crisis, the economy has grown annually by about 2 percent each \nyear. Unemployment has declined and labor markets appear to have only m odest, if any, \nremaining slack. Inflation has been running at rates consistent with price stability and near the \n\n2 \n FOMC’s longer -run goal of 2  percent . Of course, there are always some areas of concern \nin the economy, but as a whole , things look fairly positive.  \n Optimism has increased during the past few months, as measured in both business and \nconsumer surveys. While consumer spending is expected to continue  at a healthy pace , this rise \nin confidence may not  automatically lead to even stronger consumer spending. The evidence \nsuggests that consumer confidence is not always a useful predictor of future consumption \ngrowth, especially once other factors such as interest rates or incom e growth are taken into \naccount. Still, household balance sheets are in much better  shape compared to the years \nimmediately following the  financial crisis and the labor market has been performing well, so the \noutlook remains positive for consumer spending.  \nLooking at labor markets, we’re essentially at or near full employment. The \nunemployment rate now sits at 4.8 p ercent, just below  what I view as its longer -run value of \nabout 5 percent. Labor force participation, which had been trending downwards for most of the \nexpansion, has leveled off and even slightly increased  over the past year. This recent rise appears \nto be due to a decline in labor force exits rather than an increase in labor force entry. In other \nwords, individuals are not more likely to return to the labor force right now, but workers are \nstaying on the job a bit longer. These factors suggest that there is not a lot of labor force slack, \neither among the officially unemployed or those out of the labor force who might rejoin.  \nOf course , there are numerous indicators on the labor market, so trying to judge the \namount of slack is not a straightforward task . One approach we use at the Kansas City Fed is a \nLabor Market Conditions Index, which was developed by my staff . It summarizes a wide array \nof labor market data into two succinct statistics :  the level of labor market activity and the \nmomentum of that activity . The most recent reading for January showed a level of activity that \n\n3 \n was above the long-term average, and a momentum indicator that was the highe st level since the \nseries began in 1992 .  \nAnother important indicator of slack in the labor market is wage growth, which has been \nquite moderate since the financial crisis, though has increased over the past year . Despite the \nimprovement in overall wage growth, there are differences across sectors. Recent re search by my \nstaff shows that the increase in wag es has been driven by only a few industry segments  – namely, \nthe construction, manufacturing and wholesale sectors. Growth in hours worked in these sectors \nhas been moderating, even as wages rise, perhaps suggesting firms are having an increasingly \ndifficu lt time attracting new workers. On the other hand, wage growth has shown few signs of \nacceleration in many of the service  sectors , although growth in hours worked has been steadily \nincreasing . This suggests there may have been a modest amount of slack in some service  sectors, \nbut as economic growth continues , workers will  likely  become increasingly scarce. This “bottom \nup” approach to evaluating the labor market suggests further  wage pressure is likely to follow \nacross a broader range of industries.  \nAs labor markets continue to improve and economic activity expand s, we could see a bit \nmore  inflationary pressure. Currently the FOMC’s preferred measure of inflation , the personal \nconsumption expenditures (PCE)  price index,  has increased by 1. 6 percent over the last 12 \nmonths. This measure has risen notably, compared to about 0.6 percent a year ago, as the effe cts \nof lower oil prices  have waned . Looking past the se oil price  effect s, the core me asure of inflation \nis up 1.7  percent  over the past year.   \nOther measures of inflation show similar trends. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is up \n2.5 percent  over the past year, the Dallas Fed’s trimmed -mean PCE inflation rate over the past \n\n4 \n year is up 1.9  percent  and the Cleveland Fed’s weighted median CPI is up 2.5  percent . All these \nmeasures  point in the same direction:  Inflation remains low , but is rising .  \n \nThe Role of Monetary Policy R ules  \nThe current state of the economy stand s in sharp contrast to earlier phases of  the \nrecovery . Follow ing the crisis, the unemployment rate was persistently  above its longer -run \nnormal level and inflation  below the FOMC’s 2 percent  longer -run goal . At the risk of \noversimplify ing, central banks generally respond with mo netary accommodation to support \neconomic activity and achieve their mandated objectives  in these conditions . That is, the \nstandard approach is to lower interest rates .  \nWhile the policy prescription in such  circumstances is generally straightforward, a few \ncomplications come into play. The first is that monetary policy operates with lags, which is a \npoint highlighted in the FOMC’s annual “Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy \nStrategy .” The timing and extent of a ny lags are imprecisely measured and can vary over time.  \nImportantly, these lags require monetary policy to act in a forward -looking manner. That is, \npolicymakers cannot wait to take action until they see  full employment and inflation at 2 percent . \nPolicy needs to be adjusted in advance.  Second, following the crisis, policymakers have become \nfar more attuned to the importance of fostering financial stability . While the relationship between \nmonetary policy and financial stability is not entirely clear, event s and research strongly suggest \nthat risk -taking often increases in low -rate environments . Indeed , the motivation for \nunconventional policies such as large -scale  asset purchases was aimed at provid ing additional \nstimulus at the zero lower bound by encouraging risk-taking , creating wealth effects , and \nboost ing asset prices . And third, policy needs to be set with a  sense of the risks surrounding the \n\n5 \n economic outlook . Foreign developments or financial  market volatility are examples of issues \nthat might cause policymakers to temporarily adjust course . Judging the scope and impact  of \nsuch risks is always  challenging , but this caution carries certain costs . Postponing rate \nadjustments is not unreasonable in the face of near-term risk s, but can keep policy stuck in place. \nThe result ing delay can leave a lasting imprint on the stance of monetary policy , especially  if \nadjustments are not made after the risk pass es. \nPolicymakers must deal w ith such complications . Among the tools available to us are \nmonetary policy rules, commonly known a s Taylor rules . These rules  provide guidelines for how \nto calibrate interest rates  under most economic conditions . How the FOMC should use such rules \nhas been the focus of some recent public discussion. In fact, the FOMC does consult the \nguidance coming from monetary policy rules  at each of its meetings . Rules come in many \nflavors , depending on what variables are included , the weights attached to  the different variables , \nand the designated value of the longer -run level of the funds rate. All of these make choosing a \nsingle rule difficult, but that’s not to say that they are not immensely useful. They may offer \ndifferent advice, but when all the ad vice moves in a particular direction, that is usually an \nimportant signal to policymakers.  \nWhile a variety of rules exist, t he intuition behind them  is relatively straightforward . \nMost rules take into account how far inflation is from the FOMC’s price sta bility target , as well \nas how far the labor market is from full employment . The deviation from their longer -run levels  \nis accounted for in the resulting rate prescription . When both numbers are close to their longer -\nrun levels, the se rules often prescribe that the federal funds rate should be near or be moving \ntoward its longer -run level . Indeed, most monetary policy rules today are pointing in the same \ngeneral direction and suggest short -term interest rates should be moving higher.  Given these \n\n6 \n signals , it may be a bit surprising that the FOMC has only raised its policy rate target twice since \nthe end of the financial crisis.  \n \nThe Path to the Longer -Run  \nWhile these p olicy  rules are prescrib ing higher short -term interest rates , the FOMC has \ndetermined that the path for raising rates will be a gradual  one. Part of the reason for a gradual \napproach is risk management. Moving too quickly could potentially risk slowing economic \nactivity , which obviously would not be an objective of monetary policy given current growth and \ninflation rates . A more rapid increase in short -term rates also could pose risks to financial \nstability  after an extended period of near zero rates . \nWhile I support th is gradual approach , the current readings for inflation and \nunemployment rel ative to the FOMC’s mandate d objectives  argue for more than just one move \nper year , as has been the case over the previous two years . This pace has left the current stance of \npolicy more accommodative than advocated by most policy rules and the funds rate well below \nits longer -run level, a discrepancy I see as important to  remedy in order  to preserve longer -run \nprice stability  and sustainabl e growth . \nIn considering the path to more normal interest rate settings, some have questioned \nwhether monetary policy is truly stimulative given that unusually low rates have not generated \nthe same kind of growth or inflation experienced in the past . One explanation is that certain \nfeatures of the economy may have changed , and that these changes are reflected in a measure \nknown as  the natural rate of interest. For example, short -term interest rates adjusted for inflation  \n– that is, real rates – have been n egative for many  years . When real rates are low, but the \neconomy is not growing rapidly, the  implication is that the  natural rate of interest is quite low. \n\n7 \n Although not observable,  movements in the natural rate  are presumed to occur gradually, \nsuggest ing current low level s will persist and result in a lower  longer -run federal funds rate than \nin the past. The implication of a lower natural interest rate would mean that today’s monetary \npolicy settings , although low by historical standards , might not be as stimulative as policy rules \nsuggest.  \nWhat would cause the economy to change in such a way ? There are likely any number of \nreasons, but one that seems plausible is that productivity growth has not been as strong as it was \nin previous decade s. Slower productivity growth, which has been an ongoing issue for the \neconomy  for some time , means the supply side of the economy also is grow ing more slowly. As \na result, moderate economic growth may be sufficient to absorb slack  and could  even cause the  \neconomy to outrun its potential . In fact, we see this today in some measures of what is called the \noutput gap , which captures the difference between th e level of economic activity and what the \neconomy can produce at full employment . For example, the Feder al Reserve Bank of San \nFrancisco produces a measure of the output gap  and natural rate . They show that 2 percent \ngrowth the past few years has actually been higher than the economy’s potential and in fact, the \namount of economic activity is currently above  its potential level. These circumstances often \nlead to price pressures and higher inflation.  \nPulling the pieces together, then, how should monetary policy respond in a setting with a \nlow natural rate of interest and s low productivity growth, but with the economy growing  faster \nthan its potential? Again, we can glean insight from Taylor rules, which still would prescribe a \nhigher federal funds rate in the near -term to ensure economic activity does not too far exceed its \npotential capacity, but that  rate might top out at a level  below what we have seen in the past. \nThat is, the longer -run level of the funds rate could be lower than in previous decades.  \n\n8 \n The case for a much lower natural rate of interest seems plausible to me, but it puts a \ngreat deal of weight on estimate s that are subject to considerable uncertainty . History has shown \nthat deviating from long -run variables can increase risk to desired economic outcomes . My own \nview is that policy must still adjust from its current settings  in order to  “promote effectively the \ngoals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long -term interest rates” as \nspecified by the Federal Reserve Act . So while I see a gradual approach to raising rates as \nappropriate, I see more than one move per year , as h as been the case,  as needed to achieve the \nFOMC’s objectives .  \n \nConclusion  \nEconomic expansion over the past seven years has brought the labor market and inflation \nto levels consistent with the FOMC’s longer -run objectives . In this environment, p olicy rules  \npoint to higher rates, and there is reason to believe they are fairly signaling . To be sure, t he \noutlook for the economy does not call for tight policy by any means, but a gradual and deliberate \nmove to more normal rates is necessary  to limit the risk of creating imbalances and financial \nstability risks that could surface in undesirable ways.",

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJuly 12, 2017  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Economic Forum  \nDenver, Colo.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal \nReserve System, its governors, officers or representatives.  \n \n                                                           \n1 A. Lee Smith and Timothy Todd assisted in preparing these remarks.  \n\n1 \n I want to thank you for the opportunity to join you today. The Denver Branch of the \nFederal Reserve Bank of  Kansas City was created to serve as the central bank’s connection to \nportions of the Mountain West that are within the Tenth Federal Reserve Distric t – Colorado, \nWyoming and n orthern New Mexico. To help us fulfill that responsibility, we rely heavily on o ur \ncontacts from within this community, including many joining us here  today , as well as others \nacross  the region to provide us with insight on emerging financial and economic conditions. The \ncontributions by these individuals are extremely important to me  in my responsibilities \nrepresenting this  region in Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) deliberations , and I want to \nexpress my thanks to those who provide this valuable input . \nToday, I would like to talk  about a topic that has been receiving much attenti on — the \nFederal Reserve’s balance sheet  – and what it means when policymakers talk about its \nnormalization  and ceasing reinvestments . Large scale asset purchases  (LSAPs) , better known as \nquantitative easing , or QE, have transformed the Fed’s balance sheet  and sparked active debate, \nboth within and outside the FOMC, about the costs and benefits of this unconventional monetary \npolicy  that was deployed during and after the financial crisis . Given the juncture we are at in the \nprocess of normali zing monetary policy , now is a useful time to revisit these issues  based on \nwhat we know — and what we have yet to learn — about using the Federal Reserve’s balance \nsheet in this way . \nBecause the majority of my regional contacts are neither central bankers nor economists, \nI have focused my remarks today on providing a basic foundation for understanding this headline \nissue . I’ll begin my comments with a primer on the nature of the Federal Reserve’s assets and \nliabilities . Then, I will describe how the Fed’s balan ce sheet changed starting in 2008 based on \nFOMC decisions to make credit easier and provide more accommodation to the economy . \n\n2 \n Finally, I’ll discuss some of the  key issues policymakers are considering today and what I see as \npossible implications.  \n \nInside the N umbers  \nUnderstanding the Fed’s balance sheet requires some understanding of t he Federal \nReserve System structure designed by Congress in 1913 . The Fed  consists of a government \nagency in Washington, D.C.  known as The Federal Reserve Board o f Governors,  and 12 \nseparately -incorporated, nationally -chartered Reserve Banks. When we talk about the Federal \nReserve’s balance sheet today , we are actually referring to the combined  balance sheets of the 12 \nindividual regional Federal Reserve Banks .  \nThis combined  balance sheet is audited annually by an independent  audit firm, currently \nKPMG , and is made available to the public on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \nSystem’s website: www.federalreserve.gov . Also  on this website are unaudited quarterly \nfinancial report s that include the combined  balance sheet. And each week, generally late on \nThursday afternoon, changes to the Fed’s balance sheet are published on the website in the H.4.1 \nstatistical release,  known as “Factors Affecting Reserve Balances .”  \nThe current  $4.5 trillion balance sheet  certainly stands out . The Fed’s assets primarily \ninclude a securities portfolio  of System Open Market Account (SOMA) holdings . The Fed’s \nliabilities primarily consist of Federal Reserve notes in circulation and depository institution \ndeposits.2 \n                                                           \n2 Additional details on the composition of assets and liabilities in the Fed’s combined balance sheet at March 31, \n2017 can be found in the unaudited quarterly financial report, which is available online at: \nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/files/quarterly -report -20170331.pdf  \n \n\n3 \n What is unique about the Fed’s  balance sheet is its ability to  expand  and shrink as needed \nto facilitate the conduct of  monetary policy  in response to economic conditions . Conventional \nmonetary policy involves the buying and selling of securities. At the conclusion of each FOMC \npolicy meeting, a directive is communicated to the Federal Reserve’s open market desk, which is \nbased at the New  York Fed. This directive also is communicated publicly in the FOMC’s post \nmeeting statement, which is heavily covered by the financial press.  \nIn the case of a conventional policy tightening, the Fed’s open market desk will sell \nsecurities . The funds recei ved from those sales will then be removed from circulation, reducing \nthe overall amount of available reserves  in the banking system . The resulting smaller pool of \nreserves from which to lend  increa ses the cost of borrowing – or to put it more clearly,  interest \nrates move higher . If the FOMC decides to ease monetary policy, this process would work in \nreverse, with the Fed buying securities.  \nThe Federal Reserve’s balance sheet has grown considerably over the past decade. At \nnearly  $4.5 trillion, it represents almost 25 percent of the nation’s Gross Domestic Product \n(GDP)  compared to  just 6 percent of GDP in 2007 . Liabilities of the Fed at that time were \ncomprised almost entirely of currency in circulation with reserves averaging about  $10 billion.  \nToday , reserves total more than $2 trillion. These reserves were created  by the Fed  to finance the \npurchase  of long -term Treasury and agency debt during multiple rounds of  large scale asset \npurchases , also known as  LSAPs . Although  the Fed stopped its program of expansionary bond \npurchases in October 2014, it has continued to reinvest the returns it receives from the maturing \nsecurities. As  a result, the current size and composition of the balance sheet has remained \nunchanged for mo re than 2 ½ years.  \n \n\n4 \n The Shift to Unconventional P olicy  \nIn the pre -crisis monetary policy framework, the Fed adjusted its holdings of Treasury \nsecurities t o affect the amount of reserves in the banking system  through the process I explained \nearlier . Due to the low level of  excess  reserves banks held  at that time , modest adjustments in the \nsize of the Fed’s balance sheet influenced the federal funds rate , which is the rate that banks lend \ntheir reserves to each other overnight . When t his was the key mechanism  to influence monetary \npolicy , open market operations required a relatively small balance sheet  with assets  comprised \nprimarily of short -term Treasuries. However, this pre -crisis framework was challenged during \nthe global  financial crisis.  \nIn December 2008 , the economic outlook deteriorated to the point that the FOMC voted \nto target a federal funds rate of zero to 25 basis points. Despite these extraordinarily low short -\nterm interest rates, longer -term rates for consumers and firms remained well above zero.  The \ncombination of weakening economic conditions and effectively constrained short -term policy \nrates led the Federal Reserve to pursue a strategy of LSAPs  to further ease monetary conditions .  \nBy the nature of the fed funds rate, traditional monetary policy has a more substantial  \ninfluence on the short -term securities market , providing a base from which yields extend across \nthe curve . LSAPs were designed explicitly to depress yields on longer -term securities through \nthe purchase of  large quantities of assets. The initial round of purchases, which commenced in \nDecember of 2008, primarily targeted mortgage -related securities in an effort to put downward \npressure on mortgage rates and to help stabilize housing and financial markets. Ho wever, \nsubsequent rounds of asset purchases included longer -term Treasury securities in a bid to ease \nbroader financial conditions and foster overall economic activity. In these latter rounds of \npurchases, LSAPs evolved from a crisis response mechanism to a more general policy tool used \n\n5 \n to promote the Federal Reserve’s mandate  to foster maximum sustainable employment and stable \nprices.  \n \nJudging t he Benefits and C osts of LSAPs  \nThe use of the balance sheet as an instrument of monetary policy in this manner marked \nan important shift . With no experience on which to rely, the FOMC’s decision to undertake \nbalance sheet po licy was not taken lightly. Arguments in favor of expanding the balance sheet \nfocused on the notion that by depressing longer -term yields and e asing credit conditions , the \nFOMC could provide some stimulus to support the economic recovery. On the other hand , it was \nrecognized that there could be  nontrivial costs associated with providing this experimental \nstimulus . These costs stemmed from the uni ntended consequences LSAPs could have on the \neconomy and financial markets , and the complexities associated with employing and exiting \nfrom such unconventional policy . Ultimately, the FOMC deemed the benefits would outweigh \nthe costs.  \nWhile i t is likely premature to fully judge the  extent of the benefits versus the  costs of \nLSAPs , a consensus of research does suggest  that the expansion of the Federal Reserve’s balance \nsheet has depressed longer -term interest rates . This has eased financial conditions ,3 although \nsome of this effect assumes that the Federal Reserve will hold the assets it purchase d for a \nprolonged period of time  independent of economic conditions.   \nResearch by my staff suggests that the Fed’s asset holdings continue to place downward \npress ure on longer -term rates today  – as they were intended to do .4 This effect , however, has the \n                                                           \n3 See, for example , Taeyoung Doh,  “The Efficacy of Large -Scale Asset Purchases at th e Zero Lower Bound ,” \nEconomic Review, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Q2 2010. Also,  the Macro Bulletin cited below.  \n4 See, for example , Troy Davig and A. Lee Smith , “Forecasting the Stance of Monetary Policy under Balance Sheet \nAdjustments ,” Macro Bulle tin, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, May 10, 2017.  \n\n6 \n potential to introduce new threats to economic stability going forward . Holding long-term rates  \nbelow the level that they  might otherwise move to  naturally , amidst improving economic \nfundamentals , risks creating financial imbalances . History reminds us  that it may be difficult to \ndetect such imbalances in real time and that they can only become apparent well after they \nmanifest . Looking across a spectrum of a sset classes today, from real estate to equities to \ncorporate bonds, there is reason to remain vigilant despite the apparent tranquility in financial \nmarkets.  \nIn addition to the potential costs associated with using LSAPs, some costs have becom e \nincreasing ly visible as the FOMC begins  to normalize monetary policy. For example, a large \nbalance sheet has made monetary policy more complex today than it was a decade ago. From an \noperational  standpoint, the Federal Reserve has had to rethink its traditional approach to \ntargeting  the federal funds rate in an environment of abundan t reserves. In the process, the \nFederal Reserve has engaged an expanded set of counterparties and thereby e xpanded its \nfootprint in certain financial markets.  \nFrom a communications persp ective, the existence of multiple policy instruments has \nmade explaining  the FOMC’s monetary policy strategy to the public more complicated. With the \nintroduction of LSAPs , the FOMC’s post -meeting statements became lengthier .5 These \nstatements now include not only the traditional policy directive and relevant details regarding \neconomic conditions a nd the outlook, but also address securities holdings acquired under the \nLSAPs.  \n \n                                                           \n5 The first post -meeting  public  statement , issued in 1994 , was a total of about 100 words. The length of policy \nstatements in recent years has increased to average more than 600  words.  \n\n7 \n The Process of Normalizing the Balance S heet \nAt its June 2017 meeting , the FOMC outlined its planned approach for reducing its \nTreasury and agency portfolio. Once initiated, the Committee intends to limit the pace at which \nthe FOMC’s portfolio is unwound by gradually decreasing its reinvestment of the principal \npayments received from maturing securities. Specifically, such payments will be reinvested only \nto the extent that they exceed preset rising caps , allowing the balance sheet to shrink  in a slow \nand largely predictable manner.  \nWhile the “how” of balance sheet normalization has be en largely established, the “when” \nand the “how much” remain to be determined . In terms of “when ,” the FOMC has indicated it \nexpects to begin implementing a balance sheet normalization program this year, provided the \neconomy evolves broadly as anticipated . One reason I favor shrinking the balance sheet sooner \nrather than later is the observed  disconnect between short -term rates and long -term rates. Despite \nfour 25 -basis -point increases in the target funds rate since December of 2015, longer -term yields \nrema in little changed.  \nAccording to the FOMC’s Summar y of Economic Projections (SEP), the median forecast \nin the so -called “dot plot” anticipates another 25 -basis -point increase in the funds rate this year \nand three more increases next year. If further increa ses in the target funds rate fail to transmit to \nlonger -term yields, the yield curve could flatten further . Such a rate environment can distort \ninvestment decisions. To the extent that reducing our asset holdings will apply some modest \nupward pressure to l onger -term interest rates, balance sheet normalization could promote the  \nmore  typical transmission of short -term interest rate changes throughout the yield curve and \nensure that all components of policy accommodation are removed in a gradual manner.  \n\n8 \n The qu estion of “how much” the Fed’s balance sheet will shrink also is an important \naspect of policy normalization , but has yet to be determined . The FOMC has said that it \nanticipates reducing the amount of reserves, over time, to a level appreciably below that seen in \nrecent years but larger than before the financial crisis . The ultimate size of the Fed’s balance \nsheet will be influenced by a number of factors, including the public’s demand for currency in \ncirculation, decisions the FOMC makes about its securiti es portfolio and its long -run operating \nframework , and  the economy . To improve the public’s understanding of balance sheet \ndevelopments, t he Federal Reserve Bank of New York ’s public website was  recently updated \nwith projections for the long -run size of the Federal Reserve ’s balance sheet .6   \n \nGauging the Implications of Balance Sheet N ormalization  \nI support th e FOMC’s approach to balance sheet normalization and favor initiating the \nprocess in the near future , although  I would  have  prefer red to be starting the process with a \nsmaller balance sheet than exists today . As a voting member of the FOMC  in 2013 , I voted \nagainst  the continuation of the asset purchase program known popularly as QE III. By then, \nfinancial markets were stable and the economy was growing . My concerns about the expansion \nof the Fed’s balance sheet under those conditions  centered on many of the issues I’ve discussed \ntoday. In my view, the possible unintended side effects of the ongoing asset purchases posed \nrisks to economic and financial s tability and served to unnecessarily further complicate future \nmonetary policy. I remain reluctant to advocate for the use of LSAP s in the future  outside \nextraordinary circumstances . \n                                                           \n6 http://libert ystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2017/07/just -released -updated -soma -portfolio -and-income -\nprojections.html  \n\n9 \n It could prove to be the case that my concerns were misplaced . Certainly today’s \nfinancial markets are calm  and labor markets remain robust . Recent “stress tests” suggest that the \nlargest U.S. banks are healthy for the most part . I hope such conditions point to a path of \ncontinued, stable economic growth .  \nYet, my experience reminds me that imbalances can develop in sectors outside the lens of \nregulators and , as we witnessed a decade ago , can  unwind with little warning . The current \ncombination of asset valuations —influenced  in part by LSAPs — together with low levels of \nimplied  volatility in equity and bond markets , could be signal ing broader complacency in \nfinancial markets. For example, the failure of longer -term rates to move up with short -term rates \nduring this normalization cycle illustrates the risk for a disruptive repric ing of assets as markets \nadjust to a more normal policy stance. The potential for such disruption highlights the essential \nnature of ensuring that our largest banks are indeed  well capitalized  and able to withstand the \nrepercussions of a financial shock . Although often noted as higher than a decade ago , equity \ncapital levels in these banks remain well below levels held by the nation’s community banks .7  \nAssuring s trong  capital is particularly critical in light of focused efforts to ease various \nregulatory mechanisms that are designed to off set the systemic risk these large banks pose to the \nnation’s economy . \nAt the same time, the FOMC faces the unprecedented task of normalizing multiple \ndimensions of policy without impeding the economic expansion . Moving too fast could \nexcessively tighten financial conditions and slow the economy. Moving too slow ly could cause a \nrelatively tight labor market to become further stretched beyond what is sustainable in the \nlonger -run. In either case, history shows tha t a policy mistake  can invite a recession .  \n \n                                                           \n7 FDIC Global Capital Index: https://www.fdic.gov/about/learn/board/hoenig/global.html  \n\n10 \n Conclusion  \nEven as short -term interest rates rise, monetary policy remains accommodative . Making \nadjustments to the Fed’s sizeable balance sheet is a necessary  but unfamiliar  part of the FOMC’s \npolicy process . As a result, the Committee has adopted a gradual  approach to its policy \nnormalization  approach . Removing accommodation in small doses , consistent with the pace of \nimprovement in the economy’s fundamentals , should allow Fed policy to evolve from fueling an \neconomic expansion to  sustain ing it.",

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMay 4, 2017  \nFaster Payments Task Force Meeting  \nChicago, Ill.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the \nFederal Reserve System, its governors, officers or representatives.  \n \n\n1 \n Good morning.  It is my pleasure to join you today  to recognize the tremendous \ncontributions you’ve made to this public -private effort aimed at improving t he nation’s \npayments infrastructure .  This is one of the most ambitious undertakings in the history of \nour country’s payment s system and one that is essential to the growing and evolving \ndemands of businesses and consumers .  I also want to thank Gordon Werkema and his \nteam  for the expertise and leadership they’ve brought to this engagement  on behalf of the \nFede ral Reserve . \nCharting a course for faster payments has been demanding, but the progress \nwe’ve seen is rewarding .  It signals that even as more work lies ahead, we can build on \nthe experience of the past two years to achieve the desired outcomes  identified in the \n2015 paper Strategies for Improving the U.S. Payment  System .  This morning, I’d like to \ntalk briefly about the progress achieved to date  and then offer my thoughts on  the road \nahead for the Fed eral Reserve  and the payments industry .  \nBefore I continue, now would be a good time to remind  you that the views I \nexpress here  are my own and not those of others in the Federal Reserve System.  \n \nProgress report  \nIn 2012, the Fed eral Reserve  was among those noting that the U.S. payment \nsystem was undergoing a period of rapid change , and contemplating the implications . \nConsumers and businesses were turning increasingly to e -commerce and Internet -enabled \ntechnologies.  In the midst of this transition, payment security was being challenged by \nnew, dyn amic, and escalating threats.  \nTraditional payment services had been adj usting slowly to these changes , while \nemerging players were coming to market with innovative product offerings .  Avoiding \n\n2 \n fragmentation and facilitating end -to-end adoption required a more coordinated rather \nthan organic approach  to ensure that issues of access and security could be broadly \nconsidered . \nA path forward took shape with extensive industry dialogue in the form of the \nStrategies for Improving the U.S. Payment System  paper pub lished in 2015.  Within the \npaper were strategies based on five desired outcomes for improvements in the following \nareas: speed, security, efficiency, cross -border payments and industry collaboration.  \nAs this group knows better than anyone, industry stake holders and the Federal \nReserve have invested significantly over the past two years in efforts to advance toward \nthe desired outcomes outlined in that paper.  While some thought our efforts would fall \nvictim to proprietary interests and a lack of cooperati on, substantial measureable progress \nhas been made on a number of issues and there is significant momentum towards \naddressing some of the more intractable issues that will demand a more sustained focus.  \nEarlier this year , the Task Force released Part One  of its final report and I look \nforward to seeing Part Two  when it becomes available this summer .  Once completed, \nthis document will share assessments of proposals for faster payments solutions and \nrecommend next steps for the industry to take to achieve safe and accessible faster \npayments capabilities.  Together, these documents will provide a comprehensive report of \nthe Task Force’s work.  Feedback from private sector providers suggests they have found \nthis work to be worthwhile and promising  as they see k to design and deliver faster \npayment capabilities to end users.  \nOf course , while th e Task Force has been at work  on these issues , the payment s \nsystem has continued to evolve .  Innovation and new capabilities have emerged from the \nprivate sector and the Federal Reserve also has continued to improve the services it \n\n3 \n provides .  For example, same -day ACH credit payments began flowing through the \nnetworks last fall, with 13 million payments cleared same -day in the first 100 days.  \nAlthough not real -time, this development is an important and tangible step toward faster  \npayments in the United States.  Additionally, g lobal messaging standards (ISO 20022) \nhave been adopted for better interoperability .  Innovations in the card space now facilitate \nreal-time P2P tran sfers via credit push.  And many fintech and social media entities are \ndelivering payment services with some real -time attributes through stored value or card \non file models.  The payments industry is also exploring models that leverage virtual \ncurrency an d distributed ledger technology in delivering faster payment solutions.  \n \nThe Road Ahead  \nWhile the efforts of the Federal Reserve and the Faster Payments Task Force have \ndriven significant progress , we recognize that the desired outcomes identified in the 2015 \npaper have yet to be realized .  With continuing technological innovation and the \nemergence of new potential security threats, real work remains if we are to achieve and \nmaintain a safe, ubiquitous, faster payments capability.  \nOngoing innovation and m arket activity, including a variety of proposals \nreviewed by the Task Force , suggests the potential for multiple solutions in the faster \npayments market.  However, the lack of established industry standards and rules could \nhinder interoperability  of these solutions, resulting in fragmentation and inhibiting \ncompetition over time .  Such conditions could  negatively affect the ability to “pay \nanyone” and constrain access and adoption. Study of the payment system also teaches \nthat over time, consolida tion of providers seeking economies of scale and scope may \noccur, adversely affecting competition, an essential ingredient to innovation and serving \n\n4 \n the needs of consumer and business end users.  I am encouraged by the amount of \nattention that you’ve given to considering these kinds of critical issues  and challenges . \nFurther progress is needed in other aspects as well .  As highlighted in the \nStrategies paper, developing settlement services to support real -time payments  is yet to \nbe addressed .  Faster payment  capabilities that rely on current settlement systems would \nhave end user service gaps or real -time end user service offerings with deferred \nsettlement.  Deferred interbank settlement could create credit or liquidity risks for \nfinancial institutions and po tential risk for the financial system.  We will continue to \nwork with the industry to understand such issues  as solutions are implemented.  \n \nThe Federal Reserve’s role  \nOver the next decade, I anticipate that changes to the payment s system will only \naccelerate, but in uncertain ways .  As it has done in the past, the nature of the Federal \nReserve ’s engagement going forward will likely evolve.  \nThe Faster Payments Task Force is only the most recent example  of the \ncooperation between the Fed eral Reserve  and the private sector that has historically \ncontributed to a more efficient and effective payments system .  This history include s the \ndevelopment of routing numbers, the growth of the automated clearing house network \nand the crafting of Check 21 legislatio n. \nA secure and smooth -functioning payments system is a critical component of \neconomic growth and stability.  Recognizing this, the Federal Reserve has sought to \npromote its “integrity and efficiency  … and to ensure the provision of payment services \nto all depository institutions on an equitable basis … in an atmosphere of competitive \n\n5 \n fairness.”1    \nThe Federal Reserve’s dual role as an operator and regulator  in the U.S. payments \nsystem is  often viewed as unique  relative to approaches in other countries .  Throughout \nU.S. history, consumers, merchants, financial institutions, policymakers and others have \ngrappled with the question of who is ultimately responsible for what congressional \nleaders in 1913 called the “highways of commerce .”  From the chaos of the early 19th \ncentury through  today’s digital transactions, there has been a spirited deb ate over the \ncentral bank’s roles and responsibilities.2   \nToday’s  active participation in a range of activities  position s the Federal Reserve \nto bring perspective and insight to the challenges and emerging issues affecting the \npayments landscape .  While some public authorities in other countries have acted based \non explicit mandates, the Fed eral Reserve has leveraged the experience of its existing \ncentral bank roles to serve as a catalyst for critical improvement to the payments systems.  \nIn this role, we have facilitate d the important work of the more than 300 individuals \ninvolved in the Task Force.  And, as is noted in the strategies paper, the Federal Reserve \nremains  committed to serving as a leader, convener and catalyst as appropriate to foster a \nwell-functioning payments system for the public . \nI very much look forward to continuing our work  with the industry to shape  the \nnecessary improvements in our  payments system that support confidence, economic \ngrowth and global competitiveness going forwa rd. \n                                                           \n1 The Federal Reserve in the Payments System , revised 1990  \n2 See: Medley, Bill.

            "content": "Evaluating the Balance of Economic Risks and Monetary Policy  \n \nRemarks by  \n \nEsther L. George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMay 9, 2017  \n \nRipple Effects  \nThe University of California, Santa Barbara’s 36th Annual South County Economic Summit  \nSanta Barbara, Calif.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve \nSystem, its g overnors, officers or representatives.  \n \n \n\n \n \n1 \n It’s a pleasure to join you today  for this annual Economic Summit . As a Federal Reserve \npolicymaker, I took particular note of the theme for this year’s event . Thinking about the ripple \neffects of monetary policy is  something that occupies a great deal of my time and focus . Not only \nconsidering how those effects ripple through the economy but also how they ripple through time \nand the implications that those policy actions can have well into the future.  \nToday, I am go ing to be sharing with you my views on recent economic developments \nalong with my thoughts on the outlook for the national economy and the appropriate course of \nmonetary policy. I want to stress that these views are my own and not those of the Federal \nRese rve System.  \n \nThe U.S. Economic Outlook  \nThe U.S. economy’s average 2 percent growth rate is quite modest by historical \nmeasures . Expansions dating back to 1961 have produced growth of some 4.1 percent  on \naverage . But what this current expansion has lacked in strength, it has made up for in longevity . \nApril  marks the 94th consecutive month of growth, making it the third -longest U.S. expansion on \nrecord going back to about 1850 .  \nOver this recovery, the  U.S. economy has witnessed a remarkable impro vement in labor \nmarkets . The unemployment rate has fallen from a peak of 10 percent to 4. 4 percent today.  \nGranted, this is a broad measure , and it is true that some areas of the labor market could benefit \nfrom further improvement . Rather than picking and choos ing which indicators best describe the \nstate of the labor market , Kansas City Fed staff looked at how we could summarize 24 different \nlabor market variables  by creating two indicators : one that looks at the level of labor market \nactivity , and the  other at the momentum of that activity . The most recent results confirm \n\n \n \n2 \n continued strength . Both indicators were above their  historical average s, suggesting a somewhat \n“tight” labor market with forward momentum pointing to continued improvement.  In fact, the \nmomentum indicator is at its highest lev el in the history of the series, which goes back to the \nearly 1990s.  \n With labor markets showing little or no slack, why then did real Gross Domestic Product \n(GDP)  only grow 0.7 percent in the first qua rter?  Importantly, does  this weakness call for the \nFederal Reserve to pause its process of normalizing monetary policy?   \nFor a number of reasons , I think the answer is “No .”  \n First, some of the weakness reflects unusually mild winter weather that led consumer \nspending on housing and utilities to  decline sharply in  the first quarter. Although such an effect \ntemporarily reduces measured output, it is  clearly not cause for concern. In fact, household \nsaving increased  by over half of a percentage point bet ween December and March, likely \nreflecting lower utility bills.  \nThe second reason  is a more  technical one  – what economists call “residual seasonality .” \nNamely, despite the best effort of statisticians to smooth through predictable seasonality , we \nhave seen a pattern emerge in recent years in which measured growth is weak er in the first \nquarter than it is  during  the rest of the year . I suspect  we are seeing  this same dynamic , at least in \npart, in 2017.   \nThe third reason is that economic data is subject to dips and spikes . Despite best efforts, \nmeasuring a dynamic, $ 19 trillion dollar economy is an extremely difficult task . As a result, w e \nshould be ca reful not to overreact to  every move in reported data. To illustrate some of the \nchallenges in me asuring economic activity, m y staff recently issued a report on the so -called \nsharing economy,  a business model in which customers who are looking for rides  or rooms, \n\n \n \n3 \n among other goods and services, are matched with providers via online platforms.1 While this \ntype of activity remains too small to affect our understanding of recent macroeconomic trends, \nthe report highlights some of the difficulties statisticians face when trying to capture emerging \neconomic trends .  \nAs we consider these factors  affecting the nation’s GDP , we are likely seeing a \nsignificant amount of noise. The core signal, I believe, may have more strength than what we are \ncurrently able to determine.  \nStill, interpreting the data is a balancing act . Just as one should not overreact t o each \nsingle data point , it is important to watch for signal s that could mark a turn in the economy . For \nexample , one area I am watching closely is auto sales. After setting a record last year with 17.5 \nmillion light weight vehicles sold, the pace of vehi cle sales slowed  in the first quarter. Recently -\nreleased data for April  did rebound a bit to just under 17 million on an annualized basis, but sales \nremain below last year’s level . Some cooling raise s questions about softening consumer  demand . \nOn the other  hand , indicators of consumer sentiment remain high, gas prices remain low , \nhousehold balance sheets are, on average, healthy and other fundamentals suggest consumers \nhave the ability to continue spending.  \nAll told, w hile the recent GDP report  and auto sal es may be flashing yellow, numerous \nother indicators remain solid  green. In particular, consumer and business confidence remain \nstrong, as do s urveys of business conditions . For example, the  ISM manufacturing index, which \nsurveys manufacturing firms across the U.S. about business conditions, has been signaling a \nstrengthening manufacturing sector over the last eight months . Its nonmanufacturing counterpart, \nwhich covers the broader se rvices s ectors , has also been solid as of late .  \n                                                           \n1 Redmond, Michael. 2017 . “Waiting for a Pickup: GDP and the Sharing Economy ,” Federal Reserve Bank of \nKansas City, The Macro Bulletin , April.  \n\n \n \n4 \n Likewise, global economic conditions have improved, supporting exports, and downside \nrisks posed by China and Europe have diminished . Given the strength of fundamentals across a \nrange of sectors, I expect the econom y to continue growing at a slightly above -trend rate.  \nWith this outlook, I view inflation  dynamics as broadly consistent with the Federal \nReserve’s goal of price stability . Personal consumption expenditure ( PCE) inflation was 1.8 \npercent over the past yea r after averaging just 1 percent for much of 2016 , and core inflation has \nbeen trending up . Its unexpected decline in March  appears to reflect some one -off factors as \nopposed to broader disinflationary pressure . It seems reasonable to l ook through this volatility, \nwith labor markets continuing to improve, and longer -term inflation expectations staying \nanchored near 2 percent.  \n \nThe Balance of Risks  \n Developing an outlook for the economy requires not only judging the health of the \neconomy over a medium -term horizon, but also requires an assessment of the nature of risks to \nthat forecast . Now that the U.S. has  largely  recovered from the Great Recession  – the \nunemployment rate is below its estimated longer -run level , real gross domestic produ ct (GDP ) is \ngrowing slightly above its estimated trend, and inflation is near the Federal Open Market \nCommittee’s (FOMC)  longer -run objective of 2 percent  – I will turn to my thoughts on the \nbalance of risks . And here I would point out an important shift  in the FOMC’s assessment of \nrisks since it took its first steps to normalize monetary policy in December 2015 .  \nAt th at time, inflation was moving closer to the FOMC’s desired 2 percent objective , and \nthe labor market reflected substantial improvement . How ever, nearly half of the FOMC \n\n \n \n5 \n participants continued to view the risks to inflation as weighted to the downside – highlighting \nconcerns that inflation might start to move further below the objective.  \nA year later, with sustained improvements in the labor market and progress toward the \nCommittee’s inflation objective, the FOMC took a second step toward monetary policy \nnormalization , raising short -term interest rates another 25 basis points . By then , the assessment \nof risks had changed . An overwhelming majority of participants viewed  the risk to their inflation \nforecasts for 2017 as broadly balanced, and a few more  report ed that risks were weighted more \nto the upside  than the downside.   \nThe same is true for judgments about risk to the outloo k for the unemployment rate . A \nlarge majority currently  sees risks as broadly balanced, but a few participants see risks that the \nunemployment rate is more likely to be even lower than their projection.  \n The assessment that risks to the unemployment rate a re balanced right now  is a \nreasonable one, although having the unemployment rate fall below its longer -run level  is not \nwithout risk . At 4. 4 percent, the unemployment rate is  already below the FOMC’s median \nestimate of the longer -run unemployment rate , and overshooting poses risk to the sustainab ility \nof the expansion . Past e pisodes to push unemployment lower than its longer -run level have \nended in recession, and for that reason, adjusting policy to ensure the economy remains on a \nsustainable growth tr ajectory is of paramount importance.  \nOthers may argue that concerns about the economy potentially overheating  are \nexaggerated. For example, the link between low unemployment and rising wages is weaker than \nit was a few decades ago. This means tighter labo r markets may be  unlikely to generate as much \ninflation as in the past. While I acknowledge that the link between real activity and inflation \nappears to have diminished, there could very well be conditions when the relationship reasserts \n\n \n \n6 \n itself. That is, under tight labor markets, employees may find themselves with significantly more \nbargaining power to negotiate for higher wage s, which in turn could translate into more \ninflationary pressure.  \nAnother point often raised to suggest  the Fed eral Reserve  need not be overly concerned \nwith tight labor markets is that inflation has been running below the FOMC’s 2 percent goal  for \nan extended period . Such low rates of inflation seem to have lowered longer -run inflation \nexpectations. Given the infla tion goal is symmetric, meaning that the Committee gives equal \nweight to deviations above and below the goal, some argue there is scope to let inflation drift \nabove 2 percent for a time, particularly if it would help anchor expectations more firmly around \n2 percent.   \nI have not yet found this argument compelling . The most recent estimate from the Survey \nof Professional Forecasters points to future levels of inflation slightly  above the FOMC’s 2 \npercent goal. In fact, s ome consumer expectations of inflation have slipped, but not sufficiently \nto suggest they have become fundamentally unanchored from the inflation goal.  \n \nMonetary Policy  \nLast week, t he FOMC took no action  to change policy , although it remains on a path to \nremove accommodation in a gradual manner . Given my own economic outlook and assessment \nof the balance of risks, I support this policy path .  \nIt is worth noting that e ven as the FOMC has increased short -term rates , financial \nconditions remain accommodative . Looking a t the Kansas City Fed ’s Financial Stress Index , \nwhich synthesizes 11 financial market v ariables , the index has generally declined over the past \n\n \n \n7 \n six months despite two rate increases . Thus, t he modest amount of removal of monetary \naccommodation has had little notable effect on broader financial conditions.  \nLooking ahead, a  natural question is how gradual will the monetary policy normalization \nprocess be?  According to the Fed’s Survey of Economic Projections , the median calls for another \n2 moves this year  and f inancial markets appear to expect another 1 or 2 moves . The FOMC has \njudged that m oving gradually  is appropriate . Understandably, moving too aggressively risks \nslowing economic activity  or even derail ing the expansion . Removing accommodation in small \ndoses is consistent wi th the economy’s improving fundamentals  and perceived benign rates of \ninflation.  \nAlternatively , policy cannot move  too gradually. Postponing the removal of \naccommodation when the economy is at full employment and inflation near 2 percent poses  risks \nto longer-run economic and financial stability . Moving too slow ly carries the risk of pushing the \nunemployment rate below its sustainable rate  and inviting recession  as history shows . Failing to \nkeep interest rates in line with improving fundamentals also can distort the allocation of capital \ntoward less fruitful, or perhaps excessively risky, endeavors .  \nAs monetary policy continues on a gradual path of tightening, questions emerge about the \nimpact to those sectors of the economy that are especially interest r ate sensitive . This concern is \noften associated with the housing sector . However, I would note that t he housing market  has \nchanged significantly over the past decade. While demand fueled rising home prices  prior to the \nfinancial crisis , it seems that lack of supply is now the dominant factor. For example, research by \nmy staff suggests the number of households is at least 3.5 million below its trend, even after \naccounting for demographics and changes in preferences. The unmet demand for housing may \nface a more persistent lack of supply, due in part to limited land available for development  in \n\n \n \n8 \n desirable areas . Conditions vary across regions, but with a limited supply of housing  and a strong \nlabor market , prices are likely to continue rising  even as interest ra tes gradually go up . Even with \nsuch conditions, while h igher home prices may boost measures of household wealth, those  \nhouseholds that spend a relatively larger share of their income on shelter  will face challenges.  \n Finally, removing policy accommodation  goes beyond increasing the level of the federal \nfunds rate . The FOMC also must begin to adjust the size and composition of its securities \nholdings . The Federal Reserve’s balance sheet is currently about $4.5 trillion , or almost 25 \npercent of GDP compared to 6 percent of GDP 10 years ago . The composition of this balance \nsheet has changed as well . Ten years ago, the balance sheet was primarily comprised of short -\nterm Treasuries . Today, mortgage -backed a nd agency securities make up about 40 percent of \nassets .  \nWith these changes, the FOMC faces unprecedented challenges for its decision -making \ntoday, such as when to begin the process  of reducing the size and altering the composition , and \nhow to communicate the approach and the timing to the public . My own view is that the process \nshould begin sometime this year by reducing reinvestments in mortgage -backed securities \n(MBS)  and long -term Treasury securities . Once it begins, however, the runoff in the portfolio  \nshould be on autopilot and not reconsidered at  each subsequent FOMC meeting . Otherwise, the \nCommittee w ould need to re -evaluate and make adjustments that will potentially complicate \nmonetary policy and provide few benefits to the real economy.  \n \nConclusion  \nThe economy continues to expand as sustained j ob growth and solid gains in household \nspending  – the weak first quarter notwithstanding  – are mutually reinforcing. The international \n\n \n \n9 \n backdrop poses less downside risks today, further supporting growth at home. In this \nenvironment, the role for monetary p olicy is to support the sustainability of the expansion. \nTherefore, a s labor markets continue to tighten, continuing the gradual removal of monetary \naccommodation is the appropriate course for the FOMC.",

And its namesake, \nHenry Bloch , serves as a worthy example of the school ’s mission  to develop purposeful, \nentrepreneurial and innovative leaders to meet changing global demands, and advance \nknowledge and practice throug h excellent teaching, scholarship, outreach and service.  \nCongratulations. You’ve earned a college degree , and t hat achievement alone gives you \nan advantageous seat at the table of the U.S. economy . By completing a bachelor ’s or graduate \ndegree, your chances of getting a job are pretty good . Last year, the unemployment rate for \ncollege graduates was only 2.5 percent – it’s more than twice that rate for those with out that level \nof education . 1 And not only are your chances good for landing a job , it’s l ikely that you’ll be \npaid more for it . The median income of a worker  with a Bachelor’s or higher degree is more than \n40 percent above the overall median  income .2  \nThose facts paint a very favorable picture of your future .  Unfortunately , the advantages \nyou have today  are not guarantee s of future success . Take a careful look at your diploma . You \nwon’t see fine print with any such guarantee .  \nThat’s because t omorrow you will join the ranks o f millions of other college graduates  in \na workforce where more than one-third of all workers have at least as much education as you if \nnot more . So w hat happens from here is up to you, but that’s only partially true . Your lot in life \n                                                           \n1 Bureau of Labor Statistics d ata updated April 20, 2017 : https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat07.htm  \n2 Note workers age 25 and older.

To put it simply….. Life will happen.  \nSo what exactly does the path to success look like?  Here’s a spoiler alert . I think I know \nmost of the ingredients, but I don’t have the re cipe.  \nWhen I meet with n ew employees at the Kansas City Fed, they often  ask me about my \nown career path and whether I knew early on that I wanted to be the president and CEO of a \nFederal Reserve Bank . The truth is I had no such goal . In fact, I had neither  a plan nor a carefully \nconstructed series of strategic moves to reach the position I’m in today. I was focused on making \na living . Along the way, I worked hard and found the work I did meaningful and challenging. \nAnd each assignment became the rung to the  next one.  \nToday, as I look back at my own path, I can see that any measure of success I realized \nhad much to do with the experiences and lessons I learned along the way .  I’ve condensed those \nyears of experiences and lessons learned into f ive simple rules .  They’ve served me well. A nd as \nyou move into the ranks of the dreamers and doers , you might consider them:  \n1) Be prepared:  There really are no shortcuts to doing your best. Few people can  \nsuccessfully wing it. Most of us have to spend  time and make sacrifices to be prepared for that  \ninterview, to complet e a job assignment  on time , to earn a raise. But that preparation arms  you \nwith knowledge and gives you confidence.  \n2) Be flex ible:  Things won’t always go as planned. And sometimes, we bui ld plans that  \ncan fall apart. If you can learn to accept that  life is unpredictable and full of change, you’ll  be \nable to adapt and cope.  \n3) Be brave : You will have to make choices of consequence. It is not always clear what \nthe right answer is, but make s ure you ask  the right questions . And then choose.  \n\n4) Be humb le: Regardless of how confident you may be, you are not always right.  Listen \ncarefully to others. You might learn  something.  \n5) Be grat eful:  Everyday someone is doing work that makes your job easier, safer and \nless stressful. Look around you today —I suspect  some of those people are right here.  \n \nAs you come to this stage to accept your diploma today, I hope you enjoy the feeling of \naccomplishment . But I would encourage you not to confuse this ac hievement , and those to come , \nwith making your mark in other important ways . As you strive for success – and you should – \nkeep your focus on the things that define who you are and what you stand for :  your values, your \nintegrity, your work ethic , your service to others . These are within your control and these are \nwhat matter in the long run . If you focus on these , regardless of whether you achieve your best \ndreams and hopes, whether you get the next promotion, or secure wealth or fame, you will have \naimed for those things in a principled way .  \nJohn Adams, one of America’s founding fathers , expressed this sentiment well. During \nsome of the darkest days of the American Revolution, he worried about whether the struggle for \nindependence would be won . In a letter to his wife Abigail  in 1776 , he made a profound \nstatement when he wrote , “We can’t guarantee success, but we can deserve it.”  \nAnd so it is for each of you . The degree you are about to receive does not represent what \nyou know, but what you are capable of learning . So choose your path carefully .  Because t he \nworld is looking to you to tackle the challenges we face, to  repair the divisions  we see , and to \nbuild on the opportunities ahead of you . And whatever the outcome, and however success will be \ndefined for you, if you go about it in the right way, y ou too can deserve it.",

            "content": "Labor Market Trends and Monetary Policy  \n \n \n \nRemarks by  \n \nEsther L. George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOctober 5, 2017  \nInvesting in America’s Workforce Conference  \nAustin, Texas  \n \n \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal \nReserve System, its governors, officers or representatives.  \n\n 1 I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak here in Austin . Understanding the \ndynamics of the nation’s l abor market  plays an essential role in the work of the Federal Reserve \nand for me a s a regional Federal Reserve Bank president .  \nIn my role, I meet with business, labor  and community leaders  throughout the Federal \nReserve’s Tenth  District , which encompasses Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, \nWyoming, and portions of Missouri and New Mexico . I regularly  hear about  the importance of a \nstrong alignment between employer s’ needs and the skills available in the local labor force . The \nchallenge  is to find the best opportunities and partnerships across a wide range of organizations.  \nIn my remarks today, I’ll discuss the progress that has been made in the current economic \nexpansion toward full employment . I’ll then turn to longer -term shifts in th e types of jobs that \nare offered by employers, and how these shi fts in demand for skills have affected  workers . \nFinally, I’ll conclude my remarks with some comments on the  current stance of monetary policy \nas the Federal Reserve seeks to promote long -run s ustainable growth by foster ing maximum \nemployment and price stability.  \n \nLabor Market  Dynamics in the Current Economic Expansion  \n This is the 100th consecutive month of the ongoing economic expansion . In historical \nterms, it is the third -longest U.S. expansion on record going back to 1850 . Total employment has \nincreased on net by 17 million workers  since 2009 , which is double the number of jobs lost in the \nmost recent  recession. As employment has steadily increased, the unemp loyment rate has fallen \nfrom 10 percent in 2009 to its current level of 4.4 percent. This level of unemployment is below \nnearly all estimates of the natural rate of unemployment, which is the level of unemployment that \nis estimated to prevail in the longer  run in the absence of cyclical fluctuations.  \n\n 2  While the headline variables  indicate that much of the labor market has returned to pre -\nrecession levels, other indicators reveal broader  shifts taking place . For example, the percentage \nof people participati ng in the labor force has decline d notably since the recession and has not \nmade much of a recovery . In 2007, 66 percent of the U.S . adult population (ages 16 and over) \neither had a job or were actively looking for employment . By 2015, the labor force parti cipation  \nrate had declin ed to 62 percent —this represent s a shift of 10 million people out of the labor force  \nbased on our current population . A large portion of this decline wa s due to the aging of the \npopulation , with many baby boomers reaching retirement age . However, some of the decline was \ndue to workers being discouraged about their job prospects  and no longer seeking employment . \n Over the past two years, we have seen a modest pickup in the labor force partici pation \nrate, which is  a sign of improving  labor market conditions . Research by my staff has investigated \nthis improvement to better assess  its underlying dynamics.1 While an increase in the participation \nrate may seem to suggest a surge of new workers ente ring the labor force, entries actually slowed  \nin 2016 . The increase in the participation rate was instead a result of a decline in the number of \npeople exiting the labor force . This decline, in c ombination with steady increases  in employment, \nsuggests workers are now more attached to the labor force tha n in earlier years during  the \nrecovery . As workers are matched to better  and more stable jobs , the rotating  of workers in and \nout of employment and in and out of the labor force s lows . An additional contributing factor was \nthat the group experiencing the largest slowing  in labor force exits was the population aged 55 \nand older . This suggests that for older workers, the reduction in exits may indicate that some \nworkers were delaying  retirement decisions.  \n                                                        \n1 Tüzemen, Didem and Jonathan Willis. 2016. “ What is Behind the Recent Increase in Labor \nForce Participation ?” The Macro Bulletin , Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, November.   \n \n\n 3  \nJob Polarization  \n Despite  overall improvements in employment and the participation rate, we know there \nare still segments of the working -age population that have not experienced as much of a recovery  \nas we would like . This group has  been impacted by  longer -term trend s. In particular, workers in \nmiddle -skill jobs have seen the demand for their skills steadily decline . For decades, these jobs \nwere the gateway to the middle class.  \nThe decline in middle -skill jobs is the result of a number of sweeping changes affecting \nthe economy . If we look back to the 1980s, examples of middle -skill jobs that were much more \nprevalent than we see today include as sembly -line manufacturing jobs and clerical and \nadministrative positions. In 1983, nearl y 60 percent of all jobs were in middle -skill occupations.2  \nToday, that employment share has declined to 4 3 percent . Based on current employment levels, \nthis shift would be equivalent to moving 22 million jobs away from middle -skill occupations .  \nMany  of the employment opportunities in our economy have shifted toward high -skill \njobs, which are jobs that typically require a college education . Since 1983, the share of high -skill \njobs has increased from 26 percent to 39 percent .  \nWhat is perhaps more surp rising is what we have seen at the other end of the spectrum . \nThe share of employment for low -skill jobs has also increased, from 15 percent to 18 percent . \nWorkers in these jobs typically have little formal education beyond high school, and they work \nin oc cupations that are service -oriented and cannot be easily automated, such as food \npreparation, cleaning and  security services .  \n                                                        \n2 Tüzemen, Di dem and Jonathan Willis. 2013. “ The Vanishing Middle: Job Polarization and \nWorkers’ Response to the Decline in Middle -Skill Job s.” Economic Review , Federal Reserve \nBank of Kansas City , first quarter , pp. 5 -32.  \n \n\n 4 This shift of employment toward both high - and low -skill jobs and away from middle -\nskill positions  has been labeled “job polariz ation.”   \n \nJob Polarization: Gender and Race  \n As a result of this development , the current generation entering the workforce finds a \nvery different landscape than the  labor market of  the 1980s . How have new entrants to the labor \nforce adapted over time to be better prepared for the current labor market?   Understanding these \ntrends is particularly relevant to those of you  focused on developing today’s workforce .  \nI’d like to use two demographic lenses  to illustrate  how the population is adapting to job \npolar ization —looking first at shifts by gender and second at shifts by race.  \nOver  the past three decades, both men and women experienced declines  in the shares of  \nemployment in middle -skill jobs, but for different reasons. For women, t he main losses in the \nshare of middle -skill employment were in  office and administrative occupations, likely related to \nthe replacement of many secretarial and clerical jobs with desktop computing. For men, m ajor \nlosses were  in production occupations, likely related to the decline in employment in the \nmanufacturing industry.  \nWomen and men  responded very differently to these developments .  \nFor women, the decline was accompanied by an almost equally large increase in  the share \nof high-skill job s, particularly in  managerial, professional and technical occupations, such as \nengineering, finance, management  and medicine. Based on the shift, women today occupy a \nlarger portion of high -skill jobs compared to the 1980s.  \nFor men, the shift away from middle -skill occupati ons led to almost equal increases in \nthe shares of employment in both low- and high -skill occupations. Accordingly , a larger portion \n\n 5 of low-skill occupations , which are primarily service jobs, are held by men today as compared to \nthe 1980s.   \nGender differe nces in job shifts line up closely with gender differences in educational \nattainment. While levels of attainment increased for both male and female workers  over the past \nthree decades , the change was more pronounced for women. The strong shift toward high -skill \njobs for women  was associated with  a large increase in the share of women with a bachelor’s \ndegree or higher. Educational attainment of men has risen more modestly, in line with the \nsmaller shift of male employment toward high -skill jobs.   \n  While we see very different response s to job polarization between  men and women, the \nresponse s across racial groups are more similar, with difference s predominately reflecting \nhistorical  disparities in levels of educational attainment .  \nTo illustrate the response s to job polarization by race , I will fo cus on two groups, African \nAmerican and Caucasian workers , who together account for 9 0 percent of employment in the \nUnited States.  First, however, let me describe the terms and information I’ m using . The statistics \ncome from the Current Population Survey  (CPS) , which is the survey used to construct the \nunemployment rate . The terms I’ll use for race also require clarification . The term s African \nAmerican and black are used synonymously in  the official data collection and so I will use the \nterm black to mean African American and white to mean Caucasian . Finally, I’d like to note that \nin this survey, Hispanic workers account for 16 percent of total employment, and many  likely \nself-identify a s white when identifying  their race  in the survey . They have the option of \nidentifying as Hispanic in a separate question on ethnicity.  \n Over the past two decades, both white and black workers have experienced similar shifts \nin job opportunities consisten t with job polarization . Both groups experienced a significant \n\n 6 decline in the employment  share of middle skill jobs .3 And e mployment for both populations \nshifted toward high - and low -skill jobs, with a stronger shift toward high -skill jobs.  \n While employme nt shifts were similar, white workers have had a consistently larger \nshare of employment in high -skill occupations . In 201 7, 40 percent of white workers were \nemploy ed in high -skill jobs, relative to 30 percent of black workers . Both populations have a \nsimilar share of workers in middle -skill jobs —approximately 45 percent . This implies that there \nis a larger share of black workers in low -skill jobs than white workers:  24 percent of black \nworkers and 17 percent of white workers.  \n As employers have increas ed the share of high -skill jobs, workers have responded by \nobtaining higher levels of education than previous generations . The share of workers with a \nbachelor’s degree ha s increased by approximately  10 percentage points over the past two \ndecades for both black and white workers . But underlying this shift in educational attainment, a \npersistent education gap exists between black and white populations . In 201 7, 36 percent of \nwhite workers had a bachelor’s degree, relative to 2 8 percent of black workers.  \n The difference in  education al attainment  is very important . It is increasingly challenging \nfor a worker to obtain a high -skill job without having a bachelor’s degree . During the past 20 \nyears, workers with a high school diploma or some college education have experienced a \ndecrease in the likelihood of obtaining one of these jobs .  \nOf particular concern is the divergence in opportunities between those with a bachelor’s \ndegree and those with some college  education . For those with a college degree, the opportunit ies \nare clear: high -skill jobs . However, individuals with some college education  or an a ssociate ’s \n                                                        \n3Kansas City Fed  Economic Research Department. 2017 . “Assessing Differences in Labor \nMarket Outcomes Across Race, Age, and Educational Attainment .” Federal Reserve Bank of \nKansas City, Research Working Paper no. 17 -03, April.  \n\n 7 degree  are struggling to find good employment opportunities . Especially in the case of  black \nworkers, individuals with some college education are increasingly ending up in low -skill jobs.  \n The workforce development challenge  is steadily  shifting to how to best equip workers \nwith the skills in demand by employers . More than 60 percent of wor kers do not have a college \ndegree, and are thus most likely competing for middle -skill jobs . Employers will no longer \nsimply welcome a young worker with a high school diploma and say, “I’ll train you ,” but are  \nmore likely to ask, “What skills do you alread y have?” Young people  today who do not see \ncollege as their best path forward need to have better awareness and opportunities for vocational \ntraining  and post -high-school certification and training programs in areas such as skilled trades, \nhealthcare, and coding . With improved training, they will be better equipped for today’s middle -\nskill jobs, which despite declines,  still account for 4 3 percent of all jobs.  \n The Federal Reserve System is actively involved in a range of activities t o promote  better \noutcomes for workers . We are engaged in research, roundtable conversations with industry and \nlabor leaders, conferences like this one, and publications, such as our recent publication \nexploring workforce development policies for the 21st century.  \n \nThe Role of Monetary Policy  \n As the Federal Reserve determine s the appropriate settings for the nation’s monetary \npolicy, it must weigh a variety of economic factors, including the labor market trends that I have \ndescribed today . In the short run, I look a cross a wide range of business sectors and assess their \nperformance , monitoring their demand for workers in a tightening labor market and their capital \ninvestment plans . In the longer run, I evaluate trends such as job polarization and an aging \nworkforce , and consider what those structural forces imply for the Federal Reserve’s goals of \n\n 8 maximum employment and price stability . These are challenging economic factors  to evaluate, \nwith different  forces typically pushing the economy in different directions at the same time . \nMonetary  policy is a blunt tool with limited ability to influence any specific  segment of the \neconomy . It is most adept at addressing factors related to the business cycle and least adept at \naddressing  the longer -run trends such as  job polarization and an aging workforce.  \n For monetary policy makers, the key question centers on the appropriate level of \naccommodation , at this stage of the economic expansion , to best foster long -run sustainable \ngrowth . At the most recent  Federal Open Market Committee  (FOMC ) meeting, the Committee \nannounced plans to initiate its balance sheet normalization program in October . Large -scale asset \npurchases (LSAPs), better known as quantitative easing, or QE, transformed the size and \ncomposition of the Fed’s balance sheet from less than $1 trillion in mid -2008  to approximately \n$4.5 trillion today . This unconventional policy was implemented because the Federal Reserve’s \nconventional policy tool, the feder al funds target rate , had been lowered to zero in December \n2008 , and the Federal Reserve determined that additional measures were warranted . Beginning \nthis month, the FOMC plans to gradually reduce its securities holdings by decreasing \nreinvestment of the principal payments received from maturing securities . This gradual reduction \nin securities holdings will continue “until the FOMC judges that the Federal Reserve is holding \nno more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effe ctively.”  \nIn regard to interest rates, the FOMC has maintained a very accommodative stance of \npolicy up to this point . The target range for the federal funds rate was set at the zero lower bound \nfrom 2008 until the end of 2015 . Starting in December 2015, t he federal funds rate has been \nraised a total of four times to its  current target range of 1 to 1 ¼ percent . During this first phase of \n\n 9 monetary policy normalization, economic growth has remained above trend and the \nunemployment rate has declined from 5.0 p ercent to 4.4 percent.   \nLooking forward, policymakers face the challenge of setting the appropriate path of \ninterest rates to promote the FOMC’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability .  \nBased on my own economic outlook, further gradual rate a djustments will be needed to \nmove the federal fund s rate toward its longer -run level . With an economy growing at an above -\ntrend rate and unemployment at a low level , postponing the removal of accommodation poses \nrisks to sustainable growth and financial st ability . At this stage of the expansion, it is appropriate \nto move cautiously . But waiting too long  risks more aggressive moves , which , history shows can \ninvite  prospects of recession . And a continuation of current levels of accommodation risks \nsimilar distortions in capital allocation toward less fruitful, or perhaps excessively risky, \nendeavors that could result in financial imbalances.  \nMoving inte rest rates at a gradual pace toward a level consistent with longer -run growth \nis the best step to help pro mote a continuation of the economic expansion . For the Federal \nReserve, such efforts are the most likely course, in my view, to meet our long -run goals of \nmaximum employment and price stability . And by doing so, we can best foster conditions to \nsupport wor kforce development efforts to invest in workers and build a stronger econom y.",

            "content": "Monetary Policy in a Low  Inflation  Economy  \n \n \n \nRemarks by  \n \nEsther L. George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOctober 11, 2017  \nKansas City, Mo.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do  not necessarily reflect those of the Federal \nReserve System, its governors, officers or representatives.  \n  \n\n1 \n Thank you . It’s a lways a  pleasure to join you at the  Central Exchange .  \nThe U.S. economy has now entered its ninth year of expansion, and labor mark ets have \nnormalized . Real gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth has averaged 2. 1 percent over the last \nseven  years, and the unemployment rate has fallen from 10 percent in 200 9 to 4.2 percent today . \nOverall, the economy looks to be in good shape.  \nDespite this positive  news , there has been a great deal of attention focused on inflation . \nNot because the inflation rate is high like it was in the early 1980s, but rather because it is low . \nBased on the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation —the Personal Consumption \nExpenditure s (PCE) price index —the current inflation rate is running just under 1.5 percent . Of \ncourse, this is an aggregate measure of inflation . If a specific component of the  consumption \nbasket is taking a greater bite out of your paycheck,  such as the rental cost of housing, you might \nfeel inflation is plenty high . On the other hand, you mig ht find that the price of a big -screen \ntelevision  is more affordable . Taken together, this preferred measure of inflation includes a \ncollection of  hundreds of different individual prices, gets revised periodically, and doesn’t take \ninto account asset price inflation .  \nNow you may be asking yourself “what’s wrong with low inflation?”  It’s a fair question \nand one I plan to address  in my remarks today . I’ll talk ab out why I believe that, in the context of \na growing economy at full employment, low inflation is not a current worry . I’ll also review \nsome of the factors that are contributing to soft inflation readings and talk about the implications \nfor monetary  policy .  \nBefore continuing, I must tell you that any views I share are wholly my own.  \n \n \n\n2 \n Why the FOMC targets 2 percent inflation   \nAs background, let me explain why inflation plays a prominent role in the Fed’s policy \ndecisions . You may know  that Congress has given the Federal Reserve a mandate that is  spelled \nout in the Federal Reserve Reform Act of 1977 , and it specif ies that the Federal Reserve \n“promote … maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long -term interest rates.”  Th is \nmandate is  often referred to as  a “dual mandate ” because moderate long -term interest rates are \nthe expected result of achieving the goals of maximum employment and stable prices .  \nHistorically , the price stability mandate was viewed largely in qualitative terms . For \nexample, for mer Fed Chairs Paul Volcker and Alan Greenspan defined price stability as a state in \nwhich expectations of inflation  are not a pervasive influence on economic and financial behavior . \nOver time, however, as major central banks around the world —including, first, the Reserve Bank \nof New Zealand, then the Bank of Canada , the Bank of England , and the European Central Bank  \n—adopted inflation targets , the F ederal Reserve began considering a numerical inflation \nobjective for the United States . Seeing how  inflation targets in other countries were  viewed to \nhave helped successful ly bring inflation down from undesirably high levels and stabiliz e it near \ntarget , man y academics and policymakers advocated a numerical inflation ob jective for the \nFedera l Reserve. This was despite inflation having already stabiliz ed at moderate rates in the \nUnited States in the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s  and early 2000s .  \nAfter several years of debating the merits of an explicit numerical inflation objective, the  \nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC)  adopted a 2 percent inflation objective  in January \n2012 .1  In its  “Statement of Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy St rategy,”  the FOMC stated \n                                                 \n1 See https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC19960703meeting.pdf , \nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC20050202meeting.pdf , \nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC20070321meeting.pdf , \nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC20101015confcall.pdf , \n\n3 \n that “inflation at the rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change  in the price index for \npersonal consumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal \nReserve’s statutory mandate.”2   \nThe Committee chose 2 percent as its objective based on a number of factors . One factor \nwas a consideration of the costs of inflation . When inflation is much above 2 percent, relative \nprice signals get distorted, uncertainty about the future price level increases, and income is \narbitrarily transferred from creditors and savers to borrowers . On the other hand, some argue that \ninflation much below 2 percent also could be  costly . For example, when inflation is low, nominal \ninterest rates tend to be low . As a result, there is less room to cut rates in an economic downturn \nand policymakers could be faced with resort ing to unconventional policy instruments when \ninterest rates are at zero , as occurred in 2008 .  \nAt the time the target was adopted  in 2012 , inflation in the United States appeared to be \nanchored near 2 percent , and m any other central banks had adopted 2 per cent as either the center \nof a target range for inflation or as a specific  target . In addition , monetary policy was highly \naccommodat ive in 2012 , with the policy interest rate near zero and t he Fed’s balance sheet large \nby historical standards , and growing . This highly accommodat ive stance of  policy caused some \nconcern that inflation expectations could  become unanchored  and move higher .  \nWhile I supported the 2012 decision to specify a 2 percent objective for inflation, in \nhindsight I think it has proven to  be far more challenging than expected both as a \ncommunications mechanism and a policy guide . Too much focus is placed on achieving this \nspecific  numerical target when, in fact, inflation is likely to fluctuate around that target with \n                                                                                                                                                             \nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC20110126meeting.pdf , and  \nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC20111213meeting.pdf . \n \n2 See https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf . \n \n\n4 \n deviations that occas ionally might persist . In fact, the qualitative definition of price stability that \nguided Volcker and Greenspan  rings true today : An inflation rate that does not materially affect \nthe decisions of business or households is an inflation rate that is consistent with price stability . \nWhile I still see 2 percent as an appropriate long -run objective for policy, I think it makes sense \nto evaluate deviations from that objective in a broader context.  \n \nThe mandate  is not as simple as  a number  \nClearly, t he current inflation rate is running below 2 percent  and has been for several \nyears . But let’s put that in the context of the other leg of our dual mandate —maximum \nemployment . The unemployment rate is currently 4. 2 percent, b elow most estimates of the full -\nemplo yment unemployment rate , including that of the Congressional Budget Office (4.75  \npercent), the Survey of Professional Forecasters (4.5 percent), and the  FOMC  participant s’ \nmedian projection for the long er-run unemployment rate of 4.6 percent .  \nIn addition , FOMC participants project real GDP to grow faster over the next two years \nthan its longer -run growth rate of 1.8 percent, pushing the unemployment rate down further . \nThese projections suggest that the recent, and persistent, softness of inflation relative  to 2 percent \nhas not prevented the economy from achieving  and, arguably, overshooting maximum \nemployment . Indeed,  as recently as last year , the PCE inflation rate less food and energy prices \ncame in at 1.9 percent on a Q4 over Q4 basis. It ’s only been since February that we have seen a \nweakening in this measure of core inflation .  \nTaking the recent performance of the labor market and inflation together, I would argue \nthat the FOMC is, by historical standards, meeting the dual mandate . Yet our  policy interest rate \nremains below FOMC participants’ estimate of its longer -run level . Specifically, FOMC \n\n5 \n participants have lifted the federal funds rate —our target policy rate —four times beginning in \nDecember  2015, with the latest move in  June. With  these moves, the federal funds rate now \nstands at 1 to 1¼ percent compared to the FOMC’s median projection of the longer -run funds \nrate of 2.8 percent .  \n \nSoft inflation is not an indicator of cyclical weakness  \nSo what is driving this slowdown in inflati on? It does not appear that t he slowdown is \nassociated with a weake ning economy . As I mentioned earlier, the current unemployment rate is \nlower than many estimates of the full -employment rate , and the economy has been growing \nfaster than estimates of its l onger -run trend growth rate . These conditions might normally be \nassociated with rising inflation . That inflation has instead been falling does not , however , appear \nto reflect slack in labor markets.  \nReadings from the Kansas City Fed ’s Labor Market Conditio ns Indicators  (LMCI) \nsupport this view .3 The LMCI  looks at 24 different labor market variables and constructs two \nmeasures to describe labor market conditions : the level of activity and momentum. The level of \nactivity continues the improvement we’ve seen throughout this expansion and , except for May \nand July, it’s at its highest level since the end of the recession  and is about equal to its level at the \nend of the last expansion , suggesting tight labor market conditions. The other measure , focused \non th e momentum in the labor market , has remained at a high level , suggesting strength over the \nnear-term. Among the key variables driving improvement in the level of activity over the last six \nmonths were an increase in the quits rate and a decrease in the number  of people working part \ntime for economic reasons as a share of household employment . In other words, more people left \n                                                 \n3 See https://www.kansascityfed.org/~/media/files/publicat/research/indicatorsdata/lmci/2017/lmci_091317.pdf . \n \n\n6 \n their jobs for other employment and fewer people were working part -time because they couldn’t \nfind full -time jobs . These are favorable si gns, but history reminds us that they are unlikely to be \nsustainable in the longer -run. \nLabor markets also show limited slack based on behavior of the labor force participation \nrate. Demographic trends, particular ly the agi ng and retirement of the large ba by boom \ngeneration , have been exerting downward pressure on participation in the labor force  for some \ntime. However , over the last four years, the labor force participation rate has stabilized , after five \nyears of unprecedented  sharp declines that starte d in the last recession . The steady participation \nrate in recent years therefore signals that improving labor market conditions have drawn workers \nfrom the sidelines and more people are remaining in the workforce . Again, this is not a \ndevelopment  that can continue unabated . As the demographic trend reasserts itself, the labor \nforce participation rate will fall, tightening labor market conditions further .  \nAdditional evidence is based on research  by economists at the San Francisco Fed  who \nlooked at unemployment over the past 100 years.4  They estimate a hypothetical unemployment \nrate that is consistent with stable inflation and aggregate production being at its long -run level, \nbased on the relationship between inflation and labor market slack. Go ing back to 1890, they \nfind that this stable -inflation unemployment rate fluctuates in a relative ly narrow range of 4½ to \n5½ percent . With today’s unemployment rate of 4. 2 percent, we are below the low end of this \nrange.  \nIf weakness in the economy is not a  cause of soft inflation, then what is?  My best guess \nis that it is a combination of idiosyncratic shocks combined with a number of longer -run changes \nthat are holding down inflation . Examples of idiosyncratic shocks are large declines in the prices \n                                                 \n4 Regis Barnichon and Ch ristian Matthes, “The Natural Rate of Unemployment over the Past 100 Years,” Federal \nReserve Bank of San Francisco Economic Letter , August 14, 2017.  \n\n7 \n of telecommunications services associated with the introduction of unlimited data plans and one -\ntime downward movements in pharmaceutical prices as various drugs come off patent . Among \nthe longer -run forces holding inflation down are the lingering effects of th e appreciation of the \ndollar and decline in oil prices from 2014 . While these forces should now be abating, several  \nstructural factors —such as global competition, an agi ng population, technological change  and \ndisruptive forces in the retail sector —may persist . For example, Amazon’s purchase of Whole \nFoods and the expansion of Aldi and Lidl in the U.S. market are disrupting the grocery business \nand increas ing competitive pressure.  \nThese developments, along with the persistence of inflation below target , may also have \ncontributed to inflation expectations settling at a level somewhat less than 2 percent. If so, \nmonetary policy may be confronted with a difficult dilemma . Should policy normalization \nproceed on a gradual path to avoid overheating the economy? Or would it be more prudent to \nwait until inflation reaches 2 percent before taking further steps to tighten policy?  \n \nPatience is not always a virtue  \nRecent experience suggests inflation has not been very responsive to labor market slack . \nEven in the aftermath of the Great Recession, when unemployment reached 10 percent, the \ninflation rate excluding food and energy  prices  has fluctuated in a relatively n arrow range \n(roughly 1  percent  to 2 percent) . In my view, because of the weakness of th e relationship  \nbetween inflation and slack , it would take a considerable overheating of the economy to move \ninflation more quickly up to 2 percent . Such overheating would, in th e meantime, foster  a \nmisallocation of resources and risk financial instability as asset prices continue to climb . In \naddition, there is  a meaningful risk that if the unemployment rate fell significantly further, \n\n8 \n inflation might move considerably above 2 pe rcent, causing policymakers to tighten policy  \nabruptly . Monetary policy affects the economy with considerable lags s uch that, by the time we \nsee inflation actually moving up to 2 percent, it may be too late to prevent an undesirable \novershooting. This go -stop approach to monetary policy serves to foster uncertainty and too \noften ends in recession.  \nI also recall another time when concern about low inflation led to a delay in interest rate \nnormalization . From 2002 to 2006 as the economy recovered only gradual ly from the 2001 \neconomic recession, the FOMC cut the federal funds rate to 1 percent and held it there for a year . \nIn doing so , the FOMC was responding in part to a concern that inflation was falling below \ndesired levels , with an outside risk of actual de flation . During this period , the real time data on \nthe core PCE price index fell below 1 percent . And i n May 2003, the FOMC pointed explicitly to \nthe risk of an “unwelcome substantial fall in inflation.”5  \nIn retrospect, the inflation data was subsequently revised up, and by 2005 inflation had \nrisen above 2 percent . Arguably, and although not the root cause,  the low level of interest rates in \nthis period fostered the financing of asset purchases with short -term borrowing, feeding a \nbuildup of financial imbalances and a bubble in the housing market . These excesses ended with a \nsevere financial crisis and the Great Recession .  \nTo be sure, our understanding of inflation dynamics is imperfect. It is prudent for t he \nFOMC to move cautiously and continue to monitor inflation developments to better understand \nthe causes and consequences of low inflation . In saying this, I recognize the various tradeoffs \nbetween maximum employment and price stability and their implicat ions for financial stability \n                                                 \n5 See https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC20030506meeting.pdf . \n \n\n9 \n and sustainable economic growth . On balance, therefore, my judg ment is that we should continue \nto make gradual adjustments to normalize policy rates.  \nWaiting for solid evidence that inflation will reach 2 percent before taking  further steps to \nremove accommodation carries risks of overheating the economy, fostering financial instability, \nand perhaps putting in motion an undesirable increase in inflation . Delaying monetary policy \nadjustments c ould further tighten labor markets a nd stretch the economy’s productive capacity . \nThe resulting inflationary pressures may build slowly, though  they may be difficult to contain \nonce released .  \n \nConclusion  \nLow inflation, in itself, is not a problem in an economy that is growing and operating at \nfull employment . In such an environment, it is desirable to sustain  the economic expansion by \navoiding overheating and financial market instability. The best way to do that is to gradua lly \nadjust policy rates to more -normal settings . With  this approach,  it seems reasonable to expect \nthat inflation will gradually rise as labor markets tighten further and the effects of past oil price \ndeclines, dollar appreciation, and idiosyncratic price movements fade .",

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSeptember 27, 2017  \nBanking and the Economy: A Forum for Minority Bankers  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \nKansas City, Mo.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve \nSystem, its governors, officers or representative s. \n \n\n1 \n  \nThank you for the opportunity to join you  today . I am pleased to host  this important event \nat the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.    \nThe Kansas City Fed is one of 12 regional Reserve Banks  that, along with the \ngovernment agency called the Federal Rese rve Board in Washington, D.C., comp rise the Federal \nReserve System, our nation’s central bank.  The work of t he Federal Reserve can be summarized \nin three primary mission areas : monetary policy , financial institu tion supervision and regulation, \nand payment services. And taken together, these activities are intended to maintain economic and \nfinancial stability as important conditions for the health of the U.S. economy and the prosperity \nof the Am erican public . As a regional Federal Reserve president, I oversee the Kansas City Fed’s \nwork in these areas across a seven -state region with branch offices in Oma ha, Denver  and \nOklahoma City.  \nIn my remarks today , I will offer a brief perspective on the pe rformance of the nation’s \neconomy  and the current stance of the Fede ral Reserve’s monetary policy. I’ll also discuss  the \nimportance of acces s to credit in creating broadly shared economic growth , concluding with \nhighlights of how these issues affect communities, including minority communities . Before \ncontinuing, I must tell you that the views I share are wholly my own.  \n \nThe U.S. e conomy  \nThe U.S. economy  is in reasonably good sha pe, with growth reported to have increased \n3.0 percent in the second quart er of 2017, a rebound from its weak first quarter pace. Consumers \ncontinue to be the main force behind this expansion , with consumption accou nting for more than \ntwo-thirds  of the nation’s  gross domestic product  (GDP ). We also  have  recently seen business \n\n2 \n investment pick up, experiencing the strongest growth rate since mid -2014. Looking forward, \nwith accommodative financial conditions, elevated levels of consumer and business confidence, \nand a brighter global growth outlook, I  expect the economy will continue  to grow over the next \nfew years with low unemployment a nd low inflation.  \nLabor market s have continued to strengthen with  total employment increas ing on net by \n17 million workers, which is double the number of jo bs lost in the last recession. As employment  \nhas steadily increased, the unemployment rate has fallen from 10 percent in 2009 to its  current \nlevel of 4.4 percent. This level of unemployment is below nearly all estimates of the natural rate \nof unemployment, which is the level of unemployment that is estimated to prevail in the longer \nrun in the absence of cyclical fluctuations.  \nAt last week’s Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) meeting, the committee decided \nto maintain the current level of short -term interest rates , continui ng an accommodative polic y \nstance.  Another important action was taken , however. The c ommittee announced it would initiate \nthe process of normalizing its balance sheet.   \nBased on my own economic outlook, further gradual rate adjustments will be needed to \nmove the federal fund s rate toward its longer -run level. With an economy growing at an above -\ntrend rate and unemployment below most estimates of its long -run level, continuing to remove  \naccommodation will be important for long-run sustainable growth and financial stability.   \n \nAccess to credit  \nAppropriate monetary policy settings serve an important role in sust aining growth in the \nlong run. But there are many other important factors that determine the nation’s economic \ngrowth , including  a healthy and prod uctive labor market, inn ovation  and access to capital . I \n\n3 \n would like to turn to the issue of the availability of credit  and its implications for the economic \nprospects  of households and businesses .  \nThe banking system in the United States has long been an essential source of cap ital for \nthe nation’s economy. Here i n the Tenth Federal Reserve District , we have a large number of \ncommunity banks.  \nHaving adapted over the years to significant economic and regulatory changes, as well as \ntechnology disruption, the community bank busine ss model has retained its unique focus on \nrelationship banking. These banks, their owners and the people who work for them are generally \nmembers of the communities they serve . The relationships are long -term and the incentives of \nthe bank and the borrower are well aligned . \nWhether the community is a  small rural town or an urban neighborhood —this business \nmodel features local bankers who are immersed in their communities, understand the  economic \ndrivers of the ir communities and often serve as leaders in their communities. Those of you who \nare bankers here today recognize t his critically important role , and your financial institutions  \nhave  recognize d that this requires diverse staff reflecting the communities they serve .    \nHowever, diverse tale nt in banks is just one aspect of serving a community from a base of \nundersta nding and personal engagement. Diverse ownership of banks is also important . Yet, \nthere are very few minority -owned banks in the United States  today and their numbers are \ndeclining . Over the 10 -year span since 2006 to the end of 2016, the total number of FDIC -\ninsured minority depository institutions has declined from 194 to 157.1 Within this category, the \nnumber of institutions classified as Native American or Alaskan Nativ e American has held \n                                                           \n1 Data Source: FDIC -Insured Minority Depository Institutions data, year -end totals.  Accessible via: \nhttps://www.fdic.gov/regulations/resources/minority/mdi.html . Minority status is defined either by the \nconcentration of ownership status among a certain minority group or the concentration of board membership by a \nminority group of an institution that serves primarily that minority group.  \n\n4 \n relatively steady , falling from 20 to 18 , while the number of Hispanic American banks has \ndropped from 48 to 39. The sharpest decline has been in  the number of African A merican banks , \nwhich  has fallen  by almost half to 24 institutions, according to FDIC data.  \n \nCommunity ban k trends  \nThese trends are not limited to minority banks , however. The number of banks in the \nUnited States has dropped considerably from a little more than14,000 in 1982 , according to \nFDIC data,  to around 5,000 today , and much of this decline has been in banks with less than \n$100 million in assets.  How these consolidation trends affect access to credit is important to \nunderstand.  \nYou have only to read today’s news to recognize the  value of a local bank . It was recently  \nreported  that Bank of America, the second largest lender in the United States, has closed nearly \n1,600 branches since the financial crisis . These closures p rimarily impact  rural areas . While \nsome branches were sold to smaller lenders, others were simply closed with customers directed \nto offices dozens of miles away.2 On the other hand , at about the same time this story was \nmaking headlines, another article highlighted efforts to save a communit y hospital in the \nMissouri boot heel region and the involvemen t of a community bank in providing its financing .  \nAs the banker explained: “We knew what would happen to this community if that hospital \nclosed.”3  \n                                                           \n2 https://www.wsj.com/articles/how -bank -of-america -ditched -1-597-branches -across -the-u-s-1505646000    \n3 http://kcur.org/post/how -one-missouri -town -saved -its-hospital -financial -collapse#stream/0  \n\n5 \n  \nThe h istoric role of minority -owned b anks  \nThroughout the history of our financial system, the inability to access credit often spurred \nthe establishment of a local bank. These banks often proved to be innovative lenders that \nconsidered the unique characteristics of local communities . \nMinority -owned banks emerged for the same fundamental reason , and their history tells \nan important story  about access to the financial system , and understanding history is so important \nto understanding how to solve the challenges we face today.  \nIn the Tenth Federal Reserve District, Centinel Bank of Taos, N.M. , is a great example.  \nCentinel is generally bel ieved to be the first mainland U.S.-based Hispanic bank. If you were \nhere last year, you remember one of our speakers was Centinel’s chair and CEO, Rebeca Romero \nRainey. In 1959, Rebeca’s grandfather, who had serve d in the military and then earned a law \ndegree, was denied a $50 loan  to purchase office furniture. At that point , he vowed to create a \nbank that would provide equal access to  credit for  everyone . After gathering support from about \n300 investors, the bank opened for business  in 1969 .  \nMore recently, the first bank owned or controlled by a Native American tribe was created \nin 1987 when the Blackfeet Tribe of northwestern Montana took over a failed bank in the city of \nBrowning, Mont. Blackfeet National Bank l ater became Native America Bank, NA .  \nWith some of the earliest African American banks , loans were primarily to mutual aid \nsocieties and entrepreneurs.4 The number of African American -owned banks increased \nsubstantially after 1900 and, between 1900 and 1914, the number of African American business \nenterprises doubled, with more substantial increases in some business segments, particularly \n                                                           \n4 Ammons, Lia. “The Evolution of Black -Owned Banks in the United States Between the 1880s and the 1990s.” \nJournal of Bla ck Studies, Vol. 26, No. 4 (Mar. 1996).  \n\n6 \n retail merchants .5 This was a notable expansion of opportunity compared to the late 1800s when \nthe primary occupations held by African Americans were blacksmith, tailor, barber and similar \njobs.6 \nThe first banks with African American ownership opened during the Reconstruc tion \nperiod in our country . The first to receive a charter was The Savings Bank of the Grand Fountain \nof the United Order of True Reformers.  In 1890, the b ank’s founder , William Washington \nBrowne , explained his goal: “The True Reformers sounds like reforme rs of character, but we are \nhunting for people who are already reformed. The church …has the other kind of reformation in \nhand; mine is financial reform. I want to go forward reforming our people financially. We are \nthrowing away money enough to buy this c ountry.”   \nBrowne’s bank, and the others that  soon followed his model, sought to provide services \nto customers who  had suffered in many ways , including being exploited financially. Prior to that \nbank’s creation, the government had established the Freedman’ s Bank in 1865 specifically to \nserve the nation’s African American population. Although the intentions were honorable and \nbranches were opened in several states in an attempt to con nect to local populations, the b ank’s \nleadership was not aligned with the n eeds of its communities. Instead, corruption and high -risk \ninvestments made with bank deposits resulted in its failure (despite the best efforts of Frederick \nDouglass , who had fought to save the institution after the damage had been done). In this era \nbefore deposit insurance, the collapse took with it the life savings of 61,000 savers who were \nstruggling to become established in the United States.  \nBrowne’s life story is itself very much about the ability to overcome challenges and is as \ninspirational as a ny in American history. At age of 13, he escape d slavery and  eventually joined \n                                                           \n5 Meier, August. “Negro Class Structure and Ideology in the Age of Booker T. Washington.” Phylon. Clark Atlanta \nUniversity. Vol. 23, No. 3. (Q3, 1962).  \n6 Ibid.  \n\n7 \n the Union Army. After gaining an education in Wisconsin, he returned to the south as a teacher \nand served as a minister. Influenced by his experiences, Browne established the Gr and Fountain \nof the United Order of True Reformers, a fraternal organization with the stated goals of taking \ncare of the sick, burying the dead and providing other assist ance.   \nBrowne had not necessarily sought to establish a bank to achieve personal goals. Instead \nthe bank was created in response to the needs of his organization, which reflected the needs of \nthe community. A Virginia chapter had been unable to organize because of difficulties safely \nstoring its treasury of about $100. Denied access to a t raditional banking institution, the group \nhad to instead rely on the safe of a local storekeeper, which had proven problematic. The chapter \nwas ready to give up, but Browne encouraged them forward. Creating a bank provided a degree \nof security for the orga nization by meeting a very fundamental financial services need —in this \ncase, the bank was literally a  response to the need for a safe place to store funds —but Browne \nknew, as we know today, that banks also foster opportunities. It was  to be an economic win/win \n—a place to pool the resources of savers to meet the needs of borrowers.  \nIn the words of one of Browne’s associates: “We mean to encourage … people to get \nhomes and means upon which they may independently subsist.”   \nBrowne kept his word. Throughout the panic of 1893 , which saw nearly 600 banks \nnationwide either fail or suspend operations, it is recorded that Browne’s bank was the only bank \nin the entire state of Virginia that co ntinued paying out all checks. During the crisis, at  least one \nlocal public school was able to obtain the funds necessary for paying salaries from Browne’s \nbank after being denied by  other financial institutions. Similarly, the bank loaned money to the \nCity of Richmond in the early 1900s when the city was a lso unable to obtain funds from other \nsources. This is the story of community banks —saving the local hospital in Missouri today, \n\n8 \n fundin g Hispanic customers in 1969, and  saving the city o f Richmond in the early 1900s. An \ninstitution that is local enough to understand and meet the credit needs of a community \ndetermines whether that community thrives or withers.  \n \nConclusion  \nThis history is a reminder of the importance of access to credit and the role it plays in the \nprosperity of households a nd the vitality o f businesses. In the words of one of Browne’ s \ncontemporaries , “Banks are the life blood of trade and progress, whenever they may be \nestablished.”7 It is as  true today as it was in 1890. And the health and diversity of our banking \nsystem remains key  to the promise of delivering broad -based economic gains for thousands of \ncommunities  and for the millions of households and businesses that they serve . \n                                                           \n7 Burrell, William Patrick and Johnson, D.E.

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFebruary 8, 2018  \nWichita Independent Business Association Annual Meeting  \nWichita, Kan.  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal \nReserve System, its governors, officers or representatives.  \n\n2 \n Thank you. I appreciate the opportunity to join  you here this evening.  \nThe Tenth Federal Re serve Distric t covers a very large geography  and keeping tabs on \neconomic conditions in the region is an important aspect of my work .  Fortunately, I have a small \ngroup of economists at the Bank who  conduct research,  analyze data and survey key sectors of \nthe economy , but I also rely on individuals across the region who serve on our various boards \nand advisory groups.  The input and perspective of these individuals  and other contacts are key \nto our understanding of the economic conditions and emerging risks facing our region and the \nnation. The ir contributions  help to shape my views as I represent my region at the Federal Open \nMarket Committee (FOMC) .  In fact, t here are a number of individuals from the Wichita area \nwho assist th e Federal Reserve in this way,  and I would like to take a moment to acknowledge \nthem .  \nTrish Minard with Southwest National Bank here in Wichita, Kan. , recently joined the \nKansas City Fed’s Board of Directors. Although the Federal Reserve Board of Governor s in \nWashington, D.C., has oversight responsibilities  for the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks , each \nBank also  operate s under the leadership of a Board of Director s. This structure was designed by \nCongress to carefully balance public and private interests  in the oversight of the nation’s central \nbank.  The goal was to ensure broad representation in the Fed’s important policy deliberations \nwith ample opportunity for discussion and disagreement , while also providing insulation from \nthose who might seek to in fluence policy decisions for short -term political gain.  As a result, the \nindividuals who serve  on our board have a very important responsibility  within the Fed’s \nstructure .  \n\n3 \n Dan Solomon, chief financial officer  of Koch Chemical Technology Group, has been \ninvolved with our Ec onomic Advisory Council for several years , and I have appreciate d his \ninsights on regional, national and global economic trends .   \nI’d also like to recognize Michael DeBroeck, senior vice president with Intrust Bank , and \nBob Thurman, chief executive officer  of Credit Union of America, who have served on our \nPayments Advisory Group .  Additionally , Steve Radley, president of NetWork Kansas in \nAndover , serves  as a member of our Community Development Advisory Council – a group that \nregular ly informs and advises us on conditions in low-, and moderate -income communities . My \nthanks to each of these individuals for their service to the Kansas City Fed and for the \ncontributions they make to monetary policy deliberations.  \nWe have a lot going at t he Fed r ight now. At last week ’s FOMC meeting , we said our \nfarewells to Janet Yellen , whose term as Fed chair has ended. And on Monday  of this week , Jay \nPowell took the oath of office as the Fed’s new chairman .  He  is an experienced Fed governor \nwhose serv ice on the Board of Governors began in 2012.   Having worked with him the past \nseveral years, I think you can expect that Fed policy will continue along its current path , and I \nexpect a smooth transition.  \nOf course , this week’s headlines have been f ocused o n the market’s reaction to last \nFriday’s employment report and potential inflation  risks . So, this evening, I’ll share with you my \nviews on the outlook for the nation’s economy and the challenges ahead for the Federal Open \nMarket Committee over the near - and long er-term. I’ll plan to leave time a t the end of my \nremarks  to take your questions, comments or advice.  \n\n4 \n Before continuing, now would be a good time to remind you that the views I express this \nevening are my own and not those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market \nCommittee.   \n \nCurrent econom ic conditions  \nThe fundamentals of the U.S. economy are sound.  Preliminary estimates suggest that real \nGDP  — our broadest measure  of economic activity  — grew at an annual rate of just under 3 \npercent in the second half of last year  with robust consumer activity and  a solid increase in \nbusiness spending on fixed investment.   \nThis current expansion has been a long one and it has draw n millions of Americans into \nthe workforce as labor markets have strengthened.  The unemployment rate has fallen to a \nhistorically low 4.1 percent.  Here in Wichita, labor market conditions are somewhat tighter with \nthe unemployment rate at 3.8 percent.  \nHiring remains solid with payroll employment gains averaging 192,000 per month over \nthe last three months . But t he pace  of payroll gains has been gradually slow ing since the peak in \n2014, and I expect those numbers will decelerate further as labor markets continue to tighten and \nfirms find filling job openings increasingly difficult .  \nAs labor markets have tightened, compensation for workers has increased.  This is a \nwelcome development because wage growth has been fairly modest through muc h of the current \nexpansion.   \nAnother favorable aspect of the current expansion is that inflation has remained low even \nas the economy has experienced above -trend growth and a tightening job market.  This has \nhelped workers by allowing wage increases to out pace inflation.  Year -over-year inflation is \n\n5 \n currently running just under the Federal Reserve’s objective of 2 percent , although I expect it \nwill begin to rise as labor markets tighten further and global demand  pushes up import prices .  \nTaken together, the se current conditions and the near -term outlook appear quite rosy.  \nYou might think in a scenario like this, Federal Reserve policymakers would have  an opportunity \nto relax a bit. Unfortunately , that is not the case.  \n \nNear -term challenges  \nAlthough the fina ncial crisis is now well behind us, and we have largely achieved our \nobjectives for employment and inflation, the stance of monetary policy remains quite \naccommodative . The fed eral funds rate, which is  the overnight interest rate  we target , remains \nwell be low estimates of its longer -run value of around 3 percent.  \nIn addition, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet remains extraordinarily large by \nhistorical standards due to  the FOMC’s large -scale purchases of longer -term Treasury and \nagency debt beginning in 2007.  These programs , commonly referred to as quantitative easing or \nQE, ended in October 2014 and the process of shrinking the Fed’s balance sheet to reduce these  \nholdings started last fall . By the end of this year, only about a quarter of the increase to the Fed’s \nbalance sheet resulting from the first round of large scale asset purchases will be unwound.   \nAs monetary  policy accommodation is gradually withdraw n, the economy is getting  a \nboost from fiscal policy related to the recent tax bill . How much of a boost is hard to tell at this \nstage .  \nIn our surveys of manufacturers across our District , the expectations of future activity \nhave increased since the bill was signed. This is potentially good news for Wichita, where the \neconomy is heavily reliant on  manufacturing , a sector that  experienced a net job loss last year. \n\n6 \n Overall, I expect that l ower personal tax rates will boost aggregate demand, and that a lower \ncorporate tax rate and the more favorable tax treatment of investment spending will increase \naggregate supply, although it is difficult to predict exactly how and when consum ers and \nbusinesses will respond .  \nThe result is that an uncertain degree of fiscal stimulus is arriving at the same time the \neconomy is operating at or beyond full employment and monetary policy remains \naccommodative.   And because of that, it is important that the FOMC continue s on its current \npath of policy normalization with gradual increase s in the target federal funds rate. The median \nprojection from the FOMC’s Summary of E conomic Projections calls for about three, 25  basis \npoint hikes in the federal funds rate this year and about the same number next year. This is a \nreasonable basel ine unless the outlook changes  materially .  \n \nLonger -run challenges  \nWhile t hreading this policy needle will be a key challenge over the next couple of years, \nthere are also a number of structural developments that could pose challenges over the longer \nrun.  The nature of these structural issues is beyond the scope of monetary poli cy to address, but \nthey will nevertheless have implications for economic growth, employment and inflation and \ndeserve careful monitoring.  \nAmong these is the slowdown that we have seen over the last several years in the \neconomy’s potential growth rate. This  is the rate of growth consistent with maintaining the Fed’s \ndual mandate of price stability and full employment. By most estimates, this rate was falling \nbefore the financial crisis and is currently believed to be about one -half of what it was in the \n1990 s.  This slowdown in the economy’s potential growth stems from slower growth in the size \n\n7 \n of the potential  work force and the productivity  of that workforce .  Due largely to demographic \nchanges, especially  the retiring of the Baby Boom generation, the annual  growth rate of our labor \nforce is only a little better than one -third of what it was in the 1990s. At the same time, \nproductivity growth is about one -half what it was in the 1990s. Both of these unfavorable trends \nare projected to persist over the next de cade.  While these projections are highly uncertain, if they \nprove accurate, we can expect , among other things, a slower rate of improvement in living \nstandards relative to the pre -crisis period.   \nSlower potential growth also has some troubling implication s from a monetary policy \nperspective .  For one thing, it has led many economists to lower their estimate of the interest rate \nthat is consistent with full employment and price stability. Currently, the FOMC’s median \nprojection for the longer -run federal funds rate is around 3 percent, which is considerably below \nwhat it was only a few years ago . This means that a future FOMC may have substantially less \nroom to lower the federal funds rate should conditions warrant an increase in monetary stimulus.   \nIn such situation s, for example a future recession,  it might prove  helpful for fiscal policy to step \nin and provide a countercyclical stimulus.   \nBut that leads me to another structural challenge —the unsustainable trend of government \ndebt. This will make  it difficult for fiscal policy to play that countercyclical role.   \nThe federal budget deficit increased as a share of GDP for the third straight year in fiscal \n2017, and it was widely expected to creep higher over time even before the recent tax cuts.  \nDemographic trends will raise government spending as an increasing share of the population \nreceives retirement and health care benefits.  Additionally, health care costs are projected to \ngrow faster than the economy, as are the federal government’s net inte rest costs.   \n\n8 \n In all, federal debt held by the public, which was equal to about 35 percent of GDP \nbefore the recession, is now up to 7 5 percent of GDP.  It is projected to exceed its historical \n(WWII) peak of 106 percent by the 2030s , barring a shift in fis cal policy.  The nation remains far \nfrom a fiscal crisis, but changes will be necessary to put government debt on a sustainable \ntrajectory in the coming decades.  The sooner these changes can be made , the less drastic they \nwill need to be and the better po sitioned fiscal policy will be to take a more prominent counter -\ncyclical role in any future downturn.  \n \nConclusion  \nIn closing, over the longer run, demographic trends and sluggish productivity point to the \npossibility of slower economic growth and higher f iscal deficits.   These structural developments \nhave the potential to complicate monetary policy.  If the neutral rate of interest remains \nhistorically low, monetary policy may have less scope to stimulate the economy in a downturn \nwithout again resorting to unconventional policies such as asset purchases.  A natural response to \nsuch a situation would be to rely more heavily on fiscal policy.  However, the longer -run fiscal \noutlook suggests that fiscal policy may be similarly constrained.  Thus, it is criti cal that the \nlonger -run budget issues associated with our aging population be addressed sooner rather than \nlater.    \nIn the near term , the good news is that the U.S. economy is currently growing at a \nmoderate pace, with full employment and price stability.   As always, some regions and industries \nare doing better than others but, on the whole, economic conditions are good.  At the same time, \nmonetary policy remains accommodative.  To sustain the expansion without pushing the \n\n9 \n economy beyond its capacity limit s and creating inflationary pressures, it will be important for \nthe Federal Reserve to continue its gradual normalization of interest rates.",

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJuly 17, 2018  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Agricultural Symposium  \nKansas City, Mo.  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers or representatives.   \n\n \n \n1 \n Good evening and welcome. Today ’s discussion  has been bot h interesting and \ninformative. I want to thank the presenters and discussants for participa ting in this year’s \nsymposium. Clearly, international trade is central to the performance of the ag ricultural sector, \nand uncertainty about trade policy  clouds the outlook. I look forward to continuing the \ndiscussion tomorrow.  \nThis evening I would like to focus my remarks on the outlook for the U.S. economy and \nthe role of monetary policy in supportin g sustainable economic growth. With the economy at or \nbeyond most estimates of full employment and inflation near the FOMC’s  2 percent objective, \nmonetary  policy  should be a neu tral influence on the economy. However, i n my view, policy is \nstill providing accommodation . Gradual further increases in our poli cy rate will be necessary to \nreturn policy to a  neutral stance , although there is considerable uncertainty about exactly how far \nor fast we need to go. Thus, policy must thread th e needle between moving too slowly  toward \nneutral , which could lead to an undesirable increase in inflation, and moving too aggressively , \nwhich could precipitat e an economic downturn.    \n \nCurrent economic conditions  \n Let me turn first to current econ omic conditions. The U.S. economy  is in excellent shape,  \noperating with tight labor markets and  low and stable inflation. The unemployment rate  at 4.0 \npercent  is well below most estimates of full employment . In addition , headline inflation as \nmeasured by the Fed ’s preferred indicator, the personal consumption e xpenditure price index , \nrecently reached 2 .3 percent , while the core measure excluding food and energy came in at 2 \npercent —consistent with the Fed’s inflation objective.  \n\n \n \n2 \n  Looking back at the first half of the year, real GDP —our broadest measure of economi c \nactiv ity—increased at a solid pace. In fact, it accelerated from a moderate 2 percent annual rate \nin the first quarter to an expected growth rate of around 4 percent in the second quarter, based o n \nvarious GDP tracking models. Looking ahead, we expect co ntinued economic growth at or above \nestimates of the economy’s longer -run potential growth rate of around 1¾ percent . \n Economic growth is broad based, and the economy appears to be firing on all cylinders.  \nConsumer spending has supported overall economic growth since the beginning of the \nexpansion, but more recently, we have seen a pickup in business sp ending on plant and \nequipment. In addition, we are beginning to see a n increase in the pace of wage gains . For \nexample, the employment cost index —a broad me asure of labor compensation that accounts for \nemployment shifts among occupations and industries —accelerated over the past couple of years \nto a 2.7 percent annual growth rate in the first quarter, after having hovered for s everal years \naround 2 percent. These wage gains along with ongoing increases in employment will continue \nto support increases in personal income and spending over the remainder of the year and on into \nnext year.  \nWith this strong performance and a legacy of low interest rates, financial st ress may be \nbuilding in some sectors . The corporate bond market and subprime borrowers  appear to be at \nsome risk shoul d interest rates rise sharply. In addition, asset prices remain elevated . \nNevertheless , regulators have judged the financial system to be stable , with manageable \nvulnerabilities . They point, for example, to the most recent assessment from the annual stress -\ntesting of the largest banks . That said, I am concerned that regulators are not doing more to build \nresilient capital buffers into the ba nking system at a time of cyclical strength.  \n \n\n \n \n3 \n The risks to the outlook  \n Aside from the possibility that we are misjudging the manageability of emerging  \nfinancial imbalances, the risks to the outlook appear balance d. Even so , the risks —both to the  \nupside and the downside —are significant.   \nThe predominant upside risk s in my view are a pro-cyclical U.S. fiscal policy and \nglobally accommodative monetary policies . While estimates of the stimulative effects vary, t he \nfederal government ’s actions  to cut taxes a nd increase spending have come during a business \ncycle expansion. These policies may have the short -run benefit of promoting spending and, \nperhaps, increasing the economy’s longer -run growth potential by increasing business \ninvestment, but they also carry a risk of pushing the economy beyond its productive capacity.  \nLikewise, accommodative monetary policies in the United States and other advance d economies \nencourag e risk-taking and incentiviz e spending over saving. At this point in the business cycle, \nsuch fiscal and monetary policies could lead to an undesirable increase in inflation or to a further \nbuildup of financial imbalances.  \nThe predominant downside risks come from uncertainty around trade policy.  To date, the \nimpact of new tariffs on the broad econ omy has been minimal, and I have not incorporated any \nsignificant effect into my baseline outlook for the broader U.S. economy. However, anecdotal \nreports from our business contacts suggest that some companies are taking a “wait and see” \napproach to new ca pital spending due to uncertainty about future trade policies . Whether this \nwill materially slow the economy over the next couple of years or threaten the sustainability of \nthe expansion i s something that I will be monitoring carefully . \n \n \n\n \n \n4 \n Monetary policy m ust thread the needle  \nBarring the realization of these risks to the outlook, I continue to believe the stance of \nmonetary policy will need to be gradually adjusted toward a more neutral position.  At a time of \nfull employment with price stability, policy sh ould be a neutral influence on economic activity.  \nBut navigating the path to neutral will be challenging.  \nIn the first place, there is considerable uncertainty about what the neutral policy rate is \nand, therefore, uncertainty about how many policy moves it will take to return to neutral. Various \nstructural changes —such as slower growth of the labor force and sluggish productivity growth —\nsuggest the neutral policy rate is lower than in the past . But other, cyclical, factors may be \npartially offsetting.  In addition, fi scal stimulus is likely raising the neutral rate , but it is not clear \nby how much.   \nLikewise, questions exist about the natural rate of unemployment and the slope of the \nPhillips curve —and whether these concepts remain relevant in today’s econ omy.  The fact that \ninflation has been relatively stable even as the unemployment rate has fallen well below \nestimates of its longer -run sustainable level suggest s that either the Phillips curve is unusual ly \nflat or, perhaps, obsolete. That said, monetary policy is currently testing the limits of how low   \nunemployment can go without causing an undesir able increase in inflation.  \nMonetary policy is further complicated by the extraordinary actions central banks took to \npromote growth during and after the global financial crisis.  When unemployment was high and \ninflation was low relative to our targets, the F ederal Open Market Committee (FOMC) greatly \nexpanded the Fed’s  balance sheet and provide d forward guidance to the public that policy rates \nwould be ke pt low for a prolonged period. I don’t dispute that some of these policies may have \nhelped  get us to where we are today. But now that the FOMC has largely achieved its objectives, \n\n \n \n5 \n the costs of these extraordinary policy actions are becoming apparent. Even tho ugh we have \nbegun to gradually normalize the size of the balance sheet, it remains exceptionally large by \nhistorical standards. It is still likely putting downward pressure on longer -term rates, working at \nodds with efforts  to achieve policy neutrality. In addition, keeping rates “low for long” has \nresulted in a policy stance that remains accommodative in the face of tight labor markets and \ninflation at the FOMC’s goal . \n   Moreover, t raditional signals of the stance of policy , such as the slope of the yield  curve, \nhave likely become  distorted. A yield curve inversion —that is, a situation where short -term rates \nrise above longer -term rates —has historically been a strong signal that the economy might dip \ninto recession sometime over the next six months to two years. Except for once1, such an \ninversion  has always  been followed by a recession. While the yield curve has not yet inverted, it \nis relatively flat by historical standards, raising the possibility that further increases in policy \nrates could move them ab ove longer -term rates.   \nIt’s not clear how concerned we should be about this possibility. As I mentioned , the \nFed’s large holdings of Treasury securities may be  keeping longer -term rates below where they \notherwise would be and, therefore, distorting th e signal from the yield curve. In addition, the \nlevel of interest rates , as well as that of the neutral policy rate , is below historical benchmarks.2   \nWhile economic conditions are quite positive right now, i t is important that monetary \npolicy be calibrat ed over time to sustain the expansion . The stakes are high since policymakers  \nwill have less scope to lower rates in a future downturn. Monetary policy cannot offset all of the \nshocks that affect  the economy , and recessions will happen. But recessions can also be caused by \n                                                 \n1 The one time when an inverted  yield curve (10 -year treasury yield/3 -month treasury yield) did not immediately \nprecede a recession was in September 1998.  \n2 Bauer, Michael, and Thomas M. Mertens, “Economic Forecasts with the Yield Curve,” FRBSF Economic Letter , \nMarch 5, 2018.  \n\n \n \n6 \n policy mistakes. The FOMC will need to monitor incoming data carefully to avoid moving too \naggressively and causing a downturn  or moving too slowly and allowing inflation to rise.   \nAllowing inflation to rise also can result in a recession  if the Fed must then raise rates \naggressively to return inflation to target.    \nAdding to the complexity of monetary policy is that it affects the real econom y with long \nand variable lags. Past policy actions have not yet had their full effect, and actions  taken today \nwill not have their full effect for many months into the future. This raises the risk of \novershooting. Like adjusting the thermostat in a hot room to cool it down , failure to account for \nlags can lead one to continue tinkering with the control s. Because i t takes time to reach the \ndesired temperature, if you’re not careful, it’s easy to overshoot, turning a room that is too hot \ninto one that is too cold.  \nAll of this suggests to me that  future policy actions  will increasingly need to be data \ndependent. And given the policy lags, our actions need to be forward looking. In this context, \ndata dependence means that policymakers should adjust their forecasts and associated policy \npaths as necessary based on the flow of incoming data. Therefore , I will be monitoring signs that \nmight indicate whether we are nearing neutral or ha ve further to go. For example, further \ndownward movements in the unemployment rate or upward momentum in inflation would \nsuggest to me  that we have more work to do. On the  other hand, stabilization of inflation and \nunemployment around their current levels might suggest  less urgency for further policy action.  \n \nConclusion  \n Notwithstanding these challenges , the U.S. economy is currently in very good shape ,  \nunemployment is well below most estimates of its longer -run level , and inflation has mov ed up \n\n \n \n7 \n to the FOMC’s objective. My baseline outlook is for the expansion to continue at a moderate \npace, while recognizing  there are signific ant upside and downside risks. With a long -run view t o \nsustain the expansion, monetary policy will need to move from an accommodative st ance to a \nmore neutral stance. Threading this needle will be challeng ing in the face of numerous \nuncertainties and the ongoing complexity of unwinding the extraordinar y policy actions taken in \nthe aftermath of the global financial crisis.",

As a  regional Federal Reserve Bank president, I gain important insights about the \neconomic landscape of our District from visits like this one, where I have the opportunity to meet \nwith business and community leaders.  Your comments  and concerns about the econ omy, \ncombined with economic data and analysis, help inform my own views on monetary policy.  \n My remarks t his evening  will focus on the state of the economy and the current stance of \nmonetary policy.  In particular, I  want to highlight some key dynamics of the labor market, as we \nare experiencing the confluence of several cyclical and structural trends that are collectively \nreshaping the job market in Nebraska and the nation as a whole .   \nBefore I continue, however, I want to note that these are my own views  and are not \nnecessarily representative of others in the Federal Reserve System.  \n \nThe Nebraska Economy  \nAs we heard earlier tonight , the Nebraska economy  is relatively strong  and its \nunemployment rate is historically low.  I’d like to use the lens of the labor market to describe the \nopportunities and challenges that the state faces  as you collectively work to build and support a \nstrong economy.    \nRelative to th e nation, Nebraska has a strong  labor market with an unemployment rate \nbelow  the U.S. national average.  Just over a decade ago, prior to the financial crisis, Nebraska \nhad an unemployment rate of about 3 percent.  Following the financial crisis and during the \nrecession that ensued, Nebraska’s unemployment rate rose to about 5 percent , far less than the \nnational unemployment rate, which rose to 10 percent.  And at this current point in the ongoing \n\n3 \n economic expansion, Nebraska’s unemployment rate is 2.7 percent, suggesting that the labor \nmarket is tighter now across the state than it wa s back in 2007.  \nThis is very good news for the state as a whole, but it masks several underlying trends \nthat reveal that this improvement has not been experienced equall y across all parts of the state  \nand for all workers in the economy.   Within Nebraska, e mployment growth has been \nconcentrated in metro areas, particularly in Omaha and Lincoln, while the rural parts of the state \nhave struggled .  During the past four year s, employment in Nebraska ’s metro areas  has grown at \nan annual rate of 1.5 percent, while  in that same time there has been no empl oyment growth in \nnon-metro areas  of the state.  This widening divide of economic opportunities between rural and \nmetro areas represents a growing concern for our region and is a topic that the research staff at \nthe Kansas City Fed  will be analyzing . \nA second important trend that has broad implic ations for Nebraska’s economy is the \nongoing demographic shift in its  population.  During the past decade, Nebraska’s population of \nindividuals age 16 and above has grown by 8  percent.  But a large share of this population, the \nbaby boomers, are moving toward retirement, which implies that the labor force of available \nworkers may not be growing as quickly.  In fact, the number of prime -age individuals in \nNebraska, those aged 25  to 54, has actually declined by 3½ percent over the past decade.  If this \ntrend continues with an aging population that is not fully replaced by the next generation of \nworkers, this will create a significant headwind for growth prospects for the  state eco nomy .   \nAnd a third trend influencing the labor market is the ongoing shift in the types of skill s \nemployers demand .  In the past 40 years, advances in technology and computing , along with \nshifts toward an increasingly global economy , have dramatically alt ered the employment \nopportunities that firms are seeking to fill.  Jobs that were available in the past to workers with a \n\n4 \n high school degre e, such as assembly line work  in manufacturing plants and c lerical jobs  in \noffices, have  largely been automated.  As  those jobs ha ve gone away, new jobs have emerged, \nbut many require technical skills that workers need to obtain through training programs or \nadvanced education.   \nHow best to prepare our youth and young workers for success in this economy  is a \nchallenge facing Nebraska, along with the rest of the country .  In particular, young men are \nstruggling to adapt to this shift in employment opportunities .  A recent article in the Kansas City \nFed’s Economic Review  by Didem T üzemen describes how this  shift has contributed to an \nincrease d number of prime -age men who are leaving the labor force.1  Those men typically have \nonly a high school diploma and perhaps some college education.  For Nebraska, the share of \nprime -age men who are actively engaged in the labor force has declined by 1 percent during the \npast decade, which implies that approximately 10,000 men who would have been working in \nNebraska’s economy a decade ago are now sitting on the sidelines  and not looking for work \nbecause their skills are not in demand by employers.  \nBut this is also a national dilemma with no easy answers.  In addition to the slowdown in \nthe growth rate of the labor force due to the retirement of baby boomers , the missing prime -age \nmale workers are another  headwind on the n ational economy’s productive capacity.   \nLet me turn now to the outlook for the U.S. economy which, from a cyclical  perspective, \nlooks very robust, aside from this very challenging issue.  \n \nThe U.S. E conomic Outlook  \n                                                 \n1 Tüzemen, Didem. “ Why Are Prime -Age Men Vanishing from the Labor Force? ” Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas \nCity. Economic Review, First Quarter, 2018.  \n\n5 \n Almost nine years into the current expans ion, t he U.S. economy has, by most accounts, \nachieved full employment while maintaining a low and stable inflation rate. Preliminary \nestimates suggest that real GDP  — our broadest measure  of economic activity  — grew at an \nannual rate of just under 3 percent in the second half of last year .  Looking ahead, most \nforecasters expect continued moderate growth somewhat above the economy’s potential growth \nrate of roughly 1¾  percent  to 2 percent.  Such growth will likely lead to tighter conditions in \nlabor  and product  market s and, possibly, higher inflation.  As a result, the Federal Open Market \nCommittee —the Fed’s monetary policymaking body —has been g radually remov ing monetary \naccommodation by slowly increasing its target interest rate and allowing its balan ce sheet to \nshrink.   \nThat’s my outlook in a nutshell.  Let me now provide some detai ls in support of my \nperspective .   \nOne of the key drivers of the expansion has been consumer spending.  Consumers \nmaintained a moderate pace of spending during this econom ic expansion, generally in line with  \nthe moderate pace of income growth we have been seeing.  Looking forward, I expect consumers \nto continue providing a significant amount of support for this economic expansion, as jobs \ncontinue to be added and wage growt h is beginning to pick up in response to a tightening labor \nmarket. Recent changes to personal taxes will likely provide a modest boost to household \nspending this year and allow households to pay down debt , which has continued to grow \nthroughout the expans ion.  Over t ime, the contribution of the tax plan to consumer spending is \nlikely to fade , but still remain positive for spending as labor market conditions tighten . \nAdditional momentum to the economy has come from business spending on plant and \nequipment.  Business investment grew almost 6¼ percent in 2017, which represents a welcome \n\n6 \n step up from the negligible rate of growth during  the previous three years.  Equipment \ninvestment in particular has strengthened in re sponse to stronger global demand for U.S. \nmanufactured goods and commodities. In the last four quarters, it grew almost 9 percent.    \nLooking ahead,  the lower corporate tax rate and more favorable tax treatment of \ninvestment spending are expected to provide  a further modest boost to business spending  in the \ncoming years.  Longer -term factors, however, such as sluggish productivity growth and a \nsubdued rate of growth in the working -age population, are likely to remain a drag on investment \nspending going forwar d.  Intangible investment, such as in intellectual property and \ntechnological know -how, is likely to continue growing in importance relative to investment in \nphysical structures and machinery.   \nThe housing sector presents more of a mixed picture, with resi dential investment \nfluctuating around a moderate upward trend that is likely to persist.  Construction activity is \nconstrained by a shortage of qualified workers, difficulty obtaining financing by small builders, \nand the limited availability of undeveloped  land in desired locations.  Single -family sales are \nbeing significantly constrained by limited home listings. In contrast, demand for housing remains \nvery strong.  Many young adults who moved in  with their parents or found housemates following \nthe Great R ecession would now like to form their own househo lds but are finding  a lack of \nmoderately -priced apartments and houses. Similarly, f amilies who would like to upgrade from \nstarter single -family ho mes are also finding a  limited number of homes available for sale. With \nstrong demand but limited new supply, rents and sales prices are likely to continue to move up \nbriskly, even as mortgage rates normalize from the very low levels of recent years.  \n\n7 \n Finally, the national econo my will get a small boost in growth from federal government \nspending.  The  two-year budget agreement that Congress recently passed  raises spending caps \nfor fiscal year 2018 and 2019, allowing nearly $400 billion in additional spending.   \nWith this outlook,  I view inflation dynamics as broadly consistent with the Federal \nReserve’s goal of price stability.  Year -over-year inflation is currently running just under the \nFederal Reserve’s objective of 2 percent  as measured by the personal consumption expenditure \nprice index.  But I would expect to see inflation rising this year to around 2 percent.  This \nincrease r eflect s continued economic growth  at or above its long -run potential, a further \ntightening of labor markets, and rising import prices stemming from stro ng global demand.  \nRisks to the outlook appear to be predominately to the upside.  The sectors that were \nheadwinds on growth in the final quarter of last year suggest considerable momentum going into \nthe current year.  Imports, which subtracted almos t 2 pe rcentage points from the fourth  quarter \ngrowth rate, point to considerable domestic demand.  Likewise , inventories, which subtracted 0.7 \npercentage point from overall economic growth, should be a source of strength this year as \nproducers restock their shel ves. In addition, as I will discuss in a moment , monetary policy \nremains highly accommodative, and the recently enacted tax cuts and federal government \nspending increases suggest fiscal policy has turned more stimulative.  On top of these domestic \ndemand f actors, a synchronized global recovery , in which foreign demand for our goods and \nservices ,remain s quite solid , should contribute to the momentum going forward.  \n \nMonetary policy  \nLet me now turn to a review of monetary policy.  Although we have largely achieved our \nobjectives for maximum employment and price stability, the stance of monetary policy remains \n\n8 \n quite accommodative . The fed eral funds rate, which is  the overnight interest rate  the Federal \nReserve target s, remains well below estimates of its longer -run value of around 3 percent.  \nIn addition, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet remains extraordinarily large by \nhistorical standards due to  the FOMC’s large -scale purchases of longer -term Treasury and \nagency debt beginning in 200 8.  These programs , commonly referred as quantitative easing or \nQE, ended in October 2014 , and the process of shrinking the Fed’s balance sheet to reduce our \nholdings of Treasury and agency securities started last fall . By the end of this year, however, \nonly ab out a quarter of the increase to the Fed’s balance sheet resulting from the first round of \nlarge scale asset purchases will be unwound.   \nThese holdings of longer -term assets were intended to put downward pressure on  longer -\nterm interest rates.  Many inves tors responded, as would be expected, by purchasing riskier \nassets in a reach for higher yield.  As a result, asset prices may have become distorted relative to \nthe economic fundamentals.  The very slow pace of our balance sheet normalization may still be \ncontributing to a buildup of various financial imbalances.  While until r ecently, financial markets \nremained remarkably stable, it is not uncommon to see volatility rise when asset prices become \ninflated and investors struggle to find a new equilibrium.   \nWhat then should the stance of monetary policy be at this stage in the business cycle?  \nMonetary policy can be a useful tool to lean against the ups and downs of the business cycle, but \nit is not well suited to address structural problems in the economy such as job polarization. When \neconomic conditions reflect the combination of full employment, price stability and trend \neconomic growth —as they more or less do now —monetary policy should be a neutral influence \non the economy.  But the current setting of o ur target interest rate is still well below neutral.  I t \n\n9 \n is, therefore,  important that the FOMC continue on its current path of policy normalization with \ngradual increase s in the target federal funds rate.  \n \nConclusion  \n In closing, the good news is that th e U.S. economy is currently growing at a moderate \npace, with full employment and price stability.  As always, some regions and industries are doing \nbetter than others but, on the whole, economic conditions are good.  At the same time, monetary \npolicy remai ns accommodative.  To sustain the expansion without pushing the economy beyond \nits capacity limits and creating inflationary pressures, it will be important for the Federal Reserve \nto continue its gradual normalization of interest rates.  Given the current  momentum in the \neconomy, the FOMC will need to carefully calibrate its policy to lean against a potential buildup \nof inflationary pressure or financial market imbalances.",

            "content": "Monetary Policy and Reform in Practice  \n \n \nRemarks by  \n \nEsther L. George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMay 4, 2018  \nMonetary Policy and Reform in Practice  \nThe Hoover Institution at Stanford University  \nPalo Alto , Calif.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal \nReserve System, its governors, officers or representatives.  \n\n1 \n Thank you for the opportunity to offer my views on monetary policy and ref orm in \npractice . I app reciate  the Hoover Institution bringing together leading academics and monetary \npolicymakers to share ideas about the practical issues facing central banks today . We have much \nto learn from each other .  \nMy comments this afternoon  focus on some of the practical issues I think about as I \nformulate my own policy views . As I do so, y ou’ll hear me describe these issues with more \nquestions than answers , reflecting the nature of the policy landscape today .  \nBefore I continue, however, I want to note that these are my own views and are not \nnecessarily representative of others in the Federal Reserve System.  \n \nToday’s policy landscape  \nNine years after the financial crisis, the Fed has , at least for the moment,  achieved its \nobjectives of maximum employment and price stability . Yet the legacy of the crisis —through the \nresponse of the Fed and fiscal authorities —has left us in a very different place than before the \ncrisis  in a number of ways . The equilibrium nomina l policy rate is low  by historical standards . \nThe current target for the federal funds rate is considerably  lower than the Federal Open Market \nCommittee’s  (FOMC)  projection of its longer -run value . Our balance sheet is almost five times \nits pre -crisis size . The Fed’s footprint in financial markets is considerably larger than before the \ncrisis. The banking sector is consolidating, and big banks have gotten even bigger . Federal \ndeficits and debt are high and projected to rise to unprecedented levels .  \nDespite  this legacy,  many of the structural developments that dominate our thinking \ntoday  were well underway before the onset of the financial crisis and Great Recession . An a ging \npopulation, slowing productivity growth, rising globalization and declining equilib rium interest \n\n2 \n rates all pre -date the crisis. In this sense, things have not changed . Moreover, since the mid-\n1990s and through the financial crisis , Great Recession, and current expansion, core inflation —\nas measured by the personal consumption expenditure price index —has fluctuated in a relatively \nnarrow range of roughly 1 percent to 2 ½ percent .  \nGiven the structural changes that have been developing over the last several d ecades, it \nmay well be that we are in a low -growth, low -interest -rate environment . Yet, from a cyclical \nperspective, the economy appears to be operating at or beyond full employment with inflation \nexpected to rise over the medium term , while the FOMC’s funds rate target of 1½ percent to  1¾ \npercent remains well below the FOMC’s projection  of its longer -run level of about 3 percent . \nThe current gradual normalization of interest rates is geared toward removing accommodation at \na pace that is expected to sustain the expansion without generating undesired increases in \ninflation on the one hand , or creating  financial instability on the other . But there are clearly risks .  \nAnd there are still uncertainties about how the landscape will look once policy has \nachieved a “new normal.” In particular, questions remain to be answered about the Fed’s futu re \noperating framework , its strategic framework  and it s role in promoting financial stability . I’ll \ndiscuss each of these issues in turn .  \n \nDetermining a long-run operating framework  \n In 2016, the FOMC  held lengthy discussions about potential long -run frameworks for \nmonetary policy implementation . The Committee discussed  the merits of maintaining an \nabundance of reserves in the banking system versus returning to a framework of reserve scarcity . \nWith an abundance of reserves, the Fed would rely on interest on reserves and the overnight \nreverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) to maintain control over short -term market rates . With \n\n3 \n a scarcity of re serves , the open market desk at the New York Fed would  control market rates \nthrough its control over the supply of reserves . The discussion ended with agreement that \n“decisions regarding the long -run implementation framework were not necessary at this time.”1 \nSince that time, however, w e have begun to normalize our ba lance sheet  with an understanding \nthat the balance sheet will be smaller than it is today, but larger than it was in 2007 . As the \nbalance sheet continues its steady decline, I would suggest that we again need to consider the \nappropriate long-run size of th e balance sheet and our related operating framework .  \n While it may simply be a case of nostalgia on my part, I found our minimalist  pre-crisis \noperating framework to have a number of features that served us well for many years . We \nmaintained a small balan ce sheet with liabilities that were comprised almost entirely of currency \nin circulation with reserves averaging about $10 billion, compared with more than $2 trillion \ntoday . We maintained a Treasuries -only balance sheet with duration -matching Treasury iss uance \nto maintain a neutral influence on financial markets . We had a small number of counterparties, \nand we managed the supply of reserves to achieve the target federal funds rate . As a result, our \nfootprint in the financial markets was relatively small .  \nRelative to this pre-crisis framework, the current operating framework —made necessary \nby a large balance sheet —has had a number of undesirable consequences, some of which were \nunintended . The Fed now owns significant outstanding shares of Treasur ies and mortgage -\nbacked securities ( MBS ) and is no longer a neutral influence on financial markets . We have a \nlarge number of counterparties , including nonbanks , made necessary by the ON RRP facility . \nIncreases in the funds rate are achieved by raising an administ ered rate —the interest rate on \nexcess reserves  (IOER) . Some have expressed concern that  as IOER goes up, payments to \nbanks —including to foreign banks —go up . Finally, the nature of unconventional policies has \n                                                 \n1 Federal Open Market Committee Minutes, November 1 -2, 2016 . \n\n4 \n drawn both attention and criticism to the Federa l Reserve’s large balance sheet with conequences \nfor central bank independence and fiscal discipline . Congress has begun to  see the Federal \nReserve as a source for plugging spending gaps , drawing on the Fed  to fund the Consumer \nFinancial  Protection Bureau , finance highway spending , and more recen tly, to contribute $2.5 \nbillion to the federal government from its capital surplus as part of the budget deal passed in \nFebruary after the brief government shutdown .  \nGiven these developments, the current thrust of policy can become more difficult to \ngauge . At the same time the funds rate is being normalized , we have embarked on a program to \ngradually reduce the Fed’s security holdings by decreasing reinvestment of principal payments . \nWhile I support this policy —with balance sheet normalization occurring largely on auto -pilot \nand in the background —it does pose challenges as we try to understand the implications for the \nstance of policy . Is policy tighter than  we think because t he balance sheet is shrinking? Or is the \nstill-large balance sheet  putting downward pressure on longer -term rates making policy more \naccommodat ive than we think?   \nWhether  it is desirable or even possible to return to our pre-crisis operating framework  \nremains an open question for the FOMC . Can we  return to the corridor -like framework with \nscarce reserves, o r will we need to retain the current floor system?  If we maintain the current \nsystem, by how much can we reduce the supply of reserves ?  And what is the eventua l role of the \nON RRP facility? Can IOER guide the funds rate without reliance on the floor esta blished by the \nrate on ON RRPs?  Answers to these questions will be shaped by the FOMC’s future discussions.  \n \n \n \n\n5 \n Strategic f ramework  \nIn addition to uncertainties about the longer -run operating fra mework, a number of \nstrategic challenges and uncertainties  pose practical issues for policymakers . With little \ncountercyclical policy space available to respond to a future downturn , monetary policy options \nmust contemplate how interest rate an d balance sh eet policies will work before, during and after \na crisis . Aggressively purchasing assets in a downturn and only gradually allowing them to roll \noff once the economy has fully recovered suggests the possibility of a balance sheet th at grows \nbigger and bigge r over time .  \nThis dynamic , combined with varying degrees of uncertainty  about the efficacy of asset \npurchases , has led to calls for a discussion about future policy strategies for the next encounter \nwith the zero lower bound . Ideas like price -level targeting, a higher inflation objective  or \nnominal GDP targeting all offer worthwhile and intellectually stimulating debate . And certainly \nthe time is right to consider the trade -offs around various strategies , but determining if these \nideas might work in practice is challenging .  \n \nPromoting Financial S tability  \nThese uncertainties make it all the more important to ensure the current economic \nexpansion is sustained as interest rates rise and the balance sheet normalizes. We should take \nevery measure possible  to prevent  a crisis rather than hope that we can devise a monetary policy \ncure after the fact.  \n \n\n6 \n As the FOMC gradually mov es away from the zero lower bound, with a slowly shrinking \nbut still -large balance sheet and growing federal debt, maintaining financ ial stability  is \nparamount .  \nHere I would like to make two key points .  \n First, in contemplating a future bout of financial instability , we should be realistic \nabout the robustness of macroprudential tools with a good dose of humility \naround the necessary finesse to deploy  them  in a timely fashion .  \n Second, we should not waver in our aims t o bolster resilience in our banking \nsystem especially for the largest banks .2  \nThere is little dispute  that financial stability is a necessary condition for achieving the \nFOMC’s employment and price stability mandates . It is recognized in  the FOMC’s “Statement of \nLonger -Run Goals and Strategies ” as well as being the objective of macroprudential policies . \nHowever, there remains a tension as to the trade -off between macroecon omic goals and financial \nstability . The “lean or clean” debate is ongoing . Specifically, some argue that the output losses \nassociated with using monetary policy to lean against growing financial imbalances far outweigh \nthe possible benefits . Instead, they suggest that macroprudential policies are the appropriate \nresponse to financial instability . In my view , this approach might be more effective  in theory \nthan in practic e.  \nA few years ago , I participated with some of my colleagues in a tabletop exercise \ndesigned to assess the efficacy of certain macroprudential policy tools in responding to a \nhypothetical financial crisis . In the exercise, we examined the use of capital -based, liquidity -\nbased, and credit -based tools, along with stress testing and supervisor y guidance in mitigating \n                                                 \n2 The eight U.S. global systemically important banks (GSIBs) held $11 trillion in total assets at the end of 2017, an \namount equal to 57 percent of U.S. gross domestic product.  \n\n7 \n the effects of an overheating of the financial markets . What we discovered in conducting the \nexercise was that the effectiveness of the tools varied because  of realities like implementation \nlags and/or limited scope . In addition, m onetary polic y looked to be a relatively more attractive \noption than some  might have expected before the exercise.3  Obviously this particular exercise is \nnot conclusive in all scenarios, but rather a caution about becoming overly confident in relying  \non macroprudential tools to address growing financial imbalances .  \nIn thinking about the role of financial stability in the conduct of monetary policy, I find \nrecent research from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS)  to be compelling . This \nresearch sees financial market deregulation from the 1980s and 1990s as having increased the \nlikelihood of crises and posit s a growing financial cycle in which monetary policy responds \nasymmetrically over time to crises, easing rate s aggressively during the crisis bu t raising rates \nonly gradually  after the crisis has subsided . Their prescription  is for policymakers to break this \ncycle by making policy more attentive to financial imbalances and more symmetrical in the \nresponse.4  \nWe should take advantage of the current  economic conditions to bolster resilience in the \nfinancial system . Instead, the U.S. has yet to implement  a countercyclical buffer  and the banking \nagencies contemplate steps in the direction of relaxing capital requirements . Recently issued for \ncomment is a proposal to modify  the enhanced suppleme ntary leverage ratio on global \nsystemically important banks (GSIBs ) that would have the effect of lowering capital \nrequirements.5 With the U.S. ec onomy in a sustained expansion  and at risk of growing financial \n                                                 \n3 Tobias Adrian, Patrick de Fontnouvelle, Emily Yang, and Andrei Zlate, “ Macro -prudential Policy: A Case Study \nfrom a Tabletop Exercise ,” FRBNY Economic Policy Review , February 2017.  \n4 Claudio Borio, Piti Disyatat, Mikael Juselius, and Phurichai Rungcharoenkitkul, “ Monetary Policy in the Grip of a \nPincer Movement ,” BIS Working Paper No. 706.  \n5 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2018. “R ule Proposed to Tailor 'Enhanced Supplementary \nLeverage Ratio' Requirements .” Press release, April 11 .

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOctober 11, 2018  \nEconomic Forum  \nTulsa, Oklahoma  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal \nReserve System, its governors, officers or representatives.  \n\n1 \n Ten years ago this month, financial conditions were fragile and the economy was deep in \nrecession.   The unemployment rate stood at 6.5 percent  on its way to 10 percent a  year later.  \nThe recovery from th at recession was slow, but the economy has come a long way.  The \ncombination of fiscal stimulus, corporate and bank  bailouts , and unconventional monetar y policy \naided in stabiliz ing the economy .  Yet, these dramatic actions did  not generate the sharp bounce \nback of economic activity that we might have expected based on some past recoveries .  Instead, \nthe economy found its footing in a  moderate , but resilient, recovery with annual growth in real \nGross Domestic Product (GDP) of around 2 percent.  More surprisingly, despite  the sluggish \npace of  output  growth , employment has grown at a relatively brisk  pace, pushing the \nunemployment rate down to its lowe st level since 1969 . \nBecause we are well into a recovery of record length, and with interest rates increasing, \nmany pundits are saying a recession is inevitably on the horizon.  Others are convinced  that \nrecent tax cuts and increased government spending , combined with robust consumer and \nbusiness spending , provide momentum that could extend the current expansion .  Rather than try \nto project the future, I’ll discuss what I see as the key factors that are in play today and that, on \nbalance, suggest continued growth ahead.  In doing so, I’ll offer my views on monetary policy \nand highlight the changing role of the energy  sector in contributing to the overall performance of \nthe economy , including the region served by the Kansas City Fed . \n \nU.S. Economic Outlook  \n By nearly every measure, the U.S. economy is performing well.  With accommodative \nfinancial conditions, elevated levels of confidence and solid labor markets, it seems reasonable to \nexpect economic growth slightly above trend with low and stable inflation  for the next few years . \n\n2 \n Consumers are poised to continue to be the main force behind this expansion, and the recent \npickup in business investment may continue as well .   \nDigging  a little deeper into the details, several factors support  the outlook for \nconsumption. Household balance sheets remain strong. The latest data show that the personal \nsavings rate is 6.6  percent  and household net worth as a share of income is at a histor ically high \nlevel. W age growth has  steadily increased, approaching 3 percent in the latest report s, and \nconsumer confidence is at its highest level since prior to 2008 . Finally, job gains continue to rise \nfaster than is needed to absorb workers entering the labor force . \nThe outlook for business spending is also favorable.  Business  investment expanded \nrobustly last year , and the momentum has continued in 2018. During the first half  of this year , \nbusiness investment grew at an average annualized rate of 10  percent . This is a welcome step up \nfrom the stagnant investment levels in 2015 -2016.  \nLooking ahead, capital expenditures seem poised to continue at a robust pace, as \neconomic growth remai ns solid , borrowing costs remain low , and rising labor costs combined \nwith labor shortages lead firms to invest in technology to automate tasks .  The recent cut in the \ncorporate tax rate provides additional incentives  for investment. And, as I will discuss later, \nadvances  in shale oil production have become an important factor in boosting investment .  This \nimpetus from the energy sector seems likely  to continue.  Over the longer -term, however, \ninvestment spending will likely slow to a more sustainable rate in line with the economy’s \npotential growth rate .  \nOther sectors of the economy, including net exports, residential investment, and \ninventories, a re likely to be a more neutral and uncertain influence on the overall economy.  For \nexample, the recent appreciation of the dollar, along with  possible  retaliatory tariffs and slower \n\n3 \n growth in the emerging market economies, could cause net exports be  a modest drag on overall \neconomic growth.  Nevertheless, I expect domestic demand to remain strong.  \nThis strong demand growth will reinforce the outlook for a tight labor market.  The \nunemployment rate currently stands at 3.7 percent, well below most estimate s of its long -run \nsustainable level. With solid employment gains averaging 190,000  jobs per month in the last \nthree months , some observers argue the economy is getting a second wind .  My own \ninterpretation of these gains is that we are seeing the hallmarks o f a mature expansion.   Looking \nthrough monthly fluctuations in the job market report s shows that the pace of payroll growth has \nactually moderated from a few years ago. At its peak in early 2015 , the year -over-year change in \ntotal payrolls was roughly 3 mi llion. In contrast, the latest data point to a year -over-year change \nin total payrolls of 2.5 million. I expect this trend of slowing employment gains to continue as \nlabor market conditions tighten further  and it becomes harder for firms to fill vacancies.  \nDespite tight labor markets and above trend growth, inflation has remained low. In fact, \ninflation has been remarkably stable even as the unemployment rate has fallen sharply.  That \nsaid, the accommodative stance of monetary policy that has prevailed , even as the \nunemployment rate has fallen below estimates of its long -run sustainable level,  could push \ninflation somewhat higher over the next couple of years.  Of course, the outlook for inflation  has \nimplications for monetary policy.  \n \nImplications for Monet ary Policy  \nAt last month’s meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) t ook another step \nto remove some of the extraordinary monetary accommodation that has been in place since the \nonset of the financial crisis.  This gradual normalization of policy seems appropriate to me given \n\n4 \n that the FOMC’s employment and inflation objectives have largely  been achieved while the \ncurrent setting of its overnight interest rate target remains below estimates of its longer -run \nvalue.   \nAs the FOMC seeks to make moneta ry policy a more neutral influence on the economy \nand, thereby, sustain the economic expansion , policymakers must consider a variety of risks and \nuncertainties around the outlook  for the economy .  On the upside, accommodative financial \nconditions, elevated  consumer confidence and expansionary fiscal policy could lead to further \nincreases in economic growth  and inflation . On the downside, trade policy uncertainty, growing \nrisks in emerging market economies and policy divergence between the U.S. and other adv anced \neconomies could slow down both foreign and U.S. growth.   \nWhile I see these risks as currently balanced, the path of policy cannot be on a pre -set \ncourse at this stage of the expansion.  The FOMC’s approach of gradual increases in the target \nfederal funds rate, combined with gradual reductions in the size of the Fed eral Reserve ’s balance \nsheet, has aimed to thread this needle.  This means p olicymakers will need to carefully assess the \neffects past policy actions are likely to have  as they look  for economic fundamentals to remain \nconsistent with the objectives of maximum employment and price stability .   \n \nThe Shale Oil Revolution  \nTo this point, I’ve talked about the cyclical nature of the economy and how monetary \npolicy interacts with those cyclical fea tures .  At the same time, however, a number of structural \nchanges are occurring in the U.S. economy that bear watching.  Among these developments are \nthe aging of the population, ongoing technological change  and weak readings for productivity \n\n5 \n growth.  A ke y industrial change that is particularly relevant in Oklahoma  is related to the shale \noil revolution, and I’d like to spend a few minutes talking about some of its implications.   \nIn the 1970s and 1980s, sharp oil price increases pushed the U.S. economy in to \n“stagflation” — an economic downturn with a simultaneous and persistent increase in inflation.  \nAt the time,  the United States was heavily dependent on oil imports for its energy needs, and \nhigher oil prices acted as a tax on U.S. consumers paid to forei gn oil producers.  Of particular \nnote, t he rise in inflation that resulted from higher oil prices tended to persist. Once inflation \nrose, people expected it to remain elevated, suggesting a lack of confidence in the F OMC  to \nmaintain price stability over th e longer run.     \nToday , the economy’s reaction to a sharp change in oil prices is quite different.  As you \nknow, oil and gas production has boomed in the United States over the past two decades  thanks \nto horizontal drilling and fracking technologies.  In addition, the public’s expectations for \ninflation have become better anchored following the Fed’s heightened response to inflationary \nshocks as well as its adoption  in 2012 of an inflation target .  As a result, today , oil price increases  \nlead to an increase in oil and gas production and a related increase in investment spending, \ntemporarily raising inflation but offsetting some or all of the adverse effect on aggregate \neconomic activity. Similarly, today, a sharp downturn in oil and gas p rices can put temporary \ndownward pressure on inflation  with benefits to consumers but adverse consequences for the \nenergy secto r – as we witnessed in 2014 -15.  Importantly, the inflationary effects are viewed as \ntemporary rather than persistent because of the anchoring of inflation expectations around 2 \npercent.  \nAlthough recent developments have muted the effects of oil price changes on the \neconomy  as a whole , they have to some extent increased volatility in the oil sector itself and in \n\n6 \n business capital exp enditures. For example, the oil and gas sector nationwide has experienced a \nsurge in output per rig and per worker.  From 2012 to 2017, productivity in the U.S. oil and gas \nextraction sector more than doubled.1  Associated with this increase in productivit y and along \nwith wide swings in oil prices , the number of rigs and workers required for production has fallen \ndramatically .   \n  Research by my staff finds that the energy sector has had a significant influence on \ninvestment spending in the U.S. economy, bo th to the upside and to the downside. From 2006 to \n2014, for example, total capex spending for U.S. publicly  traded firms rose roughly 41 percent. \nThis boost in spending was largely driven by energy investment, which grew  125 percent \ncompared to a more mod est 21 percent for non-energy investment. By the same token, after the \noil price decline in 2014 , energy investment plunged more than  50 percent over the following  \ntwo years .  Despite a modest 2 percent growth in non -energy investment spending over this \nperiod, total capex fell 15 percent . Variability in energy investment has had a sizable influence \non the broader investment landscape.2  \nOf course the shale oil boom also has had myriad effects on local economies that are \nheavily dependent on the oil and gas extraction industry.  Yesterday , I had the chance to tour the \nlarge oil storage facility in Cushing, just an hour west of here, to learn more about these \ndynamics.  Wor ld trade is an important issue today and it affects many local economies, \nincluding those involved in oil production.  For example, with the lifting of the oil export ban, \nwe’ve seen U.S. oil exports surge , and places like Cushing are dealing with export d elivery \nchallenges until investment in midstream and downstream capacity comes on line .   \n                                                 \n1 Chad Wilkerson . 2018.  “Oil and Gas Productivity Doubled in the Past Five Years —What Happens Next? ” \nOklahoma Economist , Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, June 18.  \n2 David Rodziewicz, 2018. “ Energy Investment Variability within the Macroeconomy ,” Economic Review , Federal \nReserve Bank of Kansas City, Third  Quarter.  \n\n7 \n A key question is whether this now abundant and accessible natural resource has , on net, \nhad a positive effect on local economic conditions. Some theories suggest res ource abundance \nmay increase local economic development through higher demand for labor in the energy sector \nand spillover spending in the local economy. Other theories, though, suggest industries not \nclosely related to the resource extraction industry may  be harmed as energy production expands. \nFor example, labor demand by the extraction industry may be high enough to bid up local wages, \nwhich in turn could pull employees from other lower -paying jobs and make it difficult for other \nindustries to survive. A t the national and international level, this phenomenon has been referred \nto as the “natural resource curse,” but the topic has received much less attention at the local \nlevel.  \nStaff at the Kansas City Fed took a look at this issue and examined how the bo om in the \nU.S. natural gas industry has affected local economies in the central United States. By looking at \nlabor market conditions at the county level in a nine -state region  including Oklahoma,  they \nanalyzed how employment and wages have responded to the  rapid expansion of natural gas \nproduction from 2001 to 2011. The key finding is that the gas boom had a modest but po sitive \nimpact on local labor market outcomes in counties where natural gas production has increased, \nand little evidence of a so-called natural resource curse.3 \nGiven the nature and scale of the  dramatic developments  in the energy sector , we \ncontinue to monitor this segment of our economy very closely, both in the Kansas City Fed \nregion and be yond.  We stay abreast of real-time trends throug h roundtable discussions with \nindustry executives, and we conduct a quarterly survey of our oil and gas firms  to monitor \nactivity .  Our third -quarter survey will be released tomorrow  morning .  We also host an annual \n                                                 \n3 Jason P. Brown. 2014. “ Production of Natural Gas from Shale in Local Economies: A Resource Blessing or \nCurse? ” Economic Review , Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, First Quarter.  \n\n8 \n energy conference with the Dallas Fed , bringing together researchers, executives, bankers, and \ngovernment officials.  This year’s conference focused on trends in world oil supply and demand, \nthe rising importance of energy trade, and the longer -term future of shale.  Overall, the \nconference atte ndees were relatively upbeat about the near -to-intermediate outlook for U.S. oil \nand gas, while recognizing that geopolitical risks could create volatility in the near term.4   \n \n \nConclusion  \n In closing , the U.S. economy is enjoying a long expansion . One particular bright spot in \nthe outlook is the strength of t he oil - and gas -producing sector.  As we assess the outlook for the \neconomy as a whole , it has becom e increasingly important to understand developments in the \nenergy sector to identify  industry -specific shocks and their possible spillovers to the broader \neconomy.   The Kansas City Fed and its Oklahoma City Branch in particular will continue to \nkeep tabs on these energy sector dynamics.  \n Looking ahead, there is good reason to expect continued moder ate growth, with a gradual \nslowing to more sustainable growth rates of both output and employment.  This outlook will \nlikely require further gradual increases in the FOMC’s target interest rate, although the pace and \nextent of future actions remain a key a spect of the Committee’s deliberations.   \n  \n                                                 \n4 See “ Energy and the Economy: Charting the Course Ahead ,” for presentations from the conference.",

            "content": "Digital Currencies: A System Upgrade or Problems 2.0?  \n \nRemarks by  \n \nEsther L. George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n       \n            \n \n \nFebruary 10, 2020  \nThe Volcker Alliance Roundtable  \nWashington, D.C. \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, its governors, officers, or representatives. \n  \n\n1 \n Technology and innovation have a long history of joining forces to disrupt e xisting \nconventions . We certainly see this dynamic playing out in today ’s financial system as it relates to \nhow we think about money and its role in facilitating payments . While  digital currencies —the  \nsubject of t his program —ha ve modern features , the public policy questions associated with \nprivate ly issued  currencies  are familiar ones  in a historical context .   \nWell before the Federal Reserve’s creation in 1913, the United States had already been \nthrough multiple periods of what might be considered “financial experimentation .” In the earl y \n1800s, a time when our nation’s western boundary barely reached the Mississippi River, \nhundreds of commercial banks were issuing their own unique currencies .1 This era of wildcat \nbanking prevailed for nearly three full decades with  banks iss uing even more poorly backed and \nsuspect currency.  In this period, currency values could fluctuate wildly and created a n \nimpediment to commerce for both sides of a transaction;  the good or service being purchased as \nwell as the currency used in payment cou ld be vulnerable to negotiation.  \nStill, the motivation for creating many of these early private currencies was in response to \ndemand from a population seeking access to a medium of exchange  that would improve the flow \nof commerce. In fact, t he demand for private money remained in place even after the founding of \nthe Federal Reserve, as national bank notes and Federal Reserve notes co -existed in circulation \nfor se veral decades. This experience was true in other countries as well.    \nToday’s landscape is diff erent in many respects from the wildcat era. But the questions \nfacing policymakers strike me as having similar refrains.   \n                                                      \n1 Clark M. St. Clair and Hall, D.A. eds. “Documentary History of the Bank of the United States.” Gales and Seaton, \n1832. P. 632.  Note that these remarks were made around 1816.  \n\n2 \n In my remarks this afternoon, I’ll highlight the features of the current payments landscape \nthat drive the private sector ’s digital currency solutions. Th is landscape also is  prompting central \nbanks to respond, and in this regard, I’ll talk about the Federal Reserve’s approach.    \nThis is a good time to remind you that the views I express here are my own, and not \nnecessarily t hose of the Federal Reserve System.  \n \nWhat Problems are Digital Currencies Trying to Solve? \nNew privately issued digital currencies  seek  to bring money into  the digital world  with \nimprovements in speed and cost, and with the scale and scope to provide broad access. The \nability to send money with the speed and convenience of an email message is appealing and understandably gaining rapid adoption.   \nFirst, let’s discuss speed . The Federal Reserve has heard from the industry for a number \nof years that  payments need to be faster . However, o ne of the reasons processes have not been \nupdated is that the underlying infrastructure i s not designed to be instantaneous . As a result, it \ncan take up to a few days for someone  to receive funds in a pers onal account , regardless as to \nwhether the payment was by check, ACH, card , or one of the increasingly popular payment apps . \nThis can be especially problematic for many  Americans who are living paycheck -to-paycheck . It \nalso matters to small businesses and their ability to manage cash flow.   \nThe cost of payments is another pain point  that is potentially amplified by multiple \nintermediaries in a payments transaction . For example,  some providers of digital currencies \nhighlight what they view as excessive interchange fees —an  issue we at the Kansas City Fed have \nbeen studying for more than  15 years —as a reason that merchants may  be interested in  adopt ing \n\n3 \n this new medium of exchange  over current systems .2 According to a 2019 Nilson Report, U.S. \nmerchants collectively paid fees of $ 108 billion to accept credit, debit, and prepaid cards in \n2018.3 The majority of th ese were interchange fees.  \nThe reach of payment capabilities also is an important aspect of to day’s landscap e. \nGlobalization has led to an increase in cross -border payments . Yet because infrastructure,  \ncurrency,  standards, laws and regul ations are domestic and not international, there are many  \nefficiency and coordination challenges  with cross -border payments . As a result, the location and \njurisdiction of payment participants matters , and raises the question of whether digital currencies \ncan address these challenges .   \nFinally, digital currencies have been touted as better facilitating access to the financial \nsystem for the unbanked population. This is an issue that brings to mind  that paper currencies in \nColonial America were developed as something of a proxy for the gold or silver that the British \nlargely kept out of the c olonies. Colonists, unable to access the specie used for commerce in \nmuch of the rest of the developed world, began to develop their own rudimentary system. In it \nwere bills that could be redeemed fo r some amount of another item —for example, the \nContinental Congress issued bills that could be  redeemed for Spanish dollars. For coloni sts, this \nwas one way —although perhaps not t he best or most efficient way —of addressing issues of \naccess.  \nAccording  to the World Bank, 1.7 billion people still do not have access to useful and \naffordable financial p roducts and services . As commerce and payments have become more \n                                                      \n2 See, for example, Hayashi, F . (2004) “ A Puzzle of Card Payment Pricing: Why Are Merchants Still Accepting \nCard Payments? ” Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Payments System Research Working Paper, WP 04 -02. The \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  hosted an international payments policy conference entitled “ Interchange Fees \nin Credit and Debit Card Markets: What Role for Public Authorities? ” in 2005.  \n3 Nilson Report, Issue 1155, June 2019.  \n\n4 \n digital ized, those who rely solely on physical cash for transactions may run the risk of limiting \nthe transactions they can conduct.  \n \nWhat are the Problems  Associated with these I nnovations ?  \nEach of t hese are legitimate problems that digital currencies seem well suited  to address . \nYet we can’t overlook that despite efforts to make payments fast er, less costly , and broadly \naccessible, today’s privately issued digital currencies operate largely outside our  existing \ninstitutional and regulatory frameworks . This raises importa nt questions for policymakers. I \nwould highlight three potential problems related in particular to central bank objectives: the role \nof the banking system, the implications fo r monetary policy, and the risks to financial stability.   \nDigital currencies and other private nonbank financial innovations challenge the notion of \nthe traditional bank business model. Our institutional frameworks have for some time regarded \ncommercial banks as foundational, even special , to our financial system  in three particular \naspects.4 First, no other type of financial company and its funding  has access to the public safety \nnet of federal deposit insurance and the Fede ral Reserve’s discount window. Second, banks a re \nregulated and supervised because of this safety net and their key role in the economy. Indeed, the \nseparation of commercial banking from investment banking and commerce was an important part of the prudential regula tory structure for many  years. Finally, only banks ha ve direct access to \nthe Federal Reserve’s payments rails.   \nNonbank financial companies are competing aggressively for these traditional banking \nfunctions. Lending platforms offered by nonbank entities allow households and bus inesses to \n                                                      \n4 Corrigan, E. Gerald, 1983. “Are Banks Special? ” Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, 1982 Annual Report. \nAvailable at http://www.bu.edu/econ/files/2012/01/Corrigan -Are-Banks -Special_main -text.pdf .  \n\n5 \n access credit, and nonbank payment  services are growing rapidly. According to McKinsey data, \nglobal revenue in these services grew to $1.9 trillion in 2018.   \nSome federal and state banking authorities have considered the use of special purpose \ncharters as a way to cast a regulatory frame around t hese new “fintech” activities. In 2018, t he \nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency announced it would issue a fintech charter , only to \nface legal challenges. At the state level, legislation is beginning to accommodate digital currency \nactivities through special purpose depository institutions operating  under new regulatory \nregimes. For example, the state of Wyoming has passed legislation that will allow these new special p urpose depository institutions  to apply  for membership in the Federal Reserve S ystem  \nand to gain access to the payment system through a Federal Reserve Bank master account.   \nThe adoption of private digital currencies at scale also has i mplications for monetary \npolicy. Should digital c urrencies lead to a large share of financial transactions taking place \noutside of the  current  system, then digital currencies may challenge current operating \nframeworks.  For instance, the Federal Reserve implements monetary policy by engaging with a \nlimite d number of primary dealers. This centralized framework could be challenged should a \ndecentralized medium of exchange develop which facilitates financial settlement outside of the markets in which primary dealers operate.   \nIn addition, one of the most bas ic functions of the central bank is to supply liquidity in \ntimes of crisis.  However, without a clearly defined set of counterparties, the benefit of this \nfunction could be limited. More generally, the proliferation of digital currencies may challenge the ability of central banks to achieve their longer -run macroeconomic objectives to the extent it \nerodes the ability of monetary policy to influence broad financial conditions confronting households and businesses. \n\n6 \n Finally, the stability of the financial syste m is foundational to the ability of central banks \nto achieve their objecti ves. Events that trigger a loss of confidence or incite a classic bank -like \nrun may not find remedies in the existing regulatory and policy toolkit , including the Federal \nReserve’s d iscount window .   \n \nWhat are Central Banks Doing to Address  These Problems ?  \nThe accelerating pace of change has implications for financial systems around the world \nand for the way central banks conduct their busi ness to meet their objectives. To that end, the \nBank for International Settlements  (BIS)  has organized an Innovation Hub where global central \nbanks c an collaborate and experiment. Additionally, m ore than 50 central banks are engaged in  \ndigital currency work , according to the BIS. Countries like Swed en and Uruguay are evaluating \ndigital currency prototypes.   \nAlthough t he Federal Reserve has no plans to issue a digital currency, we are carefully \nmonitoring and studying global developments. A more immediate priority has been to modernize \nour own payment rails to meet the demand for  reliable, real -time payments , as are other central \nbanks around the world.  \nWe are currently developing a new retail payment service called F edNow  to support \nwidespread adoption of faster payments in the United States . This service will operate alongside \na private sector service to provide real -time, payment -by-payment, settlement of interbank \nobligations through debits and credits to banks’ balances in accounts at the Reserve Banks while incorporating clearing functiona lity, thus allowing for end- to-end fa ster payments . We expect \nFedNow will be able to address the concerns that we’ve heard from the public  about the need for \na real -time payments infrastructure.  \n\n7 \n Other central banks also  are addressing the desire for speed . The Reserve Bank of \nAustralia developed its Fast Settlement Service, which “enables final and irrevocable settlement \nof individual New Payments Platform transactions in real time.” TARGET Instant Payment Settlement, common ly known as TIPS, was developed t o reach retail participants  in the \nEurozone . Additionally, modernization efforts are  underway for countries with existing  faster \npayment  systems , such as the U.K.  \nAs it relates to the costs of today’s payment system, central banks are responding in \ndifferent ways. S ome countries allow central banks and other public authorities to direct ly \nregulate the payments system and often have the authority to regulate certain fees associated with making a payment . Central banks such as the Federal Reserve operat e retail payment systems to \nachieve its objectives for efficiency, access ibility,  and safety. Operating alongside the private \nsector in the delivery of retail payment services to some 10,000 financial institutions in the U.S. has been judged by the Government A ccountability Office in a 2016 report to promote \ninnovation and competition with benefit s to the public.\n5 \nCentral banks also have begun to coordinate their efforts at an international  level .  For \nexample, this year’s Financial Stability Board  (FSB)  work program highlights how the FSB, in \ncoordination with the BIS’s Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructure  (CPMI) , will \ncreate a roadmap for the G -20 to enhance global cross -border payments . As participants of both \nthe FSB and the CPMI, the Federal Res erve will be working with its  international counterparts to \naddress some of the pain points  with cross -border payments. \n                                                      \n5 See: “Federal Reserve’s Competition with Other Providers Benefits Customers, but Additional Reviews Could \nIncrease Assurance of Cost Accuracy.” U.S. Government Accountability Office. August 30, 2016, at  \nhttps://www.gao.gov/products/GAO -16-614 and “The Federal Reserve in the Payments Mechanism.” Feder al \nReserve System. January 1998, at  \nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/press/general/1998/19980105/19980105.pdf .  \n\n8 \n Finally, a ccess to  financial services remains an important policy goal . This is an \nimportant consideration for the U.S. as well , although access to technology itself has been noted \nas a barrier with some 45  percent  of unbanked households having  neither a smartphone nor \ninternet  access at home. This means almost half of the unbanked may not be able to use these \nnew payment solutions . Providing a foundational infrastructure such as broadband internet \nservice will be essential for this population . The Federal Reserve has viewed such investments \nfavorably for purposes of the Community Reinvestment Act.   \n \nConclusion  \n Payments digitaliza tion, new entrants, and new business models will continue to disrupt \nand reshape th e financial services industry. As I noted earlier , digital currencies may well have \nthe potential to address pain points in the current payments system. At the same time, however, \nwe should be mindful of lessons from the past.   \nRealizing th e benefits  of these alternative solutions  argues for careful consideration of the \nimportant safeguards that have fostered the public’s confidence in, and the safety of , the financial \nsystem. To that end, it is important for central banks and other policymakers to monitor closely these emerging technologies and to assess potential implications to the banking industry, to financial stability, and to monetary policy, which are essential for securing  the public’s trust and \nconfidence.   \nI look forward to the insights that will come from this forum.",

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n   \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \nJanuary 14, 2020  \nThe Central Exchange  \nKansas City, Missouri  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers, or representatives.   \n\n \n \n1 \n Thank you and welcome to the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City .  I’m pleased to \ncontinue this New Year’s tradition with  the Central Exchange of offering  my view of the \neconomic outlook for the coming year.1    \nBefore I do that, however, I want to take a few minutes to remember former Federal \nReserve Chairman Paul Volcker , who passed away last month.  C ertainly, others worked more \nclosely with Chairman Volcker than I did, and a number of wonderful tributes have been offered \nsince his passing.  But in starting a new year and reflecting on the challenges facing the Federal \nReserve in 2020 and beyond, I was  thinking about how much the nation and our institution in \nparticular owes to him.  His leadership and public service also have been important to me \npersonally.  \nI came to work for the Kansas City Fed in 1982.  I was excited about my new job as a \nbank exami ner and pleased with my $10,000 annual salary to help me pay for what at that time \nwas considered an affordable 12  percent  fixed -rate mortgage.   Paul Volcker was the Fed Chair \nwho signed my examiner credentials.  In that role, I would learn that he paid cl ose attention to \nthe health of the financial system, including small banks in this region.  He understood well that \nhigh interest rates were taking their toll on the economy and especially in our region where \nagriculture, energy and real estate conditions resulted in hundreds of bank failures.  He also \nunderstood that the long- run health of the economy and the public’s well -being depended on \nbreaking the back of high inflation.  That took courage to endure short -term—but  very real — \nsuffering for long -term benefits.  \nAfter  I became president of the Kansas City Fed  in 2011, Paul Volcker took my calls and \nalways welcomed a visit to New York, willing to share his experience and advice with a new Fed \n                                                 \n1 I thank Kansas City Fed Vice President and Economist George Kahn and Senior Vice President Diane Raley for \ntheir assistance in preparing these remarks.  \n\n \n \n2 \n president like me.  He was a source of encouragement and inspir ation.  And even in New York \nCity, where they are proud of t heir “no -eye-contact -anonymity,”  when you crossed the street \nwith Paul Volcker to go to his favorite restaurant, heads turned.   \nHe spoke his mind and his views were well informed.  Watch his blunt statements at \ncongressional hearings and other public events.  Intellectual honesty, public service, and \nleadership were his hallmarks.  And even if you didn’t agree with him, you knew where he stood \nand that his interest was in how best to serve the Ame rican public.   \nFinally, the Kansas City Fed owes a debt of gratitude to Paul Volcker whose attendance \nwas essential to the 1982 launch of our fledging economic policy symposium in Jackson Hole, \nWyoming.  In the years that followed, he remained accessible to us.  In 2009, Paul came to \nKansas City, where he was awarded the Truman Medal for Economic Policy . He was willing to \nread our Bank’s proposals and papers and would offer his comments – sometimes criticism, \nsometimes support – but it was always helpful a nd welcomed insight.   \nCertainly, I did not agree with him on every issue, but that is never the point.  Leadership, \nintegrity, and service were at the core of his character , and it’s something to aspire to today .  It \nwas an honor to have started my career  under his leadership as Fed chair and to have engaged \nwith him during his post -Fed years.  I am grateful for his mentorship. \nOf course, the economic environment that we face today is quite different than the one \nthat challenged Paul Volcker and his collea gues on the Federal Open Market Committee.  That is \nperhaps a good segue to sharing my views on the challenges the Federal Reserve faces in 2020 as \nwe consider the economic landscape and our monetary policy settings.  \nWhen I spoke to you last January, the e conomy looked to be in good shape in terms of \ngrowth with low unemployment and low inflation.   At that time, the Federal Reserve had raised \n\n \n \n3 \n its policy interest rate to a range of 2¼ to 2½ percent —a total of 225 basis points since the end of  \n2015.  The len gthy expansion seemed poised to continue with historically low unemployment \nand muted inflation, although sentiment began to sour and recession fears mounted in the face of \nslowing  global growth and trade policy uncertainty .  Given these downside risks , the Federal \nReserve reversed course last July and eased policy three times .   \n \nOutlook for 2020 \nAs we turn the page to a new year, many of the themes from 2019 seem likely to carry \nover to 2020.  In particular, I continue to see the expansion supported by solid growth in consumer spending with continued weakness in manufacturing and  business spending.  While a  \nstrong labor market and rising incomes will support consumer spending, the underlying cause of weak business spending—sluggish global growth and ongoing trade tensions —will likely persist \nover the near term .  The combination of these factors should lead to slower growth in real \nGDP —our broadest indicator of economic activity —to its longer -run trend of 1¾ to 2 percent.  \nWith growth near trend, I would e xpect the unemployment rate to remain near i ts current level of \n3.5 percent and inflation to remain benign.   \n  Because the consumer is critical to th e ongoing expansion, monitoring a number of \nfundamental factors that drive consumer spending will be impor tant this year .  The good news is \nthat the consumer is entering the new year with considerable spending momentum.  For example, household consumption data was stronger than expected in the third quarter with  spending on \ndurable and non -durable goods r ising at a solid pace.  While we don’t yet have official data on \n\n \n \n4 \n consumer spending for December, a report from MasterCard  indicates a strong holiday shopping \nseason with record high e -commerce sales.2  \nOne reason to be optimistic that this momentum is sustainable is that residential \ninvestment appears to have responded to lower mortgage rates. Recent data indicate positive \ncontributions from most major housing indicators , as single -family construction and brokers’ \ncommissions rebound.  Forward -looking m easures, such as single -family starts and permits, \ncontinue to move up strongly, suggesting the strength in residential investment growth will likely contribute to growth in the medium term.  Another key factor to keep an eye on is the labor market.  With the unemployment rate at \n3.5 percent, a robust labor market supported consumer spending in 2019 and should continue to \ndo so in 2020, e ven as payroll growth continues to slow  in line with the economy’s potential .  \nThe economy added on average 176,000 jobs per month through December of last year , \ncompared to 223,000 per month in 2018.  In addition, the  Bureau of Labor Statistics  has reported \nthat the pace of job openings has slowed.\n3   \nWhile I project  consumer spending to remain robust , some  moderation from recent strong \ngrowth is to be expected for a number of reasons.  First, as I just discussed, employment is likely \nto grow at a slower pace this year than last year.  Second , while the consumption of goods has \nremained robust, the consumpti on of services , which represent s a larger share of consumer \nspending, decelerated in the third quarter .  Third , real retail sales data have leveled off since \nreaching a peak in August of last year , and imports of consumer goods and autos have slowed. \n                                                 \n2 https://newsroom.mastercard.com/press -releases/mastercard -spendingpulse -u-s-retail -sales -\ngrew -3-4-percent -this-holiday -season/  \n3 According to t he Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey ( JOLTS) , job openings \ndeclined  from 5.2% of total private nonfarm payroll employment plus job openings at the end of November 2018 \n(the current cyclical high) to 4.8% of total private employment plus job openings at the end of October 2019.  \n\n \n \n5 \n The recent slowing in imports may reflect the effect of tariff increases that were imposed in \nSeptember and have fallen mostly on consumer goods.  Finally, consumer spending could \nmoderate based on sentiment about the economic outlook.  W hile confidence measures remain \nnear post -recession highs, expectations for the future bear watching.  Based on the Conference \nBoard ’s survey  of consumer confidence, the differential between consumer expectations for the \nfuture and their assessment of current conditions has  widened over the past several years. In the \npast, when confidence in future conditions has fallen relative to confidence in the present \nsituation, consumer spending has tended to slow.  That will be something to keep on an eye on this year .  \nIn contrast t o consumer spending, business spending has been relatively weak for some \ntime.  T he goods -producing sector, in particular, which includes manufacturing, mining, energy \nproduction and construction, has  faced a range of challenges that has limited the  pace o f its \nexpansion. For example, U.S. tariffs on imports, retaliatory tariffs on our exports abroad, along \nwith weaker global growth and continued uncertainty surrounding trade policy , have created stiff \nheadwinds for manufacturers. Our manufacturing survey f or the Kansas City Fed’s region  shows \nthat activity has contracted in each of the past six months .  In addition, the Institute for Supply \nManagement’s manufacturing survey indicates that national manufacturing activity moved into contractionary territory i n August. For the energy sector, oil prices declined 24 percent from \nOctober 2018 to October 2019, contributing to a slowing in drilling activity across most oil -\nproducing regions.  More recently, oil prices have rebounded somewhat , which may lead to some \nincrease in production going forward.  \nSo on balance , the broad economy continues to grow with high levels of employment and \nlow inflation, while downside risks have lingered  and strained key parts of the goods -producing \n\n \n \n6 \n sector. This dichotomy presents a challenge for policymakers as we determine the appropriate \nstance for monetary policy under such conditions.  \n \nChallenges for Monetary Policy  \nLooking back at last year , I viewed monetary policy decisions in light of an  econ omy that \nwas slowing , as expected , toward its trend rate of growth due in large part to the ebbing of fiscal \nstimulus  and the shift to higher interest rates .  But I also recognized that  slower global growth \nabroad  and trade policy uncertainty posed downsid e risks to the outlook.  Even so, I did not \nsupport the three outright cuts in the  target federal funds rate starting in July  because I preferred \nto wait for clearer evidence that the headwinds from global developments were threatening to \nderail the ongoin g economic expansion.  I supported the decision in December to hold rates  \nsteady as a prudent move while  we assess a number of factors going into this  year.   \nWith an economy growing at or above potential, a strong labor market, and low and \nstable inflatio n, policymakers  will need time to judge the proper stance of policy .  We will need \nto assess whether the 2019 rate cuts prove to be “ insurance cuts ” that will need to be reversed if \nheadwinds fade .  On the other hand, the 2019 rate cuts may turn out to be a reset to  a more \nneutral policy stance , recognizing  that the equilibrium federal  funds rate may be lower than \npreviously assumed.  Finally, it could be the case that  downside risks and uncertainties persist in \na way that keeps investment spending weak and spills over to the consumer, altering the  modal \noutlook and requiring further policy easing . \n  Over the longer run, a key concern is the capacity of monetary policy to address a future \neconomic downturn should it arise.  One reason for this concern is tha t the federal funds rate is \nhistorically low, leaving little policy space to deal with a future recession .  In a typical recession, \n\n \n \n7 \n the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) has reduced the federal funds rate target by 5 to 6 \npercentage points.  With the funds rate target currently at 1½ to 1¾ percent, the Fed has less than \nhalf the policy space available relative to the past  before hitting the zero lower bound on rates.  \nThis is not just a concern for U.S. policymakers.  Interest rates are at historically lo w \nlevels in a number of advanced economies, including the euro area, Japan, Canada, and the UK.  In fact, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan, as well as a number of other central \nbanks , have set their policy rates below zero.    \nCentral banks a lso have expressed concern that inflation has run persistently below their \ntarget s.  In the United States , both headline and core inflation as measured by the personal \nconsumption expenditure price index have remained muted since the Fed announced its 2 perc ent \ninflation objective in 2012.  The fact that this, too, is a global issue affecting both Japan and the \neuro area, r aises the possibility that global structural factors outside the control of policymakers \nare driving inflation dynamics.   \nIn the Unit ed States, persistently low inflation has been unusual  in light of historically \ntight labor markets.  This has led policymakers to mark down their estimates of the natural rate of unemployment —the unemployment rate consistent with stable inflation.  These e stimates of \nthe natural rate have come down from over 5 percent in 2013 to a median of 4.1 percent in \nDecember 2019.\n4  Even with this lowering of estimates of the natural rate of unemployment, the \nactual unemployment rate still remains below the natural r ate.  In the past , this situation would \nhave typically put upward pressure on inflation.  So it raises questions about the accuracy of \nestimates of the natural rate as well as about the relationship between inflation and slack in labor markets.    \n                                                 \n4 Based on the central tendency of the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) for the longer -run \nunemployment rate reported in 2013 and the median  projection  of the SEP reported in December 2019.  \n\n \n \n8 \n This weak ening of the relationship between inflation and labor market slack perplexes \ncentral banks, making it very difficult to credibly achieve their inflation targets  by pushing the \nunemployment rate down.  Even if such a policy were successful it might entail a  further, \nsignificant tightening  of the labor market , leading to a misallocation of labor resources and a \nbuildup of financial imbalances.   \nGiven these concerns, the Federal Reserve i s engaging in a r eview of its monetary policy \nstrategy, tools, and communications. The review has several parts, including a series of Fed \nListens events around the country designed to help policymakers better understand the \nperspectives of people from diverse backgrounds and with varied interests.  The Kansas City Fed \nhosted one  such event in October.  T he Federal Open Market Committee also is devot ing time at \na series of its  regular meetings to assess lessons learned in the aftermath of the Great Recession  \nand to consider  how monetary policy can best serve the public, including possible enhancements \nor changes to its monetary policy  framework that would help the Federal Reserve meet its \nstatutory objectives for employment and price stability —especially in the event of a fut ure \ndownturn in economic activity .  Fed  Chair Jay Powell has indicated that the FOMC will publicly \nreport the conclusions of its discussions, likely during  the first half of this year.   \n \nConclusion \n The U.S. economy is currently doing well, with real GDP growth near trend, \nunemployment near record lows, and inflation low and stable .  While business spending is in a \nsoft spot, household spending has remained robust. Keeping rates on hold for now is appropriate in my view as we assess the economy’s response to last year’s rate cuts and monitor incoming data.   \n\n \n \n9 \n  For the longer run, the Federal Reserve will  be reevaluat ing its monetary policy \nstrategies, tools, and communications to address future downturns in a low interest rate economy.  \nWith limited policy s pace between our current federal funds rate target and the zero lower bound \non nominal interest rates, policymakers are likely to find themselves looking  deep into the policy  \ntoolkit to fight future recessionary shocks .  Clearly explaining the Federal Reserve’s monetary \npolicy strategies and longer -run goals will be essential to the institution’s credibility and to the \npublic ’s trust and confidence.",

In my discussion, I will review the tremendous hit to the economy inflicted by the \ncoronavirus, before highlighting some recent indicators that suggest a recovery is underway , \nincluding across the seven states of the Tenth Federal Reserve District that is served by the \nKansas City Fed. This is a region that spans much of the central plains from western Missouri through Colorado, Wyoming and northern New Mexico . I will then discuss the extraordin ary \npolicy response, both fiscal and monetary, that is underlying this recovery , closing with a \ndiscussion of the economic outlook, and the implications of that outlook for monetary policy .  \nThe past few months have been a challenging t ime for our economy and our  nation. The \ncoronavirus pandemic has led to a public health emergency unlike any in modern times . \nMeasures taken to control the virus have delivered an unprecedented shock to economic activity, both nationally and in the Tenth D istrict.  \nThe economy  enter ed recession in February, with real output falling 5 percent in the first \nquarter of the year , the most significant decline since late 2008, and a widespread expectation \nthat activity will decline at a record pace in the second quarter . A tremendous number of \nAmericans have lost their jobs  since March , pushing the unemployment rate up from one of its \nlowest levels in half a century to the highest reading s in the post -war era  in just a matter of \nmonths .  \nThe coronavirus  recession  has some unique elements . Modern r ecessions have typically \nresulted from imbalances within the  economy that become unstable over time, either as \neconomic demand exceeds supply leading to a buildup in inflation or as financial imbalances unwind after an unsustainable build up. H owever, the coronavirus shock cam e from outside the \neconomy . An otherwise healthy economy  was more or less put into a medically induced  coma to \n\n2 \n protect the public ’s health  with policies that allowed only businesses deemed essential to remain \nopen.  \nThe nature of the measures taken to combat the coronavirus also have differentiated the \ncurrent recession from past recessions . The need for social distancing has taken a particularly \nheavy toll on the consumption of services . The services  sector is often relatively stable in a \ndownturn;  this time services are leading the decline.   \n \nLABOR MARKET DEVELOPMENTS  \nOne consequence of the services -led downturn has been that certain parts of the labor \nmarket have been  hit harder than others. Almost two -thirds  of the 22 million jobs  lost in March \nand April were concentrated in three broad industries: leisure and hospitality, education and \nhealth services, and retail trade. The vast majority  of the 8 million layoffs in leisure and \nhospitality was concentrated in  highly socially interactive  sectors, including accommodation s, \nrestaurants  and bars . Within education and health services, dentist and physician offices cut \nmany workers,  as did day care providers . While we saw strong job gains in these industries in \nMay,  with employment increasing by 2 million jobs,  a full recovery is still far off .  \nIt is notable that, partly as a consequence of the sectoral distribution of layoffs , different \ndemographic groups, though all suffering large declines in employment, have bee n affected to \nvarying degrees . The increase in the unemployment rate has been particularly pronounced for \nHispanic workers, increasing from 4.4 percent in February to 17.6 percent in May . African -\nAmerican workers have also seen a large increase in unemploy ment, from 5.8 percent in \nFebruary to 16.8 percent in May . It is also concerning that , unlike most demographic groups, the \nunemployment rate for  African -Americans showed no improvement in May relative to April  \n\n3 \n even as the overall economy added millions of jobs . Similar to previous recessions, younger \nworkers also have been  especially hard hit by job losses .  \nA particular feature of the current recession is that  women have  suffered disproportionate  \njob losses, in contrast to their relative performance in the  typical recession .1 Women held more \njobs in the hardest -hit industries and a majority of these women did not have a college degree. \nConsequently, the unemployment rate of non- college -educated  women rose more than  fourfold \nfrom 4.5 percent in Fe bruary to almost 21  percent in April, a far larger increase than experienced \nby men with similar educational background . A similar imbalance was also observed for college -\neducated men and women, though to a slightly lessor degree . Overall, women went from having \nan unemployment rate below their male counterparts in February to a far higher rate after the \ncoronavirus shock.  \n \nECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT S \nAlthough every part of the United States experienced dramatic decreases in activity, \nstates in the Tenth District have fared slightly better , likely due to the lower case counts \nexperienced in the region .2 All the same, more than 21 percent of the Tenth District labor force \nhas filed for unemployment benefits since mid -March , with employment in the leisure and \nhospitality sector recording a dramatic 44 percent decline in the region . \n More recently, as stay -at-home orders and other restrictions on activity have been lifted \nwe have started to see signs of recovery, both in the Tenth District and nationally . Because there \n                                                           \n1 Didem Tuzemen and Thao Tran. 2020. “ Women Take a Bigger Hit in the First Wave of Job Losses due to COVID -\n19.” Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Economic Bulletin , April 16.  \n2 For further detail  on the economic effects of the pandemic,  see Jason Brown and Alison Felix . 2020. “COVID -19 \nStuns U.S. and Tenth District Economies, but Both Show Signs of Stabilization .” Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas \nCity, Economic Bulletin , June 17.  \n\n4 \n is a lag in the official data , economists at the Kansas City Fed and elsewhere have been \nmonitoring more timely, but less traditional, indicators of activity . One of these measures is f oot \ntraffic to businesses . Foot traffic in mid -April was down  60 percent relative to early March in \nboth the U.S. and the Tenth District.  Traffic began to improve by late April, and has picked up \nslightly faster in the Tenth District, where stay -at-home orders were lifted earlier . As of early \nJune, foot traffic rela tive to the  first week in March was down about  25 percent in the District \nversus 35 pe rcent for the nation as a whole, still depressed but a considerable improvement \nrelative to where we were in April.  \n \nTHE FISCAL POLICY RESPONSE  \nThe pick -up that we have seen has been importantly supported by some  of the  swiftest \nand most aggressive fiscal policy  actions on record. In March and April, Congress enacted four \nbills related to the current pandemic and economic crisis , providing an esti mated  $2.9 trillion of \nfiscal support to the economy, including one -time direct payments to households, an expansion \nof unemployment benefits, forgivable loans to small businesses, and support for new Federal \nReserve lending facilities.3 These fiscal measures are unprecedented not only in terms of the ir \nsize, but also in terms of how rapidly they were enacted . As a comparison, following the 2008 \nfinancial crisis, Congress provided a total of $2.5 trillion of fiscal support to the economy, enacted over a two -year span from 2008 to 2010.  \nSo far, i ncreased transfer payments from the government, including importantly both \ndirect payments and increased unemployment benefits, have covered the loss of income for many \n                                                           \n3 The CARES Act allows employers and  self-employed people to defer Social S ecurity taxes from March 2020 \nthrough December 2021. The CBO estimates that the federal government will reduce revenues over 2020 -21, but \nincrease revenues over 2022 -23. Including this deferral, while excluding the estimated revenue increases over \n2022- 23, brings the total  fiscal package  to $3.6 trillion.  \n\n5 \n households . As a result, eco nomy -wide  disposable income actually incr eased in April despite a \nsharp fall in wage income . However, the coronavirus  is affecting household economic prospects \ndifferently, often depending on how easily jobs can be transitioned to a remote work \nenvironment . Relatively secure and highly  paid  jobs are most often the easiest jobs to make \nremote, while relatively low -paying jobs are overwhelmingly less amenable to remote delivery.  \n \nTHE FEDERAL RESERVE’S POLICY RESPONSE  \nThe Federal Reserve has also responded quickly and aggressively to the developing \ncoronavirus crisis . Credit conditions tightened at an unprecedented pace  as the pandemic spread \nand states and local jurisdictions began to issue shelter -in-place and quarantine orders. Economic \nstrains apparent i n early March developed into a fully -realized financial panic weeks later when \ninvestors fled risk y assets resulting in sharp asset price declines, increased debt spreads, and \nnotable deterioration in market liquidity. Commercial banks experienced draws on existing lines \nof credit, shadow banks saw  funding runs, and short -term corporate debt issuance stalled as \ninvestors flocked to the safety and liquidity of cash and shorter maturity government securities. Even conditions in markets typically considered sa fe-haven s, such as longer -dated Treasuries  \nand agency guaranteed mortgage -backed securities, became strained.\n4  \nThe severity of the liquidity crisis threatened to exacerbate the economic contraction \nfrom the pandemic, prompting a forceful response from the  Federal Open Market Committee \n(FOMC). On March 3, the FOMC reduced its benchmark rate 50 basis points in response to burgeoning economic stress before ultimately cutting the target rate to zero a few weeks later due to rising financial strains. Credit con ditions finally began to ease around March 23 after the \n                                                           \n4 Karlye Dilts Steadman, 2020. “Measuring Liquidity Risk in Treasury Markets: The G -Spread” Economic Bulletin, \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, forthcoming.  \n\n6 \n FOMC announced purchases of Treasury securities and agency mortgage -backed securities in \nthe amounts needed to facilitate orderly market functioning , and established new credit facilities \nto promote the flow of credit. \nIn addition to FOMC actions, liquidity facilities administered by the Federal Reserve \nhave helped to further ease financial conditions and improve market functioning. Commercial \nbanks, for example, have been encouraged to borrow from the Federal Reserve’s discount window  to maintain the flow of credit in the face of increased demand by businesses . At the \nsame time, the Federal Reserve has established a number of temporary liquidity facilities that make short -term loans against safe colla teral to address illiquidity at nonbanks.\n5 These \ntemporary facilities are largely guided by the Federal Reserve's 2007 -09 crisis -era experience, \nthough their scope has been expanded to include a wider variety of accepted collateral and a larger number of e ligible participants. Domestically, these facilities aim to ensure credit remains \navailable to U.S. businesses and local governments. For example, the Federal Reserve has intervened directly in the commercial paper market to facilitate the flow of short- term credit to \ncorporations. Globally, the Federal Reserve has established swap lines with other central banks so that U.S. dollar funding is widely available abroad.  \nThe sudden nature of the coronavirus shock, however, presents unique and unprecedented \nfinancial challenges for businesses and local governments. While the Federal Reserve’s initial \nresponses eased short -term funding stresses, additional actions were required to address longer -\nterm concerns. In a signif icant departure from the 2007- 09 crisis -era policy, the Federal Reserve \njoined the U.S. Treasury, as authorized under the CARES Act, to provide temporary relief to \nlocalities and businesses to offset revenue losses. Examples include programs that lend directly \n                                                           \n5 Rajdeep Sengupta & Fei Xue, 2020. \" The Global Pandemic and Run on Shadow Banks ,\" Economic Bulletin , Federal \nReserve Bank of Kansas City, issue May 11, 2, pages 1 -5, May.  \n\n7 \n to smaller businesses with limited ac cess to external capital markets, programs that provide \nliquidity to financial institutions participating in the Treasury’s Paycheck Protection Program, \nand direct intervention in corporate bond, corporate loan, and local government bond markets.6 \nThese lo nger-term interventions require the Federal Reserve to take on more credit risk than that \nassumed by short -term liquidity facilities, and, as such, are backed by an equity stake from the \nU.S. Treasury, which  will absorb any losses. To the extent that these  funds can assist businesses \nand local governments in maintaining their operations , however, they help lay the foundation for \na quicker recovery once the pandemic abates.  \nSo far, Federal Reserve actions appear successful. Markets are largely functio ning in an \norderly fashion and debt spreads are near pre -pandemic levels  for highly rated  borrowers . \nMoreover, utilization rates at some liquidity facilities and the discount window have declined, while market activity has resumed, suggesting that liquidity condi tions have improved.  \n  \nTHE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK  \n The improvement in financial conditions should further support a rebound in economic \nactivity backed by fiscal support and a further relaxation of virus -related restrictions , however, \nthere are a number of risks that could hold up the r ecovery .  \nMost important is the course of the virus itself . A renewed upsurge in infections and \nresumed social distancing, either mandatory or voluntary, is likely to be a persistent risk, at least until a vaccine has been developed  or treatment options sufficiently improve.  \n Putting aside the direct effects of the virus, there are other elements of the health crisis \nthat are likely to prolong the recovery . One risk is that consumer s and businesses react to the new \n                                                           \n6 Huixin Bi & Jacob Dice & Chaitri Gulati & W. Blake  Marsh, 2020. \" Understanding the Recent Rise in Municipal \nBond Yields ,\" Economic Bulletin , Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, May 27.  \n\n8 \n uncertainty introduced by the virus  by pulling  back on consumption and investment with the goal \nof building precautionary buffers  against future disruptions . While rational at the individual \nlevel , such a pullback can hampe r growth across the wider economy .  \n Another risk comes from the global economy . Foreign demand for U.S. exports had \nalready been weak for some time before the crisis . Now, with the virus rolling across foreign \neconomies at varying times and intensities, it seems unlikely that we should expect much support \nfrom overseas as our economy picks back up.  \n Finally, while fiscal policy is currently providing substantial support for growth, there is \na risk that the impetus from fiscal policy will turn negative be fore the recovery has been fully \nrealized . The coronavirus pandemic has created serious financial consequences for state and \nlocal governments, which  unlike the federal government, must balance their budgets. In the near \nterm, governments are facing liquid ity challenges, as many tax deadlines have been postponed, \nleading to massive drops in income tax collections this spring. Also, s helter -in-place orders have \nsharply reduced consumer spending, thereby lowering sales tax collections. At the same time that \nstate revenues are under pressure, the demand for state services, including spending on medical \nsupplies and temporary health facilities, is growing . Although funding from the CARES Act , \nwhich allocated $150 billion in direct aid to state and local governme nts, including over $11 \nbillion for states in the Tenth D istrict,  will help states cover some of  the costs associated with \nCovid- 19 and partially fill budget gaps in the short term, strains are likely to intensify . Indeed, \nmany states are already making difficult decisions about spending cuts as they finalize budgets \nfor the next fiscal year.  \nIn the longer term, governments will experience large revenue declines that are likely to \nlead to significant budget cuts for years to come . Likewise, the current cr isis is likely to further \n\n9 \n stress the funding of government pension plans, as contributions will likely come under pressure \nand investment returns decline sharply . Even as some economic indicators are starting to \nimprove, evidence from previous recessions s uggests that the economic effects of the \ncoronavirus shock on state and local governments may take some time to fully materialize and may persist even as health risks dissipate.\n7   \n \nOUTLOOK FOR POLICY  \nHow does th is economic outlook shape my views on the appropriate stance of monetary \npolicy?  One thing to note is that d etermining the correct  path for policy is likely to be even more \ndifficult than usual given what I expect to be the continued volatility of the incoming data . \nIndicators are expected t o improve  in the third quarter even as the level of activity remains \ndepressed . Overall, it might be awhile before the dust settles and we gain insight  on whether \nfurther accommodation is necessary or not .  \nAs the economy’s reopening progresses, we should get more clarity about the impact of \nthe actions we’ve taken, as well as the impact of fiscal stimulus . I am also realistic that the \nextraordinary uncertainty about the path of the pandemic over the second half of the year and the \neconomic outlook will require a fair amount of patience and wisdom as we navigate the likely long-lasting implications of the coronavirus shock.  \n \n \n                                                           \n7 See Alison Felix , 2020. \" COVID -19 Challenges State and Local Government Finances .\" Economic Bulletin , Federal \nReserve Bank of Kansas City,  May 13.",

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n          \n \n \nMarch 6, 2020  \nThe Shadow Open Market Committee  \nNew York, N.Y.  \n \n    \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers, or representatives.  \n  \n\n \n \n1 \n I appreciate this opportunity to pay tribute to Marvin Goodfriend and his many \ncontributions to the theory and practice of monetary policy.1 At the Kansas City Fed, we knew \nMarvin as a scholar and a good Federal Reserve colleague. Marvin also was a participa nt in a \nnumber of our Jackson Hole Economic Symposiums . As a Research Officer at the Richmond \nFed, he attended the first symposium that we h eld in Jackson Hole , Wyoming, in 1982, where his \nwork on “Discount Window Borrowing, Monetary Control, and the Post -October 6, 1979 \nFederal Reserve Operating Procedures” was widel y cited.2 Thirty -four years later i n 2016, as a \nprofessor at Carnegie Mellon, he presented a paper making the case for deeply negative interest \nrates  as a policy tool  that could breach the zero lower bound on nominal rates. He argued that \n“the zero interest bound encumbrance on monetary policy should be removed so that movements \nin the intertemporal terms of trade can be reflected fully in interest rate policy to sustain price stability and full employment with a minimum of inefficient and c ostly alternative policies  \n[emphasis  added] .”\n3  \nWilling to challenge conventional views, Marvin expressed concern that “c entral banks \n[would]  be tempted to rely even more heavily on balance sheet policy in lieu of interest rate \npolicy, in effect exerting s timulus by fiscal policy means via distortionary credit allocation, the \nassumption of credit risk and maturity transformation, all taking risks on behalf of taxpayers and all moving central banks ever closer to destructive inflationary finance.”   He unders tood the \nassociated heartburn of this view, acknowledg ing that negative interest rates was an idea that \nwould likely require “some getting used to.” He not ed, however, that the public also was initially \n                                                 \n1 I thank Kansas City Fed Vice President and Economist George Kahn for his assistance in preparing these remarks.  \n2 Later published in the Journal of Monetary Economics , September 1983, pp. 343- 56. \n3 Marvin Goodfriend, “The Case for Unencumbering Interest R ate Policy at the Zero Lower Bound,” Federal \nReserve Bank of Kansas City Economic Policy Symposium, Jackson Hole, 2016, pp. 127- 160. \nhttps://www.kansa scityfed.org/~/media/files/publicat/sympos/2016/2016goodfriend.pdf?la=en \n\n \n \n2 \n resistant to leaving the gold standard, and later to floating the exchange rate, but gradually \naccepted these changes.   \nWhile the use of negative interest rates gives me pause as a way to address a future \nencounter with the effective lower bound, I share Marvin’s concerns about the potential side \neffects of balance s heet policies that pose risks to financial stability and threaten the central \nbank’s policy independence.   \nAs a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in 2013, I \nexpressed my concerns about  the continuation of the asset purchase program  known popularly as \nQE3. By then, financial markets were stable and the economy was growing. These concerns \nabout the expansion of the Fed’s balance sheet under those conditions echoed many of Marvin’s \nconcern s. In my view, the possible unintended side eff ects of the ongoing asset purchases posed \nrisks to economic and financial stability and served to unnecessarily further complicate future \nmonetary policy .4 Today, however, it is  conventional wisdom that the benefits of asset purchases \nhave been clearly est ablished and that their potential costs have proven negligible.  History and \nfurther research may ultimately affirm that wisdom, but it remains less than clear to me that the \nlonger -run costs of balance sheet policies have been fully  taken into account. \nAs a consequence of large- scale asset purchases, for example, the FOMC had to evaluate \nand reconsider its longstanding operating framework. Given the abundant reserves associated with its  balance sheet policies, the FOMC had  to consider whether  the federal  funds rate target \ncould be achieved administratively by setting the int erest rate on excess reserves. Indeed, t o \nensure effective interest rate control and establish a firm floor on overnight rates, a n overnight \n                                                 \n4 Esther George, “Fed Balance Sheet 101,” Remarks to the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Economic Forum, \nDenver, Colorado, July 2017. https://www.kansascityfed.org/~/media/files/publicat/speeches/2017/2017- george -\ndenver -07-12.pdf  \n\n \n \n3 \n reverse repo facility  was created .  In addi tion, as the Fed began to shrink its  balance sheet, it \nproved challenging to gauge  the minimum reserve balances needed for achieving the  federal \nfunds rate target  without intervention by the open market d esk at the New York Fed. As a result, \nthe desk resu med regularly conducting repo operations and outright purchases of Treasuries to \nbuild a bigger buffer and ensure an ample  supply of  reserves. These operations have caused some \nconfusion in markets as some participants have seen them —incorrectly, in my vie w—as a type \nof quantitative easing.  \n More generally , to the extent that large -scale asset purchases succeeded in their aim of \ncreating a wealth effect , they also played some role in contribut ing to e levated asset valuations .  \nThese effects,  together with the perception that interest rates will remain at historically low \nlevels for a prolonged period, can lead to a buildup of financial imbalances that ultimately pose \nrisks to the real economy. Experience has shown that these imbalances can develop in sector s \noutside the lens of regulators and, as we witnessed a decade ago, can unwind with little warning.  \nAnother concern I share with Marvin is the risk that income from the Fed’s  large balance \nsheet combine d with our  capital surplus could tempt fiscal authorities to  view the Fed as a source \nof funding for government programs.  I would argue that we have seen a degree of th is risk \nunfold.  T he funding of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) , as required under the \nDodd- Frank Act, is a case in point.  E ach quarter the Reserve Banks transfer to the CFPB, \nwithout Congressional appropriations, the amount of funds requested by the Director of the \nCFPB to carry out its operations . To date, the Federal Reserve has transferred almost $4.4 billion \nto the CFPB.  In addition, the Dodd- Frank Act required the Fed to fund the first two years of the \nOffice of Financial Research in support of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC).  \n\n \n \n4 \n Yet another example of c ongress ional funding of programs outside the regular \nappropriations process is the “Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act .”  In the \nFAST Act, Congress funded highway construction by reducing the Federal Reserve Bank stock \ndividend rate for member banks with assets of more than $10 billion. The Act  also placed a cap \nof $10 billion on the aggregate surplus funds of the Federal Reserve and directed that any excess \nbe transferred to the Treasury general fund.  The potential policy implications of modifying \ndividends to member banks, or more generally, the requirement for member banks to purchase \nstock in a regional Federal Reserve Bank, is a concerning development that risks undermining \nthe Federal Reserve’s long -standing institutional design of public and private interests serving \nthe American public.5 \nTo ensure the central bank maintains surplus capital against prospective exposures on a \nbalance sheet inflated  by large scale asset purchases, Marvin  argued that the central bank must \nhave independent authority to retain its net interest earnings to build surplus capital . Without \nsuch capital, the “carry trade” exposure from the balance sheet would “[jeopardize] the \noperational credibility of monetary policy for price stability.”6 \nFinally, Marvin was adamant that central bank  independence was essential for  the \ncredibility and effectiveness of monetary policy.  In testimony before Congress, Marvin said:  \n“Flexibility and decisiveness are essential for effective central banking.  Independence \nenables a central bank to react promptly to macroeconomic or financ ial shocks without \nthe approval of the Treasury or legislature.  Central bank initiatives must be regarded as \n                                                 \n5 Esther L. George, “Structure, Governance, Representation: Federal Reserve Member Banks and Federal Reserve \nBank Stock,” July 2016. https://www.kansascityfed.org/~/media/files/publicat/speeches/2016/structure -governance -\nrepre sentation.pdf  \n6 Marvin Goodfriend, “Monetary Policy as a Carry Trade,” IMES Discussion Paper Series  No. 2014- E-8, Bank of \nJapan, September 2014. \nhttps://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/596b/3815fb45d8fd6fd7b7c1b4a2fc6dacb0b04d.pdf?_ga=2.188435944.190354274\n6.1581107605- 2138291141.1581107605  \n\n \n \n5 \n legitimate by the legislature and the public, otherwise such initiatives will lack credibility \nessential for the ir effectiveness. ”7 \n \nFurthermore, to maintain independence, policymakers must draw a bright line between monetary \nand fiscal policy actions . He said:  \n“The problem is to identify the limits of independence on monetary policy and credit \npolicy to preserve a workable, sustainable division of responsibilities between the central \nbank and the fiscal authorities —the legislature and Treasury.”8 \n \nArguably , this bright line faded in November 2008 when the Federal Reserve announced \nits first round of large -scale asset purchases consisting of  $100 bil lion of agency debt securities \nand $500 billion of agency mortgage -backed securities (MBS).  This program was expanded in  \nMarch 2009 with the planned purchase of a total of $1.25 trillion in MBS, $200 billion in agency \ndebt, along with $300 billion in long er-term Treasury securities.  Additional “open- ended” \npurchases of MBS were announced under the third round of LSAP s in September 2012.  Today \nthe Federal Reserve holds almost $1.4 billion in MBS on its balance sheet , and  the FOMC has \nindicated th at it cur rently does not anticipate selling agency mortgage -backed securities as part \nof its  policy normalization process .  These holdings arguably blur the line between monetary \npolicy and credit allocation. \nTo address th is important distinction , Marvin proposed that the 1951 Treasury -Federal \nReserve Accord on monetary policy be supplemented with a Treasury -Fed Accord on credit \npolicy. He identified three key principles: First, as a long -run matter, a significant, sustained \ndeparture from a “Treasuries on ly” asset acquisition policy is incompatible with Fed \n                                                 \n7 Marvin Goodfriend , “The Case for a Treasury -Federal Reserve Accord for Credit Policy,” Testimony before the \nSubcommittee on Monetary Policy and Trade of the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, Washington, D.C. March 2014. \nhttps://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/896e/65a69106282deb5806c03da136c026d42176.pdf  \n8 Ibid. \n\n \n \n6 \n independence. Second, the Fed should adhere to “Treasuries only” except for occasional, \ntemporary, we ll-collateralized ordinary last- resort lending to solvent, supervised depository \ninstitutions.  And t hird, Fed credit i nitiatives beyond ordinary last -resort lending should be \nundertaken only with prior agreement of the fiscal authorities, and only as bridge loans accompanied by take- outs arranged and guaranteed in advance by the fiscal authorities.  \nThese principles are worth considering as the Federal Reserve contemplates its next \nencounter with the zero lower bound. T he Federal Reserve’s ongoing  review  of its monetary \npolicy strategy, tools, and communications  necessarily has surfaced  a number of possibl e \napproaches to address such a future encounter.  Among the possibilities are things  we have tried \nin the past , such as asset purchases and forward guidance .  Other ideas have been more novel , \nsuch as average inflation targeting, yield curve control and, y es, even negative interest rates.   \nMarvin may be right that these things , particularly when they are controversial, take some \ngetting used to.  But as importantly, he was keenly focused on preserving the central bank’s \nintegrity and independence at the same time.  That perspective undoubtedly would serve us well \ntoday.",

            "content": "Energy, Economic Activity and Monetary Policy  \nRemarks by  \nEsther L. George  \nPresident and CEO  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nNovember  20, 2020  \nDelivered via video at “Navigating the Changing Energy Landscape,” a conference hosted by the \nFederal Reserve Banks of Kansas City and Dallas  \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers or representatives . \n\n1 \n  Good afternoon. It’s a pleasure to host this year’s conference with President Kaplan and \nhis team at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.  Combined, our  two Federal Reserve districts \nserve an area of the central United States that accounts  for almost half of the nation’s energy \nproduction. Th is includes around 60 percent of its oil and gas  production, as well as nearly 60 \npercent of the electricity generated by wind power. Obviously, e nergy plays an important role in \nour regional economies  and employs  a substantial number of workers, but it is also a central \ncomponent of national economic activity with implications for monetary policy. \n My remarks today will focus on this  interaction of the energy  sector  and monetary policy. \nEnergy plays a key role in determining the environment  in which monetary policy operates. It is \na direct component of  economic output  through production, employment and investment  in the \nsector . Energy also  creates  indirect spillovers to other industries , government finances and \nconsumers . At the same time, monetary policy,  through its effect  on interest rates and asset \nprices , has implications for the energy sector, primarily by shaping aggregate demand, but  also \nthrough its impact on commodity prices and perhaps the structure of the industry.    Energy Production:  Booms and Busts   \n I will start with some observations on energy’s role in shaping the economy . Given the \ndiscussion earlier today, and the expertise represented in the forum, I will only briefly touch on the direct contribution of energy production to overall output, focusing primarily on tracing its indirect effects through other economic sectors. This is certainly not any indication of the lack of importance  of direct effects . Booms and busts in the oil sector have led to large swings in \nemplo yment and investment, particularly  for regional economies that rely on the sector . Still, oil, \ngas and coal  production accounts f or roughly half a million jobs, or less than 1 percent of \n\n2 \n national employment  and around 1 percent of domestic output. While the sector itself is not that \nlarge in those terms , the jobs tend to pay high wages, and movements in employment affect  \nspending and consumption within many communities. \n Energy extraction also has a direct effect on aggregate output through capital investment. \nIn particular, following the 2014 collapse i n oil prices , energy investment took 2 percentage \npoints off overall business fixed investment growth in 2015 and 2016, contributing to the overall weakness of investment over this period.  \n Among the biggest shifts affecting  the energy sector  today is the growth of renewable \nenergy . Renewables now account for almost 20 percent of electricity generation, in part as the \ncost of solar power and wind power has fallen 85 and 70 percent , respectively , over the last \ndecade.\n1 As renewables continue to reshape the energy industry, there are likely to be shifts in \nemployment, investment and output , with notable effects on regional economies.  \nWhile much has been said about the difficulty in dealing with the short -term fluctuations \nin renewable power generation, employment and investment have been relatively smooth, with shifts more likely in response to lower costs and government incentives than to volatile demand. With  renewables continuing to gain market share, it may be  that energy diminishes as a source of \nmacroeconomic volatility.  Certainly, U.S. energy prices and output are likely to become more \ninsulated from global developments, the source of many energy se ctor shocks over the years.  \nWithout the geopolitics, energy could well  become more boring, which is maybe not such a bad \nthing.    However, the direct effects of the energy sector likely capture only a small portion of the \noverall impact on economic output  and growth. E nergy is interwoven with all aspects of activity, \n \n1 https://www.lazard.com/media/451419/lazards -levelized -cost-of-energy -version -140.pdf  \n\n3 \n and developments in energy spill  over widely. Given that the channels linking energy to the \noverall economy are incredibly complex and wide -ranging, I ’ll focus on four sectors —\nmanufacturing, agriculture, government finances  and consumers —which I believe illustrate  the \nbroader point : that an understanding of energy developments is essential for understanding \neconomic developments more generally, and therefore give  context for mon etary policy. In \nhighlighting these sectors, I will consider both cyclical movements, for example, the fall in oil \ndemand and prices related to the coronavirus, and longer -term structural developments  often \ndriven by technological factors, such as fracking, the falling price of renewables, or the advent of \nelectric vehicles.  Admittedly, separat ing cyclical and structural effects  can sometimes be \ndifficult.     Manufacturing:  Natural Gas and U.S. Comparative Advantage  \n I’ll start with manufacturing . Energy is an important input into manufacturing, and \nfluctuations in the price and availability of energy have important spillovers for the sector. I will \nhighlight one aspect of this : how the decline in the price of natural gas relative to oil has boosted \nthe comparative advantage of U.S. manufacturing over the past decade , and how an increase in \nthe relative price of natural gas could unwind that advantage.   \n As technological advances led to  a sharp increase in U.S. natural gas production starting \nin 2006, the higher supply pushed down the price of natural gas relative to the alternatives and \nled industries  to substitute towards natural gas and a way from other energy sources. This was \ntrue for utilities, as has been well reported, but also manufacturers.\n2 The decline in the relative \n \n2 In 2006, natural gas accounted for 28% of U.S. manufacturing energy us age. By 2018, it was 37%. Usage of natural \ngas liquids also rose from 11% to 15%. This mainly replaced coal and fuel oil (EIA, 2020: \nhttps://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=45156 ). \n\n4 \n price of natural gas boost s the competitiveness of U.S. manufacturing, in part because U.S. \nmanufacturers tend to use natural gas more extensively than their foreign competitors, who  are \noften more oil -dependent. F or example, oil’s share in manufacturing energy consumption is more \nthan five times higher in Europe than it is in the U nited States.3 This  difference in energy usage \nis particularly notable in the refinery, petrochemical  and plastics industries.  \n This comparative advantage is apparent in performance of U.S. exports. U nited States  \nexports of refined petroleum products, petrochemical s and pla stics increased 160  percent over \nthe period from 2006 to 2019, while exports of the same products from Europe rose only 25 \npercent.4 During this period the United States  became a leading exporter of gasoline and \npetroleum products and captured market share around the world. Overall, spillovers from low natural gas prices were likely an important support for U.S. exports in recent years and a contributor to the strength of  economic growth.    \n Recent developments , however , threaten  this comparative advantage.  This year , oil prices \nhave declined as natural gas prices  have increased , in part as falling U.S. oil production has cut \nback on the supply of associated natural gas production. The relative price of  Henry Hub natural \ngas to WTI oil fell by almost half  over the period from 2006 to 2019, but ticked up by almost a \nthird this year . If such a shift in re lative prices were to persist , and futures markets suggest that it \nwill, certain U.S. exports are likely to suffer a decline in competitiveness, and the aggregate economy is likely to face an additional headwind as we continue our recovery.  \n  \n \n3 Oil is less than 2 percent  of U.S. manufacturers ’ energy consumption (EIA), while it comprised 10.2 percent  of \nEuropean industry consumption in 2017 (EEA).  \n4 Data from WiserTrade, FRBKC calculations.  \n\n5 \n Agriculture:  Electric Cars Don’t Need Ethanol  \n The agricultural sector is also subject to spillovers from the energy sector, in part because \nagriculture  is an energy -intensive industry, but also even more directly through ethanol. Corn \nused for ethanol accounts for  more than a third of U.S. corn production. For perspective,  the \nacreage devoted to  corn destined for ethanol is equivalent to about 50,000 square miles, or 2/3 \nthe area of the state of Nebraska. With demand for ethanol largely dependent on the demand for \ngasoline, fluctuations in gasoline consumption have important implications for the farm \neconomy. As the pandemic compressed gasoline demand, there were immediate spillovers to the agricultural economy, and  demand for ethanol fell off sharply.  \n In addition to the cycl ical lin kages , longer -term trends in energy usage also have \nramifications for the agricultural sector . As motor vehicles have become more fuel efficient, \ndomestic demand for ethanol has flattened out, even as increased exports have cont inued to \nsupport production. Looking farther ahead , quick advances in the technology around electric \nvehicles, as well as aggressive government mandates promoting electric vehicles  in China and \nelsewhere, pose further challenges to the  long- run outlook for  ethanol. Somewhat ironically, the \npush toward electric vehicles is likely a significant threat to  what is currently  one of the largest \nsource s of renewable energy in the United States.   \n Government:  Finances under Threat  \n As energy -dependent states well understand, t he performance of the energy sector also \nsignificantly affects state tax revenues  and spending. Although severance taxes only make up \naround 1 percent of state tax revenues nationally, they play an outsized role in many energy-dependent states. Over the past five years, severance taxes have contributed more than 29  percent  \n\n6 \n of all state tax revenues in Wyoming and more than 45 percent  of revenues in North Dakota and \nAlaska. Even in slightly more economically diversif ied states such as Texas, Oklahoma, West \nVirginia and New Mexico, severance taxes have exceeded 7  percent  of state tax revenues on \naverage.5 \nFor states that rely on severance taxes, these tax streams are typically the most volatile \ncomponent of revenues a nd can lead to large swings in tax collections.6 However, natural \nresource extraction has  also been a blessing for many of these states, allowing them to build up \nlarge reserve funds in many cases.7 \nDuring the current crisis, most states have faced subst antial budget shortfalls as tax \ncollections have fallen in almost every revenue category and pandemic- related government \nspending has risen. In energy states, sharp drops in severance taxes have exacerbated these \npandemic -related budget shortfalls. Thus, s tate governments in energy states are struggling. \nLarge reserve funds can help to offset some of the decline in tax revenues, but most of these states will also be forced to make spending cuts over the next couple of years , likely creating a \nfurther headwind to the recovery.  \nIn the longer term, many state governments in energy states will continue to look for \nways to not only diversify their economies, but also to diversify their revenue streams. This will be particularly important for states that re ly on revenue from commodities that are expected to \nface continued downward pressure over the longer term such as coal and natural gas. As one \nexample, coal lease bonus payments contributed more than $1 billion to school capital \n \n5 U.S. Census Bureau.

With households dependent on gasoline for transportation, changes in oil prices have a direct impact on household budgets.  Higher gasoline prices decrease the amount \nthat can be spent on other goods, which  can be a drag on consumption and the economy. \nSimilarly, lower gasoline prices boost the resources available to buy other goods and have historically supported consumption.  \nHow important a gasoline price shock is to consumers depends on the  share of gasoline in \ntotal expenditures. The lower the share of gasoline in total expenditures, the less important and \nthe less likely that a change in gas prices w ill have a meaningful effect on overall consumption. \nOver time , the amount of household budgets devoted to gasoline has been falling, from about 4 \npercent in the 1980s to only about 2 percent in 2019, suggesting a declining importance of oil price shocks t o overall macroeconomic volatility.\n9  \nThat being said, the declining importance of oil in the aggregate masks considerable \nheterogeneity across the income distribution, with changes in gas prices being notably more important for low -income households. In the lowest -income quantile, gasoline accounted for \nmore than  8 percent of household income in 2019, more than five times the budget share of the \n \n8 http://eadiv.state.wy.us/creg/GreenCREG_Oct20.pdf  \n9 Total gasoline consumption increas ed by about 36% and 25% in the U.S. and the 10th District, respectively, from \nthe 1980s to 2018 (last annual data point for states).  \n\n8 \n highest -income households. However, even for these lowest -income households, gasoline \naccounts for a smaller sh are in spending now than in the past. \nThe COVID -19 shock could further loosen the grip of gasoline prices on consumers ’ \nbudgets  and reduce the already lowered  sensitivity of consumption to changes in the price at the \npump. The pandemic dampened demand for gasoline as the volume of commuting fell off \nsharply with the rise in  unemployment and increase in the number of employees  work ing from \nhome. Gasoline sales in April were off by a third of the ir pre-pandemic level.  While mobility has \nincreased w ith the lifting of stay -at-home restrictions, gasoline remains well below normal \nlevels .10 One  thing that seems unlikely to ever bounce back fully is the amount of  commuting. \nWith many workplaces offering, or likely to offer, increased workplace flexibilit y, not only is \ngasoline demand likely to be lower, but it is also likely to be more elastic.  More elastic demand \n(with the caveat that not all jobs are tele -workable ) should lower the volatility of overall \nconsumption in response to gasoline price shocks.     \n Putting it all together, developments in the energy sector have widespread effects across \nthe economy, both transmitting and amplifying near -term cyclical shifts, but also leading to \nlonger -term s tructural trends.  Energy shapes  the context for economic growth and inflation, in \nboth the near -term and long- run, arguing for monetary policymakers to keep a close eye on \nenergy  dynamics .  \n Monetary Policy’s Influence on the Energy Sector  I will close with some thoughts on the influence of monetary policy on the energy sector. \nTo the extent that direct and indirect spillovers affect the economic outlook, and thus monetary \n \n10 EIA and Affinity Solutions.  \n\n9 \n policy settings, it is worth considering how monetary policy, and particularly the prospect of \nlow-for-long interest rates, might affect the energy sector.  There is a long literature that suggests, \nall else equal, that low interest rates should boost the price of stora ble commodities, such as oil, \npartly by incentivizing greater demand, but also by decreasing the incentive to produce.11 \nConverting oil reserves into currency and other assets is less appealing when the return on alternative assets is low.  In addition, there is a literature that suggests that low rates should lead \nto less -volatile prices.  Interest rates are an important cost of holding inventory, so low rates \nshould lower inventory costs and incentivize larger buffers that can then mitigate unexpected shifts in supply and demand.\n12 Of course there are many oth er factors affecting oil prices beside s \ninterest rates, so low oil prices and continued price volatility can certainly coincide with low -for-\nlong rates.  \n Again relying on “all else equal ,” low rates should incentivize investment  in the energy \nsector , and generally , by decreasing the cost of capital. This could be particularly true in the \nrenewables sector, which has long -lived capital investment with high initial costs similar to \nutilities more generally.  However, low interest rates can work not only by promoting new \nadditions to the capital stock, but also through the acquisition of pre -existing capital—that is by \nencouraging mergers and acquisitions. In an industry with uncertain near -term and long- term \ndemand, it might not be surprising to see low r ates engender a greater response in M&A activity \nand consolidation as opposed to increased capital expenditure.  \n \n11 See Jeffery Frankel \"The Effect of Monetary Policy on Real Commodity Prices\" , Chapter 7  in Asset Prices and \nMonetary Policy , John Campbell, ed.

            "content": "The Outlook for the Economy and Monetary Policy \nRemarks by  \nEsther L. George  \nPresident and CEO  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n   \n                \nOctober 8, 2020  \nDelivered via video to the Kansas Economic Outlook Conference  \nWichita State University  \nWichita, Kansas  \n The views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, its governors, officers or representatives  \n  \n\n1 \n  \n Thank you for the opportunity to participate in this year’s Kansas  Economic Outlook \nConference . In my remarks today, I’ll offer my thoughts on the U.S. economic outlook and the \ncurrent stance of monetary policy. I will also describe recent revisions to the Federal Reserve’s \napproach to setting monetary policy and how I s ee those changes influencing future policy \nchoices .  \n \nThe Economic Outlook  \nThe recovery from the second quarter’s historic fall off in economic activity has been \nmore rapid than expected  by me, by financial markets, and by many of our  business contacts . \nRetail sales have bounced back to pre -pandemic levels and the labor market has made up  \nconsiderable ground, with half of the 22 million jobs that disappeared  in March and April having \nreturned.   \nTwo factors have been particularly impor tant in driving the  recovery. First, the rebound \nin activity reflects an evolution in the mechanisms for responding to the virus , as broadly \nimplemented lockdowns shift towards more targeted restriction s and to an increased willingness \nby the  public to engage in  certain activities. Second, policy support , both fiscal and monetary, \nhas played an essential  role. It is  particularly notable that even as wages and salaries  fell a record \namount  in the second quarter, personal income, which includes transfer payments from the \ngovernment, grew at the fastest pace in U.S. history and reached a new record high.   \nMonetary policy has also played an important part in buffering the effects of the crisis. \nThe Fed responded quickly and aggressively, cutting its benchmark interest rate to near zero, \npurchasing Treasury securities and agency mortgage -backed securities at an unprecedented scale, \nand establishing a number of new credit facilities to promote the flow of credit.   \nWhile the recovery has so far been more pronounced than many expected, its gains have \nnot been evenly distributed, due in part  to the unequal toll the pandemic has  taken across sectors  \nof the economy. Some sectors, such as restaurants , and many other services consumed outside \nthe home , have shown only a partial recovery, with some, such as movie theaters, still virtually \nshut down. Other sectors, including many durable consumption goods, have more than \nrecovered, with home improvements, personal computers, and bicycles all showing considerable \n\n2 \n strength. Low interest rates have undoubtedly boosted the purchase of durable goods and \nunderpinned the continued strength of the housing market.  \nThe unevenness of the recovery is evident  in the labor market  as well . After peaking at \n14.7 percent in April, the unemployment rate fe ll back to 7.9 percent in September ; we are \nmoving in the right direction, even if we still have a way  to go. However, the sharp loss in jobs \nhas been concentrated almost entirely in service -providing industries, normally a relatively stable \npart of the econom y. Particularly hard hit by the initial disruptions were the retail and leisure and \nhospitality industries, though I will note that these sectors have also seen the largest gains in \nsubsequent months. Another aspect of unevenness has been the disproportionate effect of the \ncrisis on women. The unemployment rate for women has moved from being below that of men \ngoing into the  crisis  to now being above .                 \nMany of the same dynamics that have been driving the national economy are at  play here \nin Kansas. After spiking to almost 12 percent in April, the unemployment rate in Kansas has \nsince fallen back to below 7 percent;  better , but still considerably above the less than 3 percent \nrate we saw in March. While most of the lost jobs have been in the services s ector , \nmanufacturing has also taken a hit . This is most apparent in the aerospace sector, an important \nindustry here in Wichita , where employment has fallen 20 percent from March with no signs of \nrecovery . Given the global outlook for air travel and the airline industry, this weakness  could \npersist for some time.  \nThe crisis has also impacted agriculture.  While many segments of the agricultural  \nindustry in Kansas had already been under pressure before the crisis, the pandemic has exacerbated the challenges. The prices of many major agricultural commodities produced in \nKansas are lower today than before the crisis due, in part, to various disruptions connected to the \npandemic. And while government support programs may limit some financial stress this year for  \nKansas farmers , head winds in the sector appear likely to remain, and wil l also depend \nsignificantly on the course of the pandemic.       \nThough I have been encoura ged by the pace of recovery, substantial risks to the outlook \nremain , with two deserving particular attention. First is the virus itself. As the F ederal O pen \nMarket C ommittee (FOMC)  has noted, the path of the economy will depend significantly on the \ncourse of the virus. A resurgence in the virus and the renewed imposition of control measures \nwould likely throw the recovery off track. Already we have seen this dynamic play itself out to \n\n3 \n various degrees in Europe  where cases have spiked again in many countries after falling over the \nsummer . The economy is unlikely to fully recover until the virus no longer interferes with the \npublic’s  day-to-day decision -making. Th at seems ultimately to depend on confidence that the \nvirus can be effectively managed, such as  with a vaccine.   \nSecond, individuals and small businesses have been able to resume economic activity \nthrough substantial  fiscal  support . As the virus persists , and the funding provided to date \ndissipates, the recovery could stall. One sector t hat poses a particular risk is spending by state \nand local governments  that have boosted spending on public health measures, while at the same \ntime experiencing significantly lower tax collections.  With deteriorating budget positions, state \nand local governments are cut ting spending, and have already furloughed and laid off worke rs, \nleading to over a million fewer jobs in the sector relative  to February.   \nIn summary, the recovery has been encouragingly fast, but the risks around the outlook \nare substantial. We are not out of the woods yet.  \n \nThe Federal Reserve’ s Framework Review  and the Outlook for Monetary Policy  \nBefore turning to the outlook for monetary policy, I think it is important to provide some \nbackground on the recent revisions to the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy framework. The \nrevisions marked the culmination of a process that was launched  in early 2019, when the Federal \nReserve began a review of how t o best conduct monetary policy in an economic environment  \nthat has undergone  some notable changes in recent decades . While the review pre- dated the \npandemic and was targeted at longer -run structural changes in the economy, the pandemic has \namplified  many of these changes . \nTwo developments in particular have made the conduct of monetary policy more \nchallenging in recent years . First, interest rates have fallen to levels that once seemed almost \nunthinkable, not just in the United States, but around the world. These lower rates have resulted , \nat least in part, from structural changes that have increased the amount that households and \nbusinesses want to save , while at the same time lowering  the amount of desired investment. \nThese changes  include sluggish economic growth, coincident with lagging productivity, and an \naging population. Regardless of the cause, lower interest rates reduce the capacity  of the Federal \nReserve to stimulate the econo my, when necessary , through the  traditional method of lowering \nthe policy interest  rate.     \n\n4 \n The s econd  key development is that  inflation dynamics have shifted such that the link \nbetween the pace of economic activity and inflation appears to have weakened. For some time, \ninflation has remained persistently low, even when the economy appeared to produce above its \npotential . Policymakers have seen that far lower levels of unemployment have been achieved \nwithout triggering inflationary pressures. This shift in inflation dynamics has prompted the \nFederal Reserve to rethink its monetary policy response . \nIt is intuitive that rising prices are viewed negatively by households unsure of how \nquickly, or even if, their own incomes  will be increasing. And certainly,  there is a consensus , \nbacked by considerable historical experience,  that too high inflation is bad for households and \nthe economy.     \nLow inflation on the other hand is generally associated with low interest rates , and low \ninterest rates pose a constraint on the Federal Reserve’s ability to the stabilize the economy . \nFurthermore, low inflation can beget even lower inflation, if households and businesses start to anticipate it and shift down their expectations for inflation in the future. Under such conditions, \ncentral bankers worry t hat inflation expectations and actual inflation could spiral  dangerously \ndownward, further cons training monetary policy. Without the space to cut interest rates, the \nFederal Reserve is likely to have to rely more on asset purchases and other non- interest rate \npolicies to address downturns in the economy. Though these policies have been viewed as effective, they can come at some cost. In particular, balance sheet policies have implications for \nfinancial imbalances , resource misallocation,  and a further expansion of the Fed’s footprint in \nfinancial markets.   \nFaced with a changed economy, the Federal Reserve  changed  its monetary policy \nframework  in two significant aspects . First, the Committee clarified that it w ill accommodate \nlow rates of unemployment. That is to say, policy would not be tightened in response to low unemployment in the absence of signs of sustained upward pressure on inflation. Prior to the \npandemic , unemployment reached historically low levels fo r some time without causing an \nundesirable increase in inflation  and it had become incr easingly clear that defining a precise \nnumber for maximum employment was likely not appropriate . As a result, the FOMC’s \nframework would not call for preempt ing inflation by tightening policy on the basis of tight labor \nmarkets alone.    \n\n5 \n Second, while maintaining its 2 percent inflation target in the longer run, the FOMC will \nnow aim to achieve this objective by targeting an inflation  rate that averages 2 percent over time. \nThus, following periods when inflation has fallen persistently be low 2 percent, the Committee \nwould allow inflation to run above 2 percent for a period of time .   \nWhile the change to average inflation targeting may  seem quite technical, let  me explain \nhow I see this adjustment  affecting our policy decisions . My long- held view  is that i nflation \nrunning a bit under 2 percent or a bit above 2 percent  is consistent with a  longer -run 2 percent \ninflation objective . Given the volatility of inflation, and the imprecision with which it is \nmeasured, I  have generally not been concerned by an inflation  rate a few tenths off target on \neither side of 2 percent. \nBy allowing inflation to move  above 2 percent for some time, the f ramework makes clear  \nthat the 2 percent target is not a ceiling  on inflation. M onetary policy is most effec tive at steering \ninflation at longer horizons. The  2 percent objective  provides the public a guidepost for the long-\nrun. While the new consensus statement elaborates that this 2 percent long- run target is viewed \nthrough the lens of average inflation outcomes, no timetabl e for averaging was specified,  \navoiding a sense of undu e precision over inflation outcomes. Instead, I interpret the revised \nconsensus statement as a tolerance — and less as a promise to engineer — for inflation \nmoderately above 2 percent for some time. Moreover, inflation should, in my view, continue to \nbe vi ewed in the context of broader economic outcomes. Inflation temporarily and moderately \nabove 2 percent is unlikely to warrant a policy response if the economy is otherwise functioning well.  \nThe term “average” has attracted a lot of attention  among the cot tage industry of Fed \nwatchers. From my stand point, I see little benefit in getting too  tied up in a precise mathematical \nformulation of “ average. ” The challenge of adopting a  precise definition of “average” inflation \nhas familiar parallel s to the  challenges of adopting precise monetary policy rules. T here are \nreasons why the FOMC has in the past avoided strict adher ence to monetary policy rules, so it is \nunsurprising that the new framework  is not a precise prescription for policy actions . The \nstructure of th e economy changes over time, as acknowledged by the  framework review, and the \nFOMC’s credibility will come from its  flexibility in adapting to new cir cumstances rather than \nadher ing to a formula.    \n\n6 \n At its September meeting , the FOMC moved t o adjust policy in light of its revised \nframework. In particular, the C ommittee provided forward guidance that it expects to keep the \npolicy rate near zero until inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 \npercent  for some time . I view this guidance as consistent with a message of patience. We are \nsignaling that the committee is unlikely to preemptively tighten  policy at the prospect  that \ninflation is approaching 2 percent , but rather a willingness to wait until the data confirms its \narrival.   \nGiven an unsettled  outlook for inflation, it is not yet clear how much patien ce will be \nrequired . The pandemic has affected prices in a variety of ways, and it will be difficult to ass ess \nthe underlying pace of inflation until the dust settles. While overall inflation has weakened with \nthe pandemic, the decline largely reflects the weight of a few s ectors hard hit by a virus -induced \ncollapse in demand . Many other sectors have seen inflation step up, due to supply disruptions or \nstrong demand. In fact, looking at the change in prices across the individual categories that \ncomprise consumer spending, more categories have recorded higher inflation than lower inflation \nsince the onset of the pandemic. Good news on the virus could quickly boost inflation back to, or  \neven above, 2 percent.   \nHowever, if the pandemic were to unleash a deeper and more prolonged recession, the \ndrag on prices could be more pronounced. The Committee’s recent interest rate guidance would suggest this would lead to a longer period of accommodative policy.       \nWhile the Committee has offered relatively explicit guidance for policy rates, it has so far \nprovided only  minimal guidance on a nother aspect of policy; that is the trajectory of our asset \npurchases, primarily Treasuries and M ortgage B acked S ecurities (MBS) , and its  intentions \nregarding the size and composition of the Fed’s balance sheet. Following disruptions in financial \nmarkets in March, the Fed began purchasing large quantities  of Treasuri es and MBS. These \nactions proved very effective in calming financial markets, even as the pandemic exacted a tremendous toll on the real economy.  \nWith market functioning having largely returned to pre -pandemic conditions, the  \nSeptember policy statement broaden ed the objective of asset purchases to  include fostering \naccommodative financial conditions . It will be important to provide further detailed gui dance on \nthe Committee’s intentions regarding these purchases. This is a matter of transparency and \n\n7 \n accountability, but also an important element of ensuring the effectiveness  of the purchases . I \nlook forward to discussing these issues with my colleagues.  \nEven as the economy continues to recover , the risks that lie ahead  cannot be \nunderestimated . The Federal Reserve has been active in its support of the recovery and we will \ncontinue to monitor the economy’s progress  closely.",

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \nSeptember 25, 2020  \nDelivered Virtually to the Independent Bankers  of Colorado  \nAnnual Convention  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal \nReserve System, its governors, officers or representatives. \n\n1 \n  \nThank you for the opportunity to join you today .   \nIn my remarks , I am going to focus on the role that community banks have played in \nsupporting the economy throughout  the pandemic. I’ll begin by talking for a few minutes about \nthe Federal Reserve’s response to the crisis and some of the immediate issues we saw in the \nbanking sector early on. I will then turn to the importance of community banks throughout this \nperiod. I’ll also offer some considerations on how the pandemic could shape banking going \nforward, with a particular e mpha sis on industry concentration.1 \n \nThe Fed’s Crisis Response  \nThe Covid- 19 pandemic , and the actions required to contain it , have had a profound \nimpact on the U.S. economy and financial system. As the virus spread throughout the country, the economic outlook deteriorated sharply . In March, businesses began to slow production or \nclose their doors and consumers reduced spending, both as they withdrew from economic activity and  to buffer against an impending downturn. These actions, and the  continued \nuncertainty around the virus’s projected path, sparked a full -scale economic recession and \nfinancial panic.  \nThe Federal Reserve’s un precedented actions to support the economy during the \npandemic involved a combination of conventional and unconventional monetary tools and \ndiscount window lending. Borrowing from the Financial Crisis playbook, the Federal Reserve \nissued credit to a number  of financial actors including primary dealers, commercial banks, \nmoney market funds, and special purpose vehicles holding asset -backed securities in order to \nfacilitate the continued flow of credit into the real economy. In an unprecedented step, the \nFede ral Reserve joined with the U.S. Treasury to issue credit to non- financial firms and local \ngovernments. These programs require the Federal Reserve to take on some amount of credit risk, and as such they are backed by an equity stake from the U.S. Treasury.  In addition, the Federal \nReserve purchased sizable amounts of Treasury and mortgage -backed securities to ensure that \ncapital markets continue d to remain liquid and open to investors.  \n                                                      \n1 I thank Rajdeep Sengupta, Blake Marsh and Nick Baker of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City for their \nassistance in preparing these remarks.  \n\n2 \n The Federal Reserve ’s actions rely on commercial banks as a conduit to channel funds \ninto the real economy, and we have taken steps to ensure that banks can continue to lend. For \nexample, the U.S. Treasury provided loans to businesses under the Payroll Protection Program \n(PPP) made through partner lending institutions. By taking extraordinary measures to reach  out \nto customers and work with existing borrowers, small banks accounted for 40 percent of the program’s total lending. This surge in lending, however, resulted in reduced balance sheet \ncapacity for participating banks. In response, the Federal Reserve established the PPP liquidity \nfacility , which accepts these loans as collateral in order to free up cash for additional lending.\n2 \nCapital regulations for certain asset classes and loan ty pes were also eased to facilitate Treasury \nmarket functioning and to blunt the balance sheet impact of business lending.  \nOther aspects of the crisis response have also importantly involved banks. The CARES \nAct authorized forbearance programs to ease paymen t pressures on a number of consumer loan \nproducts. Forbearance allows consumers to delay payment of their loans until employment conditions return to more -normal levels and helps banks conserve capital by avoiding \ndelinquencies that become charge -offs down the road. In this aspect, the banking agencies are \ncommitted to working with banks to find acceptable ways to mitigate loan losses throughout the \nremainder of the pandemic. Preserving bank capital and keeping credit flowing throughout the \neconomy is essen tial. \n \nThe Early Impact of the Pandemic on the Banking Sector  \nDuring the early days of the crisis, businesses turned to banks of all sizes in an effort to \nprotect themselves against rising economic and financial stress. Precautionary draws on existing \nlines of credit increased sharply in March as firms tried to cover expected revenue declines. At \nthe same time, deposits flowed into the bankin g system as a flight -to-quality ensued and both \nfirms and investors showed a preference for holding  cash over other financial assets.   \nThe effects of the crisis varied among banks  of different sizes and operating models . \nWhile balance sheets grew quickly across the banking universe, large banks experienced the \nmajority of the loan draws and deposit inflows and, therefore, bore the brunt of the immediate \n                                                      \n2 Community banks have been important users of the PPPLF with 50 percent of current total take up, or $34 bill ion, \nas of August 31, 2020.  \n\n3 \n pandemic -related activity . Smaller banks quickly engaged with borrowers to assess their needs \nand offere d payment deferral.   \nTo date, few stresses have emerged across banks despite the severe economic contraction.  \nThe level of problem assets reported by banks in the second quarter remained at historic lows, \nand c apital buffers, despite declining as balance sheets grew, stayed above regulatory minimums .   \nThe resilience of the banking system certainly reflects stronger capital and liquidity positions \nbuilt up over the last decade.  The response of fiscal and monetary policy to support households \nand business es, along with actions taken by the banking agencies to  offer aspects of supervisory \nand regulatory relief, has undoubtedly muted the impact to banking conditions so far .    \nThe economic recovery, however, is far from complete. S trains on household and \ncommercial balance sheets since March have created fragilities that could yet threaten bank \nprofitability and loss -absorbing capacity for some time. Adequate capital is critically important \nfor the safety and soundness of banks, as well as for the continued provisioning of credit that keeps our financial system and our economy functioning during periods of stress. There is \nwidespread consensus among economists and policymakers that bank capital not only serves as a \nbuffer against unexpected losses and insolvency, but also mitigates excessive risk -taking \nincentives. Higher capital levels reduce the probability of failure and crises, and better capitalized banks can hasten a post -crisis recovery.   \n The Pandemic and Community Banks  \nCommunity banks continue to be central to the health of local communities and \ncollectively to the health of the nation’s economy. This is particularly true for the access to credit \nrequired for small businesses, which have been hit hard by the pandemic. Th ese businesses \nemployed 60 million people or 47 percent of the private workforce in 2016.\n3 As of August, both \nsmall business revenue and employment were down 19 percent since the beginning of the year.4  \nCommunity banks are particularly well -situated to un derstand the needs of small - to \nmedium -sized businesses where local knowledge and lending relationships  exist. These \nrelationships prompted community bankers to reach out and offer assistance to their customers \nearly in the pandemic. It is has also been evident in the launch of the Federal Reserve’s Main \n                                                      \n3 https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp -content/uploads/2019/04/23142719/2019 -Small -Business -Profiles -US.pdf  \n4 https://tracktherecovery.org/  \n\n4 \n Street Loan Facility. Among the  more than 500 registered lenders, the overwhelming majority  \nare community banks. And to date, nearly half of the loans purchased by the facility have been \nextended by community banks . Although t here has been some criticism that this program has not \nbeen more widely utilized , it appears that the program is serving its intended purpose , and \nbroader use of this funding may be a function of specific terms and operational needs .  \nIn responding to the crisis, c ommunity and regional banks have taken prompt action to \nstrengthen balance sheets in light of expected future credit losses. This is evident in the \nbolstering of loan loss reserves i n the first two quarters of this year.5 For many community \nbanks, commercial real estate and agricultural lending are cornerstones of the business model; as such, concentration risk warrants ongoing attention as strained business revenues and commodity \nprices threaten the ability of some borrowers to repay their obligations.\n6 Thus, community \nbankers must remain vigilant.   \nAs you well know, the banking landscape has changed significantly over the past three \ndecades. Industry -wide consolidation over this period has increasi ngly led to the concentration of  \nbanking assets in large banking organizations, with the highest concentration of assets within the eight U.S. banks  known as the G -SIBs , or global systemically important banks . At the turn of the \ncentury,  U.S. G -SIBs held one -third of total banking assets and generated around 40 percent of \nindustry profits. As of year -end 2019, G -SIBs account for 60 percent  of both the banking \nindustry’s assets and its profits. The financial crisis led to a wave of bank fa ilures and mergers \nthat contributed to the ongoing consolidation. Despite the resolution of many failed banks during \nthe crisis (2007- 10), unassisted mergers accounted for more of the increased concentration than \nthe resolution of failed banks.\n7 While it is always difficult to forecast economic trends, \nconsolidation in the banking industry has continued since the mid- 1980s and is likely to continue  \nin the post -pandemic recovery.  \n \n                                                      \n5 Second quarter  2020 data shows substantial provision expense across banks of all sizes.  \n6 Risks also noted in the Federal Reserve’s May 2020 Financial Stability Report: \nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2020 -may -financial -stability -report -purpose.htm   \n7 David C. Wheelock, 2011. \" Banking industry consolidation and market structure: impact of the financial crisis and \nrecession ,\" Review , Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, vol. 93(Nov), pages 419 -438. \n\n5 \n Recent changes to the operating environment in banking are likely to exacerbate this \ntrend of consolidation.  Most economists and policymakers believe that bec ause of differences in \nsize, interconnectedness, complexity, and cross -jurisdictional activity, larger banks should hold \nrelatively more capital than their smaller counterpar ts.  And yet, despite the lessons of the \nfinancial crisis and as mentioned previously, critical capital ratios at community banks have been \npersistently higher than that at the largest banks.8  Community banks entered this extreme shock \nwith leverage capital at a 20 -year high and a collective leverage ratio 270 basis points above that \nof the GSIBs.9 This capital advantage undoubtedly affects the competitive environment for \ncommunity banks. Moreover, recent regulatory changes intended to provide signifi cant capital \nrelief to the largest banks not only raise concerns about financial stability but also could further \nwiden the difference in capital ratios between small and large banks. C apital regulation is \ncreating incentives for banks to grow significantl y larger.  \nCommunity banks have also noted the challenges they face with persistently low interest \nrates as  another important factor in this operating environment. While low -for-long interest rates  \nnegatively affect net interest margins for all banks , margin compression puts community banks at \na disadvantage relative to large banks because it is their principal source of income. In contrast, large banks can rely on alternative sources of (noninterest) income such as trading revenues and \nintermediation fees to offset any decrease in interest margins. From the standpoint of community \nbanks, the large bank model that relies on transactional lending and fee -based income while \nholding relatively less capital becomes increasingly attractive. In short, both regulation and monetary policy appear to be tilting the scales in favor of large banks.  \nSome argue that efforts to ease capital requirements are necessary to support the \nprovision of credit to individuals and businesses. I do not find this argument compelling. The \nFederal Reserve’s most recent Senior Loan Officer Lending Survey indicated that no large banks \nconsidered their current or expected capital position a “very important” reason in their \ndetermination of credit standards.\n10 Additionally, large banks benefiting from this change have \nmade significant distributions to shareholders since the pandemic began. These large banks \n                                                      \n8 The Federal Reserve Bank o f Kansas City publishes a horizontal comparison of capital adequacy among banking  \norganizations with different risk profiles: https://www.kansascityfed.org/research/bankingandpayments/bca .  \n9 Ibid.   \n10 July 2020 Senior Loan Officer Survey: https://www.federalreserve.gov/data/sloos/sloos -202007.htm .  \n\n6 \n distributed more than $50 billion of capital through shareholder dividends and share repurchases \nin the f irst six months of this year, representing the equivalent of nearly $1 trillion in balance \nsheet capacity.11  \nTo be sure, regulatory relief during this pandemic likely has played a role in ensuring that \nbanks are able to continue to serve as financial inter mediaries. But once the crisis has passed, \nmaintaining robust capital levels at the largest banks will be essential to the nation’s economic \nand financial stability  and to the long -term health of a diverse banking system . \nThere are of course other factors , beyond  regulatory incentives,  behind banking \nconsolidation trends. Transformational changes in information technology and payments systems \nalso have been important forces that have yielded significant efficiency gains from consolidation, \nespecially in the early years after branching deregulation in the mid- 1990s. This consolidation, of \ncourse, raises concerns. With policies favoring a banking model that relies on transactional lending and fee -based incomes, a traditional model of banking that relies on len ding relationships \nand local knowledge faces pressure. Numerous studies, including research on the F inancial \nCrisis, have shown that, despite the technology and efficiency gains, abandoning the traditional \nmodel has often yielded worse lending outcomes.\n12  \nExtending broad access to payment systems has long been an objective of the Federal \nReserve. As scale and network effects begin to dominate the landscape for instant payment methods, community and regional banks have expressed a desire to provide access to their \ncustomers. To facilitate access to faster payments, the Federal Reserve will provide a new \npayment service called FedNow , providing public benefits related to the safety, efficiency, and \naccessibility of instant payments, specifically through its ab ility to reach more than 10,000 of the \ncountry’s diverse depository institutions , including community banks and rural customers. The \npandemic itself has highlighted the need for this capability to expedite payments as the \ngovernment issued Economic Impact Payments to millions of Americans.  \n  \n                                                      \n11 Distribution data contained in second quarter financial reports.  $1 trillion is an estimate using a 15x multiple \n(5% minimum = 3% SLR minimum + 2% Leverage buffer to avoid distribution limitations).  \n12 See, for example, Patrick Bolton & Xavier Freixas & L eonardo Gambacorta & Paolo Emilio Mistrulli, 2016. \n\"Relationship and Transaction Lending in a Crisis, \" Review of Financial Studies, Society for Financial Studies, vol. \n29(10), pages 26 43-2676.  \n\n7 \n Conclusion  \n  The fiscal and monetary policy response to the pandemic has been extraordinary , and the \nbanking industry has played an essential role i n supporting this response and providing credit to \nhouseholds and business. Community banks in particular have been indispensable in maintaining \naccess to credit for small business and in doing so have served the needs of local communities as \nwell as contributed to the nation’s economi c recovery. To be sure, the banking industry must \nnavigate the path to economic recovery , and community banks face the particular challenges of \nindustry concentration and consolidation. Finding ways to address these challenges will shape \nthe diversity of t he nation’s banks and t he crucial role they play as catalysts of the recovery.",

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAugust 11, 2021 \n18\nth Annual Economic Measurement Seminar  \nNational Association for Business Economics  \nRemarks delivered virtually  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve \nSystem, its governors, officers or repre sentatives . \n\n1 \n Thank you for inviting me to participate in this year’s Economic Measurement S eminar .  \nAs you well know, m easurement and data are central to  monetary policy making.  Data are the \nvocabulary that policymakers use to build  the narratives that are essential for  making sense of the \neconomy and  for explain ing policy decisions . Data alone cannot tell the story, but the story \ncertainly depends on data.  Consequently, the same data can often underpin widely divergent \neconomic narratives.  As a policymaker, those narratives are shaped not only by an assessment of \nthe data, but also by experiences . Wisdom and the humility to adjust a narrative is essential, \nespecially when  the data make the story increasingly difficult to  tell.  \nToday I would like to look at the data and narratives as they relate to  a particular question \nwith important implications for monetary policy: Is the e conomy tight or slack ? The strength of \ndemand and the ability of supply to meet that demand have been significantly impacted by the \npandemic and the related policy response.  As I talk to contacts in the Kansas City Fed ’s region , I \noften hear anecdotes that suggest an economy that  has run into constraints, including reports of \nthe difficulty in finding workers and of having to pay much higher prices for materials and \ntransportation.  These stories are confirmed by the data, with a record number of unfilled job \nopenings  and sharply higher prices for many commodities.  At the same time, almost 6 million \nfewer individuals are working now relative to before the pandemi c. This suggest s that there \nremains  considerable slack in the labor market .  \nSo, is the economy tight or slack ? Prices are telling in making this assessment.  An \neconomy operating near or at its productive capacity is likely to display higher prices.  On the \nother hand, slack implies under -utilized resources, such that higher demand can be met without \nincreased prices.    \nIn my remarks today, I’ll explore  some of the  factors that are currently contributing to a \ntight economy, which is lifting inflation . While there is good reason to think that many of the \nfactors boosting demand and restraining supply will fade over time , the extraordinary events of \nthe global pandemic make this unfolding narrative a complex one , not the least as the course of \nthe virus r emains uncertain . Importantly, p olicymakers must consider not only near -term but also \nlong-run implications of their policy choices and be prepared to adjust as the economy evolve s.  \n   \n\n2 \n A tight economy \nYou don’t have to look hard to spot signs of an economy that has run into constraints.  \nBusiness surveys are reporting a record number of  job openings . In addition, w orkers are quitting \njobs at a record pace, typically a  sign of a hot  labor  market when alternative opportunities  are \nplentiful.  Not surprisingly , many firms are reporting raising wages or expect ing that they will be \nraising wages  soon.   \nStrong demand and limited supply are  also apparent in depleted inventories.  The \ninventory-to -sales ratio for retailers is at a record low and far below historical norms.  The run -\ndown in inventories has been particularly notable in the automotive sector, where the days ’ \nsupply of available vehicles for sale, at just under 30 days, is less than half its typical level.   \nTight supply and high demand  are behind the recent increase in price inflation.  Prices, as \nmeasured by the consumer price index  (CPI), increased 5.4  percent over the 12 months ending in \nJuly, matching June’s increase and remaining at the fastest pace of increase in over a decade.  To \nbe sure , some of the increase in prices simply  reflects a reversal of price declines recorded earlier \nin the pandemic , particularly  for service categories like airfares and hotels . But the normalization \nof some prices is not the whole story.  Other prices have moved far above pre-pandemic levels.  \nThe sharp increase in car prices has been w idely  reported, not just as it relates to new cars but \nalso used cars and even rental cars.  Indeed, durable goods more generally have experienced large \nincreases  in prices, sometimes at the fastest pace in decades . Outside of consumer prices, there’s \nalso been a sharp rise in commodity prices and transportation costs.  \nBased on this evidence, the economy shows clear signs of tightness.  An important \nquestion is : Will this tightness persist with implications for the path of monetary policy ?  \n \nThe evolution of factors contributing to a tight economy  \nWhether the economy is temporarily tight or more persistently tight will depend on the \nevolution of the dynamics affecting both supply and demand . Currently , demand is exceptionally \nstrong, boosted by expansive fiscal policy and low interest rates.  It is also unbalanced, favoring \nthe consumption of a  subset of goods.  Supply is constrained by frictions in the labor market and \nproduction bottlenecks  resulting from kinks in global supply chains.  \nThere is reason to believe that some of the drivers  boosting demand and constraining \nsupply will fade over time . In particular , I anticipate four factors that could introduc e slack into \n\n3 \n what is now a tight economy.  After discussing these factors, I will turn to a few of the risks \naround this outlook, including the possibility of economic disruptions related to the Delta \nvariant.   \nFirst, notwithstanding the upswing in the virus, I expect to see the continued rotation of \nconsumption from goods to services . More than a year ago , many consumers were forced to \navoid contact -intensive services, such as hotel accommodations , concerts, and amusement parks, \nas well as visits to doctors, dentists, and hair stylists.  Stuck at home, c onsumers rotated their \nconsumption towards goods, often ordered online.  This led to a very uneven pattern of demand.  \nAt the end of the first quarter of this year , services consumption was 5  percent below pre-\npandemic levels , while  the consumption of durable goods was a remarkable 34 percent higher on \nthe same basis.   \nThis unexpected shift in demand towards a subset of  consumption goods has been behind \nsome of the observed tightness in the economy.  For example, purchases of household appliances  \nin the second quarter , including refrigerators and washing machines,  were running 12 percent \nabove the level at the start of 2020 , in part as the pandemic set off a wave of  home  remodeling . \nReports of long delivery delays proliferated  as demand ran up against supply constraints . Not \nsurprisingly,  prices for major household  appliances have surged, increasing 14 percent in the 12 \nmonths to June.   \nWith the advent of widespread vaccination and a lessening of pandemic disruptions \nthrough the spring , services consumption has picked up , and goods consumption has stepped \ndown.  Still, services consumption remain s depressed  relative to previous levels,  suggesting \nfurther room to grow.  As consumption rotates from goods to services, some of the pressure \nshould ease for ove rstretched goods demand, perhaps allowing inventories to rebuild, even as \nservices growth continues to support the overall recovery in the economy.   \nA second factor  is the likelihood that the growth of overall demand will moderate  as \ngovernment supports fade.  The tremendous amount of fiscal stimulus provided to the economy \nsince the start of the pandemic, on the order of $ 6 trillion,  has been essential in supporting \neconomic activity.  However, much of this stimulus has already been distributed,  with the last \nchecks to households going out at the end of March and the Paycheck Protection Program for small business es closing to new applicants at the end of June.  Thus,  the peak boost to growth \nfrom fiscal policy has likely passed . Some estimates show that fiscal policy,  after adding almost \n\n4 \n 4 percentage points to growt h last year,  will subtract about 2 percentage points from growth over \nthe next few years.1 Additional spending bills under consideration could blunt this drag , but \nseem unlikely to fully offset it.   \nA third factor focuses on supply-side considerations contributing to near -term tightness  in \nthe economy.  As it relates to labor supply, temporary factors related to the pandemic are likely \ncontributing to the current tightness in the labor market , importantly  reflect ed in a still-depresse d \nlevel of labor force participation. D isruptions to schooling and daycare led many workers with \nsmall children, primarily non -college educated women, to drop out of the labor force.  Enhanced \nunemployment benefits could also be playing a role, as potential workers  sit on the sidelines and  \nassess their options.    \nAs schools reopen, and enhanced unemployment benefits end, these constrain ts on labor \nsupply should ease.  Already we are seeing promising signs that the labor market is healing.  The \nJuly jo bs report , released last week, showed the unemployment rate dropp ing to 5.4 percent as \nthe economy added close to 1 million jobs.  The labor force participation rate,  however , remained \nalmost 1½ percentage points below its pre -pandemic level, suggesting fur ther room for recovery.    \nFinally, s upply constraints go well beyond labor markets.  A number of materials and \ninputs to production have also experienced  bottlenecks, notably semiconductors and steel , but \nother  aspects of production have been affected as well.  In part, these shortages reflect the \ndifficulties of restarting or reorienting production after a year of sharp shifts in demand.  The \nbottlenecks have also arisen from domino effects related to the tight logistical networks that were \nin place before the pandemic.  With a flexible, dynamic economy, firms can be expected to \novercome most of these bottlenecks through the rest of the year.   \nThis narrative for why the current supply and demand constraints  might be expected to \nease over time strikes me as a reasonable baseline.  My own expectation is that growth will step \ndown but remain robust ; that the labor market will continue to recover at a rapid pace; and  that \ninflation will moderate.  But this narrative would be incomplete without acknowledging the risks \naround these assumptions.  \nOne key risk is the lingering presence of the pandemic.  The upsurge in Covid cases \nrelated to the Delta variant  threatens r enewed restrictions on activity or increased caution on the \npart of consumers and could delay the recovery across many dimensions.  Importantly, the effects \n \n1 See, for example, the  Hutchins Center Fiscal Impact Measure (brookings.edu)  \n\n5 \n could be as pronounced on the supply side as the demand side, prolong ing the tightness of the \neconomy and maintaining upward pressure on prices.  Renewed concern over the virus could \nimpede the recovery in services consumption such that demand remains directed towards sectors \nof the economy that are near capacity and away from those sectors that have available slack . The \nsurge in the virus could als o delay the normalization of the labor market, particularly if schooling \nand childcare is once again disrupted.  The spread of the variant has been particularly disruptive \nin Asia, where vaccination rates remain quite low.  Given Asia’s large imprint in glob al value \nchains, disruptions in the manufacturing sector there can spill over quickly to other parts of the \nworld , further exacerbating production bottlenecks and shortages , and inflation pressure . \nAside from the economic threats associated with the Delta variant, the assumption that \ndemand will moderate may prove otherwise  given the high level of household savings . In \nparticular, a considerabl e portion  of the stimulus transfers to households ha ve been saved , with \nestimates suggest ing that the stockpile of household saving has increased by close to $ 2.5 \ntrillion . Of course, healthy household balance sheets are positive for the economy, and t o the \ndegree that the saving is spent out over time, this could support strong and steady growth for \nsome time.  However, if households instead choose to spend rapidly, a burst of demand could \nkeep  the economy at capacity, reinforcing bottlenecks and putting continued upward pressure on \nprices.  Households have a lot of firepower, and if and how quickl y they choose to spend will be \nan important factor in how tight the economy remains . \n \nThe outlook for m onetary policy  \nWhat does this mean for monetary policy  and the Federal Open Market Committee’s  \nlong-run objectives for the economy ? How should policymakers account for today’s “tight” \ndemand and supply dynamics in their decisions about the path of asset purchases and interest rates?  \nSince last December, t he Committee has stated that it expects to keep the policy rate near \nzero until the labor m arket has reached levels consistent with maximum employment and \ninflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. The \nFOMC also expects to maintain its purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities unti l \nsubstantial further progress has been made towards these employment and inflation goals.   \n\n6 \n Without question, the combination of fiscal and monetary policy supports at the onset of \nthe pandemic bridged the economy’s transition from a deep contraction to a robust rebound.  \nNow, with the recovery underway, a transition from extraordinary monetary policy \naccommodation to more neutral settings must follow.  Today’s tight economy as I described \nearlier certainly does not call for a tight monetary policy, but it does signal that the time has \ncome to dial back the settings.  With year -over -year inflation running well over the Committee’s \ntarget and steady progres s in monthly employment gains, the FOMC’s long -run objectives for \nprice stability and employment  are in focus.   \nWhile recognizing that special factors account for much of the current spike in inflation, \nthe expectation of continued strong demand, a recover ing labor market, and firm inflation \nexpectations are consistent, in my view,  with the Committee’s guidance regarding substantial \nfurther progress toward its objectives.  I support bringing asset purchases to an end under these \nconditions.   \nAs this adjustment gets underway, public attention will naturally turn to timing for \nadjusting the policy rate , though it is important to note the timing of the tapering of asset  \npurchases is not mechanically connected to the timing of any policy rate adjustment . With both \nupside and downside risks in play, and multiple policy tools in use, judging the achievement of \ncriteria for raising rates is more complicated.  One might argue that today’s inflation dynamics \nare likely to keep inflation moderately above 2 percen t for some time and align with the \nCommittee’s threshold criteria.  On the other hand, the criteria for judging maximum employment \nare murkier.   \nWhile it is clear that we remain far from the historic low levels of unemployment \nachieved pre-pandemic, it is less clear to me that such a benchmark will be the best guidepost in the current expansion . The pandemic introduced a number of  frictions into the labor market, \nmany of which are likely to evolve over time . Barring further intensification of the virus, I would \nexpect these frictions to fade, promoting strong job gains and a relatively fast approach to maximum employment.  However, the experiences of the past year may well have resulted in a \nnumber of structural changes to the labor market, including how, when, and where people work.  \nThese changes could affect the  assessment of maximum employment in ways that are not yet \nclear.   \n\n7 \n As witnessed during the last expansion, it can take some time to draw individuals back \ninto the labor market.  This is not an argument for keeping rates unchanged but ensuring \naccommodation adjusts as the economy expands, avoiding imbalances  and instability tha t can \nderail such gains.  \nNeedless to say, t he road ahead to policy normalization is likely to be a long and bumpy \none as we navigate inflation and labor market dynamics in the post -pandemic economy . \nConsidering the financial stability landscape also will b e key to the achievement of our goals.  \nAlong the way, a careful assessment of  the data will be essential in shaping the narratives that \nguide policy decisions, balancing nimbleness and patience and steering clear of  policy errors .",

            "content": "In the Wake of a n Unprecedented Year  \n \nRemarks by  \nEsther L. George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n      \n                \nJanuary 12, 2021  \nCentral Exchange  \nKansas City, Mo. \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve \nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.   \n\n1 \n  Thank you for inviting me to participate in your event today. I appreciate the opportunity \nto speak with you about my outlook for the nation’s economy and look forward to our \ndiscussion. As we turn the calendar to a new year, the opportunity to reflect on the past and to look ahead to the future  is a time -honored tradition. Today I will do a little of both. \n Last year was one for the record books. The year had  both the largest  decl ine in quarterly \nGDP  on record as well as the largest increase. The unemployment rate hit a  50-year low before \nclimbing to levels not seen since the Great Depression . The equity market  set record highs, while \nthe price of oil dropped below zero for the first time ever, if only for a moment. The year  saw the \nlargest fiscal policy reaction and the most rapid increase in government debt , even as  the yield on \ngovernment securities  fell to new lows . The Federal Reserve, for its part, broke new ground in \npolicy accommodation, while expanding its balance sheet to record size. Suffice to say, 2020 \nwas not a typical  year.  \n I am hopeful, as I believe many of us are, that 2021 will mark the beginning of a return to \nsomething more like normal . Just two weeks in, we are off to a rocky start. However, I am \ngenerally optimistic that the year will be one of continued economic recovery, though not without bumps and potholes , particularly in the first part of the year as the virus continues to \nexact a terrible human and economic toll.  \n In my remarks t oday, I will offer my  outlook for the economy, noting my growing \nconfidence in the recovery, notwithstanding near -term turbulence. Underlying this outlook are \nmy expectations about a path to resolving the pandemic, renewed fiscal support and the continued accommodative stance of monetary policy. Even as the economy recovers , the events \nof the last year are likely  to leave an imprint on the economic outlook for years to come. There is \nno going back to where we started, and I’ll highlight my own thoughts on some of the longer -\n\n2 \n term consequences of the pandemic. Finally, I will turn to what this all means for the path of \nmonetary policy.  \n The Economic Outlook  \nStarting with  the outlook, e conomic activity appears to have stalled at the end of last \nyear. Consumer spending edged down broadly, not just in the contact -intensive service sectors  \nmost sensitive to the path of the virus, but also for durable  goods , which have been quite strong \nup to now . The widespread nature of this  pullback suggests that fading fiscal support along with \nuncertainty about the timing of any new government transfers likely weighed on activity , as did \nthe resurgence of the virus  across the country.  \nWith the v irus still impe ding the resumption of many activities, employment growth also \nhas stalled , with the economy shedding 140,000 jobs in December . Given that we ended the year \nstill 10 million jobs short relative to  before the pandemic, the re remains quite a large gap to \nclose. About a third of the jobs that have yet to come back are in the high- contact leisure and  \nhospitality industry, making it likely that the pace of employment growth will remain lackluster until widespr ead vaccination is achieved and the virus diminishes as an everyday concern.   \nOverall, much of the optimism for eventual recovery this year is tied to a successful and \nwidespread vaccination program . One of the most substantial risks to the outlook is a significant \ndelay or disruption in the administration of the vaccine. Already, a slower -than-expected roll out \nhas led many analysts to push back their estimates  for when the U nited States  might achieve \nbroad- based immunity . It is difficult to imagine a sustained and robust recovery until the virus no \nlonger interferes with the public’s day- to-day decision -making.    \n\n3 \n That said, there is reason to be optimistic about the economy’s growth prospects post -\nvaccination. One signal has come from equity markets , which have responded favorably to \npositive vaccine news. Sectors that have been particularly hard hit by the virus, including air \ntravel  and leisure and hospitality, have seen some of the largest price gains , suggesting that \ninvestors, at least, are optimistic that demand could bounce  back strongly for these still -\ndepressed services. Inventories are another dynamic  that could support strong growth later this \nyear. B usinesses, and particular ly retail establishments, ran down their inventories  during the \nearly stages of the pandemic, unsure of future sales prospects. A sustained recovery in demand could prompt businesses to restock, boosting production and growth, even if perhaps also straining some supply chains .   \nThe additional fiscal support passed at the end of last year also se ts the stage for a strong \nrecovery. A renewed Paycheck Protection Program offers the prospect of sustaining small businesses until demand picks up, avoiding the significant cost and disruption of bankruptcy or \nclosure. Transfer payments in the CARES A ct had boosted aggregate personal income to an all -\ntime high in the spring, even as wage income fell off steeply, providing a key support to consumption and the economy. In recent months, personal income had been trending down, as the payments faded and wage in come has yet to fully recover. The new fiscal package, with \nenhanced unemployment benefits and household stimulus payments, should once  again push up \npersonal income, maintaining support for spending and growth.  \nAs with the earlier government transfers, t here is a high likelihood that a large portion of \nthe renewed fiscal support will end up being saved by households rather than spent. In April, the \npersonal saving rate shot up to a record 34 percent, as transfer payments boost ed income and \nCovid restrictions and concerns  limited consumption. Although the saving rate has come down \n\n4 \n since, it remains almost twice as high as the average prior to the pandemic.  Of course, fiscal \nsupport that is saved has less of an immediate impact on growth than that which is spent , but it \nalso is true that transfers that strengthen  household balance sheets  can prevent  a pullback in \nspending that might otherwise occur as households demand higher  precautionary buffers  in an \nuncertain environment . Also, once concern for the virus  ebbs, relatively healthy household \nbalance sheets should allow for a quick rebound in demand and a resumption of activity. To the \nextent such dynamics prevail, the economy might avoid the experience of the Global Financial \nCrisis , when even after  the recession ended there was a prolonged period of household \ndeleveraging that contributed to a lackluster pace of growth for years.   \n Long- Term Implications of the Pandemic \nWhen thinking about the long- term consequences of 2020, I find it helpful to group the \npotential factors into three broad categories. First, despite the best efforts of policymakers, t here \nare likely to be  scars from the crisis that will take time to heal. Businesses and workers have \nsuffered a tremendous disruption, and while the re is some optimism for a quick bounce -back, it \nwould not be unexpected for some of the negative effects to  persist . Second, the crisis will leave \na lasting impact  on business  and public  sector  balance sheets , with governments  taking on \nnotably more debt, central bank balance sheets  swelling  around the world, and corporate \nborrowing soaring, even as household balance sheets , in the aggregate, have improved. Third, the \ncrisis  will likely have a lasting effect on the structure of the economy, both by changing the way \nthat people work as well as what and how they consume.       \nStarting with the f irst of these three broad categories , there could be economic sc arring \nthat eventually heals , but only after some time. For example, as mentioned earlier, 10 million \n\n5 \n fewer  individuals are working now relative to before the pandemic . Given the notable  decline in \nlabor force participation over the same period, it would appear that about half of those workers \nthat lost jobs dropped out of the labor force altogether. Traditionally, i t has taken some time to \nbring individuals back into the l abor force, and it has often taken a fairly hot labor market to do \nso.   \nAn additional dynamic with this crisis h as been the disproportionate decline in labor \nforce partici pation among woman. In particular, about half of the decline in wom en’s \nparticipation is attributable  to caregiving, likely reflecting disruptions in child care. While this \ncould suggest a quicker bounce -back once the virus is checked and normal child care options \nreturn , it is important to note that even after  returning to the job, these workers could suffer  \ninterruptions in human capital development and career progression, with unfortunate  long- term \neffects.  \nTurning to the s econd  broad category , 2020 has scrambled balance sheets  across the \neconomy. While household balance sheets  are generally i n good shape , this has come at the \nexpense of government finances . The federal government  increased its liabilities to fund \ntransfers that, in many cases, have turned into household assets. Again , it must be noted that the \nrelative strength  of household balance sheets is in the aggregate. Certainly, the pandemic has led \nto significant economic hardship for many, as a large number of households struggle to pay bills and purchase necessities. One of the defining features of the pandemic has be en the unevenness \nof its economic impact. There has been substantial variation in how different industries, \nprofessions and geographies have been affected, with some sectors reporting record activity even as others have seen demand collapse.     \n\n6 \n On the bus iness side, non- financial corporations  have further increased borrowing from \nalready elevated levels, in part to cover pandemic -related holes in revenue but also, for larger \ncorporations, to take advantage of near -zero interest rates and favorable borrowing conditions .  \nThese shifts in balance sheets can have long -run impacts. For example , the large increase in \ngovernment debt could limit a fiscal policy response during some future crisis. Higher levels of \nbusiness debt could threaten financial stab ility, increasing the fragility of the financial system to \nprospective shocks.  \nFinally, l ooking at the t hird broad category , the pandemic has likely unleashed, or at least \naccelerated,  structural and technological changes  that will contin ue to play out over years or even \ndecades.  These include a shift to remote work , as well as online retail and entertainment. While \nthese changes could ultimately result in increase d economic  productivity, there will likely be \nnear- and medium -term disruptions as resource s shift between sectors . These changes also \nincrease the risks around  the value of capital in certain sectors —for example, commercial and \nretail real estate —which  could in turn raise important financial stability considerations.    \n Monetary Policy  \nAn excep tionally  uncertain economic outlook, with the chance of both downside and \nupside surprises , creates a complicated  and difficult environment for monetary policy. While t he \nvaccine promises an eventual end to the virus’s hold on the economy, there remains a substantial gap to be bridged before we get there. With the most recent fiscal package, the economy could get the necessary momentum to  bridge this gap and prevent  standard recessionary dynamics  from \ntaking hold before we reach the s afety  of widespread vaccination.   \n\n7 \n Monetary policy is also playing an important role in supporting the economy, as it has \nsince the start of the pandemic. In March, t he Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) cut its \npolicy inte rest rate to near zero  and launched an aggressive balance sheet expansion program, \npurchasing large quantities of Treasuries  and Mortgage -Backed Securities  (MBS). While the se \npurchases were initially directed towards smoothing market functioning, the expansion of the \nFed’s balance sheet also supports accommodative financial conditions, to the benefit of the overall economy. In September, the FOMC provided forward guidance, consistent with the Fed’s new monetary policy framework, that interest rates would remain near zero until the labor \nmarket reached levels consistent with maximum employment and inflation had  both risen to 2 \npercent and was on track to exceed 2 percent for some time. In December, the Committee further extended its forward guidance to cover its asset purchases, s tating that it will continue to increase \nits holding of Treasuries and MBS by at least the current pace until substantial further progress has been made on its employment and inflation goals. Overall, the outlook is for monetary policy \nto remain accommodat ive for some time.        \nClearly, in the current environment where the economy continues to heal, an  \naccommodative policy stance is appropriate. It is too soon to speculate about the timing of any \nchange  in this stance . The Committee  has agreed that further substantial progress in achieving \nhigh employment and average inflation at its 2 percent target is necessary  before making \nadjustments . This wait -and-see approach will guide the trajectory of monetary policy. As the \ndata come in , and the  economy evolves, the public and markets should be able to adjust their \nexpectations regarding the policy path. This feature of forward guidance is especially useful now given the heightened uncertainty around the outlook, stemming in large part from  the path of the \n\n8 \n virus. In the near -term, the r isks are predominately negative , but once the pandemic is behind us , \nthere is  considerable  scope for a snapback in activity .   \nHowever, a s the economy recovers and the Committee judges progress toward its \nmanda te for employment and inflation, policymakers will necessarily wrestle with judgments \nabout the appropriate stance of its policy settings. With longer -term implications of the pandemic \nnoted earlier unfolding over time, these deliberations are likely to be challenging. For example, \nhow long- lasting will the effect s of the pandemic on the labor market  be? Should we expect  \nemployment to return to its lows of early 2020? Or w ill changes in the structure of the economy \nand labor markets shift employment’s long- run equilibrium ?   \nWill inflation continue to fall short of central bankers’ desired 2 percent long- run \naverage, or  will other dynamics take hold and shift inflation impulses ? For example, a lthough \naggregate inflation, as measured by the PCE index, remains muted, a few hard- hit services prices \nhave played a disproportionate role in depressing the aggregate index. To the extent that a post -\nvaccine bounce- back boosts demand and prices in these sectors, including airfares and hotel \naccommodation, inflation could move up quickly. Other large contributors to the decline in inflation are a bit idiosyncratic, including owner -occupied housing and financial servic es. In \ncontrast to these sectors, price inflation for many other  categories  of consumption (particularly \ngoods) has  moved up, sometimes quite sharply. Such a scenario does not suggest higher inflation \nis a near -term threat, but rather that inflation could approach the Committee’s average inflation \nobjective more quickly than some might expect.   \nFinally, will highly accommodative monetary policy seed imbalances in the economy that \nincrease the fragility of the economy to the next inevitable shock? Will othe r mechanisms \neffectively mitigate and balance any destabilizing elements of a low -for-long rate environment?  \n\n9 \n As we  close the chapter on 2020, the N ew Y ear ushers in its own mix of optimism and \nchallenges. The experience of the pandemic will undoubtedly leave its mark even as our nation’s \neconomy shows its resilience  and recovers. Ultimately, the wisdom to understand this unfolding \nlandscape and to respond  with appropr iate policy adjustments will set the course for achieving \nour objectives for financial stability, sustainable long- run growth, employment and inflation.",

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n    \n              \nMay 26, 2021 \nOklahoma Bankers Association Annual Conference  \nOklahoma City, Oklahoma  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers or representatives.  \n\n1 \n  I appreciate the opportunity to attend your annual meeting in person and to extend my \nbest wishes to Roger Beverage as he retires. It has been my pleasure to work with Roger over the \nyears, and his leadership to the banking industry will be missed.   \nFor more than one  year now, our nation has been confronted by a pandemic that has \ntaken a heavy toll. In addition to substantial loss of life and illness, our economy was also challenged in ways that were without comparison in recent history. Now, thanks to the efforts of scien ce and healthcare, it appears we are on a path to return to normalcy.  \nIn my remarks today, I will offer some thoughts on the  economic outlook, as well as the \noutlook for banking.\n1 \n \nThe outlook  \nSince the pandemic upended the global economy a little over a year ago, we have made \nconsiderable progress along the path to economic recovery. By many measures , the gap s that \nopened up in early 2020 have narrowed. Real gross domestic product (GDP), the br oadest \nmeasure of the nation’s economic output, increased at a robust 6½ percent annual rate in the first \nquarter, and will likely surpass its pre -pandemic level this quarter. The unemployment rate , at \njust over 6 percent in April, has improved considerabl y from its nearly 15 percent peak a year \nago.  \nThat progress alone is reason to be optimistic. Even so, we remain more than 8 million \njobs shy relative to pre -pandemic levels.  While t his shortfall partly reflects the  still-elevated \nunemployment rate, anoth er factor has been a decline in labor force participation  with  many \npotential workers  sitting on the sidelines .  \nAs we look ahead, I anticipate strong employment growth in the coming months , \nparticularly in contact- intensive industries such as hospitality and live entertainment, where the \nrebound in jobs has so far been  incomplete.  The outlook is also supported by an  extraordinary \namount of policy stimulus, both fiscal and monetary. Fiscal transfers have led to a considerable improvement in hous ehold balance sheets, with an accumulation of saving s far in excess of \nnormal levels.  In fact, the outlook is so strong that the discussion has quickly shifted from \ndemand shortfalls to supply constraints.  \n \n1 I thank Nick Baker, Stefan Jacewitz, Blake Marsh, and Rajdeep Sengupta of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas \nCity for their assistance in preparing thes e remarks.  \n\n2 \n Inflation over the 12 months  ending in April , as measured by the consumer price index  \n(CPI), increased to 4.2 percent, the fastest pace in over a decade and up considerably from the \n1.4 percent pace recorded at the start of the year.  What the current pace of inflation means for the \ninflation outlook for the medium term is less than clear . Many factors that have boosted current \ninflation seem likely to fade over time . All the same, I am not inclined to dismiss today’s pricing \nsignals or to be overly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judgi ng the outlook for \ninflation. The past few decades saw inflation play a relatively minor role in the day -to-day \ndecision- making of businesses and consumers. Maintaining this  state of affairs as we seek to \nachieve our objectives for maximum employment and price stability  will be important.  \nAs the pace and strength of the recovery unfolds , monetary policy settings remain highly \naccommodative and will remain so for some time in line with the FOMC’s  forward guidance. \nThe Committee has stated that it expects to keep the policy rate near zero until the labor market has reached levels consistent with maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. The FOMC also expects to maintain its purchases o f Treasuries and mortgage -backed securities until substantial further progress has \nbeen made towards these employment and inflation goals.   \nJudging the appropriate timing for policy adjustments is always challenging. The \neconomy is an incredibly complex se t of relationships, many of which have been disrupted by \nthe pandemic with uncertain long- term consequences. This is true for how we consume, how we \nproduce, and how we work. As the economy works its way towards a new equilibrium, policymakers will be well served to take a flexible approach to monetary policy decisions, in my view. In this regard, the Federal Reserve’s revised framework for monetary policy, adopted last August, provides a “framework,” rather than a “rule.” The  FOMC has in the past avoided s trict \nadherence to monetary policy rules, so it is unsurprising that the revised framework is not a precise prescription for policy action even as it repositions the Federal Reserve’s approach to achieving its congressional mandates for employment and inflation.  \nThe structure of the economy changes over time, and it will be important to adapt to new \ncircumstances rather than adhere to a rigid formulation of policy reactions.  With a tremendous \namount of fiscal stimulus flowing through the economy, the lands cape could unfold quite \ndifferently than the one that shaped the thinking around the revised monetary policy framework. That suggests remaining nimble and attentive to these dynamics will be important as we seek to \n\n3 \n achieve our policy objectives in the cont ext of sustainable economic growth and the well -being \nof the American public.   \n \nThe r ole of banks in the r ecovery   \n The banking industry has of course also played a key role in the recovery to date . Banks \nwere vital  in keeping the economy going in the early days of the pandemic . As investors fled to \nthe safety of cash and other liquid assets, financial markets witnessed a liquidity squeeze that \nwas particularly acute in short -term funding markets. Banks were well sit uated to withstand this \nliquidity squeeze.2 Crucially, the ir resilienc e reflected strong liquidity and capital positions  and \nmassive economic support from the government . As a result, banks were not only able to \nprovision for anticipated losses from the p andemic, but also to continue lending during the early \ndays of the pandemic. B anks provided around $ 270 billion in withdrawals on existing lines of \ncredit t o businesses in the first quarter of 2020 to cover anticipated revenue shortfalls.3  \nWhile the initial pandemic policy response of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve \naddressed the liquidity squeeze in March 2020, subsequent policy actions have pivoted from containing a potential financial crisis to addressing the challenges of supplying new credit to the businesses and households hardest hit by the pandemic. Banks have been a critical conduit for these policy measures. Most notably, banks disbursed funds to small businesses that were hard \nhit by the pandemic  through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP ). As of May 2, 2021, over \n5,000 lenders have approved close to 11 million loans under the PPP, totaling $780 billion in \nfunds to eligible small and medium- sized businesses .\n4 Regional and community banks have been \nparticularly active participants in the program. PPP loans ma ke up more than a quarter of \noutstanding C&I loans at  regional banks and around 40 percent at community banks —\nsignificantly more than large banking organizations ( LBOs ). This is a massive program , and its \nability to reach critical corners of the economy has depended on the strength of the relationships \nthat community and regional banks built over years of work with small, local businesses in their communities.  \n \n2 Rajdeep Sengupta and Fei Xue, 2020. \" The Global Pandemic and Run on Shadow Banks ,\" Economic Bulletin, \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, May 11, 2020.  \n3 The data reported are end -of-quarter changes in unused commitments for banks between Q4:2019 and Q1:2020. \nAnecdotal evidence would suggest that most of the draws occurred late in the first  quarter of 2020.  \n4 https://www.sba.gov/funding -programs/loans/covid -19-relief -options/paycheck -protection -program/ppp- data  \n\n4 \n The sheer size of the economic policy  response to the pandemic, however, has created \ncertain challenges for banks. B ank deposits have increased dramatically . At the same time , fiscal \ntransfers have weighed on loan demand. While small businesses have obtained much -needed \nfunding through the PP P program, most large corporate firms have been able to take advantage \nof easing credit conditions in bond financing. Federal aid packages have helped households \nrepay debt, boost savings and improve credit scores —complementing a decade- long cycle of \ndelev eraging by households from the peak of the 2008 f inancial crisis. As a result of this rapid \nand broad turnaround in credit conditions, demand for more credit , especially for bank loans , has \nbeen reduced. Facing low loan demand, banks have us ed much of their increased deposit funding \nto acquire low -yielding, liquid securities , which has weigh ed on overall bank profitability.  \n As the recovery from the pandemic continues, loan demand is lik ely to increase,  and \nbanks will find new lending opportunities. Indeed, demand for auto lending, for example , has \npicked up recently. However, t otal loan growth —and particularly business lending growth \noutside the PPP program —remains  tepid despite bank standards easing as economic uncertainty \nhas abated. Pressure to raise profitability could increase.  \n \nImplications for r isk-taking and b ank c apital  \nEven if loan volumes do pick up appreciably, profitability is likely to remain a concern. \nWith interest rates expected to remain low for some time, profitability measures , such as net \ninterest margins , will continue to be compressed.  The pressure t o boost profitability can result in \nturning to other , possibly riskier,  alternatives to bolster returns .  \nThe link between profitability and risk- taking is not always clear cut , but the  search for \nhigher returns  can understandably have negative consequences  for the banking system and the \neconomy more broadly. Some r esearch  argues that wh en a bank’s incentives are well aligned, \npreserving value can limit risk -taking .5 Such incentives may come under pressure in today’s \nenvironment where l ower profitability might encourage risk- taking, whether by increasing \n \n5 Demsetz, Rebecca, Mark R. Saidenberg, and Philip  E. Strahan, 1996, “ Banks with Something to Lose: The \nDisciplinary Role of the Franchise Value ,” Federal Reserve Bank of New York Economic Policy Review, 2(2), 1-\n14; among others . \n\n5 \n duration in asset portfolios, by loosening underwriting standards to compete for loans, or by \nexpanding into new or riskier lines of business.  \nDespite loan demand uncertainties, bank earnings during the firs t quarter of this year \nhave been positive, benefitting in large part from the release of loan loss reserves , particularly for \nlarger banks . Banks also have become  more reliant on non- interest income  sources. However, \nrecent events around Archegos Capital and Greensill Capital  are reminders of the impact of \nidiosyncratic losses and the ongoing value of risk management and strong capital. Both opaque, complex transactions  or those with seemingly  well -understood risks  can lead to unex pected \nlosses.  \nRegulatory reforms enhanced capital rules in response to the 2008 f inancial c risis, in part  \nto protect against risks that are not well understood . These rules strengthened requirements for \nthe amount and quality of capital in systemically significant banks and undoubtedly contributed \nto stab ility in the banking industry as the global pandemic  unfolded. Our largest banks, those \nlabeled GSIBs  (global  systemically important banks) entered the pandemic with capital  levels \nwell above those leading into the last crisis . However, in terms of leverage ratios, c ommunity \nand regional banks continue to hold even more  capital  than GSIBs .\n6 \nThe fundamentals of s trong capital and robust risk management will remain important as \nthe economic recovery advances  and banks resume dividend payments and share repurchases . \nResisting an excessive focus on short -term results at the expense of long -term interests  will be \nkey.7 The full effect of the pandemic on bank portfolios  is still unknown, and with so much \nuncertain , there are benefits to a longer -term view of capital.  \nA shifting f inancial s ector  landscape  \n Even as the banking industry manages through the aftermath of the pandemic, banks also \nare responding to strategic shifts in  the broader financial sector landscape.  The nation’s banking \nsystem across all sizes —large, small, and regional —ha s historically been the driver of financial \nservices for consumers and businesses.  However, technology and innovation also have a long \n \n6 The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s semi -annual updates on Bank Capital Analysis (BCA)  judges capital \nstrength across the banking industry. As of December 31 , 2020, the aggregate Tier 1 leverage ratios for global \nsystemically import ant banks (GSIBs) was 7. 5 compared to 9.1 for RBOs  and 10.0 for CBOs . \n7 For definitions of short -termism , see Sheila Bair, “Lessons of the Financial Crisis: The Dangers of Short -\nTermism,” Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance & Financial Regulation, Monday, July 4, 2011 , or  \nhttps://www.cfainstitute.org/en/advocacy/issues/short -termism . \n\n6 \n history of joining forces to disrupt existing conventions.  Similar to the proliferation of nonbank \nlenders, we now see thi s dynamic playing out in today’s financial system as it relates to \nfacilitating payments.  In essence, the unbundling of traditional banking services  poses new \nquestions for a legal and regulatory framework that has positioned the banking system to support \nmonetary policy transmission, financial stability and consumer protections . \nThe ability to send money with the speed and convenience of an email is appealing and \nunderstandably gaining rapid adoption. Indeed, we’ve witnessed over the past year an increased  \nadoption of digital payments. Yet we can’t overlook that despite efforts to make payments faster, less costly, and broadly accessible, nonbank entrants into financial services operate largely outside our existing institutional and regulatory frameworks. In some cases, novel charters at the \nstate and federal level have emerged to conduct these activities with new forms of money  and \ncustomized regulatory frameworks . \nTo what extent our existing legal and regulatory frameworks will need to evolve is \nunclear. The characteristics associated with commercial banks have generally assumed access to the public safety net of federal deposit insurance and the Federal Reserve’s discount window  \nwith a state/federal regulatory framework and direct access to the Federal Reserve’s payments rails.\n8 State and federal regulators collectively should consider how these fintechs and payment \nplatforms fit into the banking system.   \nToday’s accelerating pace of  technological  change has implications for our financial \nsystem.  But what hasn’t changed are the Federal Reserve’s priorities for the payment system : \nsafety, accessibility and efficiency.  It is through this lens that the Federal  Reserve remains \ncommitted to its goal to deliver its  first new payment service in over 40 years, the FedNow \nService.  The FedNow Service is a high priority for the Federal Reserve and will lay a foundation \nfor the future of payments that can be used as a s pringboard for innovation and yield important \neconomic benefits for the public. We are taking a phased approach in developing the FedNow Service so we can bring initial releases to market as quickly as possible, while providing flexibility to add key featu res in future releases.  We continue to collaborate with the industry and \nhave established a FedNow Community for those interested in helping evolve the development \n \n8 On May 5, 2021, the Federal Reserve Board invited comment on proposed guidelines to evaluate requests for \naccounts and payments services at Federal Reserve Banks: \nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20210505a.htm .  \n\n7 \n of the FedNow Service. If you aren’t already a member and would like to join, you can visit the \nFRBservices.org website9 for more information.  \nNew entrants and new business models will continue to disrupt and reshape the financial \nservices industry.  Bank strategies for the future are taking a fresh look at providing payments \nservices, including innovation through new services, such as FedNow, or new partnerships with \nfintechs and other financial services providers.  Your customers’ changing needs and preferences \nwill be key  to the strategies you pursue, as they have been for decades.  \n \n \n9 https://www.frbservices.org/financial -services/fednow/community/index.html",

            "content": "Higher Prices: Supply Bottlenecks, Robust Demand, or Both?   Lessons from Energy Markets for \nthe Broader Economy \n  \n \nEsther L. George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \nNovember 5, 2021  \nDelivered virtually at “Energy and the Economy: Opportunities and Challenges of the \nEnergy Transition ” \nA conference hosted by the Federal Reserve Banks of Kansas City and Dallas  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve \nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.  \n\n1 \n Thank you for attending this year’s Energy Conference, hosted jointly by the Kansas City \nand Dallas Federal Reserve Banks.  A lot has happened since we conv ened  last November , \nincluding the widespread distribution of vaccines  and a further reopening of the economy . The \nvirus continues its disruptive presence, though to lesser degree.  For the economy, the key \ndevelopment has been  a seemingly  abrupt transition  from a  world  of demand shortfalls to one of  \nsupply constraints . Surging demand over the course of 2021, supported by aggressive fisca l \npolicy and accommodative monetary policy, has pushed on a supply side that continues to suffer  \npandemic -related disruptions .  \nThe combination of resurgent demand and constrained supply has pushed up prices , both \nin energy markets and in the broader economy.  The price of oil has doubled over the past year, \nwith WTI increasing from about $40 a barrel  to over $80 a barrel, while domestic natural gas \nprices have risen almost 150 percent.  Aggregate inflation also has picked up significantly , rising \nto 4.4 percent over the 12 months ending in September, the fastest pace in over 30 years and \nconsiderably higher than the 1.1 percent rate recorded last November . While higher  energy \nprices have  contributed to this increase, when its impact is excluded,  inflation still remains \nelevated at 3.7 percent.       \nWith increasing prices dominating headlines, the central question confronting economic \nforecasters  and policymakers  at the Fed  is just how long  this elevated inflation  will persist . The \nanswer to this question depends  fundamentally on how long the current tightness in the economy \ncontinues, and, in turn, the outlook for both supply and demand.  While movements in energy \nprices are frequently attributed to  supply developments, the importance of supply fo r broader \nprice mo vements had been increasingly called into question prior to the pandemic . A long period \nof lackluster demand growth following the 2008 financial crisis  accompanied by muted inflation  \nhad taken some emphasis off the role of supply constraints in determining  the level  of inflation . \nJust prior to the pandemic, the importance of th e relationship between supply and inflation had \nreached a low point . After decades of viewing the relationship between the unemployment rate \nand inflation  (summarized by the Phillips Curve ) as a central constraint on  how hot the economy \ncould run without  sparking inflation , many questioned the continued relevance of this constraint .   \n Today, I  would like to briefly touch on the price dynamics  in both energy markets and \nthe overall economy before considering what lessons the energy market might provide for the \n\n2 \n consideration of price dynamics in the overall economy, and then end with some thoughts on the \noutlook for monetary policy.  \n \nRecent Developments  \nAcross a variety of energy commodities, d evelopments in both supply and demand have \nled to rapid price increases . For oil, a reopening economy has pushed up demand,  with global oil \nconsumption rapidly returning to  pre-pandemic levels , significantly  lifting  crude  prices. Despite \nhigher prices, U.S. oil producers appear wary to ramp up production on the heels of  the collapse \nin prices early in the pandemic.  OPEC has also shown restraint , sticking to previously agreed \nproduction quotas,  even as prices have cli mbed.  The price moves for natural gas have been even \nmore dramatic, especially in Europe, where low inventories  coming off a n especially cold winter \nlast year and weak renewable production during the summer coupled with resurgent demand—in \npart as climate considerations shifted electric al generation away from coal —ha ve led to surging  \nprices .   \nLikewise , we see  the interaction of demand and supply  dynamics creating price pressures \nin the broader  economy . Fiscal transfers in the United States  have supported incomes and \nspending . This has been particularly true for goods , as the pandemic led consumers to rotate \nconsumption from in-person services towards purchases for their homes.  Strong demand has led \nto a remarkable increase in prices for durable goods, which rose  over 7 percent in the previous  12 \nmonths following 25 years of consistent price declines.   \nSupply disruptions  have also contributed to the rise in prices . Notably, shortages of \nsemiconductors have constrained output  in a number of industries, including automobiles.  \nSnarled global supply chains have pushed up shipping costs and disrupted the production of a \nwide variety of goods.  Supplier delivery times have slowed dramatically, not only for \nmanufacturers but also for service providers , in part as  shipping times from Asia to the West \nCoast have doubled, and transit costs have skyrocketed.  The number of ships waiting to unload \nat Long Beach has become a commonl y cited economic indicator.  Inventories have been \ndepleted, with the retail inventory -to-sales ratio running 30 percent below its historic averag e and \nat all-time low s.   \nThere are also widespread reports that a lack of available labor is  curtailing production in \nmany industries, contributing to kinks in the supply chain and pushing up prices.  A number of \n\n3 \n indicators point towards a tight labor market.  Reported unfilled job openings are at  record levels, \nwhile the rate at which workers are q uitting their jobs, a typical sign of a tight labor market, is at \nan all -time high.  Wage growth has also accelerated, particularly for lower -income hourly \nworkers.  \nIt is important to note that the tightness in the labor market could prove temporary as a \nsizable number of people , about 5 million,  remain  out of work relative to before the pandemic . \nThese workers are roughly split between those reporting being unemployed and those who report \nno longer being in the labor force.  Non-college educated women with children represent a large \nportion of those that have dropped out of the labor force, suggesting that disruptions to childcare \nremain a barrier to work for many.  In particular, daycare capacity appears to have fallen 10 \npercent relative to pre-pandemi c levels.  A full recovery of the labor market appears unlikely until \nchildcare normalizes.    \n \nLessons from Energy Markets for the Broader Economy  \nWith the broad economy running into supply constraints to an extent that we have not  \nwitnessed  for some time , judging the outlook can be particularly challenging. Looking to the \nexperience of energy markets, where supply developments have long been an important \ncomponent of price fluctuations , we see several lessons that may inform today’s experience .  \nOne lesson from the history of oil price movements  is that it can be very difficult to \ndisentangle the role of supply versus  demand.  Prices are determined by the intersection of supply \nand demand, and the price impact of any particular supply disruption will depend i mportantly on \nthe underlying strength of demand.  The sharp fall in oil prices in 2014 occurred against the \nbackdrop of both a rapid increase in supply associated with the growth of U.S. shale oil \nproduction and relatively weak growth in oil demand as the g lobal economy continued its slow \nrecovery from the financial crisis.  These two factors interacted to cut the price of WTI in half, \nfrom over $100 a barrel to around $50 a barrel, over the second half of 2014.    \nAnother lesson from oil markets is that  precautionary motives are an important \ndeterminant of current demand  and prices . News of an actual or perceived supply shortfall can \nlead to a  desire to increase stockpiles , amplifying the price increase from any given supply \ndisruption.  For example, t he OPEC  shocks of the 1970s led to an increase in demand for  oil \ninventories (and full gas tanks) which then help ed maintain higher prices.  Similarly, in the \n\n4 \n broader economy I am hearing anecdotes  of firms responding to t oday’s supply challenges by \nover-ordering and accumulating precautionary inventories of the necessary inputs to  production, \nincluding semiconductors  and steel. As firms attempt to shore up their supply chains and move  \naway  from a just -in-time production mo del, the incentive to carry higher inventories could \nfurther support prices  across a broad variety of goods .  \n \nLessons for Monetary Policy \nThis history of energy price movements has informed t he conduct of monetary policy.  In \nparticular, energy price shocks have played a key role in developing the thinking around how \nmonetary policy should respond to elevated inflation, particularly inflation that appears to arise from supply developments.  The oil price shocks in the 1970s, the run up in oil prices in the mid-\n2000s , and the collapse in prices in 2014  all provide context for how monetary policy should \nrespond to inflation  developments  with an important supply component.  In particular , experience \nwith energy prices has largely formed the basis for  argumen ts that monetary policy should not \nreact to increases in overall inflation driven primarily by supply developments . I would \ncharacterize these  argument s along two  related  lines.  First, monetary policy should look through \ntemporar y increases in inflation.  Second, monetary policy should not respond aggressively to \nincreases in inflation resulting from a shift in  relative pric es.  \nAlong the first dimension, given that it takes some time for changes in the stance of \nmonetary policy to affect inflation , it is often argued that policymakers should look through \ntemporary changes in inflation.  It is this argument that led to the creation and widespread usage \nof measures of core inflation that exclude energy and food prices. Given the frequ ency of \ntemporary shocks to energy and commodity price inflation  that are  often attributed to supply, \ncore inflation is likely to offer  a better measure of underlying or trend inflation and thus is \nthought to provide an important guide to monetary policy.  This argument was prevalent in 2014 \nand 2015 when a sharp decline in oil prices pulled down overall inflation, and the Federal \nReserve at the time argued that policy should look through this decline on  the assumption that \nthe dip was temporary.    \n\n5 \n Second, there is a large literature suggesting that monetary policy should not respond \naggressively to changes in  relative price s.1 The logic is that relative prices serve as important \nsignals that help to reallocate economic resources to  sector s that are relatively tight from sector s \nthat ha ve excess slack.  Of course, t his reallocation could be achieved  with offsetting  changes in \nprices, an increase in prices in the tight sector s and a decrease in prices in slack sector s, which, in \ntheory,  could leave overall inflation about unchanged.  However, in reality , firms in slack sector s \nhave often found that  cutting prices, and particularly wages, is  difficult.  Thus, with incomplete \nadjustment in slack sector s, relative price changes often end up push ing up overall inflation.  \nTheory suggests it is better for policymakers to accept this increase in inflation, which should be \ntemporary, than to tighten policy and restrict overall activity in an effort to force offsetting price \ndeclines in shrinking sector s. This argument was  frequently made in the mid -2000s as oil prices \nrose steadily  and lifted overall inflatio n, due to perceived shifts in supply and demand in the oil \nsector . Even as higher oil prices contributed to higher overall inflation, it was argued that \npolicymakers should look through this temporary increase in inflation rather than force adjustment s on other sectors of the economy .  \n \nThe Outlook for Monetary Policy \nHow might these lessons apply today?  The timeframe for resolving bottlenecks and the \nscope of categories reflecting price pressures make the answer to this question less than straightforward.   \nDisruptions that  initially appeared to be temporary bottlenecks driving up prices  now \nlook as if they may  be more long -lasting , with widespread reports suggesting that supply chains \nwill not recover until well into 2022.  Additionally , while in the spring the increase in prices was \nbeing driven by select categories  of goods and services,  more recently the increase in prices has \nbecome generalized , and is apparent across a b road swath of the economy . Through May, both \nthe pe rcent of consumer expenditures showing large increases in prices and the percent of \nexpenditures showing large decreases in prices were historically elevated.  However, in recent \nmonths, price s that had been depressed by the pandemic, including hotel accomm odations and \nairfares , have rebound ed, even as prices for goods that have seen price spikes —for example used \n \n1 Including a paper presented at this year’s Jackson Hole Symposium.  Monetary Policy in Times of Structural \nReallocation (kansascityfed.org)  \n\n6 \n cars, appliances, and furniture —remain elevated.  As a consequence, currently 50 percent of  an \naverage household’s expenditure basket is now experiencing unusually higher prices .  \nAs supply chains heal and demand eases, there is reason to expect  inflation will \neventually moderate, but it is also clear that the risk  of a prolonged period of elevated inflati on \nhas increased . The argument for patience in the face of  these inflation pressures has  diminish ed.  \nThis week , the F ederal Reserve started the process of normalizing the stance of monetary \npolicy by announcing its intention to end asset purchases.  The Committee plans to decrease the \npace at which it is purchasing Treasury securities by $10 billion a month and  agency mortgage -\nbacked securities by $5 billion a month, laying out a trajectory for ending these purchases by the \nmiddle of next year.     \nIt is important to note that w hile the pace of asset purchases  is slowing , the cumulative \neffect of these purchases is arguably the more subst antive force acting on the economy. Since \nMarch of last year, the Federal Reserve has purchased more than $4 trillion of securities, pushing \nour total asset holdings to $8.5 trillion dollars. These asset holdings are depressing longer -term \ninterest rates m ost relevant for households and businesses and thereby are providing a significant \namount of accommodation. And, importantly, this accommodation will persist even when tapering is complete.  \nAs the adjustment of asset purchases gets underway, the focus of attention will naturally \nshift to the path of the policy rate. Since last December, the Committee has stated that it expects to keep the policy rate near zero until the labor market has reached levels consistent with \nmaximum employment and inflation has ri sen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed \n2 percent for some time.  \nTaken together, monetary policy remains highly accommodative in an economy where \ninflation is elevated  and labor markets have yet to fully recover. With both supply and demand \nfactors clearly at play , the choices for policymakers will be complicated as uncertainty remains \nhigh for how temporary or persist ent these frictions will prove to be. \nIn most circum stances , the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate objectives  for maximum \nemployment and stable prices are in alignment, so that the Fed’s policy actions support both objectives simultaneously.  There are however times when the objectives can appear to be in \nconfl ict. And now might be one of those times  with inflation running well ahead of its longer -run \naverage and labor markets appearing to have further room to recover . While the current \n\n7 \n economic alignment certainly adds complexity for policymakers , ending asset purchases is an \nimportant first step along the path to policy normalization  as we balance our long -run objectives \nand seek to promote sustainable growth and financial stability.",

            "content": "The Long Return to Normal  \n \n \nRemarks by  \nEsther L. George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \nSeptember 24, 2021  \nAmerican Enterprise Institute  \nRemarks delivered virtually  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve \nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives . \n\n1 \n Thank you,  Steve , for the invitation to participate in this forum.  I look forward to this \nmorning’s conversation  with your panelists . \nWhen the pandemic took hold and widespread  shutdown s were adopted in the spring of \n2020,  it was immediately apparent that the hit to economic activity would be enormous . Less \ncertain  was ho w long the shock would persist.  Many workplaces sent staff home  with the \nassumption that things would return to normal within a few weeks . Now a year -and-a-half later, \nnormal remains on the horizon.  With the 2020 recession being both the deepest and shortest on \nrecord, the  economy has bounced back sharply, while the return to normal continues to be the \nkey dynamic shaping  the economic outlook.  \nIn discussing the shocks to which the economy is now adjusting , I would include both the \nclosures and disrupt ions associated with the pandemic as well as the enormous fiscal and \nmonetary policy response that followed.  The pandemic shock disrupted the pattern of  \nconsumption  by favoring goods over services . It also disrupted production, introducing frictions \nin labor markets and scrambling global supply chains.  The policy response led to a spike in  \nhousehold savings —as fiscal deficits funded transfer payments —and to a doubling of the Fed’s \nbalance sheet.   \nIn many cases , these shocks —the pandemic and the policy reaction —were offsetting as \nevidenced by the rapid recovery of output and employment.  However, in other cases, the \npandemic and the policy response conspired to  push the economy away from its equilibrium, \ndisrupting long-run trends.  For example, the ratio of goods consumption to services consumption \nis now far above  its long -run historical trend.  Similarly, the household saving rate jumped to an \nall-time high  early in the pandemic, and, although it has come down, rema ins considerably above \nits average in recent decades.  In both these examples, as well as others, i t is reasonable to expect \nthat historical patterns will reemerge, with consequence s for demand, employment, and prices.  \nAs both the pandemic and the policy re sponse fade, the pull toward normal will shape the \noutlook.   \nThat said, while I am comfortable suggesting that the economy  has not returned to \nnormal , I would not be comfortable suggesting that  I know what normal will end up looking like . \n“Normal” is likely to be elusive for some time.  The pandemic was a tremendous disruption  that \nhas affected every aspect of how  and where people work, where they live, and what activities \nthey engage in . Some of the changes coming out of the pandemic will persist  and alter the \n\n2 \n structure of the economy.  Of course, separating transitory from persistent is one of the central \nchallenges of economic policymaking.   \nIt might seem odd to be discussing a return to normal when the Delta variant has pushed \nnew infections  uncomfor tably close to all-time highs . However, m y sense is that , \nnotwithstanding the tragic human toll, the primary effect of the Delta variant will be to prolong \nthe return to normal, rather than upend the process altogether.  \nIn the rem ainder of my time , I would like to discuss some of the key normalization \ndynamics I will be watching in the economy.  Overall, I view these dynamics  as support ing a \ncontinued strong recovery and further gains in employment, while simultaneously relieving some  \n(though not all ) of the price pressures that have elevated inflation in recent months.  I will then \nturn to  the outlook for monetary policy, including some thoughts on what policy normalization \nmight look like, and how the decisions of the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) might \nshape that process . \n \nThe Economic Outlook  \nOne dynamic  likely to shape the outlook is the reemergence of long -standing patterns of \nconsumption, particularly spending on goods relative to services.  With the onset of the \npandemic, r estrictions and consumer caution led to sharp decline s in the consumption of contact -\nintensive services , such as hotel accommodations , concerts, and restaurants , even as homebound \nconsumers ramped up spending on goods . Though services remain a far larger component of \nconsumption than goods, their relative share has declined.  For example, in the second quarter , \nconsumers purchased $1.80  of services for every $1 of goods, far less than the $2. 20 they spent \non average in the years leading up to the pandemic. Over time as the pandemic’s grip wanes , I \nexpect old patterns to re emerge as audiences return to theaters, conferencegoers resume travel, \nand the Jackson Hole Symposium returns to Jackson Hole , for example . This return to normal \nwill pivot c onsumption back towards services and away from goods.   \n The rotation towards services  consumption  will be important for  further improvements in \nthe labor market.  Service sector jobs, primarily in leisure and hospitality and health, represent the \noverwhelmi ng majority of the over 5 million jobs that have yet to return following the dramatic \nloss of jobs in March and April of last year . I expect a return of services consumption to lead to \nfurther strong job gains, with the caveat that the Delta variant could delay this rebound.     \n\n3 \n A pivot towards services will also take some pressure off the red-hot goods market.  \nStrong demand for durable goods, exacerbated by supply chain difficulties, has been an \nimportant contributor to the overall rise in inflation. Over the past year, durable goods prices \nhave increased 7 percent, the first sustain ed break in an over 20-year trend of declining prices.  \nAutomobiles, both new and used, have been an important part of this increase, but the prices for other goods, such as household appliances and recreational equipment have also moved up \nsharply.  As consumption rotates from goods to services, some of the pre ssure should ease for \noverstretched goods demand, even as services growth continues to support the overall recovery \nin the economy.  \nAlthough I expect an easing in the demand for goods , and a loosening of bottlenecks , to \nrelieve some of the pres sure on prices,  the data offer a note of caution . In particular, recent \nmonths have seen a rebound in previously depressed services prices even as goods prices remain \nelevated.  For example, prices for hotel accommodations  in the  index of personal consumption \nexpenditures (PCE)  are now  9 percent above pre -pandemic levels, even as spending on hotel \nrooms remains  16 percent below  where it was prior to the pandemic.  Earlier  this year, PCE \ninflation was recording record levels of dispersion across categories  of consumption . For \nexample, in February , categories representing 16 percent of PCE expenditure s were reporting \ninflation far in excess of average, mostly goods, whereas 26 percent of expenditures recorded \nextraordinar ily low inflation, mostly services.\n1 By June, the percent of expenditures with well-\nbelow average inflation had fallen to 5 percent, while 51 percent of expenditures recorded  price \nincreases far above recent  trend . This is to say, that a shift in demand towards services could help \nease inflation pressures, but that a sustained step down in inflation is likely to also require a \nstabilization in services prices.  \nWhy are prices for some services increasing rapidly even as demand remains weak ? \nSpeaking to contacts in my district, a common explanation is th e lack of available labor.  Without \nworkers, supply is curtailed and prices rise.  The labor shortage has developed as over 5 million \nfewer people are employed relative to before the pandemic.  In large part , the current tightness of \nlabor markets reflects a dramatic decline in labor force participation that developed at the start of \nthe pandemic and has shown  little improvement since.  Despite the persistence of the decline in \nlabor force participation, I believe the pandemic shock remains behind a large part of th e decline, \n \n1 Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco | PCE Inflation Dispersion (frbsf.org)  \n\n4 \n with a high likelihood of workers returning as pandemic -induced frictions , including concern \nover the safety of returning to work as well as disruptions to childcare arrangements,  continue to \nease.   \nThe pandemic shock has led  many women to leave the labor force, disproportionately  \nwomen of color without college degrees .2 The absence of these workers from the labor force is \ncontributing to labor shortages in some services industries.  Difficulty in obtaining child -care \nlikely explains some of the decline in participation.  Tellingly, employment in daycare centers \nremains 10 percent below pre -pand emic levels, suggesting that capacity in this important \nindustry remains impaired.  As the pandemic fades, a normalization of childcare could bring these \nworkers back into the workforce, supporting growth, increasing employment, and alleviating \nsome of the labor shortages that could be contributing to price increases.   \nAnother dynamic contributing to the fall in labor force participation has been an increase \nin the proportion of the population  reporting being retired.  Interestingly, research by staff at  the \nKansas City Fed has shown that the rise in reported retirement does not reflect an increase in the \ntransition of workers into retirement, but rather a sharp decrease in the typical flow of retirees \nback into the workforce.3 Before  the pandemic, every mont h a substantial number of retirees \nreported returning to work.  It is possible increased health concerns during the pandemic \ndisrupted this flow.  Here again , as the pandemic fades , it might be reasonable for this flow to \nonce again reemerge, adding workers to the labor force and further alleviating worker shortages.    \nAll in all, my expectation is that a return to  historical patterns of consumption, with a \nrenewed emphasis on servic es, and a recovery in labor force participation, with the return of \nchildcare and decreased health concerns , will contribute  to an outlook for continued growth,  \nless-binding constraints , and moderating inflation.   \nThere are risks around this outlook, including the continued presence of the pandemic. \nImportantly, the effects  of the upsurge in new cases  could be as pronounced for  supply as  for \ndemand, prolonging the tightness of the economy and maintaining upward pressure on prices. Renewed concern over the virus could impede the recovery in services consumption such that \ndemand remains directed towards sectors of the economy that are near capacity and away from \n \n2 Women without a College Degree, Especially Minori ty Mothers, Face a Steeper Road to Recovery \n(kansascityfed.org)  \n3 What Has Driven the Recent Increase in Retirements? -  Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City (kansascityfed.org)  \n\n5 \n those sectors that have available slack . The surge in the virus could also delay the normalization \nof the labor market, particularly if schooling and childcare are  once again disrupted.  \nAside from the economic threats associated with th e pandemic,  the high level of \nhousehold savings  contributes an additional element of uncertainty to the outlook . Estimates \nsuggest  that the stockpile of household saving s has increased by close to $2.5 trillion.  Of course, \nhealthy household balance sheets are positive for the economy, and , if the  savings  are spent out \nover time,  this spending could support steady economic growth for some time . However, if \nhouseholds instead choose to spend rapidly, a rush  of demand could keep the economy at \ncapacity, reinfo rcing bottlenecks and putting continued upward pressure on prices.  Households \nhave a lot of firepower, and if and how quickly they choose to spend will be an important factor \nin how tight the economy remains.  Of course, whether consumers choose to spend or  save is a \ndecision directly impacted by monetary policy, so the speed at which any excess household \nsaving is spent down is not independent of our policy decisions.   \n \nThe Outlook for Monetary Policy \nSince last December, t he Committee has stated that it expects to keep the policy rate near \nzero until the labor market has reached levels consistent with maximum employment and \ninflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. The \nFOMC also expects to maintain its purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities until \nsubstantial further progress has been made towards these employment and inflation goals.   \nIn my view , the criteria for  substantial further progress ha ve been met , with inflation \nrunning well above our target and the unemployment rate at 5.2  percent , down 1½ percentage \npoints relative to December.  Under these conditions, the rationale for continuing to add to our \nasset holdings each month has waned , and signaling  that we will soon consider bringing our  asset \npurchases to an end is appropriate .  \nWhile recent public focus has been on the timeline for tapering asset purchases, the \ncumulative effect of these purchases is arguably the more substantive force acting on the \neconomy. Since March of l ast year, the Federal Reserve has purchased more than $4 trillion of  \nsecurities, pushing our total asset holdings to nearly $8.5 trillion dollars. These asset holdings are depressing longer -term interest rates most relevant for households and businesses an d thereby are \n\n6 \n providing a significant amount of accommodation. And, importantly, this accommodation will \npersist even when tapering is complete.  \nAs the adjustment of our asset purchases get s underway, the focus of attention will \nnaturally shift to the path of the policy rate . The ongoing effects of these asset  purchases , \nalongside  the presence of both upside and downside risks, will complicate the task of judging the \nachievement of criteria for raising rates. One might argue that today’s inflation dynam ics are \nlikely to keep inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time and align with the \nCommittee’s threshold criteria. On the other hand, the criteria for judging maximum employment \nare murkier.  \nWhile it is clear that we remain far from the historic low levels of unemployment \nachieved pre-pandemic, it is less clear to me that such a benchmark will be the best guidepost in \nthe current expansion . As I discussed, t he pandemic introduced a number of frictio ns into the \nlabor market.  Barring further intensification of the virus, I would expect these frictions to fade, \npromoting strong job gains and a relatively fast approach to maximum employment.  However, I \nam open to the possibility that the pandemic has res ulted in a number of structural changes in  the \nlabor market.  These changes could affect the  assessment of maximum employment in ways that \nare not yet clear.   \n \nPolicy Normalization  \nBeyond interpreting the evolving economic landscape, policymakers also must consider \nthe implications of the multiple policy tools at play as we contemplate removing policy \naccommodation.  While the shift from extraordinary policy accommodation to policy \nnormalization remains some way off, the linkages between balance sheet policies and the path for policy rates  will be factors in future policy deliberations . All else equal, maintaining a la rger \n“normal” balance sheet should imply a higher “normal” terminal policy rate, as higher policy \nrates are needed to offset the stimulative effect of the balance sheet’s continued downward \npressure on longer -term interest rates .  \nGiven the likely trade -offs between the policy rate and the size and composition of the \nbalance sheet as policy shifts towards equilibrium, several factors could affect policymakers’ \ndecisions.  For example, o ne question that might be consider ed is where al ong the yield curve \nwould we prefer the most policy space:  at the long -end or at the short -end?  If the zero lower \n\n7 \n bound is thought to be a costly constraint on policy, there might be an advantage in pushing \ntowards a higher neutral policy rate, arguing for  maintaining a relatively large balance sheet \nweighted towards longer -maturity assets.  The accommodation provided by our balance sheet in \nthis case will have to be offset by higher policy rates, which in turn would provide us with more \nspace to cut rates i n a downturn.  \nWe might also want to consider the rationale for a smaller balance sheet, or at least \nshifting toward one with shorter -maturity assets, with a lower neutral policy rate.  One rationale \nmight be a desire to decrease our footprint in financial markets.  Another is that we might be \nconcerned about the slope of the yield curve.  Raising rates while maintaining a large, long -\nmaturity balance sheet is a recipe for inverting the yield curve, with potential negative effects  for \ntraditional ban king models.  Commentators often discount the effect of an inverted yield curve on \nbanks, arguing that net interest margins are only weakly correlated with bank profitability.  While \nthis might be true for the largest banks , it is not true for small banks.  An inverted yield curve is a \nparticular headwind for community banks, promoting further consolidation in the sector and \nundermining the critical role that community banks provide in terms of local access to credit and \neconomic development.  \nAs the  economy re covers from this pandemic shock, its path is likely to confound our \nassumptions about what a return to normal might look like.  The same is true for the monetary \npolicy normalization process .  Both point to a long and difficult process  ahead as the economy \nheals and the stance of monetary policy  responds .",

            "content": "Opening Remarks  by Esther L. George  \nAt the Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium , \n“Challenges  for Monetary Policy ” \nAugust 22, 2019  \n \nIt is my pleasure to welcome you to beautiful Jackson Hole, Wyoming and to the \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s economic symposium titled “Challenges \nfor Monetary Policy.”   \n \nI am pleased to be joined by Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell, as well as \nmany of my current and former colleagues from the Federal Reserve; and by other \ncentral bankers, academics, and policymakers from around the globe.   \n \nThis year marks the 43rd economic symposium , and with its long history comes an \nassociation with m any distinguished individuals. Sadly, we lost two such \nindividuals this year, both of whom were significant contributors to t he discussion \nin Jackson Hole. And because of that, I want to  take a moment  to remember Alan \nKrueger and Marty Feldstein for their important contributions  and for their \nfriendship . \n \nAlan Krueger joined us at several symposiums both as chair of the Council of \nEconomic Advisers and as a professor at Princeton University. He was always a \ngracio us and thoughtful participant. Those who were with us here last year will \nrecall that Alan was the featured luncheon speaker and offered keen insights on \nchanges in worker bargaining power and implications for monetary policy.  \n \n\nMarty and Kate Feldstein attended many s ymposiums here, and Marty was on the \nprogram some 18 times. His influential contributions to the economics profession  \nand to public service will long be remembered.  He was a wonderful mentor and \nwe are grateful for his advice and input over the years as we considered  topics and \nspeakers  for this program .  \n \nAlan Krueger and Marty Feldstein were exceptional in many ways , and both of \nthem will be greatly missed.  \n \nAs we considered the topic for this year’s symposium, we were mindful that a \ndecade beyond the global financial crisis, central bankers face a range of \nchallenges as they pursue their mandates. Differen ces in econ omic conditions \nacross countries have contributed to a divergence in policy path s with implications \nfor exchange rates, trade, and ultimately economic activity. The buildup and \neventual unwinding of balance sheet policies have implications for capital mark ets \nand fina ncial flows between countries. And a s central banks have looked to \nnormaliz e policy settings, the prospect of lower neutral rates of interest has \nemerged across the globe. While charting a course to pursue their mandates under \nthese circumstances, central banks also must take into account the influences of \ncommodity and financial markets.   \n \nWithout question, it’s a complex ecosystem in which central bank ers seek an \nequilibr ium. And o ur setting here in the Grand Teton National Park  is perhaps the \nideal place to contemplate such challenges given the very c omplex natural  \necosystem  that exists here .   \n \n\nYou will find that t he national park is home to a variety of species – elk, m oose, \nbison, and grizzly bears to name a few. These animals co-exist  in an equilibrium \nthat provides mutual benefits when they respect each other’s territory. As the park \nrangers will tell you , some of the se animals establish large territories referred to as \nhome ranges. When the home ranges of different animals overlap , or one animal \nintrudes on another’s territory, things get a little more interesting.  That said, the \npark rangers assure me  that such encounters or even aggression are generally \nresolved  without bloodshed , typically with retreat of the intruder.  \n \nWe also know that n atural ecosystems are quite sensitive to change and restoring \nthe e quilibrium after a disruption can prove challenging . Earlier this week, I \nattended a talk hosted here at the Jackson Lake L odge that also may provide \nlessons for the ecosystem in which central bankers operate. In this talk, the speaker \nreviewed the history of Grizzly bears  in Yellowstone. He explained that, a s the \nrailroad was constructed across Wyomi ng in the 1800s , hotels began to spring up \nto provide accommodation s for travelers.   \n \nAfter serving meals, t he hotel kitchens would toss out the scraps a short distance \nfrom the kitchen door , which  as you might imagine,  eventually attracted the grizzly \nbears. A s it turned out, the tourists quite enjoyed watching the bears feed and at \nfirst, it seemed harmless, even beneficial – but there  were unintended \nconsequences. The bears began to prefer this new source of food to the detriment \nof their health a nd the safety of the tourists. Eventually, the park service put a stop \nto this practice with a difficult transition to a new equilibrium – getting the \ngrizzlies to return to their natural diet. And to preserve the restored equilibrium , \nyou will find today clea rly posted across the national park  a very familiar sign : Do \nnot feed the bears.  \n\n \nWhether or not central bankers can actually draw any lessons from this natural \necosystem,  I highly recommend while you’re here that you do not feed the bears \nand avoid encounters with them while hiking in their territory.  \nAgain, thank you for coming , and  I look forward to the presentation s and \ndiscussion s of the excellent papers prepared for this year’s program and the \ninsights from all of you on the challenges for monet ary policy .",

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJanuary 15, 2019  \nCentral Exchange  \nKansas City, Mo.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe views expressed  by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal \nReserve System, its governors, officers or representatives.  \n\n \n1 \n I’m delighted  to be back  with the Central  Exchange  for what  has become  something  of a \nNew  Year’s  tradition.   This year marks  another  rotation  for me into the role of a voting  member  \non the Federal  Reserve’s  Open  Market  Committee  (FOMC) —the body  that sets our nation’s  \nmonetary  policy.    \nAs you may know,  the FOMC  consists  of the governors  of the Federal  Reserve  Board , \nwho are nominated  by the president  and confirmed  by the Senate , and the presidents  of the 12 \nregional  Federal  Reserve  Banks , who are appointed  by their respective  Boards  of Directors  \nsubject  to the approval  of the Board  of Governors  in Washington.   Each  of the governors  and the \nregional  Fed presidents  participate  in all FOMC  meetings .  However , voting  rights  are rotated  \namong  the presidents  each year.  In contrast  to the governors  and the New  York  Fed president , \nwho each have  a permanent  vote on the FOMC,  the other  11 Fed presidents  share  four votes  on a \nrotating  basis.   This system  was designed  to ensure  that the publicly  appointed  governors  have  a \nmajority  of votes  on the Committee  unless  there  are vacancies  on the Board  of Governors.   As \npresident  of the Kansas  City Fed, I rotate  voting with the presidents  of the Minneapolis  and San \nFrancisco  Feds.    \nWith  that in mind,  my remarks  today  will focus  on the current  state of the economy  and, \nin that context,  how I’m thinking  about  the stance  of monetary  policy .   \nThe U.S. economy  is currently  enjoy ing one of its longest  expansions,  while  the Federal  \nReserve  has been  gradually  removing  a portion  of the massive  accommodation  it provided  \nbeginning  in 2008.   Short -term interest  rates  have  moved  up and the Fed’s  sizeable  balance  \nsheet , which  reached  $4.5 trillion  in late 2014,  has been  slowly  shrinking.   With  these  conditions  \nin play,  the question s currently  being  asked  are, “Where are we in the normalization  process?   \nDo we have  some  distance  to go to reach  a ‘norma l’ interest  rate or are we nearly  there ?”  \n\n \n2 \n These  questions  remind  me of road trips with my children .  Filled  with anticipation  to \nreach  the destination,  they would  ask, repeatedly,  “Are we there  yet, how much  longer ?” The \nanswer  was usually  a vague  response,  like “We’re getting  close .  Just look out the window.”      \nToday,  even  with GPS-like technology  to serve  as a guide , I find our policy  map is \nincomplete  and, therefore,  I cannot  give an exact  answer  to how close  we are to a neutral  setting  \nfor interest  rates.   There  remain s a host of factors  that can influence  its “location ,” and, as a \nconsequence , will affect  the journey  ahead .  The truth  is that a vague  “we’re  getting  close ” may \nbe the best response  I have  to offer .   \nLet me share  my thoughts  on where  we are and why this is the case, reminding  you that \nthe views I express  today  are my own.  \n \nA Look  at the U.S. Economy  and Where  We Are \n By most  measures,  the U.S. economy  is performing  well.   The unemployment  rate is near \na 50-year low, and inflatio n is stable  and well-anchored  near the Federal  Reserve’s  2 percent  \ntarget.   In addition,  real gross  domestic  product  (GDP )—our broadest  measure  of economic  \nactivity —is increasing  at a moderate  pace,  supported  by both consumer  spending  and business  \nfixed  investment.   Last year,  with accommodative  fiscal  and monetary  policies,  real GDP  grew  at \nan estimated  annual  rate of roughly  3 percent —somewhat  above  the economy’s  longer -run \ngrowth  potential,  which  is estimated  to be a bit below  2 percent.    \nLooking  ahead,  I would  expect  to see a somewhat  slower  rate of growth,  closer  to but \nperhaps  still a bit above,  the economy’s  longer -run growth  potential.   While  we have  begun  to \nsee some  slowing  in interest -sensitive  sectors  such as housing  and motor  vehicles,  consider able \nunderlying  momentum  remains  and should  serve  to sustain  the expansion.   For example,  \n\n \n3 \n business  and consumer  confidence  are both near post-recession  highs.   Wages  are rising  at a \nroughly  3 percent  annual  rate, up from  2½ percent  a year ago.  Manufacturi ng activity  has \nrecovered  from  a slowdown  in 2015 -16 and is now expanding  at a solid  pace.  And,  employment  \ncontinues  to grow  at a rate that is faster  than required  to absorb  new entrants  into the job market.  \nAlongside  these  favorable  outcomes,  there  are of course  factors  that will affect  this \nperformance  and pose risks  to the outlook.   On the upside,  growth  above  the economy’s  longer -\nrun potential  could  further  stretch  labor  markets,  leading  to wage  gains  that are out of line with \nproductivity  growth.  As these  wage  gains  begin  to shrink  profit  margins,  firms  may pass higher  \nlabor  costs  on to their customers  causing  inflation  to rise.  According  to standard  economic  \ntheory,  there  is a level  of unemployment —calle d the natural  rate of unemployment —at which  \ninflation  neither  rises nor falls.   When  the unemployment  rate falls below  the natural  rate, \ninflation  tends  to rise.  There  is a lot of uncertainty  about  where  the natural  rate is, but current  \nestimates  place  it around  4½ percent.   Thus,  with the unemployment  rate at 3.9 percent  in \nDecember  and expected  to fall further,  it is possible  that we could  be on the cusp of an \nundesirable  increase  in inflation.    \nOn the downside,  financial  market  conditions  have  tightened  and become  more  volatile.   \nThe foreign  exchange  value  of the dollar  has appreciated,  contributing  to a loss of \ncompetitiveness  of our exports  and potentially  a softening  of inflation  below  our 2 percent  \nobjective.   Credit  spreads  have  widened,  making  capital  investment  costlier.   Uncertainty  about  \ntrade  policy  and global  economic  growth  has increased,  possibly  causing  businesses  to postpone  \nor rethink  capital  spending  projects.   In my travels  aroun d the seven  states  of the Tenth Federal  \nReserve  District,  I increasingly  hear that input  costs  are rising,  qualified  workers  are hard to find \n\n \n4 \n and retain,  pricing  power  is limited,  and that firms  are pulling  back  rather  than passing  higher  \ncosts  on to their customers.    \nTwo sectors  of particular  importance  to our region  have  their own unique  set of \nchallenges.  The farm  sector  is in a prolonged  downturn  as a result  of declining  agricultural  \nprices,  made  worse  by retaliatory  tariffs  on U.S. farm  products.   And the oil and gas sector  is \nfacing  another  sharp  decline  in oil prices.   While  this sector  has expanded  dramatically  since  the \nearly  2000s  thanks  to fracking  and the related  shale  oil revolution,  sharp  oil price  fluctuations  \nhave  led to a boom -and-bust cycle that may be repeating  itself.     \n To summarize,  labor  markets  are tight,  inflation  is low and stable,  and economic  growth  \nis expected  to slow  to a rate close  to the economy’s  longer -run growth  potential.   \nNotwithstanding  both upside  and downside  risks,  the outlook  for the economy  appears  favorable.      \n \nImplications  for monetary  policy  \nWith  this background,  let me turn to the matter  of monetary  policy.   Since  the beginning  \nof the interest  rate normalization  process  in December  2015,  the Federal  Reserve  has raised  rates  \n225 basis  points,  removing  much  of the policy  accommodation  that was put in place  during  the \nfinancial  crisis  and Great  Recession.   \nSo, are we there  yet?  Has the FOMC  raised  rates  back  to a neutral  or normal  level  so that \nthey are no longer  either  stimulating  or restraining  economic  activity?   Have  we reached  the \nproverbial  soft landing  where  the economy  has achieved  maximum  employment,  stable  prices,  \ngrowth  at potential,  and monetary  policy  neutrality?  In my view,  we are not there  just yet.  \nHowever,  we are close  and for now,  it seems  to me that we should  proceed  with cautio n and be \npatient  as we approach  our destination.  \n\n \n5 \n   As the year unfolds , I will be looking  for signals  from  the economy  in a number  of areas  \nthat will determine  my policy  choices.   My position  on whether  to further  increase  rates  or stay \nwhere  we currently  are will depend  on several  factors.   If, for example,  the inflation  outlook  \nremains  benign  despite  tight labor markets  or if the downside  risks  I spoke  of earlier  materia lize, \nwe can pause  the normalization  process.   On the other  hand , if inflation  pressures  emerge , it \nwould  suggest  we are further  away  from  neutral  than we may have  previously  thought  and \nfurther  interest  rate increases  could  be necessary .   \nIn judging  future economic  conditions , I am mindful  that the effects  of past policy  actions  \nhave  not yet fully  played  out, calling  for patience  in considering  our policy  actions .  As the \nfamous  economist  Milton  Friedman  observed,  monetary  policy  acts with “long  and varia ble \nlags.”   Typically,  policy  moves  affect  real economic  activity  with a lag of six months  to a year \nand inflation  in one to two years.   Given  the cumulative  225 basis  points  of tightening —100 \nbasis  points  of which  occurred  last year—we have  likely  not yet seen the full effect  of higher  \nrates  on real economic  activity  or inflation.   A pause  in the normalization  process  would  give us \ntime to assess  if the economy  is responding  as expected  with a slowing  of growth  to a pace that \nis sustainable  over the longer  run.  Failure  to recognize  these  lags could  lead to an over-\ntightening  of policy,  a downturn  in economic  growth  and an undershooting  of our inflation  \nobjective.  \nThese  issues  are made  all the more  difficult  by a fact that I mentioned  earlier  in my \nremarks —the map guiding  us is incomplete.   We do not know  precisely  the location  of our \ndestination:  that is, the longer -run neutral  value  of the federal  funds  rate.  Recall  that the neutral  \nrate is the rate that neither  stimulates  economic  activity  nor restrains  it.  Participants  at last \nmonth’s  FOMC  meeting  gave  a range  of estimates  of the longer -run federal  funds  rate from  2½ \n\n \n6 \n percent  to 3½ percent  with a median  of 2.8 percent.   With  the funds  rate target  currently  at 2¼ to \n2½ percent,  we are near the lower  end of the range  of our estimates  of neutral .  And complicating  \nour reliance  on these  estimates  is that, in the background,  we are gradually  reducing  the size of \nour balance  sheet,  allowing  assets  to roll off as they mature .  It is unclear  whether,  or how much,  \nthis roll off is further  removing  accommodation.  Again,  this sugg ests it might  be a good  time to \npause  our interest  rate normalization , study  the incoming  evidence  and data, and verify  our \ncurrent  location.    \nA final reason  to show  patience  around  further  rate adjustments  is that a number  of key \neconomic  relationships  that have  guided  policy  over the years  may have  broken  down  in the \naftermath  of the financial  crisis  and Great  Recession.   Structural  changes  in the economy  such as \nthe aging  of the populatio n, sluggish  productivity  growth,  business  sector  consolidation,  rising  \ngovernment  deficits  and debt,  and historically  low interest  rates  have  potentially  rendered  past \nguideposts  to policy  less reliable.   In addition,  central  banks  in other  parts  of the world, like the \nFederal  Reserve,  undertook  massive  asset  purchase  programs  to address  the financial  crisis,  and \nare now beginning  to confront  the need  to shrink  their balance  sheets.   These  central  bank  \ninterventions  may be changing  the structure  of financia l markets  in unknown  and unpredictable  \nways.  \nOne relationship,  for example,  that has confounded  economists  and policymakers  over \nthe past several  years  is that of inflation  and economic  slack.   As mentioned  earlier,  when  the \nunemployment  rate falls below  its natural  rate, we generally  expect  inflation  to rise.  But despite  \nunemployment  falling  well below  most  estimates  of the natural  rate, inflation  has remained  \nsubdued.   This raises  questions  about  whether  our estimate  of the natural  rate is too pessimisti c \nand whether  the economy  can operate  at a lower  unemployment  rate today  than in the past \n\n \n7 \n without  sparking  inflationary  pressures.   This is another  area where  I will be looking  for \nfeedback  from  the economy  to assess  whether  we might  need  to revise  our estimates  of the \nnatural  rate. \nTo this mix, I would  add any number  of additional  real and financial  market  indicators  to \nmonitor  closely  for evidence  that monetary  policy  is approaching  neutral  and that the pace of \nnormalization  should  change.   Gauging  the appropriate  policy  response  will also importantly  be \nshaped  by analysis  from  my staff and input  from  a wide  range  of contacts  who have  on-the-\nground  knowledge  of financial  conditions,  price  pressures,  and the outlook  for economic  activity.    \n \nConclusion  \nEarlier in the normalization  process,  the FOMC  provided  forward  guidance  suggesting  \nthat monetary  policy  was accommodative  and that gradual  interest  rate increases  would  be \nconsistent  with achieving  our goals.   Given  current  economic  conditions,  providing  such explicit  \nguidance  now about  the future  path of policy  rates  would  not be appropriate  in my view.   \nBack  then,  policy  was some  distance  from  a neutral  setting  and we had not fully  realized  \nour objectives  for employment  and inflation,  and thus the direction  of policy  was clear.   Today,  \ncircumstances  are different.   While  my policy  view  always  depends  on the flow of data,  this year \nwe must  acknowledge  that rates are approaching,  and may be closing  in on, our destination  of \nneutral.    We should  also remain  sharply aware  that the effects  of past rate increases,  while  \ndissipating,  are still in play and the effects  will need  to be watched  carefully.    \nIt is possible  that some  additional  rate increases  will be appropriate .  But making  that \njudgment  is not urgent  and should  depend  on a careful  look at the data and gathering  additional  \n\n \n8 \n insight  into where  our destination  is, how much  further  we need  to go to reach  it and how \nquickly  we should  get there .",

First, let me thank the organizers : the Finnish Government, Governor \nRehn and his staff at the Bank of Finland, and the Global Coalition on Aging for inviting me to \nparticipate in this very important forum on the Silver Economy. It is an honor to join with these \nexperts who bring insight to both the challenges and opportunities we are going to face  with an \naging population.   \nCertainly, d emographic trends are reshaping the U.S. labor force , and it is leading \neconomists and policym akers to rethink the key macroeconomic parameters  that drive our \ndecision making .  Monetary policymakers, like myself , have  had to reassess their views about \nthe economy’s longer -run growth potential, the natural rate of unemployment, and how we think \nabou t interest rates .   \n Like melting glaciers, the changes in global demographic trends are often difficult to see \nin the near term, but over time they will reshape the landscape.  Looking over the past quarter \ncentury at the U.S. economy, structural changes have only gradually  reduced the economy’s \npotential growth rate, its natural rate of interest, and  unemployment , but they must be considered \nin the context of how we respond to business cycle fluctuations and potentially underlying \ninflation.  \n I’d like to make three brief  observations about these demographic trends affecting  the \nlabor force ’s composition , the job market , and the housing market.  Then I will briefly describe \nsome of the challenges monetary  policymakers face as they confront these trends . \n \nLong-Term Trends in the Composition of the U.S. Labor Force  \nFirst, the age of the labor force in the United States has changed significantly over the \npast 25 years . The share of older individuals (age 55 and up) in the labor force has continued to \n\n2 \n increase . Twenty -five years ago, o lder individuals made up roughly 10 percent  of the workforce; \ntoday, that share has more than doubled to over 20 percent . At the same time, the shares of \nprime -age (age 25 to 54) and young individuals (age 16 to 24) in the labor for ce have declined. \nThese d emographic factors, particularly the increasing share of the older so -called baby -boom \ngeneration that are retiring, continue to put downward pressure on labor force participation.  \nStarting in the last recession,  we saw that labor  force parti cipation rate s declined steadily.  \nOver the past five years, the participation rate has stabilized as market conditions have improved \nand boosted participation enough to offset some of the downward pull from an aging population.  \nOne of the impo rtant implications of these long -term demographic changes relevant for \npolicymakers is related to  what is known as  the trend unemployment rate. The unemployment \nrate tells you something about the health of the labor market today, but where it stands in rel ation \nto what we think of as a natural  rate – or a trend unemployment rate – is far more informative for \npolicymakers. Research by my own staff at the Kansas City Fed show s that the changes in the \nage and skill composition of the labor force have systematically lowered the trend \nunemployment  rate over the past 25 years .1   \nAs these estimates of the natural rate of unemployment have declined, the scope for \nmonetary p olicy to foster lower rates of unemployment w ithout generating inflationary pressure s \nhas increased. Of course uncertainty about exactly where those natural rates of unemployment \nmight currently lie requires us to be cautious , examine a wide range of information and \ncontinually update the parameters we use as new data arrive.  \n   \n                                                 \n1 Tüzemen, Didem. \"Job polarization and the natural rate of unemployment in the United \nStates.\"  Economics Letters , 175 (2019): 97 -100. \n \n\n3 \n Job P olarization  \nMy second observation is that this shift in the composition of the labor force to older \nwork ers has coincided with  dramatic  changes in skills demanded by employers .  This change, \ndue to technological advancements , has resulted in a phenomenon known  as job polarization. \nMore specifically, job opportunities have shifted away from middle -skill occupations  that lead to \na middle -class standard of living  and toward high - and low -skill occupations . \nSkills demanded in the labor market are rapidly changing, and technological \nadvancement has rendered the skills of many less -educated workers obsolete. As we’ ve \nwitnessed in the U.S. , this lack of job opportunit y, in turn, may lead to depression and illness \namong displaced workers, and these health conditions may become further barriers to their \nemployment. E quipping workers with the new skills employers are demanding in the face of \nrapid technological advancement s continues to be a key issue for labor force  participation and  \npolicy makers .  \n \nDemographic Forces and the Housing Outlook  \n Finally,  my third observation relates to how  these demographic forces are interacting \nwith, and influencing the outlook for, key sec tors of the U.S. economy.  In the housing sector, for \nexample, a combination of forces has  resulted in high levels of housing prices and rents . These \nhigh prices  disproportionately impact younger adults , and as a  consequence younger adults are \ndelaying for ming their own households. For example, the share of adults in their late twenties \nthrough late thirties living with their parents has increased steadily.  This delayed household \nformation is also likely contributing to young a dults delaying marriage  and h aving children.  \n\n4 \n Looking forward,  downsizing by baby boomers could  significantly increase demand for \nnew multifamily construction, especially in metropolitan suburbs. This downsizing , together \nwith the mor tality associated with age , would be expected to free up existing single -family \nhomes for re -occupancy. Younger households who move into these homes from rental units  will \nin turn free up multifamily units for newly forming households.  \n With housing being a key fulcrum of monetary policy and a sector we kno w can be prone \nto boom and bust cycles, these developments will require careful monitoring.   \n \nImplications for Monetary Policy  \n This brings me to the implications of demographic change and other key structural \neconomic relationships for monetary policy.  We have already seen this play out at the Federal \nOpen Market Committee in terms of revisiting our estimates of economic  parameters. For \nexample, according to the Federal Reserve’s Summary of Economic Projections,  popularly \nreferred to as the “dot plot,”  the median projection for the long -run growth rate of real GDP has \ncome down, t he median projection for the long -run unemployment rate has also fallen \ndramatically a nd the median projection for the long -run interest rates has come down notably .    \n Understa nding of cours e that considerable uncertainty remains around these estimates,  \npolicymakers must remain attuned to changes in macroeconomic trends such as aging \ndemographics if we are to achieve our object ives for the economy.",

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJuly 12, 2019  \nLooking Back and Looking Forward: How Do We Preserve Monetary and Financial Stability ? \nThe Central Bank of Iceland  \nReykjavik, Iceland  \n \n \n \n \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers, or representatives.  \n\n \n1 \n Good afternoon.  I want to  thank the organizers and , in particular , Már and the Central \nBank of Iceland for inviting me to participate in this program.  It is timely to consider the lessons \nlooking back and to continue to do the hard work of implementing needed cha nge to secure and \npreserve monetary and financial stability. Preserving  that stability is especially important today \nas central banks work within more limited policy space and , to varying degrees , under challenges \nto independence.  \nThis month marks th e tenth year of expansion of the U.S. economy, now the longest \neconomic expansion in its history.  This long period of expansion has been one of generally \nmoderate growth , but also a period during which the stance of monetary policy remained \naccommodative  for many years,  only recently approaching what appears to be a neutral level.  \nThe unemployment rate, currently at 3.7 percent, remains below most assessments of its long -run \nnatural level and stands in stark contrast to its peak of 10 percent nearly a decade ago. Inflation \nhas remained low and relatively stable throughout this period even as labor markets tightened, \nwages moved higher and domestic demand grew . After years of accommodative policy, the U.S. \neconomy appears to be performing reasonably well  notwithstanding the emerging downside risks  \ncoming from slower global growth and trade policy uncertainty.  Even as the U.S. economy has \nachieved a degree of stability , the prolonged low rate environment accompanied by \nunconventional policy has increased risk appetites  and influenced asset values.  And signs of \nfinancial imbalances are growing, while capital in the nation’s largest banking organizations is \nnot.  \nSecuring economic and f inancial stability for the long -run health  of the macroeconomy  \nrequires balancing monetary policy calibration with an understanding of potential vulnerabilities \nin the financial system . This remains a focus in the United States. My comments today will look \n\n \n2 \n at the nature of current financial vulner abilities  and the challenges I see associated with \nresponding to those vulnerabilities at this stage of the expansion.    \n \nThe Expanded Regulatory Toolkit  \n Following the 2008 -09 financial crisis, massive regulatory change came from legislation \nknown as the 2010 Dodd -Frank Act  and revamped supervisory approaches and keener attention \nto financial stability. Among improvement s in U.S. bank regulatory policy and the  tools \nimplemented to evaluate and promote financial stability , the supervisory stress tests have been a \nkey innovation for assessing the level of capital  in the banking system . This analytical exercise \nprovides a quantitative and comprehensive process for evaluating the sufficiency of an individual  \nbank’s capital , as well as aggregate levels of capita l in the system,  to offset losses that stem from \na simulated stress  environment.  In addition  to stress testing , regulatory capital requirements for \nthe largest banks have been strengthened through more rigorous risk -weighting approaches and \nincreased l everage capital requirements.  To address cyclical concerns about financial stability \nrisk, the Federal Reserve now has the authority to impose a countercyclical capital buffer \n(CCyB ) requirement on the largest banks.  On the other hand, its authorities  related to its role as \nlender of last resort were constrained.  \n Regulatory changes for the largest banks also have  improved their liquidity cushions . \nThese firms  now hold a larger amount of high -quality liquid assets  and must routinely \ndemonstrate their ability to meet short -term liquidity demands . Efforts are underway to develop  \nrequirement s to address longer -term liquidity risk.   \nIn addition, U.S. regulators implemented structural reforms in derivatives markets, \nincluding promotion of central clearing and swap execution facilities, margin requirements, \n\n \n3 \n improved reporting , and bank capital rules for derivatives . Money market mutual fund \nregulations were implemented to reduce run risk in these funds.  Finally, the Finan cial Stability \nOversight Council was formed along with the Office of Financial Research.  \nTaken  together, t hese changes undoubtedly have improved the overall health  and \nresiliency  of the U.S. financial system . Whether these steps will prove robust to a fut ure shock \nhowever has yet to be tested.   \n \nIdentifying Vulnerabilities  \nIdentifying vulnerabilities has taken on renewed focus. To that end, t he Federal Reserve  \npublishes its assessment of risks and vulnerabilities in the economy twice  each year.  The \nframework used by the Fed looks at vulnerabilities across four dimensions:  1) asset valuations; \n2) household and business debt; 3) leverage in the financial sector; and 4) funding risks.   \nThe most recent financial stability report highlights a variety of r isks and vulnerabilities.  \nAmong them, for example, corporate leverage in the United States  has grown rapidly and is at a \nrecord level. The amount of outstanding debt among the corporate sector in the United States  has \ngrown to an unprecedented amount durin g the long expansionary period. Non -financial \ncorporations now have approximately $6 trillion in outstanding debt, roughly twice the amount \nof debt outstanding at the beginning of the expansion. Much of the growth in corporate debt \noutstanding is due to bo rrowing by firms that were already highly leveraged.  \nThe ratings for many of these corporate bonds are at the margin of investment grade and \nare at risk of being downgraded if economic conditions were to deteriorate.  In addition, the \nstandards for leverag ed corporate loans have declined steadily in recent years as loan structures \nand covenants have weakened.  \n\n \n4 \n With much of the recent growth in leveraged borrowing funded by non -bank lenders, \nvulnerabilities that originate outside the banking sector could pos e substantial challenges for both \nthe macroeconomy and U.S. banks during times of financial stress. Close links between the \ntraditional banking sector and the so -called shadow banking sector are evident, but not well -\nunderstood. However, d isruptions in the  corporate debt markets are likely to flow through these \nlinks and raise demands for short -term funding from banks during a period of market stress . A \ndecline in investor demand for corporate debt could also create loan syndicate pipeline risk and \ndownward  pressure on values that would have adverse impacts on banks.  More broadly, a \ndisruption in corporate debt markets could cause broader spillover effects on other assets classes, \nwhere values are currently elevated, adversely impacting overall bank health a nd the \nmacr oeconomy . For this reason, a focus on the stability of the banking system is essential .  \nIdentifying risks  is clearly important. Equally important  is understanding what tools are \nat our disposal to address such concerns.  In the case of the United States , this is very much a \nwork in progress .  \n In my view, monetary policy settings are not well suited to react, notwithstanding the \neffect it may have in influencing the conditions around risk and investor’s reach for yield.  And, it \nseems to me,  macroprudential approaches are desirable in theory but face considerable challe nge \naround the age -old issues of being delivered timely and potently , at least in the  United States’ \nexperience. O ther countries have different macroprudentia l loan-to-value  measures  to use .  \nWithin the Federal Reserve , a number of my colleagues and I participated in a tabletop  \nexercise a few years ago.  The exercise w as designed to assess the efficacy  of certain \nmacroprudential tools in responding to a hypothetical financial crisis. In the exercise, we \nexamined the use of capital -based, liquidity -based, and credit -based tools, along with stress \n\n \n5 \n testing and supervisory guidance in mitigating the effects  of an overheating of the financial \nmarkets. What we discovered in conducting the exercise was that the effectiveness of the tools \nvaried because of realities like implementation lags and/or limited scope.  Clearly, this particular \nexercise is not conclusiv e in all scenarios, but it cautions against becoming overly confident in \nrelying on macroprudential tools to address growing financial imbalances.1  \n I’d like to mention two potential macroprudential approaches in play: the CCyB and \nstress testing.   \n The CCyB,  as I noted earlier, is a new authority granted the Federal Reserve post-\nfinancial crisis . Based on the framework approved by the Federal Reserve Board in 2016 , the \nCCyB is designed to be implemented while economic growth is healthy, bank profitability  is \nrising and financial stability risks  are “contained , but above normal .”  \n  Based on t he Federal Reserve Board’s assessment, the CCyB has not bee n deployed and \nremains at zero, c oncluding that financial risk is not meaningfully above normal.   \n A second tool, stress testing , has been considered.  The supervisory stress  tests have been \nviewed as a more  dynamic method for evaluating capital against vulnerabilities.  Stress tests are \nforward looking , and by choosing adverse scenarios carefully, the tests can b e used to measure \nexposure to specific risks , such as those  associated with real estate or  rapidly  growing corporate \nleverage.  While the stress testing exercise has been a  useful tool to gauge bank capitalization and \npromote safety and soundness, the underlying assumptions are subject to certain limitations.   All \nmodel results have some degree of uncertainty, especially when the current vulnerabilities , such \nas in leveraged corporate debt,  represent uncharted territory . Stress test results need to be \ninterpreted carefully and used among other indicators of resiliency.   \n                                                 \n1 Tobias Adrian, Patrick de Fontnouvelle, Emily Yang, and Andrei Zlate, “Macro -prudential Policy: A Case Study \nfrom a Tabletop Exercise,” FRBN Y Economic Policy Review, February 2017.  \n\n \n6 \n Some have argued that stress tests are counter -cyclical in that more stringent scenarios \ncreated during good times encourage (even require) banks to build capital during periods of \neconom ic growth, thereby preparing for future downturns.  I find little evidence that stress tests \nhave done this.  The latest results of the Federal Reserve stress tests that were released last month \nconcluded all have sufficient capital and all were permitted to  proceed  with capital distribution \nand stock b uybac ks. Despite continued economic growth, actual capital ratios on a consolidated \nbasis for the largest banking organizations have not increased in recent years.2 Instead , \nSupplementary Leverage Ratio s (SLRs) have declined in recent years. In addition, recent  \nresearch has shown that the stress tests have not required banks to build capital.3 After \ndistributions and stock buybacks, the losses (declines in capital) in stress scenarios have been \nsmaller over the last few years.  Banks only need to add capital (or reduce capital distributions) \nwhen losses push projected capital ratios below req uired minimums.  These results suggest  that \nstress tests cannot be relied upon to make banks build capital as we progress thr ough the \neconomic cycle. The prospect of the stress tests not having the desired counter -cyclical outcomes \nshould have the attention of bank regulators and supervisors against a backdrop of increasing \nvulnerabilities .  \n \n \nConclusion  \n                                                 \n2 For the larger “advanced approaches” banking organizations, the average Tier 1 leverage ratio declined from 9.0 \npercent at December 2016 to 8.7 percent at December 2017 to 8.5 percent at December 2018.  \n3 Berrospide, Jose, Andrew Cohen, Ronel Elul, David Hou, Aytek Malkhozov, Marc Rodriguez, and Robert Sarama \n(2019). \"Cyclicality and the Severity of the U.S. Supervisory Stress Test: 2014 to 2018,\" FEDS Notes.

They were \ncostly to learn.  \n Even as we work to develop the most effective macroprudential  tools, we must take to \nheart the important lesson of bank capital as the single most important element in our framework \nfor financial stability . It serves as a buffer.  Whether or not our judgments about the size or scope \nor timing of risk is properly judged, h igher capitalized banks have been shown to lend through \nthe cycle at a higher rat e than those with lower capital and are much less likely to fail.  \nIf we are to secur e economic financial stability for the future, building stronger capital  is \nessential.",

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMay 14, 2019  \nEconomic Club of Minnesota  \nMinneapolis, Minn.  \n \n \n \n \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal \nReserve System, its governors, officers or representatives.  \n\n \n1 \n Thank you. I’m delighted to be here.  \nMy remarks today will focus on a question that garners  a great deal of attention  for those  \nwho follow Fed policy .  It is a question about whether the current level of inflation is too low. Of \ncourse, understanding the drivers of inflation dynamics is an essential part of the Federal Open \nMarket Committee’s (FOMC)  work.   \n  As central banks have done in other countries, t he Federal Reserve announced last \nNovember its plans to review its monetary policy strategy, tools  and communications practices.   \nThis review strikes me as appropriate given the changes that occur over time in  our economy,  but \nit may be especially important now  in a low interest rate environment . I look forward to the ideas \nthat may come forward as part of  this review , even as I offer  a few preliminary thoughts of my \nown today on the F ederal Reserve’s price sta bility mandate, and the FOMC’s inflation objective \nand policy strategies.   Before I do that, I’ll begin with my views on the economic outlook for the \nnation and monetary policy settings.  \n \nEconomic Outlook  \n Last year, the U.S. economy enjoyed robust growth boosted by accommodative monetary \nand fiscal policies.  As the stimulus from these policies wanes, and with slower foreign  growth, I \nexpect to see a slower pace of growth – somewhere in the neighborhood of the economy’s \nlonger -run trend of roughly 2 percen t.  \n As you know, real gross domestic product (GDP) – our broadest, if not the timeliest, \nmeasure of economic activity  – came in at a stronger -than-expected annual growth rate of 3.2 \npercent in the first quarter.  However, beneath this robust  headline numb er, real final sales to \ndomestic purchasers grew at a more modest 1.3 percent rate  – a clear slowing from its pace in \n\n \n2 \n recent years.  In contrast, inventory investment and net exports contributed a combined 1.7 \npercentage points to overall growth.  Inventories and net exports are volatile and difficult to \npredict.  Based on this underlying data, I would expect to see less contribution from these sectors \nin coming quarter s and a greater contribution from domestic final sales.  \n My outlook for  continued  but somewhat more moderate growth is tied to expectations \nthat job gains, wage increases and  consumer confidence will remain supportive of consumer \nspending .  Total nonfarm payroll employment  increased by 263,000 in April after increasing \n189,000 in March.  Over the last three months, j ob gains have averaged 169,000 per month , well \nabove the esti mated  number required to keep the unemployment rate steady.  As a result, we \nhave seen a further decline in the unemployment rate to 3.6 percent in April, the lowest rate since \nDecember 1969.   \n As the job market has tightened , labor compensation has steadily accelerated .  Average \nhourly earnings have climbed from an annual growth rate of roughly 2½ percent in 2017 to 3 \npercent last year, and 3 .3 percent in the first quarter of this year.   With low rates of inflation, \nworkers are beginning to se e signi ficant gains in real wages .  Although consumer confidence was \nbuffeted  early in the year  by the government shutdown  and financial market volatility , it bounced \nback in the spring and remains near its post -recession high.  I am also encouraged to see a  \nrelatively high personal saving rate ( 6.5 percent in March 2019 ), which suggests consumers have \nthe wherewithal to maintain spending in the event of a temporary adverse shock.  \nAnother reason I expect the economy to maintain its forward momentum in 2019 is that \nbusiness spending has picked up following  the sharp slowdown in 2015 -16.  While I don’t expect \nto see the same robust growth of business fixed investment that we saw last year, I do expect to \nsee it make a positive contribution to overall growth.  The waning of the fiscal stimulus, higher \n\n \n3 \n interest rates, and lower oil prices will all contribute to a slower pace of activity.  Still, business \noptimism remains high, and the ou tlook for sales and profits over the medium term remains \nsolid.  \nAs always, there are risks to the outlook , and this generally positive outlook  has several  \nprominent downside risks .  Over the medium term, I see the biggest risk s coming from trade \npolicy un certainty and slower growth abroad, particularly in China, the euro area, and the United \nKingdom.    To the extent slower foreign growth and waning fiscal and monetary stimulus \nrepresent a stronger headwind than I am building into my baseline forecast, we c ould see \nsomewhat slower growth.  Right now the data are noisy , and we need more time and evidence to \njudge whether this risk materializes .   \nFinally , the current outlook for inflation appears to be benign  and, in my view, broadly \nconsistent with our price  stability mandate . While inflation has declined over the course of this \nyear, last year at this time it was near 2 percent.  On a month -to-month basis, movements in \ninflation are  typically  dominated by transitory factors such as changes in energy and import \nprices.  More fundamentally, to the extent beneficial supply side developments such as increased \nproductivity growth may be pushing inflation down, they promote higher real wages and , \nultimately, higher  standards of living.  \n \nOutlook for Monetary Policy  \n At its April meeting the FOMC  maintained the target range for the federal funds rate at \n2¼ to 2½ percent and indicated that it could be patient as it determines whether future \nadjustments  to the target range may be appropriate.  I supported that decision.  This wait -and-see \n\n \n4 \n approach is appropriate because we have not seen upward pressures building on inflation, even \nthough we have experienced above trend growth and a further tightening of labor markets.    \nOver the course of this year , I will be looking for evidence on the amount of slack, if any, \nthat remains in labor  markets; signs that businesses are changing their pricing behavior ; and \nevidence that longer -run inflation expectations could be signaling a lack of confidence in the \nFed’s ability to achieve its longer -run inflation objective  of 2 percent.  I’ll also  be evaluating the \nstance of policy relative to the estimates of the long -run neutral policy rate  – the interest rate \nconsistent with price stability and maximum employment.  This rate has apparently declined over \nthe past decade, but its precise level is uncertain and subject to change.  \n \nThe Balanced Approach  \n Fostering a strong labor market while maintaining price stability is of  course the core of \nthe Federal Reserve’s dual mandate from Congress.  Wit h the unemployment rate at  an historic \nlow level and inflation currently running under the FOMC’s  objective, a  longer -run policy issue \nis whether the persistent undershoot of the inflation objective is undermining its credibility and \ncausing inflation to be anchor ed at too low a level.  Some have expressed concern that i f inflation \nexpectations fall persistently  below the 2 percent  objective , that the extent we could lower real \ninterest rate s by reducing our target for the federal funds rate  – the Fed’s key policy tool  – would \nbe diminished . This could limit the accommodation we could provide in a future downturn \nbecause interest rates cannot fall below a lower bound of roughly zer o percent.       \nAt the time the FOMC  adopted its 2 percent inflation objective in 2012 , monetary policy \nwas highly accommodative, unconventional policy tools were being deployed, and  inflation was \nrunning above 2 percent.   Since then, inflation has run pe rsistently below 2 percent.   I have not \n\n \n5 \n viewed this as a major concern given that, aside from the effects of wide fluctuations in energy \nprices, inflation has remained low and relatively stable. Since 2012, core PCE inflation has \nfluctuated in a range of r oughly 1½ to 2 percent , except during 2015 when a strong dollar pushed  \ncore inflation somewhat below 1½ percent .   \nAs long as inflation was below its objective and unemployment was above its longer -run \nlevel, it was appropriate to run an accommodative  policy to promote the movement of both \nvariables back toward their longer -run sustainable levels.  Accommodative policies tend to lower \nunemployment and, generally  speaking , increase inflation.  \nBut with the unemployment rate now below its longer -run level, s hould we still be \nconcerned about inflation  running slightly below target ?  As I listen to business and community \nleaders around my region, I hear few complaints about inflation being too low.  In fact, I am \nmore likely to hear disbelief when I mention tha t inflation is as low as measured in a number of \nkey sectors.   \nThis leads me to the observation that inflation as experienced by households and \nbusinesses is fundamentally different from inflation as viewed by financial market participants \nand many econom ists.  Households see the prices  of everyday goods such as food, energy, rents, \nand health care rising and don’t understand why the Fed would be concerned that inflation is too \nlow. Their short -run expectations for inflation are driven largely by changes i n retail gasoline \nprices while their longer -run expectations, as measured by the University of Michigan, have been \nfairly stable . (Expected changes in prices during the next 5 years have fluctuated between 2.3 \nand 2.6 percent since January 2018  and are cur rently at 2.3 percent. ) \nBusinesses see their labor and other input costs rising, and with limited pricing power, \nsee their profit margins squeezed.  For them, the product prices they charge are determined by \n\n \n6 \n structural factors such as global competition an d technological disruption that don’t  necessarily  \nrespond to monetary policy , while their costs are driven by tight labor and commodity  market \nconditions . In the April  survey of small businesses conducted by the National Federation of \nIndependent Business,  only 1 percent of respondents said inflation was their single most \nimportant problem, compared with 24 percent who said “quality of labor” and 8 percent who said \n“cost of labor.”  \nIn contrast, financial market participants see inflation and inflation expec tations as key \ndriver s of monetary policy decisions. They look at past, current, and expected future inflation \nrelative to target to form a view about the policy path that they then use to price financial market \ninstruments.  If they perceive the 2 percent  inflation objective as a line in the sand that the Fed \ndoes not want to overshoot , they may come to expect inflation to run belo w 2 percent over the \nlonger run. This concern has led to calls for the Fed to ease rates to push inflation and inflation \nexpect ations higher in an effort to  maintain the credibility  of the target  and preserve policy space.  \nBut even if such a policy  were  effective, how is policy space preserved if rates have to be cut to \nboost  longer -run inflation expectations?   \nEven with these concerns , I supported the FOMC’s decision to adopt a 2 percent longer -\nrun objective for inflation  in 2012 , and I support it today .  I believe it has been effective in \nhelping anchor longer -run inflation expectations.  Arguably, though, adopting a point est imate \ninstead of a range has placed considerable attention on a precise target and has exaggerated the \nprecision with which monetary policy can a chieve this goal .1  It would seem reasonable that even \n                                                 \n1 Jon Faust and Eric Leeper  describe the “disparate confounding dynamics” of inflation that makes it difficult to \nexplain movements in inflation with a small number of “conventional summary statistics for headline aggregates” \nand “complicates the nature of appropriate monetary polic y,” in “ The Myth of Normal: The Bumpy Story of \nInflation and Monetary Policy ,” Inflation Dynamics and Monetary Policy , Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, \nJackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium, August 2015, \nhttps://www.kansascityfed.org/~/media/files/publicat/sympos/2015/2015faust_leeper.pdf?la=en . \n \n\n \n7 \n somewhat persistent deviations from the objective, if th ey are limited to, say 50 basis points \nabove or below , may be acceptable  taken in the context of  broader economic conditions.  \nThe FOMC anticipated that its objectives for employment and inflation cou ld move in \ndifferent directions . It addresses this issue  in its annual  “Statement on Longer -Run Goals and \nMonetary Policy Strategy,” noting that when its objectives are not complementary, the \nCommittee follow s a balanced approach in promoting them, taking into account the magnitude of \nthe deviations and the pot entially different time horizons over which employment and inflation \nare projected to return to mandate -consistent levels.   \nWhat this means is that we should not focus on one leg of the mandate without \nconsideration for the other.  For example, cutting in terest rates today to boost inflation to 2 \npercent at some point in the future would likely cause labor markets to tighten further, leading to \na reallocation of resources into the most interest sensitive sectors.  Given the current \nunresponsiveness of infl ation to labor market tightness , it might take a considerable further \neasing of policy and considerable further  tightening of labor market conditions to have the \ndesired impact on inflation.   And given the lags with which monetary policy operates, it may \ntake a considerable period of time.  In the meantime, lower interest rates  might fuel asset price \nbubbles , create financial imbalances, and ultimately a recession.  \nIn current circumstances, with an unemployment rate well below its projected longer -run \nlevel, I see little reason to be concerned about inflation running a bit below its longer -run \nobjective.  Moreover, I am not convinced that a slight undershoot of inflation below objective \nrequir es an offsetting overshoot of the objective.   As I mentioned earlier, the current benign \ninflation outlook gives us the opportunity to test our assumptions about the degree of slack in the \neconomy and the level of the n eutral  rate of interest.  \n\n \n8 \n Conclusions  \nWith the current outlook for the economy remaining positive, monetary policy settings \nlook appropriate to me.  As we look ahead, however, there is a legitimate concern that monetary \npolicy “space” could be limited in response to a future downturn because o f the low level of \ninterest rates.2 This has led some to argue for a higher inflation target or the adoption of some \nkind of a price -level target.  While I see little value in pursuing a higher inflation target given the \ncredibility we have built over the last decade around 2 percent, the Federal Reserve will be \nseeking ideas and input on alternative policy strategies next month at a conference hosted by the \nChicago Fed.3  It will be an opportunity to learn  more about the pros and cons of different \napproach es for our monetary  policy strategy, tools, and communications practices.   \nThe current level of inflation may perplex central bankers and financial market \nparticipants, but in the context of a growing economy and job gains, it doesn’t demand a Fed \npolicy response  in my view.   Steering what is currently a low and stable rate of inflation up by \n20-50 basis points to reach a precise numerical target , while  disregarding the labor market, the \nother leg of our dual mandate, strikes me as a degree of fine -tuning  that goes beyond our span of \ncontrol .  \n \n                                                 \n2Other government policies that focus on productivity growth and labor force participation might cont ribute to faster \ntrend growth and a higher natural rate of interest, thereby providing additional monetary policy space.  Moreover, \nthe prospect of a future return to the zero lower bound suggests that, along with monetary policy, fiscal policies need \nto be on the menu of possible counter -cyclical options.  \n3 Former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen discussed possible monetary policy responses to a future recession, \nincluding the use of an aggressive policy rule for setting the funds rate in advance of hit ting the zero lower bound \n(ZLB), and asset purchases and forward guidance at the ZLB in “The Federal Reserve’s Monetary Policy Toolkit: \nPast, Present and Future,” Designing Resilient Monetary Policy Frameworks for the Future , Federal Reserve Bank \nof Kansas  City Economic Policy Symposium, August 2016.  \nhttps://www.kansascityfed.org/~/media/files/publicat/sympos/2016/2016yellen.pdf?la=en .",

            "content": "Robert Owen and the Federal Reserve  \nRemarks by  \nEsther L. George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOctober 4, 2019  \nEconomic Forum  \nTahlequah, Oklahoma  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers, or representatives.   \n\n \n1 \n  \nI am delighted to join you today.  \nI’d like to spend a few moments talking about the Feder al Reserve’s important \nconnection to Tahlequah . The history and design of our nation’s central bank is often \nmisunderstood, but is as important today as ever. Tahlequah is an especially appropriate location \nto discuss this history becau se events that occur red in this area more than a century ago had a \ndirect and significant impact on the Fed’s design.  \nAs you may know, sometime before  1880 a gentlem an named Robert L. Owen came to \nthe Tahlequah area as a teacher and supervisor of the Cherokee National School System.  The \nhistoric Owen School House, now known as the Park Hill/Owen Community Center, near the \nCherokee Heritage Center that bears his name.  \nAfter leaving the school, Owen  became a lawyer and practiced law not far from here in \nMuskogee where he organiz ed and served as president of the First National Bank for a decade.  In \n1907  he was elected one of Oklahoma’s first United States Senators, making him one of the first \ntwo Native Americans to serve in the Senate . \nHe joined  the Senate at a time of economic turmoil. Only a few weeks earlier,  the nation  \nexperienced  a financial crisis that would become known as the Panic of 1907. Soon  after, \nCongress began  discussions about how to improve the nation’s financial system, launching a \nprocess that would lead to the  Federal Reserve Act of 1913.  \nThere, Owen played a key role, serving as the legislation’s Senate sponsor and chair of \nthe Senate Banking Committee.  \nOwen’s 10 years in Oklahoma banking contributed importantly to his th inking about the \nrole of a central bank  and how it should be design ed. Owen was a banker during a particularly \nvolatile time for our nation’s banks and the U.S. economy. The panic of 1893 l ed to the closing \n\n \n2 \n of 500 banks. Owen later talked about  how he saw the problem s in the banking  sector during this \nperiod  ripple across the eco nomy, affecting property values, business failures and \nunemployment, which reached 25 percent or higher in some areas of the United States.  \nHe later wrote that the panic of 1893  “demonstrated the complete instability of the \nfinancial system of America and the hazards which businessmen had to meet under a grossly \ndefective banking system.”  \nHe had spent much time considering how to address these issues and, as fate would have \nit, was ideally suited to shape a solution when the opportunity was presented.  \n \nMISSION AREAS  \nBefore I talk about the structure, however,  it might be helpful to explain the full mission \nof the Federal Reserve.  \nAlthough monetary policy is likely the first thing that comes to mind when the Fed is \nmentione d, as the central bank of the United States , the Fed  has other responsibilities that focus \non the stability of our nation’s financial system.  \nWe are a banking supervisor with regulatory responsibilities that entail not only \nexamining depository institutions for financial fitness, but also ensuring that all customers are \noffered financial services on fair and appropriate terms. Here we focus on s uch matters as the \nability of borrowers to access the credit that may be necessary to fund an education, establish a \nbusiness or purchase a home.  \nWe are a bank for banks and also serve as the government’s bank .  This means we not \nonly hold deposits but we  are a provider of important services such as those necessary for the \nsmooth functioning of the payments system. This has included the processing of checks along \n\n \n3 \n with the use of other payment rails to transfer funds between depository institutions. Recentl y, \nyou may have seen some headlines about a new Fed initiative for real -time payments, a system \nwhich will expedite the actual flow of funds to match the speed with which consumers pay for \nthings using  apps on their phones or other online services . This i nitiative, which might be \nthought of as a high-tech plumbing network for the financial system, is the most substantial \ninnovation in payments in at least 40 years.  \nAnd, of course, there is our r ole in conducting the nation’s monetary policy , where we \nopera te under a directive from the U.S. Congress that is widely known as the Fed’s dual \nmandate: to foster economic conditions that achieve stable prices and a maximum level of \nsustainable employment.  \nThe Fed relies on a substantial foundation of research in su pport of these operations. Th e \neconomists  who study a variety of economic issues include for example , our Oklahoma City \nBranch with particular expertise in the nation’s energy economy. Others are experts in banking, \nfinancial markets  and payments.  \n \nTHE FO UNDATION OF TODAY’S FED  \nAs I list these responsibilities, it is clear that there are many instances where the financial \nsystem has evolved in ways  that Owen and the Fed’s other c ongressional founders could not \nhave predicted.  \nFor example, w hen Congress was  debating the Federal Reserve Act, the gold standard \nwas literally the standard for the world’s most important currencies. That began to change \ninternationally during World War I and  changed  later in the United States. Th us monetary policy , \nas it is admini stered by the FOMC today under the delegation of Congres s, is an area that has \nseen significant change. In addition, t echnology has increased the pa ce of commerce around the \n\n \n4 \n globe . Meanwhile, innovation in financial products and services has fostered with it a \ncorresponding expansion of  risks.  \nIn the same way the authors of the Constitution could not plan for every eventuality, the \nframers of the Federal Reserve Act recognized that they were establishing a framework for a \ncentral bank that would have to  evolve if it would be capable of serving t he public interest.  \nIn terms of structure and governance, there were two main ideas  put forward during the \ndeliberations : On one side were those who supported a decentralized structure under the control \nof the pri vate sector; on the other side were those who believed  that the system should be highly \ncentralized under government control.  \nOwen , however,  believed in what might be considered a third option: He  was among \nthose who supported the idea of a balanced syste m where both sides could share in governance . \nWith a background in rural Oklahoma banking, Owen  had understandably strong opinions about \nthe potential risks associated with a central bank operating  under  Wall Street’s direct control. In \na debate on an earl y proposal that did not advance, Owen  voiced his concern about a system that \nwas “concentrated in any one city where a small clique could control ” it.  \nSuch an arrangement could present a couple of key risks. First, a closely aligned group of \nlike-minded l eaders might not have sufficient perspective for gauging risks since they would \nlikely have similar views.  For example, a group dominated by an East Coast perspective might \nnot have an appreciation for the full diversity of our banking system and the econ omy. No one \nhere needs to be told that the banking  needs of a Wall Street firm and a Tahlequah entrepreneur \nare very different.  \nThanks in part to Robert Owen,  we have a central bank structured in a manner that serves \nour nation well . General oversight of the Federal Reserve is through a government -appointed \n\n \n5 \n Board of Governors in Washington, D.C. The 12 regional Reserve Banks, meanwhile, are \nindependent corporations that, along with their affiliated Branch offices, operate under the \nleadership of a local bo ard of directors.   \nCurrently, two Oklahoman s serve on the Board of Directors  of the Kansas City Fed’s \nhead office . Rose Washington, who some may know from her work as CEO of the Tulsa \nEconomic Development Corporation , currently serves as chair , while  Doug Stussi, with Love’s \nTravel Stops in Oklahoma City, is a director. Meanwhile, Susan Chapman Plumb from here in \nTahlequah is one of seven Oklahomans serving on the Board of our Oklahoma City Branch .  \nIn addition to their oversight roles , these directors are especially important to me in my \nrole representing the Tenth Federal Reserve District in FOMC policy deliberations. Along with \nour advisory councils and ot her local contacts, they are a source of information regarding \nemerging developments in banking and t he economy.  As intended by Robert Owen, t hey are the \ncritical link in ensuring that our nation’s central bank is not an isolated institution but one that \nconsiders the broad economic experience of all Americans . \nThis broad representation across the United  States  provides the regional Reserve Banks  \nwith a degree of protection against a risk that was recognized early in U.S. history by Alexander \nHamilton . That is  the risk that politicians could try to wield undue and dangerous influence over \nthe central bank . \nRobert Owen, a school teacher from Tahlequah, might not have imagined that the \ninstitution he shaped more than 100 years ago, would have proven so durable  amid  the economic \nand polit ical challenges it would face. But I think he would be pleased to see th at the Fed, by \ndesign , has a system that provides a forum for civil d iscourse about monetary policy and other \nimportant central bank issues.  And in my view, it continues to serve our nation well.",

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOctober 6, 2019  \nNational Ass ociation for Business Economics  Annual Meeting  \nDenver, Colorado  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers, or representatives.   \n\n \n \n1 \n Thank you and welco me to Denver  — one of three branch cities in the Tenth Federal \nReserve District , headquartered  in Kansas City . Our Denver Branch  serves Colorado, Wyoming, \nand northern New Mexico  and provides valuable insight into local and regional economic \nconditions thr ough contacts and relationships fostered by our Branch staff and Board of \nDirectors . The Federal Reserve’s founders knew that the long -term success and credibility of the \ninstitution would rely on its ability to serve the diverse interests, geographies, an d industries that \nmake up the U.S. economy. By maintaining close regional relationships throughout our District, \nincluding Colorado, we are able to ensure that a regional perspective can be  represented at policy \nmeetings in Washington , D.C.  \nIn addition  to providing regional economic insights , the B ranch  engages in the \nsupervision and regulation of financial institutions, provides cash services to these institutions, \nand promotes financial education and community development through a variety of programs . \nOur Denver Branch is located just a few blocks from this location, and we hope that you’ll join \nus for a reception at the Branch tomorrow evening.  \nThis afternoon I would like to focus my remarks on how I view the Federal Reserve’s  \ninflation objective in relation to its dual mandate for price stability and maximum employment .1 \nAs I hear from many academics, financial market participants, and central bankers, there appears \nto be considerable angst over the fact that inflation has fallen persistently below t he Fed’s \ninflation objective of 2 percent . It has given rise to increased interest in alternative monetary \npolicy strategies that might better  anchor inflation at 2 percent and is one reason why the Federal \nReserve has embarked on a n unprecedented public review of its monetary policy strategy, tools, \nand communications .  \n                                                 \n1 I would like to thank Kansas City Vice President and Economist George Kahn for his assistance in preparing these \nremarks.  \n\n \n \n2 \n Viewed from the perspective of Main Street , however, stakeholders show little concern \nabout  inflation run ning below the Fed’s target . They see t he U.S. economy is currently in a good \nplace . The unemployment rate is near a 50 -year low, inflation is low and stable, and the economy \nis growing near potential . In the midst of the longest business cycle expansion in history , \ninflation running a few tenths of a percent below 2 percent is , in itself, not a compelling \njustification for providing additional monetary policy accommodation.  \nIn my comments today, I will focus on three issues related to inflation dynamics, \nparticularly as they relate to the Fed’s  price stability mandate . First, wha t explains low i nflation \nin the United States? Second, is low inflation currently a problem? And third, to the extent low \ninflation is a problem, how should the Fed respond?  \n \nWhat Explains Low I nflation in the United States?  \nTo begin, let me discuss some of the factors that may be contribut ing to continued low \ninflation in the United States . As the economic expansion enters its 11th year, questions continue \nto linger whether inflation will eventually accelerate in the midst of an ever more mature \nexpansion .2 While the  dynamics of inflation during this expansion have surprised many \nobservers, including myself, my current outlook for inflation remains fairly benign .  \nThroughout much of this year, lower -than-expected readings on inflation, as measured by \nthe p ersonal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index, have led 12 -month measures of \ninflation to decline relative to last year . PCE inflation currently stands at 1.4 percent as of August \n2019, down from 2.3 percent in August 2018. Core PCE inflation, which st rips out the volatile \nfood and energy components from the consumption basket, also moved lower over the past year. \n                                                 \n2 The National Bureau of Economic Research dates the start of the recovery in June 2009.  \n\n \n \n3 \n Core PCE inflation declined to 1.8 percent at an annual rate in August 2019 from 2.0 percent in \nAugust 2018 .  \nInflation moved lower over the past year despite the unemployment rate edging below 4 \npercent. This recent behavior of inflation suggests to me that factors other than the domestic \nlabor market may be driving inflation . For example, I see global inflationary trends as an \nimportant facto r keeping inflation pressures muted in the United States.  \nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)  adopted  its numerical, longer -run \nobjective of a 2 percent annual change in the PCE price index in 2012 . Since then , this measure \nof U.S. inflation has aver aged about 1.4 percent. However, the United States  is not alone in terms \nof falling  short of its longer -run inflation target. Several other major foreign economies also have \nstruggled  to reach their longer -run inflation objectives, including the euro area and Japan.3 More \nbroadly across the globe, inflation declined throughout the last decade. Among nearly 200  \ncountries in the IMF’s database of international statistics, the share of co untries with inflation \nabove 2 percent has, in recent years, declined to levels last witnessed in the 1960s.4   \nWhile there are certainly some specific challenges shaping inflation in each economy, \nincluding where they stand in their own business cycle, th ese recent patterns suggest some \ncommon forces are likely keeping global inflation trends subdued . First, we’ve witnessed the \nwidespread adoption of inflation targets in advanced and emerging economies. As more central \nbanks pursue policies to keep inflati on low, other countries export less inflation globally . This \nfactor may be at work in the United States recently as import price inflation currently remains \n                                                 \n3 The United Kingdom is one advanced economy  that has recently experienced above target rates of inflation amid a \nrapid and large depreciation of their currency following the Brexit vote.  \n4 The International Monetary Fund’s International Financial Statistics database and Federal Reserve Bank of Kans as \nCity research staff calculations. Of 193 countries  and areas , the share with a 3 -year moving average of inflation \nabove 2 percent declined from 97 percent at the end of 2008 to 51 percent as of the end of 2018 . While the database \ncovers 198 countries  and areas , data on inflation is missing for five of them.  \n\n \n \n4 \n lower than during 2004 -2007  — a  period in which  the unemployment rate also reached its \ncyclical lo w but inflation was running slightly above  2 percent .  \nSecond, changes in commodity price dynamics may have significant consequences for \nglobal inflation. Unlike past decades, the advent of nimble U.S. oil production seems  likely  to \nkeep energy prices in check even amidst oil supply disruptions and shortages . As a result, oil \nprice inflation has been lower in recent years than in the 2004 -2007 period, possibly helping \nexplain why the current low unemployment rate is failing to genera te as much inflation in the \nUnited States  as in past expansions. The global nature of commodity markets suggests that these \ndevelopments are likely to affect inflation outcomes in the United States as well as other \ncountries .  \nAnd third, the e -commerce ind uced disruption to global retail represents a global factor \nwhich may weigh on inflation, although its exact effects are difficult to quantify . Comparing to \nthe 2004 -2007 period, the share of U.S. retail sales accounted for by non -store retailers has \ndoubl ed from around 7 percent to nearly 15 percent. As major retailers compete for global \nmarket share, perhaps at the cost of margins, retail price inflation is likely to remain tame.  \nBeyond these longer -term global trends, the rapidly changing trade environm ent threatens  \nthe rise of global supply chains, and I see the persistent effects from the ongoing trade dispute as \ndisinflationary for the United States. In particular, the uneven effects of the changes in trade \npolicy on our trading partners, coupled with  the safety and security of the U.S. dollar in an era of \nuncertainty, has generally led to a rise in the foreign -exchange value of the dollar against other \ncurrencies. These forces, along with ongoing geopolitical risks, likely further reinforce d the \nstren gth in the U.S. dollar over the past year. As a result, I expect that global disinflationary \ntrends, embodied in low import price inflation, will continue to weigh on U.S. inflation.  \n\n \n \n5 \n In addition to  global factors, domestic factors also are at play . For example, recent \nresearch at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City highlights that, after growing rapidly at \nroughly 7  percent  per year over the 1980 -2004 period, college tuition prices have slowed \nmarkedly, averaging much closer to 2  percent  over the las t few years.5  Other staff analysis \nhighlights that inflation for medical care services, a fairly large and important component of the \npersonal consumption expenditure price index, has also been substantially weaker over the last \ndecade.6  These sector -specific factors, such as changes in state appropriations to higher \neducation or changes to the Medicare reimbursement rates for doctors, are important drivers of \nchanges in the inflation rates for these various components . Given that these idiosyncratic, \nsector-specific factors are unlikely to be directly affected by changes in labor market slack, some \ncomponents of inflation may remain muted even if the overall economy is operating at or near \npotential . Such factors are beyond the reach of monetary policy to  control.  \n \nIs Low Inflation Currently a P roblem?  \nWhile I have suggested a number of reasons why inflation has been low in the United \nStates, should we be concerned that inflation is running persistently a few tenths of a percent \nbelow the F ed’s objective o f 2 percent?  My answer to that question is based partly on my \ninteractions with business and community leaders but, in addition, depends on the broader \neconomic circumstances that coincide with low inflation.  \nAs I listen to business and community leaders  around my region, I hear few complaints \nabout inflation being too low. In fact, I am more likely to hear disbelief when I mention that \n                                                 \n5 Brent Bundick and Emily Pollard , “The Rise and Fal l of College Tuition Inflation ,” Federal Reserve Bank of \nKansas City Economic Review, First Quarter, 2019 .  \n6 Presentation by A. Lee Smith at the BLS Data User’s Conference .  \n\n \n \n6 \n inflation is as low as measured in a number of key sectors. This leads me to the observation that \ninflation as experienc ed by households and businesses is fundamentally different from inflation \nas viewed by many financial market participants and economists. Households see the prices of \neveryday goods such as food, energy, rents, and health care rising and don’t understand w hy the \nFed would be concerned that inflation is too low. Their short -run expectations for inflation are \ndriven largely by changes in retail gasoline prices while their longer -run expectations, as \nmeasured by the University of Michigan, have been fairly sta ble. (Expected changes in prices \nduring the next 5 years have fluctuated between 2.3 and 2.6 percent since April 2 016 and are \ncurrently at 2.4 percent.)  \nBusinesses see their labor and other input costs rising, and with limited pricing power, \nsee their pro fit margins squeezed. For them, the product prices they charge are determined by \nstructural factors such as global competition and technological disruption that don’t necessarily \nrespond to monetary policy, while their costs are driven by tight labor and c ommodity market \nconditions. In the A ugust  survey of small businesses conducted by the National Federation of \nIndependent Business, only 1 percent of respondents said inflation was their single most \nimportant problem, compared with 2 7 percent who said “qual ity of labor” and 9 percent who said \n“cost of labor.”   I would also point out that in the last NABE outlook survey (June 2019), your \noutlook panelists’  median forecast for core PCE price inflation for each quarter of 2020 was 2.0 \npercent at an annual rate  — right at the Fed’s longer -run objective.   \nPhilip Lowe, the governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, summed it up well at our \nJackson Hole symposium when he said “…many people in our communities are incredulous that \nwe would be too worried over whether inflation was 1.6  per cent, 2.0  per cent or 2.2  per cent. \nThey ask, ‘haven’t you got something more important to worry about? ’”  \n\n \n \n7 \n Beyond this view of inflation from Main Street, I also keep in mind the Fed’s dual \nmandate . Unlike some central banks, we are t asked not only  with achieving price stability, but in \naddition, we have a mandate to achieve maximum employment . In circumstances where the \nunemployment rate is high and inflation is low, as was the case throughout much of the recovery \nfrom the Great Reces sion, policymakers typically ease policy to bring both variables in line with \ntheir longer -run objective s. Low inflation can be a symptom of economic slack, and \naccommodative policy tends to reduce unemployment and increase inflation . In these \ncircumstance s, the direction of policy is clear and policymaker consensus is relatively easy to \nachieve.  \nIn other circumstances  — such as we have today  — with both unemployment and \ninflation low relative to their longer -run objectives, the policy response is not so cl ear. On one \nhand, e asing policy might lift inflation, but at the cost of further tightening an already hot labor \nmarket  and perhaps fostering financial imbalances . And given the reduced responsiveness of \ninflation to economic slack, it might take a conside rable dose  of monetary accommodation to \nnudge inflation upward . On the other hand, tightening policy might limit the overheating of labor \nmarkets , but at the cost of putting further downward pressure on inflation.   \nIn these circumstances, where the objectives are not complementary, the FOMC ’s \nStatement on Longer -Run Goals  and Monetary Policy Strategies  lays out the framework of a  \n“balanced approach” in promoting them . In particular, we take into account the magnitude  of the \ndeviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are \nprojected to return to mandate -consistent levels .  \nNot surprisingly, under this balanced approach, there may be disagreement about a \nnumber of the factor s that determine appropriate policy . For example, policymakers may \n\n \n \n8 \n disagree about the amount of slack in labor markets or the relative costs of deviations of inflation \nand unemployment from their objectives . From my perspective, the deviation from our infl ation \nobjective is currently small, but given structural changes in inflation dynamics, trying to quickly \nreturn inflation to 2 percent by adjusting interest rates could require aggressive actions that \nwould misallocate resources and create financial imbal ances.  \nMy dissent at the last two FOMC meetings was based in part on balancing our objectives \nfor price stability and maximum employment . I dissented from the Committee’s  decision to \nlower the target range for the federal funds rate in July and September because the moderation of \neconomic growth in 2019 has been  in line with my own outlook that calls for a gradual decline to \na trend level over the medium term. With moderate growth, record low unemployment, and a \nbenign inflation outlook, maintaining an unch anged setting for policy would have been \nappropriate, in my view . There are certainly risks to the outlook as the economy faces trade \npolicy uncertainty and weaker global activity. Should incoming data point to a broadly weake r \neconomy, adjust ing policy may be appropriate to achieve  the Federal Reserve’s mandates for \nmaximum sustainable employment and stable prices.  \nBut in the absence of more evidence that the downside risks may be realized, muted \ninflation alone would not warrant a policy response . Rather  than focus ing too narrowly  on \nachieving a precise point target of 2 percent inflation , I find it more realistic  to accept that there \nwill be both temporary and persistent fluctuations around this long-run target and, as long as they \ndon’t exceed  a reasonable threshold  — perhaps as big as 50 or even 1 00 basis points  —they \nshould be tolerated, depending on broader economic conditions . Keeping our sights set on low \nand stable inflation  is key , with 2 percent as our North Star  and longer -run inflation o bjective.   \n \n\n \n \n9 \n When is Low Inflation a Concern and What Can Be Done About I t? \nSo when should  we be concerned about low inflation  and what can be done about it ?  As \nI’ve suggested, in current circumstances , concern about low inflation  seems unnecessary . While I \ndo not see a case for deliberately eas ing policy to boost inflation , the Fed’s 2 percent inflation \ntarget also should not be viewed as a ceiling . Rather, it seems reasonable to allow  modest \nunexpected shocks to  inflation  — perhaps stemming from import prices  — to demonstrate to the \npublic a commitment to achieving our inflation goal on a symmetric basis.  \nIn contrast, if conditions change so that the goals of policy are no longer in conflict, \npolicymakers should be prepared to adjust policy as necessary . For example, if weaker global \ndemand and trade policy uncertainty were to materially weaken my modal  outlook for growth , \nproviding additional monetary accommodation  may be warranted . Such a response to changing \neconomic conditions would support both the e conomic expansion and help offset further \ndownward pressure on inflation.  \nWere a more -severe downturn to hit the economy , policymakers are keenly aware that \nlittle policy space remains with the federal funds rate currently at 1¾ to 2  percent . The prospect \nof such a situation  makes  the Fed’s reevaluation of its policy strategies and objectives  a timely \nundertaking . The review has several parts, including a series of Fed Listens events around the \ncountry designed to help policymakers better understand the per spectives of people from diverse \nbackgrounds and with varied interests . In fact, we’ll host such an event in Kansas City  this week .  \nA few months ago , the Chicago Fed h eld a conference that brought together a distinguished \ngroup of academics, financial  market experts , and labor leaders  to share their p erspectives on \nhow the Federal Reserve can best achieve its mandate. Finally, the FOMC , supported by staff \nthroughout the Federal Reserve System, is devoting time at  its regular meetings to assess lessons \n\n \n \n10 \n learned in the aftermath of the Great Recession . Whether or not we ultimately make any changes \nto our framework, this review is essential in my view to the credibility of our decision -making, \nour commitment to transparency, and our collective learning abou t the changing landscape . I \nhope the exercise will become a regular feature of the Committee’s policy framework.   \n \nConclusion  \nIn closing , the U.S. economy is currently in a good place with low inflation, low \nunemployment, and an outlook for continued moder ate growth . In these circumstances, I am not \nconcerned that inflation is running a bit below our objective of 2 percent . Persistently muted \ninflation is the result of a confluence of temporary and structural factors that are not particularly \nresponsive to interest rate adjustments . Therefore, a degree of flexibility in how we interpret our \nprice stability mandate  seems appropriate . Should conditions change, however, and we find \nourselves again  at the zero lower bound, a fundamentally different strategy  may be needed . In \nanticipation of that possibility, now is a good time for a thorough review of policy strategies, \ntools, and communications.",

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOctober 15, 2019  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago Payments Symposium  \nChicago, Ill.  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers, or representatives.   \n\n1 \n I appreciate the o pportunity to join you today  and want to thank Ellen Bromagen  and the \nChicago Fed team for organizing this important conference . I look forward to the insights that \nwill come from this year’s program and its participants.   \nToday’s theme of innovation recognizes that the changing payments landscape is both \nimportant and exciting, as well as unsettling and disruptive . While a  real-time payment \ninfrastructure for retail payments is the nation’s most significant modernization in more than 40 \nyears , other innovations such as digital currencies enabled by technological adv ancements \ncontinue to emerge . Determining what role they might play in safely and effectively serving the \nbroader payments needs of U.S . households and businesses will require careful public policy \nresearch and analysis .  \nIn the case of faster payments, t he Federal Reserve’s recent decision to build and operate \na real -time payment system also followed years of research and analysis, including broad public \nengagement . Beyond their popularity for speed and convenience, faster payments demonstrate \nvalue in yield ing real economic benefits . In particular, individuals and businesses could realize \nmore flexibility to manage their money and to make time -sensitive payments whenever needed . \nThese advantages could result in better cash flow management and efficienci es for small \nbusinesses , and enable some individuals to avoid high -cost borrowing and penalties such as \noverdraft or late fees .  \nGiven these potential economic benefits, the Federal Reserve determined that upgrades to \nthe payments capabilities of both the Federal Reserve and the private sector were important . To \nfacilitate private -sector advancements, the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors  approved in \n2017 access to accounts that would allow settlement between and among banks participating in \nprivate -sector payment systems . At the same time, the Fed eral Reserve  began to assess the F aster \n\n2 \n Payments Task Force’s recommendation, asking it to evaluate what role the Reserve Banks \nmight  play in providing real -time settlement services . This year, the Board announced its \ndecision to operate a real -time payment service alongside the private sector . It also announced \nthat further efforts to support private sector services through exploring expansion of hours for the \nFedwire Funds Service and the National Settle ment Service would follow .  \nRecognizing that time to market is important, the Federal Reserve has committed to \nlaunching this new service, known as FedNow, as soon as possible. Work is underway now to \nengage with industry participants on the initial design  and features of the service .   \nAs financial institutions prepare to connect to this critical infrastructure, some are raising \nquestions about the strategic choices they face . I’d like to address three such questions in my \nremarks today . First, will the pr ivate and public options be interoperable to ensure the systems \nwork togethe r seamlessly and ubiquitously? Second, will the pricing scheme be the same for all \nbanks regardless of their size? Third, how soon will the FedNow Service be operational? Before \naddressing each of those questions, I first want to briefly discuss the Fed eral Reserve ’s history as \na payments provider as context .  \n \nFROM THE BEGINNING  \nAlthough real -time payments represent s a significant evolution in our payments system, it \nis not the first time our payments system has been through a significant transition . History shows \nthat the central bank has worked effectively with the private sector and that the nature of this \npartnership has benefitted the system, its participants and the public.  \nThe Panic of 1907 was a catalyst in the creation of the Federal Reserve . One of the \nhallmarks of th e 1907 financial crisis was a nationwide currency shortage that left businesses \n\n3 \n unable to pay workers and settle accounts . Absent a central bank, a few larg e private institutions \nheld tremendous influence  over the financial system . When these institutions  were either \nunwilling or unable to provide necessary liquidity, local bankers w ould band together and issue \nspecial certificates that effectively functioned  as a privately -issued currency . Creating a central \nbank was intended in part to address what had been referred to as a “famine of currency,” during \nthis crisis . This new central bank, according to Ca rter Glass, one of its congressional founders , \nneeded to  “tear down these tollgates u pon the highways of commerce.”  \nEarly on , the Fed developed a  nationwide par clearance system for checks that ensured \nthat a recipient of a payment received the full value regardless of location . In the 1950s, when \nrising check  volumes and a lack of standardization even in the physical dimensions of checks  \nwere proving problematic to banks, the Fed and the American Bankers Association in \npartnership developed the magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) system.  \nIn the 1970s, the Fed and private sector developed the automated clearinghouse network \n(ACH) to improve efficiency in the handling of many routine and recurring payments, thus \neliminating the need and cost associated with processing paper checks in these instances.  \nDuring the 1990s, the Fed recognized that the internet’s growing role in our economy \nwould prompt a similar evolution in payments, which then were still largely made by check . A \nnational commission headed by Alice Rivlin, vice c hair of the Fed’s Board of Gover nors at the \ntime, explored the future of the Fed’s role in retail payment services . Through a public feedback \nprocess, the commission reached two conclusions . First, the Federal Reserve Banks should \ncontinue to serve as an operator for retail payments . Second, the Fed should work collaboratively \n\n4 \n with the banking industry to improve efficiency and develop strategies for the movement toward \na digital payments environment.1 \nIn the immediate aftermath of 9/11, when some banks sought to limit customer \nwithdrawal s, the Fed assured the public it was open and ready to meet liquidity needs while \nfinding alternative ground transportation  for check transfers . Importantly, the Fed pledged to \nimmediately credit to banks all checks it processed . This promise to honor “flo at” provided a key \nsource of liquidity.  \nIn the months after the 9/11 attacks, the Fed played a key role in promoting greater use of \nelectronic check processing  to eliminate  significant inefficiencies in the payments system . \nCongress ultimately passed legislation, known as Check 21, to support the nationwide \nachievement of this improvement to our payment system .   \nThis historical record shows that having the Federal Reserve as an operator within the \npayments system has yielded public benefits . This reco rd also suggests that participation in real -\ntime settlement services will raise performance and accountability for the FedNow Service and \nothers.  \n \nTHE ROAD TO FEDNOW  \nFrom the Rivlin Commission to the efficiencies gained through Check 21, the Fed eral \nReserve , working with the industry , had already taken the first steps on the road that would lead \nto today’s faster payments supported by real -time settlement infrastructure . Over the past six \nyears , there ha ve been a number of collaborative initiatives between the Federal Reserve and \nindustry stakeholders on strategies for improving the payment system .  \n                                                           \n1 “The Federal Reserve in the Payments Mechanism.” Federal Reserve System. January \n1998. https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/press/general/1998/19980105/19980105.pdf  \n\n5 \n Among these, in  2015, the Federal Reserve convened the Faster Payments Task Force, a \n320-member group comprised of a broad range of industry participants . Its conclusions – that the \nFederal Reserve  should develop a 24x7x365 settlement ser vice to support faster payments  and \nexplore and assess the need for other Federal Reserve operati onal role(s) in faster payments – \naligned with both the outcomes of the Rivlin Commission and the Fed’s longstanding role in \npayments . The United States Treasury shared that view, recommending last year that “the \nFederal Reserve move quickly to facilitate a faster retail payment system, such as through the \ndevelopment of a real -time settlement service, that would also allow for more efficient and \nubiquitous access to innovative payment capabilities.”2 \nThroughout its history, access to Fed payment services, such as check, ACH, and funds \ntransfer services, has facilitated the banking system’s ability to deliver its services with \nnationwide reach . In addition, these services have traditionally operated alongside private -sector \nservices , achieving broad public benefits . Giving the industry choices in payments services, t his \ncompe tition has spurred lower costs, increased efficiencies and better service for users, as noted \nby independent reviews including the Government Accountability Office in 2016 .3 \n \nQUESTIONS  \nWith this historic al context , I’ll turn to each of the three questions I noted earlier : 1) will \nthe private and public options be interoperable to ensure the systems work together seamlessly \n                                                           \n2 U.S. Treasury, “A Financial System That Creates Econo mic Opportunity: Nonbank Financials, Fintech, and  \nInnovation,” (July 2018) at 156.

In a market structure with \nmultiple operators of real -time gross settlement services for faster payments,  the ability to secure \nnationwide access is advanced when customers of a bank participating in one service are able to \nreach the customers of a bank participating in another service . Similar to the efficiencies gained \nthrough the development of a consistent MICR system with checks in the 1950s, and the \nnationwide reach achieved with existing payment services, common standards and rules for \nseamless processing of real-time payment messages  is a desirable feature . But it is one the \nFederal Reserve recognizes may be difficult to achieve, at least early on .  \nAcross the existing payments landscape, services with multiple operators have been able \nto achieve the goal of nationwide reach . Although the approaches differ, they have functioned  \neffectively.  \nOne approach allows the direct exchange of payments between operators, where \npayments originated by a participant of one service could be received by a participant of another \nservice . This situation exists today in the case of the ACH system . The direct exchange of \nmessages between operators would require technical functionality to move the messages and a \nmethod to enable settlement across systems and participants . The level of cooperation between \noperators and complexity increases significan tly with this approach . I don’t consider it an \ninsurmountable challenge, but it could take time to achieve , and thus, it may not be an initial \nelement of the FedNow Service.  \n\n7 \n Another approach to achieving nationwide reach is for financial institutions to participate \nin multiple services that are not interoperable, but where at least one service has achieved \nnationwide reach on its own . Such an approach is used today in the funds transfer system . A \nfinancial institution that participates in multiple services can choose which service to use for \ntransactions, depending on any number of factors, such as fees, functionality, and counterparties \na particular service can reach.  \nAs we engage with the industry, we are exploring these approaches and other potential \npaths to achieving the ultimate goal of nationwide reach for faster payments . We also recognize \nthat the initial approach may change over time as technology, industry practices, and the \nrelationship between real-time gross settlement  services for faster payments evolve . To be sure, \nthe Federal Reserve is committed to exploring with the industry interoperability and other paths \nto achieving ubiquity.  \nA second question that has surfaced relates to how the FedNow service will be priced . As \nnoted in the Federal Register Notice, the Board of Governors will announce the FedNow fee \nstructure and fee schedule before the service is launched . This transparency in pricing will take \ninto account prevailing market practices and can be expected to i nclude a combination of per -\nitem fees, charged to sending and potentially to receiving banks, and fixed participation fees .  \nAs with existing services, the FedNow Service will be subject to the Monetary Control \nAct which requires that aggregate revenues ma tch costs over the long run and requires the Board \nof Governors to adopt pricing principles specifically to avoid unfair competition with the private \nsector . The Federal Reserve follows a transparent process in describing its schedule of fees for \neach serv ice line in an annual notice to the public.  \n \n\n8 \n Because the current private sector service initially  proposed flat -fee pricing , questions \nhave been raised about whether th e Fed will offer the same pricing or a volume -based pricing \nstructure. Implic it in this qu estion is whether one approach is fairer than the other . \nPricing based on volume or bulk is common in many industries . In the context of \npayment services, there are  often large fixed costs . When a service has more volume, it is able to \noffer the service at a lower pric e because the costs are spread out over more transactions . Unlike \nservices provided to a small group of participants with high transaction volumes, Federal \nReserve services are provided to a diverse group of participants that vary in terms of size and \ntransaction volume.  \nIn such circumstances , volume -based pricing helps ensure sufficient use of the service to \nspread costs over greater volumes, yielding lower prices for all participants . Because of these \nbenefits , volume -based pricing has been considered an acceptable pricing strategy, as noted  in \nthe 2016 GAO review . That said , a pricing structure for the FedNow Service has not yet been \ndetermined.  \nFinally, w e have received a number of questions about th e timing and a desire to see the \nnew service delivered quickly . Recognizing that time to market is an important consideration for \nmany industry participants , the Federal Reserve has committed to launching the new FedNow \nService as soon as we can . Efforts are now underway to gather input from industry participants \non the initial design and features of the service . As these  details are finalized, the Board of \nGovernors  will publish a final service description .  \nWhile the initial availability of the FedNow Service is a top priority for the Federal \nReserve , the achievement of true nationwide reach  remains a critical measure of success for \nfaster payments  for any service, including the FedNow Service or a private -sector service . \n\n9 \n Connecting more than 10,000 financial institutions to a faster payment service w ill take some \ntime. For example, by the middle of 2019, banks that had joined the private -sector service \nrepresented less than 1 percent of all U.S. banking institutions .  \nIn addition to moving quickly to deliver the service, we will ensure that industry \nparticipants are prepared to connect to the FedNow Service . Ahead of the service’s availability, \nthe Federal Reserve will be work ing closely with banks and their technology partners to prepare \nfor expeditious onboarding.  \nBeyond the questions related to inte roperability, pricing and time to market, the safety of \nthe payment system is crucial to the nation’s economic growth and financial stability . The \nFederal Reserve has historically played an important role in promoting the safety of the U.S. \npayment system by providing liquidity and operation al continuity in times of crisis . As \nprominence of faster payments in the United States grows, the development of the FedNow \nService will allow the Federal Reserve to retain its ability to provide stability and support t he \nbanking  system and the broader economy .  \nAs operator of the FedNow Service, the Federal Reserve also will be in a position to \npromote the development and implementation of industry -wide standards, as has been the case in \nother payments systems where the  Fed plays an operational role . Given the irrevocable, real -time \nnature of faster payments, the ability to detect and prevent fraud will be a key aspect of ensuring \nsafety of the system.  \n \nCONCLUSION  \nInnovation brings important benefits to our economy . We are seeing faster payments \nservices grow in popularity . An efficient payment system facilitates and encourages economic \n\n10 \n activity by making it faster, cheaper, and more convenient for individuals and businesses to pay \nfor goods and services . Creating real -time settlement services in the U.S. lays a foundation on \nwhich both banks across the country and the broader payment industry can build modern, \ninnovative, and safe faster payment services.  \nThe Federal Reserve has been core to that system for more than a century . In response to \ntoday’s need for real -time settlement services, we are moving quickly to deliver the FedNow \nService . Decisions about interoperability  and pricing  across multiple providers are yet to come, \nbut the Federal Reserve’s h istory points to  a strong public policy focus on objectives for access, \nequity and safety  that will guide the answer to these questions . Importantly, t he FedNow S ervice \nwill support the innovative  solutions available to consumers and businesses today, and many \nmore I anti cipate are yet to be thought of, although they may only be just around the corner.",

            "content": "Inform ing Today’s  Monetary Policy  Choices  \n \n \n \n \n \nRemarks by  \n \nEsther L. George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOctober 18, 2019  \nEnergy and the Economy: Markets in Transition  \nA Joint Conference of the Federal Reserve Banks of Kansas City and Dallas  \nDenver, Colorado  \n \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers or representatives.  \n\n2 \n I’m pleased to welcome you to the fourth  annual energy conference  hosted by the Federal \nReserve Banks of Kansas City and Dallas . Energy is a key sector of  our regional economies . \nTaken together, our two regions account for more than 50 percent of U.S. oil prod uction and an \neven larger share of the headquarters of U.S. exploration and production companies, including \nseveral right here in Denver .  \nThe title and theme of this year’s conference  is “Energy and the Economy: Markets in \nTransition .”  As the title sugge sts, there are several notable transitions that we will consider and \ndiscuss today.  \nWe will look first at the transitions underway as global oil markets calibrate the dynamics \nof rising U.S. production amid signs of slowing global economic growth . The Kan sas City Fed’s \nthird quarter energy survey released last Friday showed that new drilling in our region has \nslowed further and firms anticipate more deterioration in coming months, so we are keeping a \nparticularly watchful eye on the sector at the moment.  \nWe will  also discuss the energy transition occurring in the U.S. power utility sector \ndriven by abundant, inexpensive natural gas and rapid growth in renewable energy generation . \nWithin the Kansas City Federal Reserve District  alone , renewables’ share of e lectric power \ngeneration capacity has grown from less than 10 percent a decade ago to more than 25 percent in \n2019 . At the same time, our region produces more coal  — the primary fuel being replaced in \npower generation  — than any other Federal Reserve District . So understanding more about how \nthis transition is evolving is vital for understanding economic trends across our region.  \nFinally, w e will explore transitions in energy finance, with an eye toward the factors that \nare influencing investment and r isk management within the oil and gas , and the renewable \nenergy industries . Understand ing how transitions in the broader energy sector could affect \n\n3 \n financial institutions both la rge and small across our region  is an important aspect of the Federal \nReserve’ s role as a bank supervisor and regulator.  \nTo help guide us through each of these topics, we have a distinguished set of speakers \nand panelists with considerable expertise and  experience from both the private and public \nsectors . I look forward to their co mments and your participation in discussing these themes.  \n As energy market s experience  transitions , they do so in the context of changing dynamics \nin the broader economy . My remarks today will highlight the challenges that monetary \npolicymakers fac e in reading and understanding these transitions while determin ing the \nappropriate setting for policy to achieve our objectives of maximum employment and price \nstability.  \nBefore I continue, however, I want to note that these are my own views and are not \nintended to represent  the view s of others in the Federal Reserve System.  \n \nTHE U.S. ECONOMIC OU TLOOK  \nLooking across most of our economic measures, the U.S. economy is generally \nperforming well . We are now in the  11th year of the current expansion, and the economy has , by \nmost accounts, achieved full employment and stable prices.  The unemployment rate is currently  \n3.5 percent, which is  the lowest level on record in the past 50 years . And inflation, which \nhistorically h as moved higher as the labor market strengthens, has remained low and stable.  \nWith respect to the overall growth rate of the economy, 2019 has been a transition year . \nAs expected , the pace of economic growth has decelerate d to a level more consistent with the \nlonger -run trend growth rate of the economy following two years of strong growth in 2017 and \n2018 . This transition was expected in part due to the tightness of the labor market . When an \neconomy  approach es its full-employment level, the lack of available workers, particularly skilled \n\n4 \n workers, naturally limits the pace at which business activity can expand . The latest reading from \nthe National Federation of Independent Business es survey confirms this dynamic. The percent of \nsurvey respondents that cited  finding qualified workers as their No. 1  problem hit a 46 -year \nrecord high in July .  \nThe transition from faster growth last year to a more moderate pace in 2019 also is \nrelated to fiscal policy . The economy received a boost to aggregate demand from stimulus in \n2018 in the form of a tax cut to businesses and households in addition to increased government \nspending . This stimulus produce d a transitory boost to growth that was expected to eventually  \nfade in 2019 and 2020.  \nUnder these conditions , we have seen the pace of growth decelerate from a strong annual \nrate near 3 percent toward a pace of growth closer to 2 percent . Looking forward, I expect \ngrowth to slow  a bit further over the medium term as it approaches the economy’ s longer -run \ngrowth rate, which I view  as just under 2 percent.  \nWhile the aggregate economic growth picture has unfolded largely as expected in 2019, \nthere are important developments in play across broad sectors of the economy . A clear \ndichotomy is emerging between the services sector1, which is supported by strong  consumption \ngrowth, and the goods -producing sector, which is facing a range of economic crosscurrents . \nAcross both of these sectors, t he primary driver for economic growth in the U.S. is t he consumer . \nThe strong labor market with high levels of employment and upward pressure on wages has \nprovided the fuel to support solid consumption growth  and contribute to a high  level of consumer \nconfidence . Strong consumer momentum, which is also suppor ted by an overall personal savings \n                                                 \n1 Service -providing industries tied closely to the consumer include education and health services, leisure \nand hospitality, information, finance, and wholesale and retail trade.  \n \n\n5 \n rate that remains at a stable and relatively high level, has been the key underpinning of my \noutlook for continued economic expansion over the medium term.  \nThe goods -producing sector, which includes manufacturing, mining,  energy production \nand construction, has, on the other hand,  faced a range of challenges that has limited its pace of \nexpansion . For example, an expansion of U.S. tariffs on imports, retaliatory tariffs on our exports \nabroad, along with weaker global growth and continued uncertainty surrounding trade policy \nhave  created stiff headwind s for manufacturers . Our manufacturing survey for the region shows \nthat activity has contracted in  each of the past three months , and the national ISM survey  \nindicates that manufacturing activity for the nation also moved into contractionary territory in \nAugust . For the energy sector, oil prices are down about 20 percent from a year ago, contributing \nto a slowing in drilling activity across most oil -producing regions in the country.   And in the \nhousing sector, although  forward -looking indicators have improved recently , rising mortgage \nrates in 2018 and the first half of 2019 coupled with rising housing prices contributed to a \ndecline in home sales and six conse cutive quarters of declining residential investment .  \n So on balance, while the broad economy continues to grow with high levels of \nemployment and low inflation, downside risks are prominent and have strained key parts of the \ngoods -producing sector . This d ichotomy presents a challenge for policymakers as they determine \nthe appropriate stance for monetary policy  under such conditions . \n \nDATA DEPENDENCE VERS US RISK MANAGEMENT  \nAs policymakers confront this challenge, policy choices can become more difficult . \nEasing policy may be viewed as a proactive step to ward off weakness in a particular sector in \nthe attempt to prevent th at weakness from spreading to broader parts of the economy . Another \n\n6 \n approach would be to closely monitor the sectoral weakness, but wait until signs emerge of a \nbroader slowdown in activity before taking action . To better illustrate this challenge , I’ll talk \nabout these  different approaches to policy setting  using two frequently cited descriptions : a data-\ndependen t approach  and a risk-manag ement  approach . I’ll argue that both elements are important \nto monetary policy decisions.  \nFederal Reserve policymakers began using the phrase “data dependent” in 2012 to \ndescribe their approach to policy making . The phrase was intended to convey that polic ymakers \ncould not credibly commit to specific actions at specific dates in the future, but instead, their \nview of the appropriate setting of interest rates would evolve based on new data received . Such \nan approach could be misread as suggesting a “data -dependent” policymaker is solely influenced \nby the most recent data release , basing his or her decision on the arrival of new data  rather than a \nmodal outlook for the economy .  \n“Data-dependent” policy decisions in my view actually encompass a much broader  and \nmulti -faceted  process in which the da ta represent just one element . The foundation for the  \ndecision -making process is  a collection of information  that includes not only incoming data, but \nalso the perspectives from my District contacts . Their anecdote s provide timely information that \nis not likely to  appear in the data for several weeks or months given the inherent delays in \nreporting and revision of data statistics .  \nWith  this information in hand, judg ments are required to determine how t his broad \ninformation updates the  economic outlook for the near and medium term . Given the long and \nvariable lags in the time it takes for monetary policy decisions to transmit to the broader \neconomy, one’s outlook  for key variables such as real GDP growth, the unempl oyment rate, and \ninflation are central to determin ing the appropriate policy action for today . So when I refer to a \n\n7 \n “data -dependent” approach for policymaking, it is this broader approach  that I have in mind  \nrather than a short -term reaction to the most re cent data point . \nA second commonly cited approach to policymaking is “risk management .”  This \napproach is not  necessarily distinct from a “data -dependent” approach . Rather than focusing on \none’s view of the data and the mostly likely, or moda l, view for the outlook, a risk -management \napproach seeks to assess the range of risks  and then determine the policy action that best  \npositions the economy to weather those risks.  \nIn the current context, while one’s modal outlook for the economy may be consistent \nwith the FOMC’s dual mandate, downside risks may represent alternative scenarios with \nundesirable outcomes for econom ic growth and stability . One such current risk is associate d with \nthe ongoing trade policy uncertainty . Key questions relevant for policymaker s as they assess this \nrisk would include: How have developments in trade policy impacted the economy since the start \nof 2018 ? How will trade policy decisions going forward influence the outlook? What role is \ntrade policy uncertainty having on the decisions  of businesses and cons umers? Is monetary \npolicy an effective tool to mitigate risks that may emanate from trade policy uncertainty?  \nAssessment of the range of risks facing the economy, which expand far beyond trade \npolicy uncertainty, along with judg ments  of the possible economic implications should any of \nthose risks transpire, may justify policy action as insurance . In such a circumstance, it may be the \ncase that the overall  economy is growing at an above -trend rate and the modal outlook is in line \nwith our dual mandate objectives . But the emergenc e of downside risks  could be viewed as \nsufficiently threatening to warrant an adjustment in policy while those risks persist.  \nA recent example of  this type of situation occurred  in 2014 and 2015 when the economy  \nfaced several shocks that impacted a few industries at a time while  the overall economy was \n\n8 \n expanding at a solid pace . During this period, the price of oil fell by more than  50 percent, the \ndollar appreciated by  approximately 20  percent, and agricultural commodity prices such as corn \nand soybeans fell by more than  25 percent . These shifts in prices contributed to a downturn in the \nenergy, agricultural, and manufacturing sectors  and represented downside risks for the broader \necono my. \nIn this instance , the FOMC did not choose  to directly provide additional accommodation \nto the economy, but instead communicated a shift in its view of the appropriate path for policy \ngoing forward . Using the median of the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Pro jections (SEP) as a \nreference point, the projection for the appropriate setting of policy at the end of 2016 was \nlowered by nearly a full percentage point from the March 2014 projection to the December 2015 \nprojection . This adjustment provided appropriate support for the broader economy at a time \nwhen some sectors were experiencing weaknes s. And as the impact of those shocks dissipated \nover time, the FOMC  then implemented the projected policy adjustments that had been delayed . \nDuring this period, the broade r economy continued to expand with real GDP growth remaining \nabove trend and average emp loyment growth in excess of 200,000 new jobs per month.  \nOne c hallenge with this type of risk -management approach to policy setting is that while \nthe benefits of taking out insurance may be clear, the costs are not. One potential cost is that such \nan insurance policy risks overheating the sectors of the economy that are already performing \nwell. This can lead to a misallocation of resources toward those  interest rate -sensi tive sectors at \nthe expense of sectors that may be better positioned for  growth over the longer  run. A second \npotential cost stems from the fact that an easing in monetary polic y is designed to encourage \nrisk-taking and leverage . In the earlier periods of an economic expansion, risks associated with \nincreasing leverage may be moderate, and as such the cost of extra insurance may be low . But \n\n9 \n these costs move higher as the economic expansion matures and as levels of corporate debt and \nother vulnerabilities be come elevated.  \n \nMONETARY POLICY  \nTurning to the current monetary policy settings , data dependence and risk management \ncontinue to provide important strategy foundations for policymakers . In 2018, as the economic \nexpansion continued and the unemployment rate  moved b elow most estimates of its long -run \nlevel, the FOMC continued to gradually remove accommodation and the federal funds rate \nmoved cl oser to estimates of its longer -run level . At the start of 2019 with an outlook for \neconomic growth to decelerate tow ard its longer -run trend growth rate, downside risks had \nemerged and the Committee announced that it would be patient as it determined what future \nadjustments would be appropriate . Then at its July and September meetings, the Committee \ntwice lowered the fe deral funds rates, citing implications of global developments for the \neconomic  outlook as well as muted inflation pressures .  \nI dissented from the recent de cisions to ease policy based on my view of the outlook as it \nrelates to the Committee’s objectives f or price stability and maximum employment . From a data -\ndependence perspective, the moderation of economic growth in 2019 has been for the most part \nin line with my outlook , in which I expect growth  to gradually decline toward it s longer -run \ntrend level over the medium term . The combination of record -low unemployment, moderate \ngrowth, and low and stable inflation with an unchanged outlook led me to conclude that an \nunchanged setting for the federal funds target range  remained appropriate.  \nSupporting  an un changed policy rate in recent meetings does not ignore the downside \nrisks facing our economy . The emergence of those key risks to the outlook as early as the fourth \n\n10 \n quarter of 2018 caused me to moderate my expectation that further rate increases were neede d. \nSimilar to the experience from the 2014 -15 period that I described earlier, I shifted downward \nmy view of the appropriate path for policy over the next one to two  years  in light of the \ndownside risks that have emerged over the past year and the implicat ions of those risks for \ncertain sectors  of the economy . I view this as an appropriate adjustment that is consistent with \nboth data -dependent and risk -management strategies.  \nWhile some may view the cost of a reduction in rates as benign given that inflation  \nremains some what below our 2 percent longer -run target, I am mindful that rate reductions are \nintended to boost demand and encourage risk -taking and leverage . The ability of the Federal \nReserve to offset any unintended effects related to financial stabili ty at this stage of the business \ncycle seem s limited . In the most recent Financial Stability Report issued by the Federal Reserve \nBoard in May, assessments for overall vulnerabilities were mostly sanguine . But the report also \nnoted that “elevated business debt, easy lending standards, and strong risk appetite pose a \nvulnerability… that potentially increases the downside risk to broader economic activity.”  As \ncorporate debt continues to rise to high levels with the fastest growth among the riskiest firms, \nthe largest banks also are lowering their loss-absorbing capital levels . I view this combination of \nrisks as potentially costly to employment and growth, especially at this stage of the expansion .  \nLooking forward, I will remain attentive to the incoming data for signs that downside \nrisks to the outlook materialize in a way that meaningfully affects broad economic conditions . \nUnder those circumstances, I would be prepared to adjust monetary policy accordingly.  \n \nCONCLUSION  \n\n11 \n Consumers continue to drive  momentum for economic expansion  in the face of downside \nrisks that over the past year  have slowed activity in several key  sectors . In these circumstances, \nboth data -dependent and risk -management strategies  guide policymakers as they consider \nmonetary poli cy settings . My own outlook for the economy does not call for a mo netary policy \nresponse. While weakness in manufacturing and business investment  is evident , it is not clear \nthat monetary policy is the appropriate tool to offset the risks faced by business es in those sectors  \nwhen weighted against the costs that could be associated with such action . Should downside \nrisks spill over into the broader economy in a way that fundamentally affects the consumer and \nshifts the overall outlook, a monetary policy  response may be required .",

            "content": "Statement by \nEsther George  \nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \non behalf of  \nThe Federal Reserve System  \nbefore the  \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs  \nUnited States Senate  \n \n \nSeptember 25 , 2019  \n \n \n\nChairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown and members of the Committee,  thank you for \nthis opportunity.  \nChair Powell has asked me to speak to you today in my role as the Federal Reserve Bank \nleader responsible for  the Federal Reserve’s payments improvement initiative since its beginning \nand as chair of the Finan cial Services Policy Committee  (FSPC) .  The FSPC oversees the \nprovision of payment services to depository institutions and the United States Treasury  by the 12 \nFederal Reserve Banks.   I am pleased to offer my statement for the record as well as an in depth \nstatement on the role of the Federal Re serve in faster payments and the recently announced \nproposal by the Federal Res erve to support faster payments through the  develop ment of  a new \nservice called the FedNow  Service .    \nSince the Federal Reserve’s founding more than a century ago it  has p rovid ed payment \nand settlement services as part of its core function of promoting an accessible, safe and efficient \npayment system .  Today, the Federal Reserve is continuing this important operational role and \npreparing to support the moderniz ation  of our natio n’s p ayment system with capabilities that \nallow payments to move quickly  through a safe and efficient foundation , on top of which \ninnovation and competition can flourish .  \nThis decision was ma de only after three criteria were met.  \nThe first of these crite ria is that other providers alone cannot be expected to provide the \nservice with reasonable effectiveness, scope and equity .  \nOf notable importance  related to this criteri on is the Federal Reserve’s ability to connect \nto more tha n 10,000 financial institutions.  Through these connections, our  existing  payment \nservices allow banks of every size to serve the needs of thousands of communities across the \nUnited States  with com petitive, fair and transparent access.  Providing comprehen sive \n\n2 \n \nnationwide reach is something that we  believe will present significan t challenges to other \nproviders in the current market landscape.  Coming from a region of the country with a \nsignificant number of small community banks serving rural areas of the ce ntral United States, I \ncan tell you the Board’s decision to provide this new service has been well received.  \nThe second criteri on is that there will be a clear public benefit, including promoting the \nintegrity of the payments system and reducing payments s ystem risk.  \nThe Federal Reserve must continue to play an important role in promoting the safety of \nthe U.S. payment system by providing liquidity and operational continuity in response to \nfinancial turmoil, terrorist attacks, natural disasters and other cr ises.  The FedNow Service will \nallow the Federal Reserve to retain its ability to provide stability and support to the banking \nsystem , as well as promote the development and implementation of industry -wide fraud -\nmitigation  standards.  Development of the service will also enhance safety of the U.S. payment \nsystem by promoting resiliency through redundancy.   \nThe final criteri on is that the Fed be able to fully recover its cost over the long run.  \nThe U.S. payments infrastructu re today includes alternative payment choices and \nproviders.  The Federal Reserve and The Clearing  House today operate competing and \ninteroperable services, which bring important benefits for resiliency and competition.  In all of \nour services , we have bee n able to meet the requirements of the Monetary Control Act for cost \nrecovery that ensures competitive fairness while fulfilling our public policy goals.  We fully \nexpect this will be the case with the FedNow  Service . \nAs was explained in a 2016 GAO study, the Federal Reserve’s role as an operator has \nlong been judged as effective in promoting accessibility, safety, and efficiency for the nation’s \n\n3 \n \npayment system and its customers1, 2  Last summer , the U.S. Treasury recommended that “ the \nFederal Reserve move quickly to facilitate a faster retail payments system.”3   \nWe are engaging now with stakeholders for their input on features of the FedNow Service \nthrough the Federal Regi ster notice issued last month.  \nI am confident that together we can achieve our public policy objectives for broad ly \naccess ible, safe  and efficient faster payments.   \nThank you.  I am happy to respond to  your questions.  \n                                                           \n1 “Federal Reserve’s Competition with Other Providers Benefits Customers, but Additional Reviews Could Increase \nAssurance of Cost Accuracy.”  U.S. Government Accountability Office.

            "content": "For release on delivery  \n2:00 p.m. EDT  \nSeptember 2 6, 2019  \n \n \n \n \nStatement by \nEsther George  \nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \non behalf of  \nThe Federal Reserve System  \nbefore the  \nTask Force on Financial Technology  \nof the  \nCommittee on Financial Services   \nU.S.  House of Representatives  \n \nSeptember 2 6, 2019  \n \n \n\n\n\nChair Lynch , Ranking Member Hill and members of the Task Force on Financial \nTechnology , thank you for this opportunity.  \nChair Powell has asked me to speak to you today in my role as the Federal Reserve Bank \nleader responsible for  the Federal Reserve’s payments improvement initiative since its beginning \nand as chair of the Finan cial Services Policy Committee  (FSPC) .  The FSPC oversees the \nprovision of payment services to depository institutions and the United States Treasury  by the 12 \nFederal Reserve Banks.   I am pleased to offer my statement for the record as well as an in depth \nstatement on the role of the Federal Reserve in faster payments and the recently announced \nproposal by the Federal Reserve to support faster payments.  \nOver the past decade , cell phones and other online capabilities have made it more \nconvenient to send and re ceive payments .  Although the se mobile apps appear to provide for an  \nimmediate transaction, the underlying infrastructure is not designed to immediately  move money \nbetween banks , creating  notable delays between the initiation of a retail payment and its receipt .  \nTo support the demand for real -time payments in the United States and to address this \ngap, l ast month, the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors (Board) announced that the Federal \nReserve Banks would develop a new service called the FedNow  Service .    \nSince its founding more than a century ago, t he Federal Reserve has p rovided payment \nand settlement services as part of its core function of promoting an accessible, safe and efficient \npayment system  for the nation .  Today, the Federal Reserve is continuing this important \noperational role and preparing to support the moderniz ation  of our nation’s p ayment system with \ncapabilities that allow payments to move quickly  through a safe and efficient foundation , on top \nof which innovation and competition can f lourish .  \nThis decision was made only after three established criteria were met.  \n\n2 \n \nThe first of these criteria is that it is a service that other providers alone cannot be \nexpected to provide with reasonable effectiveness, scope and equity .  \nOf notable impo rtance  related to this criteri on is the Federal Reserve’s ability to connect \nto more tha n 10,000 financial institutions.  Through these connections, the Federal Reserve ’s \nexisting  payment services allow banks of every size to serve the needs of thousands of \ncommunities across the United States  with com petitive, fair and transparent access.  Providing \nthis degree of comprehensive nationwide reach is something that we  believe will present \nsignifican t challenges to other providers in the current market landsc ape.  Coming from a region \nof the country with a significant number of small community banks serving rural areas of the \ncentral United States, I can tell you the Board’s decision to provide this new service has been \nwell received.  \nThe second criteri on is that there will be a clear public benefit, including promoting the \nintegrity of the payments system and reducing payments system risk.  \nThe Federal Reserve must continue to play an important role in promoting the safety of \nthe U.S. payment system by providin g liquidity and operational continuity in response to \nfinancial turmoil, terrorist attacks, natural disasters and other crises.  The FedNow Service will \nallow the Federal Reserve to retain its ability to provide stability and support to the banking \nsystem , as well as promote the development and implementation of industry -wide fraud -\nmitigation  standards.  Development of the service will also enhance safety of the U.S. payment \nsystem by promoting resiliency through redundancy.   \nThe final criteri on is that the  Federal Reserve be able to fully recover its cost over the \nlong run.   The U.S. payments infrastructure today includes alternative payment choices and \nproviders.  Today, t he Federal Reserve and The Clearing  House operate competing and \n\n3 \n \ninteroperable services, which bring important benefits for resiliency and competition.  In all of \nour services, we have been able to meet the requirements of the Monetary Control Act for cost \nrecovery that ensures competitive fairness while fulfilling our public policy goals.  In this regard, \neven as we develop the FedNow  Service , the Federal Reserve will continue to explore ways to \nsupport the market’s existing private -sector real -time payment service including through \nexpanded Fedwire Funds Service and Na tional Settlement Service hours as described in the \nrecent Federal Register notice . \nAs was explained in a 2016 GAO study, the  Federal Reserve’s role as an operator has \nlong been judged as effective in promoting accessibility, safety, and efficiency for the  nation’s \npayment system and its customers .1, 2  Last summer , the U.S. Treasury recommended that “ the \nFederal Reserve move quickly to facilitate a faster retail payments system, such as through the \ndevelopment of a real -time settlement service, that would also allow for more efficient and \nubiquitous access to innovative payment capabilities.”3  We are engaging now with stakeholders \nfor their input on features of the FedNow Service through the Federal Register notice issued last \nmonth.   \nFinally , I found it gratifying after the Fed eral Reserve  started the conversation about \nfaster payments in the U .S. and led four years of stakeholder engagement that culminated in the \noverwhelming majority of 400 comments from industry, consumer, and small business \nexpressing  support  for the Fed eral Reserve ’s role as a faster payments provider .   \n                                                           \n1 “Federal Reserve’s Competition with Other Providers Benefits Customers, but Additional Reviews Could Increase \nAssurance of Cost Accuracy.”  U.S. Government Accountability Office.

I am happy to respond to  your questions.  \n\n \n \nFaster Payments and the U.S. Payment System  \nThe U.S. payment system faces a critical juncture in its evolution.  Services to conduct \nfaster payments, which are available via smart phones apps or on our computers, have begun to \nemerge along with the growth of digital commerce.  Faster payments allow individuals and \nbusinesses to send and receive payments within seconds, any time of day, on any day of the year, \nsuch that the receiver can use the funds almost instantl y.  The round -the-clock, real -time nature \nof faster payments offers convenience that is not available with many traditional ways of making \npayments .  In addition, faster payments can yield real economic benefits for individuals and \nbusinesses by providing them with more flexibility to manage their money and allowing them to \nmake time -sensitive payments whenever needed .   \nYet with many of the faster payment services available today, the underlying \ninfrastructure is not designed to immediately move money between banks, creating notable \ndelays between the initiation of a retail payment and its receipt .  These shortcomings limit the \ndegree to which the potential benefits of faster payment services may be widely enjoyed across \nour economy in a safe manner.  Further expansion of the  interbank infrastructure is needed to  \nserve as the foundation for the development of faster payment services that are safe, efficient, \nand broadly accessible to the American public.    \nLast month, the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors  (Board)  announced that the \nFederal Reserve Banks (Reserve Banks) would develop a new service called the FedNowSM \nService to support widespread adoption of faster  payments  in the United States .  The FedNow \nService will provid e the necessary infrastructure, alongside similar services provided by the \nprivate sector, t o connect banks across the country , allowing them to offer innovative faster \npayment services to their customers. \n\n- 2 - \n \nSince its founding, the Federal Reserve has played a key operational role in the nation’s \npayment system by providing interbank payment infrastructure that is available to bank s across \nthe country, regardless of size or location.  This critical r ole, given  by Congress, stems from  the \nFederal Reserve’s unique ability, as the nation’s central bank, to provide interbank settlement \nwithout introduc ing liquidity or credit risks.  In today’s  payment infrastructure, whether in check \nprocessing,  automated clearinghouse (ACH) services, or funds transfers , you will see a     \nFederal Reserve service operating in healthy competition with and in support of similar services \nprovided by the private  sector , all for the benefit of the American public .   \nThe importance of this ro le has been recognized  broadly , with an independent review by \nthe U.S. Government Accountability Office concluding that the Federal Reserve’s provision of \npayment services has benefited the U.S.  payment system and its users.1  It is important to point \nout, however, that Congress did not grant plenary regulatory or supervisory authority over the \nU.S. payment system to the  Federal Reserve , and the Federal Reserve does not have regulatory \nauthority over the pricing set by a private -sector system or to require a private -sector system to \nextend the service to banks of all sizes.  In some other countries, central banks have been \nassigned the  responsibility for regulating p ayment systems.   In the United States, this is not the \ncase.  Thus , the Federal Reserve has historically helped to promote the accessibility, safety, and \nefficiency of the nation’s payment system  and advance innovations through its operational role \nas provider of payment and settlement services.    \n  \n \n                                                           \n1 See U.S. Gov ernmen t Accountability Off ice, GAO -16-614, “Federal Reserve’s Competition with Other Providers \nBenefits Customers, but Additional Reviews Could Increase Assurance of Cost Accuracy” (2016) .  Available at \nhttps://www.gao.gov/products/GAO -16-614. \n \n\n- 3 - \n \n Path to Present  \nLeading up to the recent FedNow Service decision  and announcement  in August , the \nFederal Reserve took several actions to facilitate the advancement of faster payments in the \nUnited States.  In 2013, the Federal Reserve began a collaborative initiative with industry \nstakeholders to foster improvements to the nation’s payment system.  As part of th is initiative, \nthe Federal Reserve convened in 2015 the Faster Payments Task Force (FPTF), comprising a \nwide range of industry stakeholders, to identify and evaluate alternative approaches for \nimplementing safe and ubiquitous faster payment capabilities in the Unit ed States.  \nThe FPTF published in 2017 a set of consensus recommendations focused on actions to \nsupport improvements to the nation’s payment system.2  Among the FPTF’s recommendations \nwere req uests for the Federal Reserve (1 ) to develop a 24x7x365 settleme nt service to support \nfaster payments and ( 2) to explore and assess the need for other Federal Reserve operational \nrole(s) in faster payments.  Subsequently, t he U.S. Department of the Treasury recommended \nthat “the Federal Reserve move quickly to facilita te a faster retail payments system, such as \nthrough the development of a real -time settlement service, that would also allow for more \nefficient and ubiquitous access to innovative payment capabilities.”3 \n                                                           \n2 These recommendations were intended to help achieve the FPTF’s vision of ubiquitous faster payment capabilities \nin the United States that would  allow any end user (that is, an individual or business) to safely, efficiently, and \nseamlessly send a faster payment to any other end user, no matter which banks or payment services they use.  See \nFaster Payments Task Force, “Final Report Part Two: A Call to Action,” (July 2017).  Available at \nhttps://fedpaymentsimprovement.org/ wp-content/uploads/faster -payments -task-force -final-report -part-two.pdf .  \n3 The U.S. Department of the Treasury also noted that “[i]n particular, smaller financial institutions, like community \nbanks and credit unions, should also have the ability to access  the most -innovative technologies and payment \nservices. While Treasury believes that a payment system led by the private sector has the potential to be at the \nforefront of innovation and allow for the most advanced payment system in the world, back -end Fed eral Reserve \npayment services must also be appropriately enhanced to enable innovations.” U.S. Treasury, “A Financial System \nThat Creates Economic Opportunity: Nonbank Financials, Fintech, and Innovation,” (July 2018) at 156.  Available \nat https://home.treasury.gov/sites/default/files/2018 -07/A -Financial -System -that-Creates -Economic -Opportunities ---\nNonbank -Financi.pdf . \n\n- 4 - \n \n The Federal Reserve also has directly supported the development of private -sector real-\ntime gross settlement (RTGS) services for faster payments.  The Board approved in 2017 final \nguidelines for evaluating requests for joint accounts at the Reserve Banks intended to facilitate \nsettlement between and among banks participating in private -sector payment systems for faster \npayments.4  The impetus for allowing broader use of joint accounts was to support these private -\nsector arrangements . \n In November 2018, the Board published a Federal  Register notice (2018 Notice) \nrequesting comment on two potential actions  that could be taken  by the Federal Reserve  \nconsistent with the FPTF recommendations : (1) a service for 24x7x365 real -time interban k \nsettlement of faster payments ; and (2 ) a liquidity management tool that would enable transfers \nbetween accounts held at Reserve Banks on a 24x7x365 basis to support services for real -time \ninterbank settlement of faster payments.   \nThe Board explained that a Federal Reserve  RTGS service for fa ster payments, alongside \nprivate -sector RTGS services, would provide the infrastructure needed to achieve ubiquitous, \nsafe, and efficient faster payments in the United States.  Other parties, such as banks, payment \nprocessors, and providers of payment serv ices, could utilize this platform as a basis for \ninnovation to meet the specific needs of the business es and households they serve .  The Board \nfurther explained that a liquidity management tool, in turn, could help alleviate liquidity \nmanagement issues for  banks engaged in RTGS -based faster payments , notably those utilizing \nsettlement services offered by the private sector .  In particular, such a tool would enable \n                                                           \n4 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Guidelines for Evaluating Joint Account Requests,” (Issued \n2017).  Available at https://www.federalreserve.gov/p aymentsystems/joint_requests.htm .  In 2016, Federal Reserve \nstaff received a request from a private -sector service provider to open a new joint account for that organization’s \nproposed faster payment system.  The use of a joint account at a Reserve Bank to  support settlement mitigates \ncertain risks by reproducing, as closely as possible, the risk -free nature of settlement in central bank money.  \n\n- 5 - \n \n movement of funds between accounts at the Reserve Banks during hours when traditional \npayment and settlement services are currently not open to allow liquidity to be moved, when \nneeded, to an account or accounts used to support real -time settlement of faster payments.  The \n2018 Notice proposed that the tool could be provided by expanding operating hours of current \nFederal Reserve services or through a new service.  \nIn the 2018 Notice, the Board requested comment on the appropriateness of real -time \ngross settlement as the strategic foundation for faster payments in the United States and the \npublic benefits, implications, and challenges of the Federal Reserve taking ei ther, both, or neither \nof the potential actions.  \nConsideration of Comments and Policy As sessment  \nThe Board received over 400 comment letters  representing over 800 entities  in response  \nto the 2018 Notice.  Comments were submitted by a wide variety of stake holders in the U.S. \npayment system,  including community banks,  individuals, consumer organizations, merchants, \nservice providers, private -sector operators, fintech companies, trade organizations, and other \ninterested parties.5  Consistent with the diversity of the payment industry, commenters \nrepresented a broad range  of viewpoints.  \nAlmost all commenters addressed the question of whether the Federal Reserve  should \ndevelop a  real-time interbank settlement s ervice for faster payme nts.  The vast majority  of these \ncommenters , representing nearly every stakeholder segment, supported the Federal Reserve \n                                                           \n5 Overall, banks were the largest group of respondents, with community banks (small and midsize banks) \ncomprising  approximately 60 percent of the total comments —the largest specific segment —and representing \ninstitutions from 34 states.  \n\n- 6 - \n \n taking this action.   In contrast, large banks, some trade organizations, and private -sector \noperators were generally not supportive of  the Federal Reserve developing such a service.6  \nIn reaching its decision to offer the FedNow Service, the Board was informed by these \npublic comments  and the history of the U.S. payment system , in which the Federal Reserve has \nplayed a role since its inception .  In addition, any decision by the Board to offer a new payment \nservice is subject to the factors set out in longstanding Federal Reserve polic y, and the pricing of \nReserve Bank services is subject to the requirements of the Monetary Control Act of 1980 .7  \nSpecifically, in considering new services, the Board assesses three criteria: whether the service is \none that other providers alone cannot be expected to provide with reasonable effectiveness, \nscope, and equity ; whether the service will yield a clear public benefit ; and whether the     \nFederal Reserve will achieve full cost recovery over the long run .8  \nOther Providers Criterion  \n Through this assessment , the Board has concluded that other providers alone cannot be \nexpected to provide an RTGS infrastructure for faster payments with reasonable effectiveness, \nscope, and equity.  So far, only one private -sector RTGS service for faster payments has been \nestablished in the United States.  Due to coordination challenges and the high f ixed costs \nnecessary to develop a new payment and settlement service, this service is expected to re main \nthe sole private -sector RTGS service for faster payments in the United States.   The ability of a \n                                                           \n6 Approximately half of the commenters discussed the liquidity management tool, with almost all supporting the \nFederal Reserve offeri ng such a tool.    \n7 In 1984, the Board established criteria for the consideration of new or enhanced Federal Reserve payment services \nin its policy The Federal Reserve in the Payment System.  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “The \nFederal R eserve in the Payments System,” (Issued 1984; revised 1990).  Available at \nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/pfs_frpaysys.htm . \n8 In addition, the Board performs a competitive impact analysis when considering an operational or legal change to a \nReserve Bank service or price that would have a direct and material adverse effect on the ability of other providers \nof services to compete w ith the Reserve Banks.   \n\n- 7 - \n \n sole private -sector provider to extend  access to a few  thousand banks, let alone the more than \n10,000 diverse banks necessary to achieve true nationwide scope, would be costly and time -\nconsuming given that the existing service has l imited relationships with and connections to these \ninstitutions.  \nIn addition,  the Board concluded that the private -sector operator alone cannot be \nexpected to provide the service with reasonable effectiveness , as viewed through the lens es of \nsafety and efficiency .  From a safety perspective, a sole provider may serve as a single po int of \nfailure in the market for RTGS -based faster payments .  From an efficiency perspective, a market \nwith only a single operator may cause challenges related to competition, innovation, and market \nfragmentation .  According to established economic theory and experience from other markets, a \nsingle service provider not facing competition can yield undesirable outcomes, such as higher \nprices or lower service quality.  Such undesirable outcomes could limit adoption of faster \npayments by end users, which could in turn curtail efficiency benefits to the broader economy.  \nPublic Benefits Criterion  \n The Board also determined that the FedNow  Service will yield a clear public benefit. \nSince its inception, an underlying public  policy rationale for the Federal Reserve’s involvement \nin the payment system has been to provide services in a safe and efficient manner to banks \nnationwide.  Because of this long -standing policy commitment, the Federal Reserve has \nhistorically extended a ccess to banks of all sizes, including smaller banks in rural and remote \nareas of the country.   The Federal Reserve’s  relationships with and  connections to thousands of \nbanks across the country provide a solid foundation for the FedNow Service to facilitat e those \nbanks gaining access to an RTGS infrastructure for faster payments, which would benefit small \nand midsize banks and the communities they serve.   \n\n- 8 - \n \n In a payment system with multiple operators, banks would have a choice whether to join \na single service  or multiple services.  An RTGS infrastructure could, therefore, achieve \nnationwide reach in two main ways, either through interoperability via direct exchange of \npayments between operators, such as in the U.S. ACH system, or through at least one service \nconnecting to virtually all banks, such as in the funds transfer system.  \nThe FedNow  Service would promote payment system safety in multiple ways.  As noted \nby commenters, the Federal Reserve has historically played an important role in promoting the \nsafety  of the U.S. payment system by providing liquidity and operational continuity in response \nto financial turmoil, terrorist attacks, natural disasters, and other crises.  As the prominence of \nfaster payments in the United States grows, the development of the FedNow  Service would allow \nthe Federal Reserve to retain its ability to provide stability and support to the banking system and \nthe broader economy in times of crisis .  In addition, as the operator of the service , the        \nFederal Reserve would be in a position to promote the development and implementation of \nindustry -wide fraud -mitigation standards, which commenters highlighted are especially \nimportant for real -time p ayments .  The development of the service could also enhance the safety \nof the U.S. payment system by promoting resiliency through redundancy.  \nFinally, the FedNow  Service could provide efficiency benefits by serving as a platform \nfor innovation and the dev elopment of end -user services  by the private sector .  In addition, an \nRTGS infrastructure with nationwide reach would make the development of new faster payment \nservices based on real -time settlement more attractive, increasing innovation and competition i n \nthe market for end -user faster payment services.  Such c ompetition could yield efficiency \nbenefits by leading to lower prices and higher service quality.  \n \n\n- 9 - \n \n Cost Recovery Criterion  \nThe Board expects that the FedNow  Service will achieve full recovery of costs over \nthe long run .  The MCA requirement to require cost recovery “over the long run” is not \nassociated with a specific timeframe.  Beginning in 1995, the Board adopted a convention \nof evaluating long -run cost recovery for existing services using a ro lling 10 -year period.  At \nthat time, Federal Reserve  services were in mature states, characterized by widespread \nadoption by banks of all sizes throughout the country, with relatively stable volumes and \ncosts.  At other times, notably as the ACH service wa s evolving, the Board considered long \nrun over an extended time period in order to encourage the adoption of electronic payments \nfor the benefit of the economy.9  \nGiven the time frame necessary to create a broad network of banks  connecting to the \nservice , the Board determined that  a longer time frame for cost recovery is consistent with \nthe intent of the MCA to encourage the adoption of new services that have the potential to \nbring widespread economic benefits to the country.  \nExpanded H ours for Existing S ervices  \nThe second proposed action in the 2018 Notice entailed the exploration of  the expansion \nof operating hours for the Fedwire Funds Service , which is our existing funds transfer service, \nand National Settlement Service  (NSS) hours, which is our servic e that supports private -sector \nnet settlement arrangements, potentially up to 24x7x365, to facilitate liquidity management , \nnotably for users  of private -sector RTGS services.  \n                                                           \n9 ACH began as a Federal Reserve service in the 1970s, prior to the passage of the MCA.  In 1981 , when the pricing \nprinciples were first applied to ACH, the Board recognized that the ACH service was still evolving and allowed fees \nto be set based on mature volume costs rather than current costs for a number of years and only at the end of that \ntime began marking 10 -year cost recovery.  The Board concluded that doing so would result in a more efficient \npayment mechanism and was consi stent with the MCA.  See 46 FR 1343 (Jan uary 6, 1981).     \n\n- 10 - \n \n As described in the 2018 Notice, RTGS -based faster payment services require bank s to \nhave sufficient liquidity positioned in a specified account to perform interbank settl ement at any \ntime, on any day.  Without sufficient liquidity so available to conduct settlement, a faster \npayment cannot be completed in an RTGS -based service where,  by design, interbank settlement \noccurs before final funds can be made available to the receiver.  At present, the Federal Reserve \ndoes not provide a service that would provide a means to position additional liquidity in the \nspecified account  outside stand ard business hours .  In light of these considerations, in its 2018 \nNotice the Board proposed developing a liquidity management tool that could help address these \nneeds  by facilitating transfers to and from other accounts held by participants at Federal Res erve \nBanks . \nIn response to the 2018 Notice, several large banks and other commenters indicated that \nthe proposed tool could help with managing liquidity in the recently established private -sector \nRTGS service for faster payments.  The private -sector RTGS s ervice is supported by funds in a \njoint account at a Reserve Bank, and the proposed liquidity management tool would enable \nmovement of funds between a joint account and banks’ reserve accounts during hours when \nexisting services are not currently open.  Commenters suggested that the Federal Reserve should \nprovide this tool through expansion of operating hours for the Fedwire Funds Service.   \nCommenters also noted that expanded Fedwire Funds Service hours, and relatedly, NSS \nhours, could provide benefits f or a variety of payment activities beyond those related to faster \npayments.  Payment activity supported by expanded hours could include additional settlement \nwindows for the ACH service and wholesale payment activity in global markets.  Because of the \nsystemic importance of the Fedwire Funds Service, in particular, additional risk, operational, and \n\n- 11 - \n \n policy analysis is required for this action, and the draft notice indicates the Federal Reserve’s \nintention to engage actively with the industry to conduct this analysis.   \nThe FedNow  Service  \nAs explained in the August announcement, t he FedNow Service would conduct real -time, \npayment -by-payment, settlement of interbank obligations through debits and credits to banks’ \nbalances in accounts at the Reserve Banks.  Real-time settlement in accounts at the Reserve \nBanks means that settlement occurs without liquidity or credit risks, which enhances the safety \nof these payments.  The FedNow S ervice would incorporate clearing functionality, allowing \nbanks, in the process of settling each payment, to exchange information needed to make debits \nand credits to the accounts of their customers.  The service’s functionality would support banks’ \n(or th eir agents’) provision of end -to-end faster payments to their customers.  \nUltimately, the FedNow Service will provide, alongside similar private -sector services, \ncore infrastructure to promote ubiquitous, safe, and efficient faster payments in the United St ates.  \nIn fact, for all payment systems in our country, no single private -sector provider has ever \nachieved nationwide reach on its own .  With the FedNow Service, banks will now have a choice  \nin providers or could choose to use both a Federal Reserve and p rivate -sector service for back -up \npurposes, as some do today for check, ACH, and wire services.  \nThe Federal Reserve  recognize s that time -to-market is an important consideration \nexpressed by many commenters in response to the 2018 Notice.  Our objective is  to implement \nthe service as soon as practicably possible.  However, th e achievement of true nationwide reach \nover the long term, as opposed to initial availability of a service, is the most important measure \nof success for faster payments.  \n\n- 12 - \n \n At the same ti me as the Board published its decision regarding the new service, the Board \nrequest ed public comment on how the FedNow  Service might be designed to most effectively \nsupport the full set of payment system stakeholders and the functioning of the broader U.S. \npayment system.  In the same notice , the Board also announc ed its intention to explore the \nexpansion of Fedwire Funds Service  and NSS hours, up to 24x7x365, to facilitate liquidity \nmanagement in private -sector real -time gross s ettlement services for faster payments and to \nsupport a wide range of payment activities, beyond those related to faster payments.  \nThe Board’s important decision to approve a new payment service  comes over 40 years \nafter the last service, A CH, was approved for implement ation back in the 1970s .  The decision to \nestablish A CH came at a pivotal moment when the industry was overwhelmed by the volume of \npaper checks, and the new technology at that time allowed for what is essentially an electronic \nversion of paper checks.  Remarkable  new technology enables the Federal Reserve  to support the \nfinancial  sector in offering an ever -growing array of options  24x7 x365  in a safe and efficient \nmanner .  Providing such payment services is very much consistent with our historical role in the \npayment system , one that has helped banks to meet the needs of business and households  in a \ngrowing economy for over a century .",

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWisconsin Bankers Association  \nEconomic Forecast Luncheon  \nMadison, Wis . \nJanuary 9, 2014  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers or representatives.  \n\n \n \n1 \n It is a pleasure to be here today  to discuss my outlook for the U.S. economy, the stance of \nmonetary policy, and key issues facing community bank s. The focus on community banking is \nnot because the Wisconsin Bankers Association invited me here, but because c ommunity banks \nplay a vital role i n supporting economic activity in their local communities .  \n \nEconomic Outlook  \nThe U .S. economy has been recovering steadily over the past few years while facing \nvarious obstacles ranging from fiscal policy issue s to weak global growth.  As we start a new \nyear, t he economic outlook is brighter  with r eal gross domestic  product ( GDP ) show ing steady \ngrowth  over each of the last three quarters. Some of the improvement has been driven by \ntemporary factors, such as inventory accumulation , but if we look past such  transitory issues , the \ndata suggest the growth outlook for 2014 may be among the strongest since the end of the \nrecession.    \nOne simple reason growth should improve is because the initial impact of last year’s \nfiscal policy stance  has eased . The cumulative effect of the  mandated spending cuts and higher \ntaxes, by some estimates , was to lower overall real GDP growth by about 1.5 percentage points . \nGranted, there  will likely be further adjustments  to fiscal policy  to ensure long -term stability , but \nwith the effects from 2013 fading and the recent budget agreement red ucing some  policy \nuncertainty , the growth outlook is more positive .  \nBeyond these fiscal issues , however, and m ore important ly because consumer spending \naccounts for more than two -thirds o f the economy , is the fundamental strengthening in private \ndemand . Better labor market s, stronger household balance sheets,  and income  growth  have \nfostered this improvement . Real disposable income growth and average hourly earnings in the \n\n \n \n2 \n private sector have been trending higher . Employment  growth , too, has been gaining strength , as \nnearly every major sector has higher employment compared to a year ago. In fact, g overnment is \nthe only major sector to have shed jobs over the past year, but even that trend has shown signs of \nreversing. Combined, net job creation is close to  its fastest pace since the end of the crisis.  \nBusinesses also are well -position ed to begin increasing investment in new capital. \nCorporate profits are at record highs , balance sheets are healthy and many firms have the \nresources to make new capital expen ditures and expand capacity. That said, m any businesses  \nhave remained cautious the past few years due to a number of uncertainties that include the \nstrength of the global and U.S. recovery, the impact of regulations and new laws, and concerns \nover the direction of both fiscal and monetary policy. To the extent these uncertainties fade and \nglobal growth strengthens, as it could if Europe continues to recover, business investment is \npoised for growth . \nAccordingly, a bsent an unexpected s hock or a downturn  in global growth  this year , I \nexpect U.S. growth for 2014 to be in the range of 2.5 percent to 3 percent, reflecting the \ncombination of less fiscal drag, hea lthier household balance sheets  and improving labor \nmarkets —one of the better years in some  time.   \nEven as growth projections strengthen , inflation measures remain low . In fact, s ome have \nquestioned whether inflation is too low given the Fed’s inflation target of 2  percent  or whether \nthe United States  could face the risk of deflatio n. I do not share those concerns  because s everal \nspecial factors appear to be weighing on inflation  measures , such as lower -than-usual health care \ncosts, changes in how the price of some financial services are calculated , and low import prices . \nAdditionally , longer -term inflation expectations have remained stable near the 2  percent  goal.  \n \n\n \n \n3 \n  \nMonetary Policy  \nSince 2008, the Federal Reserve has maintained an extraordinary level of monetary \naccommodation to support the economy.  With short -term interest rates nea r zero, the Federal \nOpen Market Committee ( FOMC ) has also used unconventional policy tools such as large -scale \nasset purchases (known as quantitative easing or QE ) to lower longer -term rates and boost asset \nprices.   \nLast month, the FOMC  took its first step  in reducing the pace of asset purch ases referred \nto as QE3 . With the improving outlook and confidence that the gains in the labor market will be \nsustained, the Committee decided in December  to slow the pace of purchases from $85 billion \nper month to $75 b illion —a decision I supported . Although this is a modest step, it is an \nimportant part of the process of moving toward  a more -normal interest rate environment , which I \nview not only as essential but also as a positive development for the economy  and the banking \nindustry . Even so, monetary policy is likely to remain highly accommodative for some time with \nadditional (albeit reduced) asset purchases under the current program and an extended period of \nlow interest rates.  I remain concerned about the  potential costs and consequences of these \nuntested policies.  \n \nSecuring An Effective Regulatory Framework  \nAs the U .S. economy continues its path to full recovery, a vibrant and diverse system of \nbanks with sustainable, long -term prospects is critical to support the health of local and regional \neconomies, and therefore, the national economy. Let me turn now to how the industry is \npositioned to carry out that important  function .  \n\n \n \n4 \n Overall, the health of community banks is good, although it  has not fully recovered to \npre-crisis levels.  Net earnings have been relatively flat since 2012 , but they are at a respectable \nlevel of about  1 percent of assets.  Problem assets are trending down, and  although they are still \nsomewhat elevated, I expect the trend to continue.  Capital ratios also continue  to strengthen . \nWhat concerns me, though, is that the quality of net earnings is not strong. Earnings have \nbeen largely supported by d eclining provisions and reserve releases, which we  know cannot \ncontinue much longer.  At the same time , we’ve seen that the net interest margin, which is the \nprimary source of revenue  for community banks, has lost much of its post -recession  gain and is \nnear a 40 -year low  due to the  low interest rates  and weak loan demand.   \nWith this extreme pressure on net interest margins, b anke rs have expressed concern about \nlower  underwriting standards, l onger  maturities at fixed rates  and increased co mpetition from \nlarger banks that are likely to pull out of  local  markets when the economy improves further.  \nBank supervisors are monitoring these risks for vulnerabilities that will lead to asset quality \nproblems when interest rates start to rise or if there is a downturn in the economy.  Even so, an \nextended period of zero interest rates is not conducive to good banking and encourage s a reach \nfor yield .  \nThe effects of this unfavorable interest rate environment are compounded by the \nregulatory framework.  After two decades of deregulation and misplaced confidence in the ability \nof market discipline to moderate risk exposures , the pendulum has swung in favor of new, \ncomplex regulation.  Congress re sponded to the financial panic and the resulting deep recessio n \nby passing the Dodd -Frank Act, aimed at reducing the systemic risks posed to our economy by \nfirms  that we commonly refer to  as too  big to fail ( TBTF ). It remains unclear whether the new \nregulatory regime will in fact end TBTF and thereby reduce the syste mic risk posed by the \n\n \n \n5 \n largest banks  and the subsidy they enjoy . My own view is that incentives have not changed in a \nway that would achieve the desired outcome of a safer , more competitive financial system.   \nWhat is clear is that while much effort has been directed to implementing the Dodd -Frank \nAct, the competitive and regulatory pressures on the community bank model ha ve only \nworsened . Over the past 30 years, the distribution of banking assets across community, regional \nand large  global banks has moved steadily toward more concentration.  Industry concentration \nhas accelerated over the past 15 years with the 10 largest banking firms increasing their share of \nindustry assets from 44 percent in 1997 to 68 percent in 201 3. Even more s triking, their size has \nalmost tripled as a share of GDP, rising from 24 percent to 68 percent.  With this growing scale, \nthe scope of their activities exp anded as well.  In 1997, these large banking organizations held \nnearly 90 percent of their assets in traditional banking activities . In 2013, traditional banking \naccount ed for just 67 percent  of assets . And the five largest banks designated as posing a \nsystemic risk hold far less equity as a percent of total assets than community banks.  In fact, \nWisconsin  banks alone have capital ratios that are 35 percent higher than these five largest \nbanks.    \nCommunity banks have lost market share to these large players  with a share of industry \nassets half as large as 15 years ago, falling from 35  percent to 17  percent.  Yet, they have \ngenerally retained a business model that we assoc iate with traditional banking: making loans and \ntaking deposits in their local communities. In fact, community banks make more than half of all \nsmall business loa ns and extend credit in thous ands of locales across the country , including rural \nareas . Return on equity may be the bottom line in financial reports, but the foundation for the \ncommunity bank is c ustomer relationships and community economic health.   \n\n \n \n6 \n So as we look toward an improving outlook for 2014, the viability of community banking \nin the current regulatory and monetary policy environment is a relevant consideration  given their \nimportant role in meet ing local credit needs . \nAs a former community ban k examiner, I understand how the increase in regulations and \nrules  translates into higher operating costs and can influence decisions about whether to continue \ncertain business lines.  And, i ronically, this increased regulatory burden and low rate  \nenvironment —all undertaken with good intentions t o address the crisis —are disproportionately \naffecting community banks and accelerating the pace of consolidation trends . \nTo address the regulatory burden  on community banks , a rising chorus is calling for a \ntwo-tiered regulatory system  to better calibrate regulations according to the business model and \nsize of banks.  While  I am sympathetic to the idea of this kind of differentiation  and the desired \nrelief it hopes to offer , I do not think it is the answer.  As we have seen with certain provisions of \nthe Dodd -Frank Act, c alibrating regulations across broad groupings of banks is very difficult and \nthe outcomes  are not always as intended . And  fundamentally , it does not address a more \nthreatening issue to the viability of community banks and the perseverance of a diverse banking \nsystem . That issue is TBTF . We must pursue the essential reform needed to eliminat e TBTF , \nwhich is the cause of the increasingly complex regulatory system confronting community bank s \nand stands in the way of secur ing a financial system that serves —not threatens —the economic \nwell-being of the country.   \nI realize that ending TBTF is not necessarily viewed as a community bank’s biggest \nissue.  In my own region, community bankers will readily acknowledge that TBTF is a serious \nproblem , but their focus understandably is on the competitor across the street which is generally \na government sponsored enterprise , a credit union or another community or regional bank . \n\n \n \n7 \n Others are reluctant to ca ll for reform of these large st banks because they view all banks as part \nof the same industry  and advocate such . Still o thers have become resigned to TBTF as a \npermanent fixture of the global financial system  that cannot be changed  and therefore hinge the \ncommunity bank’s survival prospects on tiered regulation as the most  practical answer to the \nregulatory burden.   \nIn many respects, p olicymakers have already moved toward a bifurcated regulatory \nsystem by resorting to massive and complex rules for TBTF bank s in hopes of smothering their \nsystemic risk.  These rules may temporarily handicap TBTF risks, but I do not believe these \npolicies can solve the problem.  Research suggests that regulatory complexity incentivizes the \nregulated to game the rules (Kane) , while other research finds that simple rules are harder to \nmanipulate and more durable (Haldane).1  \nConsider capital requirements as an example.  Banks with more than $50 billion in assets \nare subject to higher minimum risk -based capital standards than sma ller banks so that they have \na larger cushion of capital given the systemic risk they pose to the economy. Yet when you look \nat the actual amount of capital that they hold relative to their total assets, their capital ratios are \nlower. For example,  the Tie r 1 leverage ratio of the 10 largest bank holding companies is 8 \npercent , which  is significantly lower than the 10.3 percent held by community banks, and even \nlower relative to the 11.2 percent held by Wisconsin community banks.     \nBecause community banks and TBTF banks are inextricably linked by public safety nets, \nI believe it is in the long -term interest of community banks and the health of our economy to rely \n                                                           \n1 Edward Kane, “ Good Intentions and Unintended Evil: The Case Against Selective Credit Allocation ,” Journal of \nMoney, Credit, and Banking, February 1977.

Our existing regulatory framework res ts on sound principles —\na safe, stable  and competitive banking system; equal access to services;  consumer  protection ; and \nthe preventi on of  illegal activities.  To implement these principles, we need rules for banks of all \nsizes that are understandable, enforceable  and equitable.  We also need a supervisory process \nwith appropriate flexibility so examiners can apply experienced judgment and thereby \ndifferentiate the supervisory regime based on the risk profile and business practices of individual \ninstituti ons.  \nIn addition, p olicymakers should consider alternatives that could foster both a safer \nsystem and a simpler regulatory framework.  Such alternatives include strengthening the \nseparati on of  banking and commerce or adopting a modern version of G lass-Steagall.2 \nUnfortunately, these ideas  have been sidetracked as too blunt or overly simplistic.  Such \nreforms would change incentives to take excessive risk and would simplify the largest banking \norganizations , provid ing a stronger foundation for management and boards of directors to govern \ncompliance and risk management . For supervisors , it would improve their ability  to enforce  rules  \nand facilitate orderly resolutions if a large bank fails . Until TBTF and its subsidized advantages \nare adequately addressed, econ omic security remains at risk , and community banks might well \nexpect to lose market share  while continuing to deal with the issue of how future regulatory \nchanges can appropriately be applied to them.  \n \n \n \n                                                           \n2 For a proposal for a modern version of Glass -Steagall, see Thomas M.

The \nbanking industry  is stronger and better able  to serv e the nation’s credit needs.

In the near -term, timely s hifts in \nmonetary policy a nd better calibration of regulatory requirements  may offer potential relief to \nsmaller banks . Ultimately, though, ending TBTF and its related advantages wi ll serve to enhance \nthe viability of community banks  and restore public confidence.  I am hopeful that policymakers \nwill continue to vigorously pursue this important objective.",

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNinth BCBS -FSI High -Level Meeting for Africa on  \n“Strengthening Financial Sector Supervision and Current Regulatory Priorities”  \nCape Town, South Africa  \nJanuary 31, 2014  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers or represent atives.  \n\n1 \n  \nI am very pleased to be here today . This meeting provides an excellent opportunity to \nhear what others are doing to strengthen their supervisory systems , including those here in \nAfrica . It also provides a n important venue for turning our attention to the long -run implications \nof polic ies and w hat we can do to create a more -resilient financial system.   \nFinancial supervisors and regulators are clearly facing unique challenges in the aftermath \nof the financial crisis.  In the Unite d States , financial institutions are stronger , although they still \nhave not recovered fully from the problems they experienced during the crisis. Demand for credit \nhas been relatively anemic during the domestic and global econom ic recover y, hindering efforts \nby these institutions to restore their lending busine ss and other activities to more -normal levels.  \nAs supervisors, we face the additional challenge of implementing the many new laws and \nreforms that our countries have instituted in response to the  crisis and to enhance  financial \nstability.   \nThere is another challenge  that threatens to undermine our best supervisory efforts and \ncould set the stage for instability  if it is not addressed appropriately and in a timely manner . This \nchallenge comes from the continued reliance on highly accommodative and unconventional \nmonetary policies and the incentives such policies provide to pursue riskier banking and \ninvestment strategies.  These policies have the effect of dampening the profitability of traditional \nbanking activities, thus encouraging ban kers and other market participants to look for greater \nreturns in other, riskier  areas . \nToday, I will focus my remarks on  the risks that current U.S. monetary policy poses to \nfinancial stability  and the challenges it  creates for supervisors . Then I will explore what steps \nsupervisors  might take to address these threats.  \n \n\n2 \n Current Monetary Policy and the Financial Implications  \nIn response to the financi al crisis, the Federal Reserve and other central banking \nauthorities significantly lowered their policy rates during the financial crisis and have continued \nto hold these rates near zero. In some countries, these highly accommodative monetary policies \nhave been supplemented by quantitat ive easing programs, expanded  central bank lending \nauthority  and forward guidance statements committing central banks to hold rates low well into \nthe future.  \nIn the United States, the Federal Open Market Committee has held the federal funds rate \nin a 0 to ¼ percent range since December 2008. Furthermore, the Committee’s forward guidance  \nstates that it anticipate s maintaining these rates “well past the time that the unemployment rate \ndrops below 6 1/2 percent, especially if projected inflation continues to r un below the \nCommittee’s 2 percent longer -run goal.”    \nTo provide additional monetary stimulus, the Federal Reserve has also implemented three \nquantitative easing programs, involving extensive  purchases of long -term U. S. Treasury \nsecurities and mortgage -backed securities issued by go vernment sponsored enterprises.  These \nefforts began in late 2008. Since September 2012, the Fed has been buying $40 billion in \nmortgage -backed securities every month and about $45 billion in long -term Treasuries —a policy \nthat the FOMC announced last month would be tapered back by $5 billion less in each category \nper month. This week the FOMC committed to another $5 billion reduction in each of these \ncategories. As shown in Chart 1, t hese quantitative easing programs have led to substantial  \nexpan sion in  the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet —from around $800 billion in late 2008 to more \nthan $4 trillion currently —and much of its traditional asset holdings have been replaced with \nlonger-term Treasury and mortgage -backed securities . \n\n3 \n The FOMC continue s to support  current levels of monetary accommodation as desirable \nand necessary as long as the growth in GDP and employment is slow and inflation remains low.  \nAlthough the benefits of the current policy settings are presumed to outweigh potential costs, this \ntradeoff is not well understood . Accordingly , I remai n concerned that continuation of these \npolicies could have significant long -term costs.  \nThe costs of accommodative policies , moreover, may not be confined to just the countri es \nwith expansive policies. Such  policies can influence other countries by distorting their exchange \nrates and balance of payment positions, capital flows and rates of credit expansion.  \nAs a former bank supervisor, I also am concerned about the effects of  current monetary \naccommodation on the banking industry and financial stability. Simply put, hold ing the price of \ncredit at near zero rates for years can negatively impact  institutions whose primary business is \nmaking loans. As central banks undertake unprecedented actions to alter rates and prices in \nfinancial markets , we should not be surprised to find unintended , negative  side effects.  \nZero interest rate and quantitative easing policies clearly limit the returns that bankers \ncan achieve in their traditional lending and investment activ ities, thus affecting the profitability \nof what we would view as essential banking activities. Beyond this, the forward guidance of \ncentral banks provides little assurance to bankers that this lending environment will improve —an \noutcome that is further com pounded by modest economic growth and a more -limited pool of \ncreditworthy borrowers for banks.  \nIn addition, bankers face a great deal of uncertainty. Monetary policy has taken us far \nfrom a normal financial environment, and the influence that accommodative policy and \nquantitative easing will ultimately have on longer -term rates and inflation expectations is \nunclear. Similar ly, some bankers are uncertain about how much of the surge in deposits produced \n\n4 \n by accommodative monetary policies can be retained by their banks  once interest rates and the \ncompetition for funds increase  (See Chart 2) .      \nAs supervisors, we can conclude  that this uncertainty and reduced p rofitability in \ntraditional banking activities can provide a nearly irresistible incentive to expand into \nnontraditional and higher -risk activities. Bankers are also likely to  “chase yields” by increasing \ntheir credit an d interest rate exposures and by increasing their own leverage.  There are signs that \nsuggest we are already on this path —a path that is likely  to become even more popular and \nenticing as financial competition increase s and memories from the fears and threa ts of the \nfinancial crisis  continue to fade . \nBank net interest margins are already near historic lows  as loan rates remain compressed \nand traditional banking activities no longer generate the profits they once did  (See Chart 3) . As a \nresult, low interest rate policies may have the adverse effect of impeding  traditional bank lending  \nchannels  and reducing the availability of funds for business expansion . It should be no surprise \nthat bankers supply less credit when the returns are so low —an outcome that keep s the economy \nwell below its potential and , hence,  more vulnerable to possible shocks.   \nSeveral measures point to the banking industry taking on added risk in an attempt to \nrestore profitability. While overall lending growth has been slow, the gr eatest growth appears to \nbe taking place in higher -risk categories, including oil and gas lending and leveraged lending  \n(See Chart 4) . Much of the recent growth in leveraged lending, moreover, is characterized by \nweaker underwriting standards, including hi gher debt ratios and fewer covenant protections.  This \ndeterioration in credit standards may not yet be a serious concern, but it is reasonable to assume \nthat lenders will be even more aggressive in  relax ing their terms as they seek more business  and \nattemp t to counter a prolonged low rate environment . \n\n5 \n In addition, m ore interest rate risk may be building up in the banking industry as bankers \nrespond to incentives  to move out along the yield curve to generate earnings. In this regard, there \nare signs that a rising number of banks are increasing their holdings of longer -term securities and \nloans —all at a time when long -term rates may rise as economic growth strength ens (See Chart \n5).     \nA final outcome of unconventional monetary policy and the incentives created by low \nrates could be a repeat of some of the liquidity and asset bubble problems experienced during \nthis crisis. For instance, “borrow short and lend long”  strategies are likely to be an outgrowth of \nthe current environment and could eventually lead to another round of liquidity problems. Also, \nwhile it is hard to identify asset bubbles with much certainty or timeliness , we have already seen \nrapid increases in farmland prices and stock prices in the United States  (See Chart 6) .  \n \nWhat Can Supervisors Do?  \nEven as we see improvements in our financial markets, the se concerns suggest \nsupervisors still face key challenges and must  give serious thought to how such challenges  might \nbe addressed . Relative to the highly accommodative and unconventional mone tary policy \nsettings in the United States , initial steps have been taken to slow the pace of asset purchases. I \nview this as a modest but positive step, allowing financial markets to better price risk and \nallocate credit  and to provide the proper incentives for conducting traditional banking services. \nHowever, until policy normalizes , supervisors must deal with whatever risks might arise.   \nSome would argue  that rece nt financial reforms have left supervisors with a better set of \ntools to address  the type of liquidity, capital  and asset bubble problems recently encountered.   \nConsiderable effort has been made to create  a new system of macroprudential supervision, \n\n6 \n countercyclical capital standards, liquidity requirements, stress tests  and enhanced supervision of \nsystemically important institutions. These approaches require careful quantification and \nmeasurements of risk, massive data se ts, forward -looking assessment s and more model -driven \napproaches. As we gain further experience with these tools, they may indeed provide additional \ninsights into financial markets and their vulnerabilities.  \nIn implementing this new framework, though, there are a number of inherent pro blems  \nand challenges . When is the right time to impose countercyclical capital buffers? Will policy and \ninformation lags and the time that must be given for institutions to raise capital mean that  such \nactions will be delayed until they are no longer usefu l or are even counterproductive? A similar \nset of concerns surround s stress testing. What are the right scenarios , and are all key risks \nincorporated into the tests?  \nWe should also note that a number of central banks did engage in a form of \nmacroprudential  supervision before the crisis through their Financial Stability Reports. Overall, \nthese reports show  that potential risks were  identified  before the crisis , but it was far  more \ndifficult for central banks to judge whether these risks w ould be fully realiz ed and to then pursue  \ncorrective supervisory action in an effective and timely manner.  Consequently, while we \ncontinue to experiment with macroprudential supervision,  we must place primary emphasis on a \nmore traditional set of supervisory responses.  \nWhat steps should we be taking now in our role as supervisors? First, given that it will be \ndifficult to identify and quickly respond to the risks emerging under current monetary policies, I \nwould argue for continuing to strengthen bank capital through hig her leverage ratios. Our \nexperience in the recent financial crisis provides strong evidence that risk -based capital standards \nmay fail to capture actual risk levels and can further be exploited by bankers.  \n\n7 \n As shown in Chart 7, the ratio of risk -weighted as sets to total assets among large U .S. \nbanking organizations  steadily declined before the crisis . While this chart might imply that these \norganizations were shifting toward safer assets , the resulting losses from the crisis certainly did \nnot correspond to lower levels  of risk on their balance sheets . \nGiven the apparent shortcomings in risk -based capital standards,  stronger leverage ratios \nare the simplest and most direct way to ensure adequate capital in banks . Consequently , as \nquickly as possible, we should move toward higher leverage ratios and set these ratios at levels \nthat will provide enough  capital in a  broad range of adverse economic scenarios . \nSecond, we should take a careful look at what we allow banks to do . In parti cular, we \nshould think about  how we can encourage traditional activities and the risks that are most \nconsistent with public safety nets . One approach  we are taking  in the United States is to restrict \nthe pr oprietary trading activities of bank ing organizati ons through the Volcker Rule. These \nrestrictions have not been easy to design, but they offer a way to limit the incentives for certain \nriskier activities that may seem attractive , especially now,  to improve profitability . \nA final point on strengthening su pervision is that we must continue to emphasize \nmicroprudential supervision and the important role that bank examiners play. It seems  clear that \nmany factors behind the recent financial crisis might have been detected through traditional \nexamination and supervisory processes if properly supported and performed correctly.  \nFor example , lax lending standards, risky fund ing strategies, poor governance and overly \noptimistic risk -management strategies all played key  roles in the crisis. Each of these is a factor \nthat experienced examiners have the best chance of identifying at an early, remedial stage  and \nthen pursuing corrective action and improved  bank risk -management practices . In contrast, these  \nrisks and wea knesses may be difficult to estimate  until much later and are thus likely to  escape \n\n8 \n timely detection if we rely primarily on purely quantitative approaches and other elements of \nmacroprudential supervision.  \nTo the extent similar weaknesses emerge  as an out grow th of current monetary polic ies \nand risk appetites , strong examination processes are a critical element in flagging such risks  at \nthe firm level.  However, limiting the conditions or incentives for risk -taking and their broader \neffect s on financial stability  must be recognized as beyond the scope of supervision  \n \nConcluding Comments  \n Supervisors face a number of challenges associated with implementing new rules and \nreforms, but they must also remain attentive to the incentives for risk -taking in an unusually low \nand prolon ged interest rate environment. The incentives to reach for yield and boost profitability \npose particular challenges for supervisors and could introduce undesirable and destabilizing \nconditions.   \nAlthough recent financia l reforms have given  supervisors a broad  range of new tools, \nconsiderable value remains to affect supervisory outcomes through  the microprudential tools we \nalready have. Key steps we can and should take include imposing stronger leverage \nrequirements , focus ing banking activities on traditional c redit intermediation functions , and \nusing experienced and skilled examiners to apply informed judgments in the identif ication of \nemerging risks and unsound banking strategies.  \n         \n \n\n FEDERAL  RESERVE  BANK of KANSAS  CITY \n0.00.51.01.52.02.53.03.54.04.5\nTraditional Security Holdings Mortgage-Backed Securities Purchases\nLong Term Treasury Purchases Lending to Financial Institutions and Credit MarketsRapid Expansion in the Federal Reserve \nBalance Sheet  \nBear Stearns Failure  QE1 QE2 $ Trillions  \nSource:  Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland – Credit Easing Policy Tool  QE3 Chart 1  \n\n FEDERAL  RESERVE  BANK of KANSAS  CITY \nBank Deposits Have Surged Since the Crisis * \n7.30  \n0.01.02.03.04.05.06.07.08.0$ Trillions  \n* Excludes Time Deposits  \nSource:  Reports of Condition and Income  Chart 2  \n\n FEDERAL  RESERVE  BANK of KANSAS  CITY \n3.20%  \n3.0%3.2%3.4%3.6%3.8%4.0%4.2%4.4%% of Average Earning Assets  Bank Net Interest Margins Have Declined  \nNotes: Net interest margin is measured as interest income net of interest expense (YTD), as a percentage of average earning a ssets - annualized.   \nSource: Reports of Condition and Income  Chart 3  \n\n FEDERAL  RESERVE  BANK of KANSAS  CITY \nLeveraged Loan Issuance Surpasses  \n2007 Peak  \nSource:  S&P Capital IQ/LCD  Chart 4  \nPro Rata  \nInstitutional  \n\n FEDERAL  RESERVE  BANK of KANSAS  CITY \n2005  \n2005  2006  \n2006  2007  \n2007  2008  \n2008  2009  \n2009  2010  \n2010  2011  \n2011  2012  \n2012  Sep-13 \nSep-13 \n0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%\nUnder 3 Years Over 3 YearsIncreased Holdings of Longer -Term \nSecurities & Loans  \n(Commercial Banks Under $50 Billion)  \nSource:  Reports of Condition and Income  % of Total Securities & Loans  \n48%  63%  \n52%  \n37%  Chart 5  \n\n FEDERAL  RESERVE  BANK of KANSAS  CITY \n18.7%  \n-5%0%5%10%15%20%25%30%\n2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013Annual Percentage Increase in Midwest \nFarmland Values  \n% Change From Previous Year  \n* Non -irrigated Farmland  \nSource: Kansas City Federal Reserve’s quarterly Survey of Agricultural Credit Conditions  Chart 6  \n\n FEDERAL  RESERVE  BANK of KANSAS  CITY \n59.5%  \n50%55%60%65%70%75%80%Risk-Weighted Assets at the Ten Largest \nU.S. BHCs  \nNotes: Depending on the year, the chart excludes MetLife and foreign BHCs.  \nSource: Reports of Condition and Income  Chart 7  \n% of Total Assets",

            "content": "Structure  Matters:  The Decentralized  Federal  Reserve  \n \n \n \nEsther L. George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Exchequer Club  \nWashington, D.C.  \nMay 21, 2014  \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those  of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers or representatives . \n\n1 \n An “End the Fed” demonstration  took place  outside  my office  last Saturday  on Main  \nStreet  in Kansas  City,  Missouri.  It was a reminder  that democracy  demands  accountability  from  \nits most  powerful  institutions  to its citizens.  The Federal  Reserve  is no exception.  \nIn my role as president  of a regional  Reserve  Bank, I am well aware  of the range  of views  \non the topic  of Federal  Reserve  accountability.  I’d like to share  with you some  comments  I read \nrecently.  For example,  one commentator  wrote  that even  if the central  bank’s “power  would  \nremain  in the hands  of the wisest,  the most  honorable,  and the most  disinterested”  leaders,  “it \nwould  not be possible  to satisfy  the people  throughout  the country  that the vast resources  and \npowers  of the bank  were  used only for the best interests  of all the people  and without  partiality  or \nfavor  to any section  of the country,  or to any class  or set of people....”1 When  it comes  to the \nnation’ s financial  matters,  someone  else noted  that authority  should  not be “concentrated  in one \ncity where  a small  clique  could  control  the system.”2  \n Yet another  comment  stated  that, “The business  resources  of the United  States...cannot  be \ncentralized . ...By  reason  of the great  expanse  of the country  and the diversity  of business  \nconditions  in the different  sections  of the country,  the details  of the business  of a central  bank  \ncould  not be managed  at a central  office.”3 Finally,  the desire  for local  control  was highlighted  in \nthis comment:  “No centralized  power  could  dominate  an organism  whose  life is drawn  from  \nfunctions  local to each community.”4  \n The sentiments  behind  these  words—concerns  about  power  and the conc entration  of \nfinancial  resources —ring true, but they are not in fact comments  on the recent  financial  crisis.  \nThis commentary  offers  a flavor  of the robust  and contentious  public  debate  that preceded  the \n                                                 \n1 Victor  Morawetz,  The Banking  and Currency  Problem  in the United  States . 1909  \n2 Robert  Owen.  The Federal  Reserve  Act. 1919.  \n3 “Doubts  Money  Plan.” The New York  Times . December  3, 1911.  \n4 Pamphlet  produced  by the Nationa l Citizens  League,  circa  1912 . \n\n2 \n signing  of the Federal  Reserve  Act in 1913.  It is striking  to me how familiar  those  words  are \ntoday.  It was this public sentiment  about  the country’ s economic  future  under  a central  bank  that \ninfluenced  Congress  to shape  the institution  in a way that would  garner  the trust and confidence  \nof the American  public. The result  was a decentralized  structure  that exists  today  with locations  \nacross  the country  operating  under  a rigorous  system  of checks  and balances.  \n  As a career  Federal  Reserve  employee,  bank  supervisor  and lifelong  Missourian,  I \nunderstand  the importance  of having  a central  bank  that is accountable  to the public.  In fact, as \nan official  with input  to national  policy  who lives  and works  in the center  of the United  States,  \nmy role is not happenstance , but rather  it is a deliberate  choice  on the part of the Federal  \nReserve’ s congressional  founders  that reflects  their intentions  for the structure  of the nation’s \ncentral  bank.  It is my view  that the Federal  Reserve’ s ability  to achieve  its broad  objectives  over \nthe past century  has been  possible  because  of its decentralized  structure.  The key role that the \nFederal  Reserve’ s structure  plays  in achieving  its mandates  is the focus  of my comments  today.  \n \nStructure  enhances  public  trust  \nThe Federal  Reserve  Act established  a framework  for the nation’s central  bank  that \ndeparted  materially  from  that of the First and Second  Banks  of the United  States.  Congress  \nrightly  understood  that the monolithic  structure  of these  first two centr al banks  was ill-suited  to \nrepresent  and serve  the diverse  interests,  geographies  and industries  that make  up the U.S. \neconomy.  The central  bank’s founders  understood  that the long-term success  and credibility  of \nthe institution  would  rely on its ability  to gain support  outside  the Washington -New  York  \ncorridor  of political  and financial  interests.   \n\n3 \n  To ensure  public  accountability,  the Federal  Reserve  Act called  for a government  \nagency—the Board  of Governors  in Washington,  D.C.—comp osed of individuals  who are \nnominated  by the president  and confirmed  by the Senate  to serve  14-year terms.  The Board  of \nGovernors  plays  an important  public  oversight  role for the entire  system,  without  which  a \nmeaningful  role for the quasi -governmental  regional  Reserve  Banks  would  not likely  be \nacceptable  to the public.  However,  to ensure  there  was appropriate  balance  and representation,  \nthe Act also called  for between  eight  and 12 Reserve  Banks  to be located  across the country.  A \ncommittee  of cabinet  members  took several  months  to arrive  at its decision  to name  the 12 \nFederal  Reserve  cities  that would  serve  as the regional  arms  of the nation’s central  bank.   \nOne hundred  years  ago this week,  on May 18, 1914,  a delegation  signed  paperwork  to \nincorporate  the Federal  Reserve  Bank  of Kansas  City.  Similar  meetings  were  held that spring  in \n11 other  cities,  and the Fede ral Reserve  System  began  operations  on Nov.  16, 1914.   \n Each  Reserve  Bank  is overseen  by a local  Board  of Directors  composed  of community  \nand business  leaders  from  diverse  sectors  across  each of the 12 regions.  These  directors  share  \ngovernance  responsibili ty for Reserve  Bank  operations  along  with the Board  of Governors.  \n In addition  to Reserve  Bank  boards,  individuals  serve  as directors  on the boards  at 24 \nFederal  Reserve  branch  offices.  All told, some  270 individuals  across  the country  serve  as \nFederal  Reserve directors,  providing  real-time economic  information  for the Federal  Reserve  to \nconsider  in its policy  formulation.  In addition,  through  their experiences  as leaders  in business,  \nand in the labor,  consumer,  banking  and agriculture  sectors , directors  offer an independent  \nperspective  on Reserve  Bank  operations,  budgetary  issues  and other  strategic  challenges.   \n  \n \n\n4 \n Structure  improves  operational  effectiveness  \n Over  the past century,  the Federal  Reserve’s local  connections  have  proven  to be valuable  \nin carrying  out its responsibilities.  Whether  responding  to a crisis,  delivering  financial  services,  \nor supervising  banks,  the deep  understanding  of regional  interests  has facilitated  effective  \noperational  performance.   \n Importantly,  the Reserve  Banks  are designed  to understand  credit  availability  issues  at the \nlocal  level.  You need  not go back  to 1913  to find an example  that underscores  this. As financial  \nmarkets  seized  up during  the most  recent  crisis,  the Board  of Governors  and the Federal  Reserve  \nBank  of New York  focused  their efforts  and resources  on designing  liquidity  facilities  to ease \nfinancial  conditions.  Even  as resources  were  dedicated  to pulling  Wall  Street  out of the depths  of \nthe financial  panic,  problems  developed  in other  parts  of the country  that needed  to be addressed,  \nincluding  in the Kansas  City Fed’s region.  \nAmong  the roles  served  by the regional  reserve  banks  is the statutory  responsibility  to act \nas a “lender  of last resort”  to depository  institutions  in the region.  Specifically,  the Fede ral \nReserve  is charged  with lending  against  collateral  to solvent  institutions,  making  its role as a \nbank  supervisor  complementary  to the ability  to confirm  eligibility  to borrow  on short  notice.  In \nthe case of the Kansas  City Fed, serving  as a lender  of last resort  across  its seven -state region  \nmeans  leveraging  relationships  and access  to information  on thousands  of institutions.  This \ninformation  is a particularly  critical  resource  during  crisis  situations.  During  the crisis  of 2008,  \nthe monthly  volume  of discount  window  borrowing  from  the Federal  Reserve  spiked  from  less \nthan $1 billion  pre-crisis  to a high of more  than $400  billion.5  \n                                                 \n5 See http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/DISCBORR .  \n\n5 \n As funding  from  Wall  Street  dried  up in 2009,  the effects  rippled  across  the country.  In \nmy district,  a sizable  and health y financial  services  firm lost access  to its line of credit  from  a \nlarge  Wall  Street  bank.  While  this regional  institution  would  not be considered  systemically  \nimportant  by today’s regulatory  definition,  it certainly  played  an important  role in the economy  \nof its own Midwestern  community.  \nStaff at the Federal  Reserve  Bank  of Kansas  City worked  closely  with the Board  of \nGovernors ’ staff to consider  the firm’ s qualifications  to gain timely  access  to funding  and avoid  \nfailure.  The firm survived  the crisis  because the local  Reserve  Bank  was familiar  with the \ninstitution  and was able to connect  it with programs  that allowed  this otherwise  viable  firm to \ncontinue  its vital operations.  \nLikewise,  the regional  Reserve  Bank  is able to gauge  the local  effects  of financial  market  \nconditions  and economic  drivers  through  its role in supervising  banks.  Although  considerable  \nattention  is focused  today  on systemic  risk and systemically  important  financial  institutions,  the \nFederal  Reserve’s regional  connections  to more  than 6,000  community  banks  and 50 state \nbanking  departments  provide  essential  information  about  the economic  health  of small  business,  \nregional  economies,  credit  conditions  and the impact  of broader  regulatory  issues.   \nThrough  the Reserve  Banks’ presence  in their respective  communities,  regional  issues  \ncan be addressed  with the expertise  and knowledge  that a regional  Reserve  Bank  is equipped  to \nprovide.  Having  been  so recently  reminded  that access  to credit  is critical  to the economic  \nsuccess  for communitie s large  and small,  I think  it is quite  feasible  that if Congress  were  to \ndesign  the Federal  Reserve  System  today,  it might  well choose  to have  50 Reserve  Banks  rather  \nthan just 12. \n \n\n6 \n Structure  fosters  independent  thinking  \nThe system,  by design,  is intended  to include  a diverse  range  of perspectives,  and the \nReserve  Banks  contribute  importantly  to this diversity.  Many  have  criticized  this feature  by \nsuggesting  that the cacophony  of voices  sends  mixed  signals.  Yet, other  public  institutions  reflect  \nsimilar  democratic  processes  where  a mosaic  of perspectives  and input  is sometimes  messy.  \nEssential  to sound  outcomes  are leadership  and governing  processes  to bring  these  voices  \ntogether  for the purpose  of decision  making.  The same  is true for the Federal  Open  Marke t \nCommittee  (FOMC).  \n The FOMC  has a long-established  process  that provides  for discussion  and debate  of \npolicy  options.  But, the decision -making  process  is quite  clear:  12 participants —seven  from  the \nBoard  of Governors  and five from  the Reserve  Banks—cast votes  at each meeting  and the \nmajority  defines  the policy  action  with a statement  articulating  its rationale.  A $17 trillion  \neconomy  with complex  dynamics  is well-served  by this process,  which  includes  a range  of \nviewpoints  and inputs.  \n This structure  also, by design,  allows  for dissenting  views.  This feature  recognizes  the \nvalue  Americans  place  on independent  thinking.  Some  have  argued:  Why  not keep  differing  \nviews  internal  and present  a united  or consensus  view  to the public?  Woul dn’t solidarity  give \nmore  confidence  and clarity  to the public?  I believe  that masking  differing  policy  views  is \ninconsistent  with central  bank  communication  and transparency.  Making  differing  views  \navailable  to the public  serves  to clarify  issues.  It is the public  duty of each participant  of the \nFOMC  to express  their views.  To suggest  that FOMC  members  should  appear  to be unanimous  \nin voting  records  is to suggest  that diverse  perspectives  are not valued  and underestimates  the \npublic’s ability  to discern  intellectual  honesty.  \n\n7 \n Final ly, independent,  stable  and informed  leadership  is especially  important  to the \nFederal  Reserve’s policymaking  process.  Policy  decisions  have  broad  impact  and benefit  from  \nthe institution ’s research,  thoughtful  analysis and public  input.  Experience  and informed  \njudgment  are as important  to good  policy  as academic  and theoretical  frameworks.  \nThe Federal  Reserve  Act calls for members  of the Board  of Governors  to serve  14-year \nterms,  yet according  to one recent  report,  the average  tenure  of Federal  Reserve  gove rnors  since  \n1936  has been  7.3 years.  Since  1986,  the average  tenure  has fallen  to five years,  and the last 10 \ngovernors  to serve  have  held their seats  on average  for four years.6 Furthermore,  whether  \nmonetary  policy,  banking  regulation  or payments,  the public depends  on those  who serve  to \nbring  diversity  of experience  to the Federal  Reserve’s most  challenging  issues . This means  \nhonoring  the Federal  Reserve  Act’s requirement  for diversity  of background  and geography  \namong  the Governors.  Consistent  with this, I agree  that the Federal  Reserve  Board  would  be \nstrengthened  by having  someone  with community  banking  or community  bank  supervision  \nexperience  to fill one of its current  openings.   \n \nConclusion  \n The financial  crisis  is behind  us, thankfully,  but not far behind.  The image  in the rearview  \nmirror  is still large—and perhaps  closer—than it appears.  The Federal  Reserve’s history  is \nimportant , but it is only helpful  to the extent  that it positions  us to consider  how we might  \naddress  the considerable  challenges  that await  the central  bank  in the years  to come.  Those  \nchallenges  include  normalizing  monetary  policy,  effectively  supervising  the largest  financial  \ninstitutions,  and ensuring  a safe, efficient  and accessible  payments  system.   \n                                                 \n6 The New York  Times . “Tenures Becoming  Shor ter at a Short -Handed  Fed.” May 12, 2014.   \n\n8 \n Today's debate  is not about  second -guessing  those  who made  difficult  choices  in the \ninterest  of the country  during  the depths  of the financial  crisis.  However,  it is not enough  to \ndefend  the steps  taken  during  the crisis  by saying , “It could  have  been  worse.”  Instead,  the \nexperience  of the financial  crisis  should  lead policymakers  to the unequivocal  conviction  that \nthey will not rest until the foundations  of our financial  system  are shored  up to avoid  similar  \noutcomes  next time.  That is the pledge  policymakers  made  to the Ame rican  public. Through  the \nbroad -based  input  provided  by the decentralized  Federal  Reserve,  we can deliver  on this pledge.  \nThose  demonstrating  on Main  Street  in Kansas  City and other  parts  of the country  deserve  this. \nThe Federal  Reserve’s  centennial  provides  an oppo rtunity  to engage  the public  and to \nreflect  on the values  that have  allowed  the institution  to serve  the country.7 Its defining  \ncharacteristics,  if embraced,  can continue  to serve  as a source  of strength  for the nation  in the \nfuture.  As former  Senator  Robe rt Owen  noted  in an Octo ber 1913  speech  on the role of Reserve  \nBanks within  the Federal  Reserve  System,  “Their  function  must  be to protect  the commerce  of \nthe nation,  to stabilize  the interest  rate and to give permanency  to the prosperity  which  this \ncountr y ought  to enjoy  continuously.”   \nThat sentiment  is as true today  as it was 100 years  ago. \n                                                 \n7For more  on the Federal  Reserve’s centennial,  visit the System’s historical  gateway  at \nhttp://www.federalreservehistory.org/ .",

It is an honor to address such a \ndistinguished group on an important topic. Given the events of the past several years, this \nconference’s focus on “Frameworks for Cen tral Banking in the Next Century” is certainly  fitting.  \nCentral banks are grappling to apply the lessons of history in the context of today’s economic \nrealities, and I expect this forum will contribute importantly to that essential evolution.   \nOne issue that the crisis has pushed to the forefront is the relationship between \nmacroeconomics and finance, and how we think about the footings of financial stability . My \ncomments this evening will focus briefly on this intersection of monetary policy an d supervisory \nand regulatory issues. I am convinced that promoting financial stability requires a comprehensive  \napproach that uses both macroprudential tools and the examination of individual firms, relying \non the judgment of experienced examiners. In addi tion, I am skeptical of a clean “separation \nprinciple” that places financial stability squarely in the purview of the supervisors. Instead, I \nthink monetary policymakers also need to maintain a careful eye on the financial system and \nhow interest rate poli cy affects incentives for financial markets and institutions.  \nAs usual, my comments today reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the \nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.  \n \nThe path of policy and incentives  \nA primary  mission of financial regulators and supervisors is to foster financial stability \nby monitoring the health of individual financial institutions.  Broader financial conditions also \nplay an important role in achieving these objectives.  In some respects, financial institutions are \nstronger today than prior to the crisis, but I remain concerned about how the stance of monetary \npolicy is affecting the ir incentives and attitudes toward risk.  As a result of near-zero interest rates \n\n \n2 \n for five years , the profitab ility of traditional banking activities is strained  and incentives to reach \nfor yield are tempting . Net interest margins continue to trend lower and are at their lowest level \nin 30 years . Banks are responding as we should expect , which is to say they are engaging in \nriskier activities. For example, an all -time high of  $600 billion of  leveraged loans were issue d in \n2013. This lending is often characterized by weaker underwriting standards, including higher \ndebt ratios and fewer covenant provisions.  \nThe incentives to reach for yield extend to smaller financial institutions  as well . \nCommercial banks with assets of less than $50 billion have increased exposure to interest rate \nrisk, due in part to the guidance the FOMC has provided regarding future interest rates. Today, \n53 percent  of the securities and loans held by these banks have maturities of more than three \nyears, compared to about 37  percent  back in 2005. If longer -term interest rates we re to suddenly \nmove higher, the se institutions could face heavy losses.  These conditions create a challenging \nclimate for supervisors. Not only are they implement ing many new rules associated with \nregulatory reform , but they also are monitor ing these and other areas of increased risk -taking.    \nHaving just painted a picture where the extended, low-rate environment adversely affects \ntraditional banking activities,  the question is , What steps might be taken to address it and its \neffects?  \nFirst,  I would like to  see short -term interest rates move higher in response to improving \neconomic conditions  shortly after completion of the “taper.”  Many of the rules offering policy \nguidance on the federal funds rate —such as the “Taylor rule”  and its variants —are already or \nclose to prescribing a po licy rate higher than the current funds rate.  Second, the path toward the \nlonger -term neutral funds  should be gradual.  Given the lengthy period of unconventional policy \nand low rates, the necessary adjustment by financial markets to less central bank intervention and \n\n \n3 \n influence could be volatile.  In this environment, the pressure to quickly back away from a rising \nrate pol icy will be significant ; such pressures will need to be resisted. If not, we risk moving into \na confusing stop -and-go policy environment.  \nIn terms of the path after liftoff, the FOMC has signaled that it will take a gradual \napproach toward  the longer -run funds rate . For example,  the median of the latest FOMC \nSummary of Economic Projections  shows the economy reach ing full employment an d inflation \nat the 2 percent  target at the end of 2016. Such conditions, under more normal circumstances, \nwould imply the federal funds rate should be at, or at least near, its longer -run level.  However, \nthe federal funds rate is expected to be 2¼ percent by year -end 2016, compared to a median of 4 \npercent in the longer run. So, the funds rate could reach its lo nger-run level well after the \neconomic recovery is complete and inflation has returned to the 2 percent  goal.  \nThese signals suggest to banks  that they will  continue to contend with a low interest rate \nenvironment for a few years, even as economic conditions are lik ely to improve. I see this as a \nset of conditions ripe for greater risk -taking  as firms reach for yield and the imbalances related to \nsuch incentives  grow .  \nGradualism can promote financial stability, as it reduces the incidence of unexpe cted \nshifts in interest rates.  Even so, t he degree of inertia suggested in the median path of the federal \nfunds rate in the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections goes beyond what is required to \nachieve  a smooth exit.  In my view,  it will likely be appropriate to raise the federal funds rate at a \nsomewhat faster pace than the median of committee members’ projections. Low rates into late \n2016 will likely continue to provide incentives for financial markets and investors to reach for \nyield in an economy operating at full capacity and risks achieving our objectives  over the longer \nrun. \n\n \n4 \n  \nA comprehensive approach to supervision  \n Given this landscape, how can bank supervisors respond? I will begin here by noting that  \nsubstantial effort s have been devoted to enhanced macroprudential supervision and requirements \naimed at strengthening bank balance sheets. Higher leverage ratios, liquidity requirements, stress \ntests and enhanced supervision of systemically important financial institutions  are designed to \ncontribute to a more stable financial system in the future.  However, our experience with these \ntools and the model -driven approaches when  evaluating the balance sheet s of large financial \ninstitution s is limited . For example, c ounter -cyclical capital buffers lack a type of “Taylor rule” \nthat would help guide us on when to make adjustments.  Absent a rule  for guidance , knowing the \nright time to adjust the buffers and by how much pose considerable challenges.   \n I would also note that a number of central banks did engage in a form of macroprudential \nsupervision before the crisis through their Financial Stability Reports.  Overall, these reports \nshow that potential risks were identified before the crisis, but it was far more dif ficult for central \nbanks to judge whether these risks would be fully realized and to then pursue corrective \nsupervisory action in an effective and timely manner.   \n Until we better understand how to utilize such tools, macroprudential supervision and the \nidentification of systemic risk can be most effective when it serves as a complement to a rigorous \nmicroprudential regime. Assessing risk-management policies and governance offer s a window \ninto the incentives that drive decision -making and risk appetite  at the level of an individual firm, \nproviding important context for macro views of the system.  \nEnhanced supervision over the past few years has focused more heavily on the role of \nquantitative models  rather than experienced bank examiners.  These contributions surely have \n\n \n5 \n been important complements to the supervisory regime.  But they are  not a substitute  for the \nperspectives of bank examiners . Macroprudential tools take a different approach to the \nsupervisory process than a commissioned bank examin er in two ways:  The credentialing  process \nfor examiners involves hands -on experience and assigns accountability to the findings of an \nexamination.  Early training includes classroom time in addition to work on bank analysis and \ntransaction testing.  Once an examiner is credentialed , that person can be the Examiner -in-Charge \n(EIC) . As the EIC, you sign the exam ination  report. And when you sign the examination report , \nyou are  accountable for the judgments and assessments contained in the report . \nI take a similar approach to monetary policy. Economic analysis from my staff provides a \nuseful high -level overview of economic trends and issue s relevant  to monetary policy. I feel \nmost confident when their analysis is consistent with anecdotes from my contacts , who are  \noperating businesses and making real -time hiring and pricing decisions. The macro view \ncomplements the micro information, and vice vers a. In the same way, this dynamic applies to \nfinancial supervision . \nThus, an effective supervisory framework blends the new quantitative macrosupervisory \napproaches with the qualitative judgments that supervisors  bring from examining individual \nfirms. So , as we experiment with macroprudential tools, we also must c ontinue t o devote \nresources to and emphasize microprudential supervision.  In addition, strengthening bank capital \nwith sturdier and higher leverage ratios is a n essential and prudent course of action. Recent \nchanges along these lines are encouraging. For example, I  see the enhanced supplementary \nleverage ratio as a positive step that avoids relying on risk -based capital standards, which can be \nexploited.  \n \n\n \n6 \n  \nConclusion  \nCertainly , the frameworks for central banking in the future are evolving and include all of \nthe topics being discussed during this conference.  They also will require a healthy dose of \nthinking —and humility —about the interaction between regulatory and interest rate p olicy if \nsustainable economic growth is to be achieved.  Interest rate policy needs to adjust to achieve \nprice stability and sustainable growth, both now and in the future. However, we have seen how \nasset bubbles can derail these goals . Finding the intersec tion of supervisory and interest rate \npolicy to achieve financial stability will be an important contribution to central banking in the \nnext century.",

George  \nPresident  and Chief  Executive  Officer  \nFederal  Reserve  Bank  of Kansas  City \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCommunity  Banking  in the 21st Century  \nConference  hosted  by the Federal  Reserve  System  and the Conference  of State  Bank  Supervisors  \nSt. Louis,  Mo. \nSept.  23, 2014  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers or representatives.  \n\n1 \n It is a pleasure  to be invited  to participate  in today’s  conference.  The Kansas  City Fed’s  \nseven -state district  is home  to some  900 banks  with less than $1 billion  of assets,  which  is 17 \npercent  of the nation’s  small  banks.  With  combined  assets  of about  $150  billion,  these  banks \nrepresent  just 1 percent  of total industry  assets.  However,  size comparisons  understate  their \nimport ant contribution  to the region al and nation al economy.   \nCommunity  banks  in our region  help finance  farmers  who contribute  to 12 percent  of the \nnation’s  agricultural  output  as well as oil and gas businesses  that account  for 16 percent  of \ndomestic  energy  output.  These  banks  also are particularly  critical  for home owners  and business  \noperators  in rural  areas  because  of their willingness  to meet  the demand  for tailored,  nonstandard  \nmortgages  and for small  business  loans.   \nThere  are more  than 5,000  such banks  in the United  States.  As the national  economy  \nstrengthens,  community  banks  are prepared  to resume  their important  role in their communities  \nand the broader  economy.   However,  they argue  that the regulatory  environment  has thrown  sand \nin the gears  of efficiently  and competitively  meeting  the credit  needs  of their communities.   \nFour  years  ago, the regulatory  reform  known  as the Dodd -Frank  Act (DFA)  was passed.  \nWith  its aim squarely  focused  on addressing  the supervision  and regulation  of the largest  \nfinancial  institutions,  the law and its architects  acknowledged  that small  banks  were  neither  the \ncause  of the crisis  nor the target  of reforms.  And to that end, the DFA  expressly  exempted  small  \nbanks  from  its reach.  So, why since  then have  community  banks  increasingly  become  concerned  \nand vocal  about  regulatory  burden  as a threat  to their ability  to serve  the credit  needs  of their \ncommunities  and, ultimately,  to their viability?   \nThis growing  chorus  of concern  and frustration  about  regulatory  burden  has gotten  the \nattention  of policymakers  and regulators.  Federal  banking  regulators  all agree  that calibrating  \n\n2 \n supervision  for community  banks  is appropriate  and important,  and they express  genuine  \nsympathy  for the need  to apply  the right  balance  to the supervision  and regulation  of small  \nbanks.   \nYet, in spite  of legislators’  and regulators’  best intentions,  customers  and communities  \nthat rely on smaller  banks  for access  to credit  are feeling  the weight  of regulatory  burden,  and \nbankers  are pleading  for relief.  Industry  advocates  have  identified  a number  of specific  remedies,  \nand efforts  are underway  to consider  how they might  be implemented.  For its part, the Federal  \nReserve  has likewise  expressed  its commitment  to a deeper  understanding  of these  issues,  \nincluding  its partnership  with the Conference  of State  Bank  Supervisors  in this forum  today.  I \ncommend  such efforts  and look forward  to the research  insights  and other  learning  from  this \nprogram.   \nIn my remarks  today,  I will offer  my own views  on the regulatory  burden  dilemma  facing  \nsmall  banks,  their regulators  and legislators,  and why it is proving  to be so difficult  to address  in \na meaningful  way.  I will also offer  my perspective  on a way forward  to ensure  that regulation  \nretains  its objectives  for public  interest  and the safety  of the banking  system.  Before  going  \nfurther,  I need  to note that my comments  today  are my views  only and not those  of the Federal  \nReserve  System  or its Board  of Governors,  which  is charged  with bank  regulation  \nresponsibilities.  \n \nThe aim of regulation  \nThe aim of bank  regulation  in the United  States  is both to protect  the public  and foster  an \nefficient  competitive  banking  system.  Similar  to the backdrop  for the DFA,  much  of the U.S. \nregulatory  system  developed  in response  to financial  crises  and other  events.   \n\n3 \n Generally  speaking,  bank  regulation  is designed  to protect  depositors,  ensure  monetary  \nand financial  stability,  provide  for an efficient  and competitive  financial  system  and protect  \nconsumers.  It is not intended  to keep  banks  from  failing  or to hinder  banks  from  taking  risks  in \nmeeting  the needs  of their customers  and efficiently  allocating  credit.1   \nStriking  an appropriate  balance  between  regulation,  banking  and policy  has always  been  \na struggle.   In that regard,  today’s  environment  is no different.  Tension  has long existed  between  \nallowing  banks  suffic ient flexibility  to adapt  to a rapidly  changing  environment  while  \nmaintaining  a regulatory  framework  that ensures  financial  stability  and adequate  consumer  \nprotection.   \nGetting  that balance  right  is critical.  History  offers  any number  of examples  of well-\nintended  regulation  resulting  in unintended  outcomes.  For example,  the 1999  Gramm -Leach -\nBliley  Act that allowed  banking  organizations  to expand  into nonbank  financial  activities  aimed  \nto allow  banks  to diversify  and reduce  risk. Instead,  as we learned  from  the financial  crisis,  \nsubstantial  increases  in risk-taking,  leverage  and business -model  complexity  increased  financial  \nfragility.   \nLikewise,  the Basel  capital  requirements  allowed  the largest  banks  to use internal  models  \nto calculate  their own risk weights  for risk-based  capital  requirements,  in part, “to build  upon  and \nfurther  encourage  investments  banks  are already  making  in their internal  risk management  \nsystems.”2 While  the intent  was to improve  risk management  and better  align  capital  ratios  with \nportf olio risk, the result  was regulatory  arbitrage  and leverage  ratios  that proved  inadequate  \nrelative  to the risks  that many  of the largest  banks  took leading  into the crisis.    \n                                                 \n1 For an in-depth  review  of the purposes  of bank  regulation  as well as what  bank  regulation  is not intended  to do, see \nKenneth  Spong,  Banking  Regulation:  Its Purposes,  Implementation,  and Effects , Federal  Reserve  Bank  of Kansas  \nCity,  2000.  \n2 See William  J. McDonough,  “Implementing  the New  Basel  Accord,” remarks  to the Global  Association  of Risk \nProfessionals,  Feb. 11, 2003.  \n\n4 \n Getting  the right  balance  for banking  regulation  is not easy.  Legislators  and regulators  \nface the growing  challenge  of regulating  an industry  that over the past three  decades  has become  \nhighly  concentrated  and engaged  in activities  that range  from  traditional  lending  to complex  \nfinance.  While  commercial  banks  of all sizes  benefit  from  public  safety  nets, the operating  \nmodels,  activities,  and risk profiles  they employ  vary widely.  Indeed,  community  banks  are not \nsmaller  versions  of the country’s  largest  banks.  If our regulatory  apparatus  is going  to effectively  \nmeet  its aims,  policymaker s must  understand  how these  commercial  banking  business  models  \noperate  and why a locally -owned  community  bank  is not the same  as a branch  of a systemically  \nimportant  financial  institution  in meeting  the credit  needs  of the local  community.   \n \nUnderstanding  relationship  banking  \nThe community  bank  business  model  is often  described  as relationship  banking.  \nCommunity  bankers  typically  have  long-term,  direct  relationships  with their customers  that \nprovide  the detailed  knowledge  about  their character,  reputation  and history.  This is necessary  to \nmake  informed,  qualitative  assessments  about  credit  quality.  These  relationships  allow  \ncommunity  banks  to tailor  loans  and other  services  to their customers.   \n Many  community  banks  also are closely  held institutions  with the top management  and \nboard  members  having  significant  ownership  positions.  These  ownership  incentives  shape  the \nbank’s  culture  and help to ensure  that its key policymakers  are focused  on achieving  good  \nperformance,  avoiding  excessive  risk-taking,  and suppo rting  the health  of their communities.  \nStudies  by staff at our Reserve  Bank  on ownership  and management  structure  find that the \n\n5 \n better -performing  and safer  community  banks  are those  where  the major  decision  makers  have  \nmuch  to lose if they do not make  the right  decisions.3   \nI often  hear that such a business  model  is becoming  less economical  in a world  that is fast \npaced  and increasingly  transactions -based.  However,  research  from  our Reserve  Bank  presented  \nhere at last year’s  conference  shows  there  is real value  in relationship  lending  and in the soft \npersonal  information  on customers  that community  bankers  typically  have.4 This business  model  \nis one in which  the incentives  of banks  are aligned  with outcomes  that benefit  their customers  \nand the economy.  When  incentives  are aligned  in this way,  the need  for an “ability  to repay”  \nrule, for example,  seems  unnecessary.   \nAnother  defining  feature  of community  banking  is its business  model  transparency.  \nTraditional  bank  lending  is inherently  opaque  because  it is based on the inside,  non-public  \ninformation  that bankers  gain from  their relationships  with borrowers,  but the business  model  \nneed  not be opaque.  In contrast  to the largest  banks,  community  bank  shareholders,  creditors,  \ncustomers  and regulators  find it relati vely easy to monitor  and verify  risks.  Management  \noversight  and market  discipline  are much  more  effective  with such a transparent  business  model.  \nEmployees  know  what  is expected;  regulators  are better  able to thoroughly  examine  the bank,  \nidentify  risks  and recommend  appropriate  corrective  actions  as needed.  \nFinally,  to understand  the community  bank  business  model  is to understand  that failure  is \nan option  when  risks  are poorly  managed.  This feature  offers  a powerful  incentive  to manage  \nrisk. To be sure,  community  banks  don’t  always  get it right,  and history  points  to their failures,  \n                                                 \n3 Robert  DeYoung,  Kenneth  Spong,  Richard  J.

Fortunately,  an efficient  resolution  process  is \navailable  to minimize  the cost to their communities  and customers,  maintain  essential  banking  \nservices  and retain  public  confidence.  \n \nThe reality  of the current  regulatory  environment  \nThe business  model  of community  banks  no longer  dominates  the commercial  banking  \nindustry.  Regulation  has expanded  to address  the size, concentration  and complexity  of the \nlargest  banks.  Unfortunately,  it also has impinged  on thousands  of community  and regional  \nbanks.    \nThe issue  is whether  we can effectively  achieve  desired  outcomes  for all commercial  \nbanks  under  the current  regulatory  framework,  or whether  we will try to further  bifurcate  the \nsystem  with separate  rules  for the largest  banks  and community  banks.  We face a decision  about  \nthe path forward.  Based  on my own experience,  I would  offer  three  observations  about  the nature  \nof today’s  regulatory  environment  that weigh  most  heavily  on community  banks  in the interest  of \nframing  potential  remedies.    \nMy first observation  is that the rules  are increasingly  prescriptive  and complex.  In a \nglobal  market  for finance  and commerce,  regulators  have  responded  to a larger,  more  \nconcentrated  and complex  banking  industry  with more  complicated  rules.  However,  the value  of \nthis complexity  is questionable.  In the case of capital  rules—a key component  of regulation  and \nbank  safety—recent  empirical  and theoretical  research  shows  that simpler  capital  rules  are better.  \nFor example,  researchers  at the Bank  of England  and Organisation  for Economic  Cooperation  \nand Development  have  shown  that simple  leverage  ratios  are better  than risk-based  ratios  in \n\n7 \n predicting  default.5 Researchers  at the Bank  of England  also have  shown  that theoretically  \ncomplicated  rules  can lead to worse  results  when  granular  measures  of asset  risk do not account  \nfor correlations  among  a bank’s  asset  portfolio  or when  models  attempt  to estimate  risk \nparameters  for risks  that are unknowable.6 \nLong  before  Basel  III was adopted,  community  banks  were  considered  well capitalized  \nand their risks  well understood.  They  remain  so today.  For example,  banks  with less than $1 \nbillion  of assets  had a Tier 1 leverage  ratio of 9.5 percent  in 1996,  and today  it is 10.5 percent.  \nEven  so, community  banks  must  adopt  the more  complicated  capital  rules  with finer  degrees  of \nrisk weights  and capital  buffers.  The risk-weighted  asset  schedule  of the call report  has 57 rows  \nand 89 pages  of instructions  yet no additional  capital  was required  for the majority  of community  \nbanks.  \nIn addition  to the higher  compliance  costs  associated  with these  capital  rules,  community  \nbanks  continue  to hold higher  levels  of capital  than the largest  banks. Unless  and until the largest  \nbanks  achieve  commensurate  levels  of capital  (inclusive  of their off-balance -sheet  assets),  they \nretain  a capital -ratio advantage  over community  and regional  banks  that is far more  powerful  \nthan the funding  cost subsidy  confirmed  in a recent  Government  Accountability  Office  study.   \nMy second  observation  is that regulation  and supervisory  frameworks  have  evolved  with \nfar less reliance  on examiner  experience  and supervisory  judgment  and more  emphasis  on data-\ndriven,  econometr ic models  and measurement  to produce  a more  systematic,  objective  and \n                                                 \n5 See Andrew  Haldane,  “Constraining  Discretion  in Bank  Regulation ,” Federal  Reserve  Bank  of Atlanta  Conference  \non “Maintaining  Financial  Stability:  Holding  a Tiger  by the Tail(s),”  April  9, 2013 ; and Adrian  Blundell -Wignall,  \nPaul Atkinson,  and Caroline  Roulet,  “Bank  Business  Models  and the Basel  System : Complexity  and \nInterconnectedness ,” OECD  Journal:  Financial  Market  Trends , Vol. 2014  – Issue  2. \n6 See Andrew  Haldane  in note 5 and David  Aikman,  Mirta  Galesic,  Gerd  Gigerenzer,  Sujit  Kapadia,  \nKonstantinos  Katsikopoulos,  Amit  Kothiyal,  Emma  Murphy,  and Tobias  Neumann,  “Taking  Uncertainty  Seriously:  \nSimplicity  Versus  Complexity  in Financial  Regulation ,” Financial  Stability  Paper  No. 28, Bank  of England,  May \n2014.   \n \n\n8 \n standardized  approach  to supervision.  For the enhanced  supervision  of the country’s  largest  \nbanks,  this approach  has been  considered  highly  successful,  for example,  in making  assessments  \nabout  capital  adequacy  under  stress  test scenarios.  However,  for community  bank  supervision,  \nthe substitution  of rigid  rules  for examiner  judgment  has altered  the supervisory  process  without  \nadding  value  and has instead  created  higher  costs  of compliance.   \nAppraisal  requirements  have  been  cited  as an example  in this regard.  Over  the last two \ndecades,  the required  use of appraisals  has expanded  in response  to the 1990s  savings  and loans  \ncrisis  and the 2008  financial  crisis.  For real estate  in larger  metropo litan areas,  market  values  can \nbe readily  determined.  For real estate  in smaller  communities,  especially  rural  communities,  \nthere  may in fact be no “objective”  market  price.  Despite  this difference,  appraisal  regulation  is \nrigid  and restricts  the kind of judgment -based  lending  that facilitates  lending  to small  businesses  \nand individuals  in rural  and other  small  community  markets.  \nMy third  observation  is related  to the nature  of consumer  compliance  regulation,  and here \nI worry  the pendulum  has swung  too far.  To be sure,  regulation  has an important  role to play in \nconsumer  protection  and fair access  to credit.  Those  protections  should  not be diluted,  especially  \nfor banks  that rely on model -based  consumer  lending.  However,  for banks  that depend  on \nrelationship  lending  with customized  terms  and conditions,  the regulations  and the focus  on \nidentifying  specific  undesirable  products  seems  to run counter  to the requisite  subjectivity  that \nunderlies  the strengths  of community  bank  lending.  Mortgage  lending,  UDAAP  (Unfair, \nDeceptive,  or Abusive  Acts or Practices) , CRA  (Community  Reinvestment  Act) and fair lending  \nmust  not only protect  consumers  from  bad actors,  but allow  consumers  to be served  where  \nsubjectivity  is required.  Unfortunately,  I frequently  hear community  bankers  expressing  concern  \nthat compliance  reviews  have  taken  a more  prosecutorial  tone.  As one banker  noted,  these  \n\n9 \n reviews  have  forced  bank  customers  to prove  they aren’t  crooks  and bankers  to prove  to \nregulators  that they aren’t  deceptive  and unfair.     \n \nMoving  forward  \nIn making  these  observations,  I share  the desire  on the part of both bankers  and regulators  \nto find meaningful  solutions.  Community  banks  have  become  entangled  in a web of reforms  \nintended  to address  the risks  in the largest  banks.  These  reforms  respond  to a business  model  \nemployed  by a few large,  globally  active  banks,  but have  created  spillovers  for community  \nbanks.  Although  it is enticing  to contemplate  the construction  of separate  rules  and frameworks  \nthat reflect  these  different  business  models  and risks,  commercial  banks  of all sizes  remain  \nbeneficiaries  of a public  safety  net. For that reason,  I believe  community  banks  have  a vested  \ninterest  in seeing  that regulatory  reforms  move  ahead  to ensure  that the largest  banks  are well \ncapitaliz ed, well supervised,  well managed  and subject  to failure.  Achieving  that end will serve  \nthe public  well.  While  that work  is underway,  regulators  must  also allow  examiner  judgment  and \ncommon  sense  to play a greater  role in their supervisory  regimes  for comm unity  banks.  \nI’m often  told that the world  has become  more  complicated,  that we have  too many  banks  \nin the U.S. and that we cannot  go back  to less-complex  and more -straightforward  regulation  and \nrules  and greater  supervisory  judgment.   I’m not convinced.   One of the best responses  to that \nassertion  was from  Sir Mervyn  King,  the former  governor  of the Bank  of England.  Although  his \nreference  was made  in the context  of finding  a solution  to the issue  of too big to fail, the same  \nmight  be said for addressing  the regulatory  environment  more  generally.  He said, “There  are \nthose  who claim  that such proposals  are impractical.  It is hard to see why.  … What  does seem  \nimpractical,  however,  are the current  arrangements.”",

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \nRedlands Community College  \nEl Reno, Oklahoma  \nApril  4, 2013  \n \n \n \n \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers or representatives.   \n\n \n1 \n Welcome remarks  \nThank you  for inviting me  to El Reno . I’ve been in the role of Reserve Bank  president for \nmore than  a year and have had  many opportunities to meet with business and community leaders \nwho offer important perspectives on the economy and credit conditions. This insight  shapes my \nview of th e regional and national economy  and provides  essential input to monetary policy \nduring discussions at the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) meetings . This regional \ninput , supported by the Federal Reserve System’s structure , was designed to serve the public’s \ntrust, and I believe it enhances the effectiveness of policy.  Certainly , these two days in El Reno \nhave provided insightful perspectives on the local economy.  \nMy remarks today will focus on an outlook for the US economy and my views on the \ncurrent stance of mone tary policy.  \n \nPrivate sector momentum, public sector headwinds  \nThe U.S. econom y continues to grow slowly.  Growth has average d slightly more than 2 \npercent  over the past three  years.  At this pace, it is certainly less robust than other recoveries, but \nhistory does show that recoveries after a financial crisis are often slower.  Importantly, despite a \nvariety of headwinds during  this four -year period, the economy continues to improve in several \nkey aspects.  \nFirst, t he pace of job growth has gradually been  putting people back to work. The \nunemployment rate has declined from its peak of 10  percent  late in 2 009 to its current level of \n7.7 percent . Over  the past six months, private sector payroll  gains have averaged 200,000 per \nmonth . This pace of growth is a positive development in labor market conditions  and compares \nfavorably to pre -recession levels . The average monthly increase in private employment from \n\n \n2 \n 2004 to 2006 was 168 ,000—a period when the housing bubble was fueling economic growth and \njob gains . \nLikewise, the decline in new claims for unemployment insurance  points to an improved \nlabor market . Claims are historically volatile, but t he four-week average number of claims is \ncurrently about 355,000 per week , which is near its lowest level in five years  and almost  half the \nlevel of the previous peak of 66 0,000 per week . This also compares favorably to the average \nnumber of weekly claims from the 2004 to 2006  period at 330,000 per week .  \nImportantly, t hese labor market improvement s are helping to support consumer demand \nand confidence. Consumption has increase d at a 3 percent  annualized pace over the pas t six \nmonths, compared to the 2 percent  pace since the end of the recession. Some of the improvement \nhas come at the cost of a lower sa vings rate, but it also suggests consumers are adjusting to \nhigher gasoline prices and lower take -home pay due to the expiration of the payroll tax holiday.  \nDespite these headwinds, consumer spending has held up quite well in the first two months of \n2013. Consumer sentiment also recently rebounded  after falling sharply in mid -March  with the \nassessment of current economic conditions at its highest level since the end of the recession . \nThe rebound in housing has likely contributed to this improved sentiment . Home prices \nhave risen 8 percent  over the past year  as a result of low inventory levels, boosting household \nwealth and support ing consumption. With low inventories,  home builders are responding by \nincreasing construction activity. Housing starts are up more  than 25 percent  compared to a year \nago, and housing has made a positive contribution to total growth for seven consecutive quarters.  \nLooking  forward, I expect GDP growth this year will likely be about 2 percent and that \nthe unemployment rate will continue  to decline modestly by the end of the year.  This pace of \ngrowth reflects the mandated federal spending cuts  and t he adjustments to the tax code at the end \n\n \n3 \n of last year. Uncertainty about fiscal policy and recurring fiscal de adlines , as well as the \nregulatory environment,  is likely to continue the cautious attitude by business es toward \nexpanding capacity.  \n \nMonetary policy during and after the crisis  \nLast month marked the fifth anniversary of the collapse of the investment bank Bear \nStearns , one of th e tremors that announced the financial crisis . The Federal Reserve , along with \nother central banks,  responded aggressively, provid ing liquidity to financial markets and \nmonetary accommodation to cushion the decline in real economic activity. More than four  years \nlater, unprecedented levels of monetary policy accommodation continue.  \nAt its March meeting , the FOMC decided to maintain  its highly accommodative stance of \nmonetary policy by continuing actions approved late last year. Specifically, the Committee \nagreed to continue purchas ing $85 billion monthly in longer -term mortgage and Treasury \nsecurities until the outlook for the labor market has improved  substantially . The size, pace and \ncomposition of the asset purchases  will depend on an assessment of benef its and costs , as well as \non the extent of progress toward the FOMC’s economic objectives.  Additionally , the FOMC \naffirmed that, provided the inflation outlook does not  move above  2½ percent, it expects to keep \nthe federal funds rate near zero until the  unemployment rate reaches  6½ percent.  \n \nEfforts t o speed  up the recovery  \nLarge -scale asset purchases and the commitment  to keep  short -term interest rates near \nzero for an extended period of time are intended to speed up economic growth and get people \nback to work more quickly . Keeping rates low for mortgages and auto loans , for example, can \n\n \n4 \n stimulate borrowing and encourage households and businesses to shift from safe asset s to \ninvestments with more risk, such as corporate bonds and stocks.  With h igh levels of \nunemployment and low inflation , a majority of FOMC members have judged such policies are \nwarranted  and that the benefits continue to outweigh any risks .   \nThere is no question that high unemployment is costly to individuals and results in a l oss \nof output relative to the economy’s long -run potential . In the interest of promoting economic \ngrowth, monetary policy can, and has, played an important role in easing financial conditions as \nthe economy recovers from the recent recession.  Even so, con tinued use of “emergency” policies \nand an extended period of inordinately low rates carry significant risks.  Because of those \nconcerns, I have dissented at the last two FOMC meetings.   \nTo be clear, I support an accommodative stance of monetary policy while the economy \nrecovers and unemployment remains high.  But I view the current policies as overly \naccommodative, c ausing distortions and posing risks to financial stability  and long -term inflation \nexpectations with the potential to compromis e future growth . As the Fed ’s balance sheet \ncontinues to expand , the risks and  costs increase  in my view .  \nA key issue that concerns me is the incentives created by an extended period of zero \nrates.  Typically, central bank actions to lower interest rates in response to a recession and boost \naggregate demand are reversed relatively quickly , and rates return to more normal levels.  In \ncontrast, following this recession, zero interest rates have been in place for more than four  years , \ncombined with l arge-scale asset purchases and a communications program signaling an extended \nperiod of low rates . As a result, the yield curve has flattened , and 10 -year rates have remain ed \nhistorically low .  \n\n \n5 \n Faced with this unprecedented rate environment,  individual and institutional savers, \nsmall er banks, insurance companies and pension funds are challenged to revamp  their portfolios \nand products. Individuals and institutions are placing more emphasis on strategies that entail \nsubstantially greater risk  as they move away from traditional investment -grade products towards \nriskier lending, non -investment -grade products  or equities.   \nBy design, zero interest rates p ush investors from “safe assets” into higher -risk assets and \nthereby  encourage growth.  Whether  this increased risk proves healthy and supportive of \neconomic activity , only time will judge. Some have argued that early signs of excessive risk -\ntaking or overheating in specific sectors of the economy , such as farmland values , high -yield \nbonds or leveraged loans,  can be effectively addressed by regulators or are not yet threatening to \nthe broad economy .  \nFor some time, concern s about the rapid rise in farmland values w ere discounted by the \nfact that significant leverage was not being used.  The shar p rise in lending at the end of last year \nraises concerns that the wealth effect in agriculture could trigger a leverage cycle similar to past \nfarm booms when farm incomes and asset values faded.  \nCertainly, I expect regulators will be focused on such risks and continue to use the \nsupervisory tools available to them, such as the recent guidance issued on leveraged lending.  \nHowever, as we learned from this most recent crisis, emerging risks can be hard to judge and it \ncan be even harder to determine what  action should be taken ahead of any obvious or near -term \nthreat.  In addition, riskier financial activity can grow outside the regulated sector.  For these \nreasons, asking bank regulators and supervisors , or the newly -tasked monitors of financial \nstability , to single -handedly identify and contain the risks introduced by a highly accommodative \nmonetary policy is not realistic . \n\n \n6 \n Likewise, I am concerned that with  the adoption of thresholds for inflation and \nunemployment, the FOMC has expressed some tolerance for having the inflation outlook exceed \n2 percent. A willingness to let inflation rise above its long -term goal carries the risk that longer -\nterm inflation ex pectations rise above the Committee’s 2 percent goal , as well . The current pace \nand composition of asset purchases  also could put the stability of inflation expectations at risk , if \nmarkets perceive that the size of the Fed’s balance sheet could complicate  the return to a more \nneutral monetary policy stance. The FOMC’s exit strategy  – the process of reducing the size of \nthe Fed’s balance sheet and returning short -term rates to their neutral level —will likely begin \nonly well into the future . But  the strategy will need to be carefully executed to minimize market \ndisruptions that could cause longer -term interest rates to suddenly rise.  \n \nPatience for the long r un \nThe economy is making progress in recovering from a deep recession.  I have \nacknowledged the important role that low rates must play in supporting this recovery even as I \nhave raised significant concerns about the current stance of zero interest rates for an extended \nperiod . Can efforts to speed up the pace of growth with u ntested monetary policy tools be \neffective?  The FOMC is carefully considering such issues  and believes the risks are worth \ntaking . However,  our limited understanding of the possible effects of unconventional polic y tools  \ncauses me to give more weight to their risks and eventual consequences.  \nIn raising these issues, it is not my goal to prematurely withdraw support.  It is critical , \nhowever , to ensure we transition from a crisis -type policy stance of aggressive  easing to one of \naccommodation that allows markets, households and businesses to begin to normalize their \nexpectations for interest rates.   In my view , therefore,  we should not underestimat e the risk of an \n\n \n7 \n extended period of zero interest rates and the accompanying incentives that may lead to future \nfinancial imbalances . Such imbalances  could unwind in a disruptive manner and cause the labor \nmarket recovery to stumble. I am concerned that monetary policy at its current settings is overly \naccommodative re lative to the long and variable lags with which it operates.   \nCentral banks must focus on achieving sustainable growth in the long run and be patient \nin pursuing its longer -run goals . Attempt ing to speed up the recovery process create s risks that , if \nrealized , could lead the economy  down a more difficult road back to full employment and price \nstability.",

            "content": "The Economic Recovery  and Monetary Policy : \nTaking the First Step Toward s the Long Run  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEsther L. George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSanta Fe , New Mexico  \nJune 4, 2013  \n \n \n \n \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers or representatives.   \n\n \n1 \n I appreciate the opportunity to be in Santa Fe. The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \nserves a seven -state region that includes this part of New Mexico. Nearly 100 years ago, \nCongress chose to put 12 regional Reserve Banks and their branches across the country because \ndecisions about the nation’s money supply and its financial system are important to the entire \ncountry and affect every business and each citizen.    \nThat’s why  I am in New Mexico this week. These regional connections serve the Federal \nReserve well in unders tanding the economic conditions and business climate that affect the Fed’s \nresponsibilities for monetary policy, supervision and regulation  of financial institutions , and the \nU.S. payments system. I always learn a grea t deal when I tour the region. Between  visits, our \ndirectors and advisory council members serve as our eyes and ears in the vast and diverse region \nserved by the Kansas City Fed. They provide a valuable source of information about the ever -\nchanging economic conditions on Main Street , and t heir reports to us are one of the essential \ninputs I bring to meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). I am pleased that so \nmany of those directors and advisory council memb ers are here today. I thank them for their \nservice.  \nMy remarks today refle ct my views on the national economy and on the next steps for the \nFederal Reserve’s monetary policy, which are currently not shared by a majority of the voting \nmembers of the FOMC.  For that reason, I am especially pleased to have this opportunity to \nexplai n my thinking about the economy and monetary policy within the context of a longer -term \nlook at the period of recovery from the financial crisis and deep recession.   \nDuring this period , the FOMC has engaged in an experiment of aggr essive monetary \npolicy e asing. For the most part, these policy actions have few precedents, and therefore, no \nsimple formula exists to direct policymakers on how to eventually return monetary policy to \n\n \n2 \n more -normal settings. Because of this, considerable judgment that is informed by history and \nexperience will be important for guiding future policy choices.    \n \nA Slow But S teady  Recovery  \nThis month marks the start of the fifth year of an economic recovery in the U nited States . \nIt’s been a slow recovery for sure with r eal GDP, the broadest measure of economic activity, \ngrowing at about a 2 percent average pace . As a result, the economy has recovered from its deep \nlosses and is now about 8  percent larger than it was in 2009. Over this period, households , \nbusinesses and banks  have been r epairing and rebuilding their balance sheets.  \nThe economy has faced bouts of difficulty during this period of recovery, causing man y \nto doubt its sustainability. Episodes of financial stress and uncertainty driven by events from \nabroad, a s well as by fiscal restraint at home, temporarily interrupted the pace of growth \nthroughout the recovery . Yet, the economy has continued to heal, showing signs of steady \nprogress in a number of important respects, including a sustainable pace of consumer spending, \nimprovements in household net worth and a return of consumer confidence.  Businesses also have \nbeen spending on equipment and software, and corporate profits have been historically high the \npast two years.  \nThe housing sector has recovered more slowly, but has gained notable momentum over \nthe past year. Residential construction is now contributing positively to  real GDP growth each \nquarter. The number of new housing starts has moved well above the post -crisis low , and new \nconstruction is supporte d by improving housing demand, as reflected in rising sales and home \nprices.  \n\n \n3 \n Labor markets  also are continuing to heal. Since the end of 2009, about 6 million jobs \nhave returned . The pace of job growth has been unusually slow  compared to other recoveries , but \nit has been strengthening.  Over the past six months, employment has increased by an average of \nslightly more than 200,000 jobs per month. This pace of job growth  is more than sufficient to \nkeep up with population growth  and put unemployed people back t o work . Initial claims for \nunemployment insurance, which is an indicator of how many people are losing job s, is near its \nlowest point since the end of the recession.  This is notable improvement.  \nEven a s the housing sector , labor market and broader economy continue to move in the \nright direction, growth this year may be tempered once again —this time by fiscal issues  \nassociated with mandated federal government spending cuts and uncertainty about future tax \npolicy and government spending. Business owners I speak with continue to emphasize that \nregulatory uncertainty in a number of areas —including the implementation of health care reform  \n—is causing them to take a more cautious approach when hiring new worker s and making capital \ninvestments.  \nI expect the economy  will push through these obstacles with grow th at about 2 percent \nthis year  with low inflation. By n ext year, growth should pick up to about 3 percent , causing the \nunemployment rate  to continue to fall. \n \nThe F OMC and Its  Policy Choices  \nIt is within this context that I turn now to the polic y choices  that lie ahead for the Federal \nOpen Market Committee . The FOMC’s  decisions about monetary policy are guided by the \nobjec tives given to it by Congress. These objectives require the Federal Res erve to pursue \npolicies that  “…maintain long run growth of the monetary and credit aggregates commensurate \n\n \n4 \n with the economy's long run potential to increase production, so as to promote effectively the \ngoals of maximum employment, stable prices, and modera te long -term interest rates.”  Over the \ncourse of the economic recovery, the FOMC has repeatedly intensified its efforts to boost growth \nand speed up the return to full employment.  \nWith short -term interest rates near zero, unemployment high and inflation lo w, the \nFederal Reserve has looked to unconventional policy actions to provide further stimulus in the \ninterest of boosting growth and bringing down  the unemployment rate faster. These actions  \ninclude large -scale asset purchases , more commonly known  as “quantitative easing ,” along with \nconditional commitments to keep rates low for an extended period , also known as “forward \nguidance.”  \nBased on forward guidance from the FOMC, the current exceptionally low level of short -\nterm interest rates is likely to remain in place for some time, at least until the unemployment rate \nreaches 6.5 percent and as long as inflation is not pr ojected to exceed 2.5 percent. To provide \nadditional stimulus when interest rates are near zero, the FOMC has authorized th e purchase of \n$40 billion of agency  mortgage -backed securities  (MBS) and $45 billion of U.S. Treasury \nsecurities each month. At this pace, the Fed’s balance sheet is expanding by more than $1 trillion \nper year. The FOMC reaffirmed this policy stance at its  most recent meeting in late April, not ing \nthat it was prepared to adjust the pace of asset purchases as warranted by the outlook for the \nlabor market or inflation.   \n \nReturning to a long -run focus   \nWith the economy improving and with monetary policy having been extraordinarily \naccommodative for nearly half a decade, the world, it seems, is holding its breath as it waits to \n\n \n5 \n learn wh en the FOMC might adjust its current policy settings . This anxiety follows in part from \nthe fact that a number of g lobal economies have come to depend on central banks to provide \nunprecedented amounts of money to engineer  growth and influence asset values, fearing \notherwise that deflation w ould take hold .  \nIn the United States, f or example, the Federal Reserve has adde d more than $2 trillion in  \nTreasuries and agency -MBS securities  to its balance sheet over the past five years  and continue s \nto add $85 billion each month . To varying degrees , these actions have influenced asset prices , \nsupported financial markets and boosted household wealth.   \nThese unconventional actions  also bring their own uncertainty ab out the outlook for the \neconomy  and increasingly appear to be viewed by markets  and the public as “conventional.”  As \na result, several sectors in the economy are be coming increasingly dependent on  near-zero short -\nterm interest rates and quantitative easing policies. For example, debit balances in security \nmargin accounts at broker -dealers hit an all -time high in April of this year. The rise in these \nbalances indicates that investors are borrowing at very low rates of interest to purchase riskier \nfinancial assets. Presumably, some investors are pursuing this strategy because they anticipate \nthat loans will continue to be available at very low rates of interest, which will allow them to ride \nout any market volatility.  Likewise, an extended period of low rates is causing investors to be \nmore aggr essive about seeking out higher -yielding and riskier assets  in the leveraged loan \nmarket . Leverage d loans are packages of higher -risk commercial loans , which hit an all -time \nhigh in the first quarter of this year.* \nThese issues , among others,  raise a most important question for the F OMC  about when to \nshift its policy focus to the longer run and what steps should be taken now that will return the \neconomy to a state less dependent on monetary stimulus.   \n                                                           \n* Fitch Ratings.  “U.S. Leveraged Finance Market Quarterly: First -Quarter Synopsis.” April 22, 2013.  \n\n \n6 \n Like others, I want to see the U.S. economy grow with healthy job creation . Without \nquestion, more progress is needed in our labor market. While m onetary policy  affects inflation \nand financial stability and influences employment, it cannot singlehandedly fix  today’s high \nunemployment. That will take additional time. In maintaining its present course, the FOMC must \nconsider other pos sible unintended consequences. For example, W ill continuing with current \npolicy and the creation of even greater excess reserves in the banking system result  in more \nlending and economic growth or merely invite asset misallocation?  Are we creating a path to \nstable long-term growth or fostering uncertainty about the impact to the economy when the \nFederal Reserve must unwind its balance sheet?   \nGiven these dynamics , and in light of improving economic conditions,  I support s lowing \nthe pace of asset purchases as an appropriate next step for monetary policy. Moreover, such \nactions would not constitut e an outright tightening of monetary policy, but rather , it wo uld slow \npolicy easin g. History suggests that waiting too long to acknowledge the economy’s progre ss and \nprepare markets for more -normal policy settings carries no less risk than tightening too soon.   \nIn other words , a slowing in the pace of purchases could be viewed as applying less \npressure to the gas pedal, rath er than stepping on the brake. Adjustments today can take a \nmeasured pace as the economy’s progress unfolds . It would importantly b egin to lay the \ngroundwork for a period when markets can prepare to function in a way that is far less dep endent \non central bank actions and allow them to resume their most essential roles of price discovery \nand resource allocation.",

Forums  such  as this one provide  a valuable \nopportunity  to hear  a wide  range  of perspectives  from  policymakers  and others  on key  challenges  \nfacing  us today . I also want  to thank Deputy  Governor  Anne  Le Lorier , who joined us  in Jackson  \nHole,  Wyoming, this  summer  for our  program  on the global  effects  of unconventional  monetary  \npolicy .  \nConsiderable  attention  has been  focused  on fix ing the problems  that caused  tremendous  \ndamage  to the global  financial  system  and economy.  More  than  five years  later,  we are still \nfeeling  the effects  of the financial  crisis,  and, at least  in the United  States , questions  remain  as to \nwhether  we are taking  the right  steps.  Certainly , the stakes  are high  and, therefore,  many  \npolicymakers  around the  world  have  committed  themselves  to improving  the durability  and \nresiliency  of the financial  system.  \nLike you, the  United  States  is committed  to finding  a way forward  and doing  so in a \nmanner  that serves  both domestic  and global  objectives. American  policymakers  and regulators  \nare working  intently  to finalize  and to implement  numerous  regulatory  changes.  Of course,  it will \nbe some  time  before  the full effects  of these changes —both intended and  unintended—are \nunderstood.  \nAs we focus  on new  tools  and approaches  to supervision and  regulation  and bolster  our \nability  to assess risks  to financial  stability,  my own view  is that macroprudential  supervision and  \nthe identification  of systemic  risk can be most  effective when  it serves  as a complement  to a \nrigorous  microprudential  regime.  It is at the firm  level where the  validation  of risk-management  \npolicies  and governance can offer  a window  into the incentives  that drive  decision -making  and \n\n2 risk appetite.  This  foundation can  provide  important  context  and confidence  in our \nmacroprudential  views  of the system.  Assuring  that we allocate scarce  resources  and serve the  \npublic ’s interest,  we must  balance today’s  regulatory  innovation with  existing  prudential  \nstandards . In my remarks  today , I will address  three  aspects  of a supervisory  framework  that \nbring  such  balance and  enhanc e both firm -level  supervision and  system -wide  assessments:  \ninformed  judgments  by examiners , supervisory  transparency  and regulatory  cooperation.  \n \nThe role of  examiner  judgment  in the new  supervisory  framework   \nMuch  of our efforts  to reform  the supervisory  framework  in the United  States  have  \ncentered  on such  features  as macr oprudential  supervision, stress- testing,  enhanced  prudential  \nstandards  of supervision for systemically  important  financial  institutions,  and orderly  liquidation  \nauthority. T hese features  place new  demands  on the  central  bank and  other  regulatory  bodies  to \napply  more  rigor  in how  we supervise  certain  financial  institutions  as well  as to create a  more  \ncomprehensive  understanding  of systemic  risk. Quantifying  and measuring  risk has become core \nto this task.  In addition, the  international  capital  framework  continues  to rely heavily  on very  \ndetailed  formulations  and risk models, and  the scenarios  that many  countries  will use to test the \ncapital  adequacy  of major  banks  will require  access  to massive  data sets  to make the  necessary  \ncalculations.  \nThese developments  suggest  a different  supervisory  regime  than  what  we have used  in \nthe past.  The trend  toward  a more  highly  quantitative  and model -driven approach  to risk \nmeasurement  and capital  adequacy  offers  a more  forward -looking  assessment  of financial  \ninstitutions  and the impact of  macro  risks  to the economy. No  doubt , as we gain  experience with  \n\n3 such tools, they  will be  further  refined  to bring  additional  insights  to vulnerabilities  in the \nfinancial  system.  \nNotwit hstanding  the potential  of these new  approaches, our  enthusiasm  to become \nmacroprudent ial supervisors  should be  tempered  with a healthy  recognition  that these methods  \nare not  a substitute  for micro prudential  supervision. I believe we  must  be careful  to appreciate \nthe crucial  role that informed judgments  by experienced  examiners  can continue  to play  in the \nsupervision of  financial  firms.  Many  of the key contributors  to this crisis —lax lending  standards, \nrisky  funding  strategies , poor governance and overly  optimistic  risk management  strategies —are  \nshortcomings  that can best be detected  through traditional examination  and supervisory  \nprocesses  when  properly  supported by  the supervisory  framework . \nIt is too easily  assumed  that financial  models, str ess tests  and macroprudential  \nsupervision will provide  “smarter” supervision and  identify  what  is presumed  to have  been  \nmissed  by examiners  in the run-up to  the 2008 financial  crisis.  However,  a more  thorough \nanalysis  suggest s that the largest  banks  were more  vulnerable  because regulators  relied  too \nheavily  on erroneous  assumptions  about  the quality  of governance and controls  over  incentives,  \nsophistication  and measurement  of risk management , and  the strength  of market  discipline . As a \nresult , regulators  had already  given  up on the  type  of full-scope  examinations  that smaller  \ninstitutions  typically  experience.  Prior to  2008, most  of the supervisory  emphasis  centered  on a  \nlarge institution’s  models  and risk weights , and  far less effort  was given  to a thorough \nexamination  and critical  analysis  of its loan  portfolio, funding  strategies  and exposure  to exotic  \nrisks  such  as synthetic  derivatives.  \nThe Dodd- Frank  Act requires  enhanced  prudential  standards  for firms  in the United  \nStates  that pose  elevated  risk to financial  stability . These macroprudential  efforts  are worthy  \n\n4 exercises , but no matter  the tool, experience and  informed  judgments  provided by  trained  and \nexperienced  staff  are required  to meet  today’s  heightened  supervisory  expectations.  Data and  \nmodels  provide  information and  choices  that must  be evaluated  in the context  of the more  \nsubjective  or qualitative  elements  of the organization, such  as the quality  of internal  controls  and \nprotocols, management  and organizational  culture.   \nWe must  be mindful  that macroprudential  supervision is  not yet a proven tool  in the work  \nof financial  supervision. Prior to  the crisis,  a number  of central  banks  conducted  their  own  \nversions  of macropr udential  supervision and  stress -testing  of major  institutions  using  their \nFinancial  Stability  Reports  and the detailed  analysis  behind these reports . While  these reports  \nidentified  potential  risks,  they  were not  able to  provide  a clear,  advance warning  of the crisis  or a \ntimely  signal  to financial  supervisors  and monetary  authorities  to take corrective action.   \nA successful  supervisory  framework  thus  will require  a blending  of new  quantitative  \nmacrosupervisory  approaches  with  the qualitative  judgments  that examiners  can contribute  at the \nfirm level.  As we adopt  new  and yet untried programs,  we should not  draw  resources  away  from  \nmicroprudential  supervision. We  must  assimilate  these approa ches and not confuse  their  roles. \nAsking  plumbers  to do the  work  of electricians  risks  burning  something  down. On  the other  \nhand, allowing  plumbers  and electricians  to work  together  is likely  to deliver  reliable  \nfunctionality.  \n \nEnhancing  market discipline  with  transparency  in supervision  \nA second  point  I would like  to explore  is how  we might use  supervision to  increase \ntransparency  in financial  markets  and thereby  restore something  that was missing  in this crisis —\nan effective framework  of market  discipline  and a set of incentives  for the  financial  industry  that \n\n5 does not encourage  excessive risk -taking  again.  Central banks  have  for some  time  regarded  \ntransparency  as essential  to accountability  and the effective transmission  of monetary  policy. \nWhile  there are some  aspects  of supervision that  may be best left confidential,  there are other  \nareas  where we  should thin k about  how  we can make our  goals  and actions  more  systematic,  \npredictable and transparent.  \nWe have  taken  several  steps  in this direction  in the United  States.  At the Federal  Reserve,  \nwe disclose  the capital  stress- testing  methodology  and the results  from  our Comprehensive  \nCapital  Analysis  and Review  (CCAR)  program.  These CCAR disclosures  are a work  in progress,  \nand we will have  to continue  to think about  what  stress scenarios  will provide  the best test of \ncapital  planning  across  all the major  financial  institutions  and whether  we should disclose  more  \ndetailed  information  on individual  institutions.  \nA strong  reason  for supervisors  to consider  a broader  approach  to transparency  is that \ntoday’s  global  institutions,  with  their  systemic  footprints, can  easily  turn the complexity  of their  \noperations  into opaqueness. This , in turn, then  hinders  the ability  of stockholders, large  creditors  \nand other  parties  to provide  the appropriate  level  of market  discipline.  The annual  repor ts of \nmajor  institutions  do not  include  simple  disclosures, but  contain  a nearly  unending  stream  of \nfootnotes  that attempt to  describe their  operations  because of  the legal  liability  of saying  \nsomething  that might prove  to be misleading.  As a result,  annual  reports  contain  few definitive  \nstatements  and forecasts,  or clear  and specific  statements  about  risk exposures. Unfortunately, \nthis lack  of transparency  leaves  many  investors  to rely on regulators  to ensure  sound conditions  \nat banks —or in the extreme  case,  to protect  these investors  through “too-big-to-fail” policies  and \npublic  assistance.   \n\n6 How can  supervisors  reverse this  trend  and return  market  discipline  to the role it once  \nplayed  in financial  markets?  Transparency  is something  we must  consider  as we continue  to \nwork  on our  stress tes ts and as  we implement new  standards  and limits  in such  areas  as liquidity,  \ncounterparty  risk, concentration  of assets  and risk exposures. We  should work  toward  \nimplementing  standards  that also provide  useful  and accurate information to  stockholders  and \ncreditors . One  way  to accomplish  this is to construct  simple  regulatory  rules  that can be easily  \nunderstood by  the public  and readily  enforced  by examiners.  Regulators  may  also be able to  \npromote  transparency  and enhance  market  discipline  by highlighting  industry  information in  \nways  that inform  the public, such  as the Federal  Deposit  Insurance  Corporation’s  Global  Capital  \nIndex* or considering  the disclosure  of key or material findings  from  examinations.  \n \nMultiple  regulatory  agencies  can be effective \nA final  issue  is the growing  chorus  in many  countries  to reshape the  regulatory  structure,  \nor to at least  rationalize  the structure  we are creating  through regulatory  reforms.  This  has clearly  \nbecome an  important  topic  in Europe  with  the movement  to a single  supervisory  mechanism  and \na single  recovery  and resolution framework.  Structure  and design  are also important  features  in \nthe European Systemic  Risk  Board  and in individual  countries  as they  participate  in these \nconsolidated systems  while  also deciding  how  to meet  their  domestic  responsibilities  in \nsupervision. \nIn the United  States,  we face similar  coordination issues with  a new  Financial  Stability  \nOversight  Council, the  Consumer  Financial  Protection  Bureau,  and in meeting  our mandate for \nenhanced  supervis ion of  systemically  important  financial  institutions  at both the  bank and  non-\n                                                 \n* Hoeni g, Thomas.  “Capitalization  Ratios  for Global  Systemically  Important  Banks,”  at \nhttp://www.fdic.gov/about/learn/board/hoenig/capitalizationratios.pdf .  \n\n7 bank level.  This  is in addition to  our existing  supervisory  structure,  which  has been  often  \ncriticized  as structurally  flawed,  with  both state  and multiple  federal  banking  regula tors and other  \nregulators  for securities  and insurance  activities.  Given  the United  States’  record  in structuring  \nregulation, I am reluctant  to offer anyone  else advice on how  to design  a supervisory  system.  \nHowever,  my own  experience with  multiple  federal  regulators  and 50 state  supervisors  has \nshaped  my perspective on  how  and why  a complicated  regulatory  structure  can work.  \nWhere multiple  interests  exist —whether  that might be  bank or  non- bank  institutions,  \ndeposit  insurance  authorities,  central  banks, chartering  or consumer  protection  agencies,  or state  \nor federal  entities —it is  important  that the mandated  responsibilities  and the diversity  of views  \nbe reflected  in the supervisory  process . This  diversity  of views  helps  to prevent  one-sided  \napproaches  that might ignore  important  policy  considerations. An  essential  ingredient  in making  \nthis structure  work  and in achieving  all the different  objectives  is cooperation among  the \nappropriate  agencies.  \nIn the United  States,  and as a federal  regulator,  I have come to  appreciate the  value  of \neach state’s  interest  in banking  industry  outcomes  as it closely  relates  to the state’s  economic  \nsuccess.  To ensure that  all stakeholders  participate  meaningfully  in the supervisory  process,  this \nmeans  sharing  supervisory  data,  joint  participation  in examinations  and cooperative  rule-writing.  \nA benefit  of our structure  is that state  and federal  chartering  authorities  can oversee their  \nrespective institutions,  while  the FDIC  can use its supervisory  experience to  gain  better insight  \ninto its deposit  insurance  responsibilities.  The Federal  Reserve’s  role in supervision provides  \nimportant  knowledge  for carrying  out its discount  window  responsibilities , monetary  policy  \nformulation  and its macroprudential  supervisory  role. \n\n8 Of course,  the globalization  of finance  further complicat es this picture,  as we saw during  \nthe crisis  with  foreign  funding  exposures, cross -border  lending  and securities  holdings, and  \nresolutions  that spanned several  countries. Now we  are all involved in  international  efforts  to \nharmonize  capital,  liquidity  and resolution rules —none  of which  can be viewed  as a small \nchallenge.  It is crucial  that we learn  from  the recent  past and establish  strong  lines  of cooperation \nahead  of the next  crisis.   \n \nConclusion  \nLapse s in our supervisory  framework  contributed to the tremendous  and devastating  costs  \nto the global  economy  and demand  that we look for new  ways  to oversee a  complex  financial  \nsystem.  Yet, even  as we deploy  new  tools  and methods , we must  commit to  strengthen  \nmicro prudential  supervision, market  discipline  and cooperation among  regulators. Importantly,  \nthe courage  and leadership  to embrace and enforce  whatever  regime  we adopt  will in  the end \nmake all  the difference  to the outcomes  we seek .",

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n    \n     \n \n \nDebt, Deficits, and Financial Instability  \n21\nst Annual Hyman P. Minsky Conference  \nLevy Economics Institute of Bard College  \nNew York, New York  \nApril 11, 2012 \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers or representatives.  \n\n1 \n Introduction  \nI am very pleased to be here. Once again, the Levy Institute has come up with an \noutstanding program and one that  addresses a very timely and critical issue.   \nThere are many views about wha t went wrong in the financial markets and global \neconomy and what policy steps should now be taken to create a more stable and resilient \nfinancial sector.  To date, we have implemented a number  of changes in monetary, fiscal  and \nfinancial policies to contain the dam age and prevent future crises. Some of these policies focus \non short -term solutions, while others are more long -term focused.  \nIn my remarks, I will look at this issue largely from the longer -term need to build a \nstronger financial system structure.  I will first discuss our recent experience in the financial \nmarkets and where we may have gone wrong from a supervisory and institutional perspective. Then I will turn to what we must do from a long -term perspective to cr eate the type of financial \nsystem that will be better positioned to weather the next crisis.  \n \nOur Recent Experience  \nThis crisis is following much the same pattern of previous financial crises —an inability \nor unwillingness to see the warning signs  and take preventative action , followed by  massive \ndamage, and then working  through the emergency policy steps and the rebuilding  of our \nfinancial system . The aftermath of th is crisis left no question about the enormity of damage that \ncould be inflicted by a financial sector with too much leverage and risk. As a result , the steps we \nare taking to clean up the damage and begin long- term rebuilding take on added importance  \nbecause the polic ies we put in place now will influence —for better or worse —the  likelihood, \nnature  and severity of the next crisis. While we know we cannot prevent the next financial cris is, \n\n2 \n public policy and preventative steps play an important role in establishing the overall stability \nand resiliency of our financial system.  Consequently, getting  these steps right is essential if we \nare to avoid setting the stage for an even more severe crisis.  \nWe must also recognize that our resolve in dealing with financial crises unfortunately \ntends to diminish after a  crisis  passes.  Understandably, f inancial institutions want to get back \nquickly to a more profitable state , and the public wants a prompt and painless return to the \nprosper ity they enjoyed before the crisis.  As a result , policymakers and regulators can face \nsubstantial pressure to back off from implementing tighter oversight, especially if such oversight interferes with financial institutions going back to the ir usual  operat ing parameters.  \nMany policymakers and market participants thus become reluctant when it is time to \nmake the hard judgments about effective reforms and instituting greater risk restraints.  Signs of \nthis are already occurring with the efforts by financial institutions and others to weaken or delay stronger capital standards and other provisions of the Dodd- Frank Act.  Before elaborating on  \nthose issues, though, it is instructive to examin e some of the factors that led  to this crisis.   \nIndeed,  the housing bubb le was a major factor in the crisis, but there is one thing that \nstands  out to me as a banking supervisor: B oth the private marketplace and regulators had \nbecome complacent and greatly underestimated the risks taken on by our financial system.  \nToo many were convinced that we had entered a new era and fully believed that we had \nnew tools that could more accurately measure, price and control risk, even as financial instruments became far more complex and often were untested.  This belief, for instance, led \nsome to think that lower credit standards were simply another factor that could be priced into the terms of a subprime loan, thereby making such loans an acceptable risk. Or that bank leverage ratios were a thing of the past, especially because financial institutions and regulators could risk-\n\n3 \n weight assets and off -balance- sheet exposures and use quantitative risk models to come up with \n“better,” “more accurate,” and, invariably, lower measures of capital needs.  \nAnother factor in the crisis was misguided incentives to take on more risk. These \nincluded low short -term interest rates that encouraged financial institutions and other market \nparticipants to “borrow short and lend long” and to “search for yield.”  These funding and lending \nincentives, along with other factors such as the low Basel risk weights assigned to certain \nfinancial instruments, further motivated major institutions to adopt very similar risk exposures.  \nThese exposures, in turn, contributed to the liquidity and funding breakdowns that were central to this crisis.  Other misaligned incentives included the belief that larger institutions were “too big \nto fail” and the implicit guarantees behind the government -sponsored enterprise s and certain \nother parts of the financi al system —all  of which gave creditors and stockholders added \nprotection from default and less reason to be concerned about risk. \nWe also have had numerous changes in the structure of our financial markets over the \npast few decades, which have left us with a much different corporate culture in banking and finance.  In fact,  the new structure has brought with it a greater focus on short -term performance \nand more aggressive attitudes regarding ri sk-taking.  These changes include  a rapidly rising \nconcentration in the banking industry, withering away of the Glass -Steagall constraints on banks \nengaging in securities activities, and the growth of securitization and money and capital markets.  \nCultural change i n investment banking began to occur more than 40 years ago, when the \nNew York Stock Exchange relaxed its rules to allow member securities firms to break away from their partnership structure and adopt a corporate framework. With partnerships, the driving force had always been to safeguard the value of partnership interests by maintaining the long -run \nprosperity of the firm and developing new partners with similar objectives. Bringing in outside \n\n4 \n capital through conversion to a corporate structure —which  all major  securities firms did by \n1999—put  these firms under gre ater investor pressure to exploit short -term opportunities and \nengage in riskier strategies.  As banks took on more investment banking activities, competitive \npressures then led to similar changes in the culture of banking. The outgrowth of all these \nchanges in the financial system was a complacency and false confidence in new risk-management practices and a substantial  and largely unrecognized build- up in leverage and risk \nthat laid the groundwork for this crisis.  Unfortunately, the pendulum swung from conf idence that  \nwe could measure and control virtually any risk to the opposite —an  environment  during the \ncrisis  where market participants had virtually no idea how to price  many financial instruments \nnor how to determine  which institutions were still sound.  \n \nLooking to the Long R un \nIf we are to construct a stronger financial system, we must address the significant \nproblems and obvious shortcomings that led to the crisis.  First and foremost is to correct the \nmisaligned incentives and the improper expansion of f ederal safety net protections that \nencouraged and enabled institutions to take excessive risks. In addition, I believe we must return \nsupervision to its traditional role of exercising sound judgment and making informed decisions. In recent years, the super visor’s role has become a more passive one, with examiners spending \nmuch time monitoring regulatory c ompliance and tracking the risk -management practices \nadopted by financial institutions.  \nWith regard to correcting the incentives in banking, the most impor tant challenge we face \nis in constructing an appropriate, but carefully limited, public safety net. During this crisis, our safety net was stretched far beyond anything we had previously done, and this expansion in \n\n5 \n safety net protections has left us with a  broad and pervasive range of moral hazard issues. Not \nonly did we expand deposit insurance coverage during the crisis, but we also guaranteed bank \ndebt instruments, used the discount window to lend to nonbank institutions and conduct special lending progr ams, and bailed out large institutions and segments of the financial markets not \ncovered by the traditional safety net.  The largest financial institutions in the United States further \nreceived significant injections of public capital through TARP. Some would argue  the only ones \nnot protected from losses were the taxpayers.  \nIt is hardly a coin cidence that at the center of this crisis w ere a substantial expansion in \npublic safety nets and the presence of major financial institutions , which were treated as being \ntoo big to fail  (TBTF) . This linkage between expanded safety nets and TBTF institutions has  \nincreased in importance over the last few decades, with the growth of one linked to the  growth of \nthe other —all  in a cycle that poses a signi ficant threat to financial s tability . \nThis link between large institutions and special public support has left us trapped in a \npattern in which public authorities believe they must  expand the  safety net each time a crisis is  \nbrought on by excesses in risk- taking  at large institutions . This broadening of the safety net \nfacilitates  the next and even more severe crisis , as new moral hazard issues  are introduced and \nmajor institutions are left with  greater incentives for taking on risk. The critical and definin g \nquestion for us is how to  break  this pattern of growing safety nets and escalating crises, while \nrestor ing much -needed market discipline to the  financial system.  \nI believe the first and most important step that we can take is to eliminate  TBTF  policies . \nThis crisis provided overwhelming evidence that the ingrained response of policymakers is to treat our largest institutions as being TBTF.  With the help of bailouts, TARP money, the \ndiscount window , accommodative monetary policy  and other actions, our larg est institutions not \n\n6 \n only survived the crisis, but in many cases, emerged as even larger players in the financial \nsystem.  \nThe funding, capital  and other advantages that TBTF provides are enormous, and such \nadvantages —as seen in this crisis —remove  important  constraints on risk- taking that financial \ninstitutions would otherwise face from their stockholder s, creditors  and uninsured depositors. \nOne simple example of these advantages is that the five largest U.S. banking organizations in June 2009 wer e given rat ings on their senior  long -term bank debt that on average were four \nnotches higher than what they would have received based on their actual condition alone. One of these organ izations even received an eight -notch upgrade for being TBTF. In a very competitiv e \nmarketplace, such advantages are enormous and highly unfair to those institutions not receiving them.  These ratings advantages conti nue to exist after the crisis —albeit  at a notch or two less \nnow, and investors  have reason to believe that similar advantages may yet exist.   \nWhat can be done to address these moral hazard and TBTF issues?  The Dodd- Frank Act \nprovides an orderly liquidation authority for resolving the failure of a systemically important organization, thus adding to the existing framework  for closing insolvent or nonviable \ncommercial banks.  Having this legal framework, though, is only the first, and perhaps easiest, \nstep in dealing with TBTF.  In fact, during the recent crisis we had a number of powers that might \nhave  been used on TBTF institutions , but were not employed to any notable extent . I’ll offer just  \none example.  \nPart of the discipline associated with taking on expanded powers under the Gramm -\nLeach -Bliley Act was that all depository institutions  in a financial holding company were \nrequired  to remain  well capitalized and well managed.  If not, the company would have 180 days \nto correct the deficiencies or face divestiture of its depository institutions or termination of newly \n\n7 \n authorized financial a ctivities . To the extent that such divestitures or terminations might be \ndifficult to do in the midst of a crisis, the  Act gave the Federal Reserve the flexibility to grant \nadditional time  for such  restructuring s. One might fairly ask whether all of the  major financial \nholding companies  were in strict compliance with these provisions throughout the crisis  or \nwhether pursuing such actions  might have been justified .  \nThus , as we can see from this crisis, the most critical issue in addressing TBTF concerns \nis having policymakers with the resolve to follow through. In a crisis, there will always be \nconcerns about creditor or depositor panics, public confidence issues, interconnections with other \ninstitutions  and disruptions in financial services. While I believe these concerns often are \nexaggerated and can be minimized through the resolution frameworks we now have in place, others will almost certainly have different views.  What we must remember, though, is that \nending TBTF is the only sure way to curtail the expansion of public safety nets and break t he \npattern of repeated and ever -escalating financial crises.  \nA second step we must take is to strengthen bank capital standards  with particular \nemphasis on leverage requirements tied to equity capital. In addition, we should weigh carefully  \nthe lengthy transition period contemplated by Basel III.  There is risk that banks will be caught \nshort again if we adopt a lengthy phase -in period and let banks manage their capital down to the \nminimum transition standards throu gh substantial dividend payouts and stock buybacks.  \nI am cautious about relying heavily on risk- based capital standards for two reasons. First, \nbanks have been quick to arbitrage  whatever risk -based standards are in place, and second, it is \nhard to say tha t our risk weights have been accurate measures of risk.  For example, many \nmortgage -backed securities were constructed to marginally meet the requirements for lower risk \nweights . These risk weights , moreover, bore little relation to the losses banks took on such \n\n8 \n securities during  the crisis.  Instead, we must insist on capital standards that can fully protect \nagainst losses—both expected and unexpected —and we must avoid creating standards that give \ninstitutions incentives to adopt more concentrated risk expos ures.  \nI am also in favor of some constraints on the type of activities that can be conducted by \ninstitutions protected by the safety net.  The expansion in activities conducte d by banking \norganizations over the past few decades has greatly increased the lev el of complexity in such \norganizations, making effective management and supervision of these entities much more \ndifficult.  In addition, this growth in activities has brought with it a changing culture in banking —\none that is more characteristic of investmen t banking  and other parts of the capital markets .  \nAccordingly , the major banking organizations have become much more concerned about \nexploiting short -term opportunities and expanding their risk  exposures , and many of the financial \nincentives provided to key personnel in banking organizations have become more closely aligned with those in investment banking. For these reasons, I support the goals of the Volcker Rule in \neliminating proprietary trading by bank and thrift organizations , and I hope we can deve lop an \nappropriate regulatory and supervisory framework to implement these provisions . We should \nalso take a careful look at other financial activities and their compatibility with public safety nets  \nto avoid a replay of the expanded safety nets and the public assistance that was provided to \nfinancial institutions in  this crisis .  \nMy final comments concern the role of bank examiners. Increasingly, examiners have \nhad to spend more time reviewing risk -management practices at banks and compliance with a \nwide variety of regulations. Th ese demands will grow  as examiners become more involved in \nstress tests, enhanced supervision, living wills and other features of the Dodd- Frank Act.  \n\n9 \n While I recognize these aspects of supervision warrant examiner attention, they should \nnot detract from the more traditional and time -tested efforts of examiners in  verify ing the quality \nof a bank’s assets, understanding  the bank’s business model  and evaluat ing lending standards \nand other factors that shape  risk within a bank. In my e xperience, t he judgments and decisions by \nexaminers typically provide the earliest warning signal of problems at a bank , and we must \ncontinue to provide examiners with the independence and authority to fulfill this role. Also, as \nimpartial observers, exami ners are likely to be in the best position to identify the type of risk \nexposures and conditions that could lead to a crisis, particularly in the case of examiners who have dealt with previous crises. In fact, d uring my career in supervision, I have seen no substitute \nfor the judgment of experienced examiners . This crisis further indicates the need to have \nexaminers with the ability and knowledge to distinguish between institutions that are viable entities capable of withstanding significant financial distr ess and those that can no longer \ncontinue in their current condition. \nThe br eakdown of risk models and risk- management practices during the crisis also  tells \nme that we must not view stress tests, other  forms of quantitative analysis  and models used by \nmacroprudential supervisors as being a substitute or replacement for examiners and onsite supervision. In particular, the breakdown we have seen in models -based approaches suggests that \nwe should not develop a false sense of security from the stress tests and other new supervisory \ntools we are now putting in place. While these tools can be useful additions to supervision, we must recognize the  very important and unique role that examiners have in supervision and their \nability to  bring a strong sense of reality and caution to the oversight of the financial system.  \nMicroprudential supervision must re main an essential and central part of our supervisory \nframework.  \n\n10 \n  \nConcluding Comments  \nWe now face a real challenge in rebuilding our financial system and its supervisory \nframework.  The steps we take today  will either serve us well in the inevitable future financial \nshock, or they will sow the seeds of the next crisis. If we are to be successful, though, we must \nstop and ask ourselves what really went wrong this time and what can we do to construct a more \nstable and resilient financial system.  \nI would like to conclude with a thought very aptly expressed in the Central Ba nk of \nNorway’s 2009 Financial Stability Report: “It is difficult to estimate the probability and price the risk of all possible outcomes in financial markets.  This particularly applies to events that occur \nrarely and have not occurred for a long time…In the long term, public authorities have an important role to play in maintaining a collective memory of previous crises.”",

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n                 \nConference of State Bank Supervisors  \nState -Federal Supervisory Forum  \nSavannah, Ga.  \nMay 22, 2012  \n \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers or representatives.  \n  \n\n \n It is a pleasure to be with you today . I have  been coming to these meetings for a number \nof years , and I  have always  appreciated that key supervisory issues that are  highly  relevant to all \nof our agencies  are consistently highlighted on the agenda. This forum provides a  unique \nopportunity for the state and federal agencies to shar e view s and to learn from one another. In \naddition, t his year’s agenda has broadened the forum to include not only state supervisors and \ntheir federal counterparts, but also the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency as regulator of \nfederal charters and the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.   \nSome have questioned  whether this diversity of regulators and views can be effective in \ntoday’s global financial market and whether the current regulatory structure is outdated and \ninefficient.  Over the years, various reforms have been proposed to improve efficiency and \neffectiveness by removing diversity . Even so, the dual banking system in the United States has \nremain ed firmly anchored in the modern world of banking and finance. And over the past 150 \nyears , financial markets in the United States  have developed into world- class centers of capital \nand have led financial innovation. \nCan this diverse regulatory model serve us well in the next ce ntury and allow the United \nStates  to maintain a strong, efficient and innovative banking system ? Does  an increasingly \nconcentrated banking industry demand fewer regulators?  Let me explain why I think this \nstructure has not only survived for 150 years but has proven to be so durable and responsive to our dynamic economy . And what will it take for the system to remain relevant going forward?  \n \nDevelopment and G rowth of the U.S. B anking S ystem\n \nThe United States ’ econom y has benefitted tremendously from  a diverse banking system  \nthat provided the means for efficiently allocating capital from savers to borr owers.  Thousands of \n\n \n state-chartered and federal -chartered financial institutions, most of which are small community \nbanks , allow credit to flow to individuals and businesses , even in remote areas of our country.  \nThe dual banking system owes its beginnings to the introduction of federally  chartered \nbanks with the passage of the National Bank Act of 1864. Prior to that, commercial banks were \ninitiall y organized under charters  granted by state legislatures —a process that became highly \npoliticized . The next step was states ’ instituting free banking laws, which allowed anyone to \nopen a bank as long as they could meet the standards specified in a  state’s banking laws.  Then \ncame the National Bank Act.  While the primary motivation for th is act appears to have been to \nhelp finance the Civil War, the a ct’s basic provisions mirrored key aspects of the free banking \nlaws that states had adopted —specifically free entry and flexibility to adapt to a changing \neconomy. Thus began the competition between state and national bank charters and the emergence of a dual banking system.  \nA report on the dual banking system prepared by the Federal Reserve in 1 930 makes it \nclear that this  system was not intentional.  Rather, as the report claims, it was expected that the \nintroduction of a federal charter and a subsequent tax on state bank notes would incent bankers  to \nconvert to federal  charters . The Fed’s 1930 report raised a number of questions about the need \nfor such a structure and noted various issues with advantages of one charter over the other. Concerns were expressed about the quality of state bank supervision—not unlike the 2012 study to be presented tomorrow. However, I firmly believe that we have a stronger supervisory system —both at the state and federal levels —as a result of dual banking.  \n \n \n\n \n Innovation and Improvement through the  Dual Banking  System  \nThe d ual banking  system  has provided and continues to offer significant benefits to our \nfinancial system and the economy. One of the primary benefits of dual banking is that the \nmultiple options for state and federal charters have led to considerable innovation and \nimprovement in  banking  services . We  have seen these benefits from the beginning.  \nFor example, it  has allowed local bankers, state supervisors and state governments to \nconstruct a banking system closely attuned to the economic needs of each state and supervised by perso nnel with a strong knowledge of the structure and condition of the local econom y. State \nlegislatures and supervisors have a long history of adopting their own set of prudential laws and regulations, consumer protection statutes, and bank chartering and expansion laws —all of which \ngenerally reflect the needs of each state.  \nA second example occurred s oon after the national banking system was esta blished. \nWhile the National Bank Act created greater competition for state chartering authorities and state banks, the playing field became steeply tilted against state banks in 1865 when the a ct was \namended to tax  the issuance of state bank notes.  As you would expect , this competitive \ndisadvantage led to a sharp decline in state banks from about 1,500 in 1864 to about 250 in 1868, whereas the number of national banks rose to about 1,650.  \nCertainly these reforms must have portended the end of state -chartered banking. But s tate \nbanks were able to overcome this uneven playing field and demonstrate their res ilience by taking \nadvantage of the growing importance of  demand deposits a nd the significant benefits they \noffered compared to bank notes . Within 10 years after the note tax, state banks had more deposits \nthan national banks , and within 25 years, there wer e more state banks (about 3,500) than national \nbanks ( about 3,100) .  \n\n \n Since then, a number of innovations resulted from changes in state banking laws . Most \nnotably , we’ve seen the development of NOW accounts, adjustable rate mortgages, home equity \nloans, and interstate banking through the use of regional compacts and nationwide entry laws \nprior to the eventual passage of national interstate banking.  \n \nChoice of Regulators  \nAnother benefit of the dual banking system is that the option to choose a regulator has \nmade bank supervision and regulation much stronger and more efficient. When the National \nBank Act was passed, the choice was between a  state banking regulator and the OCC . Since \nthen, the choice has expanded further with the addition of the Federal Reserve and Federal \nDeposit Insurance Corp. as federal regulator y options  for state banks . In fact, the choice is even \ngreater today because interstate banking allows stat e banks to choose among state banking \nauthorit ies. \nCritics of the dual banking system and the regulatory structure often claim that providing \nbanks a choice of regulator reduces bank safety and soundness and the stability of the financial system by creatin g a “race to the bottom.”  Regulatory choice, they say, leads to regulatory laxity \nas regulators compete among themselves f or larger portfolios  of supervised institutions .  \nThis is an argument without merit, in my view . I have never seen this among the bank \nregulators in my 30 years  at the Federal Reserve. In fact, I find it to be a strange argument, \nespecially when made by economists, because competition is the process that makes market economies efficient.  Choice among regulators provides an important incentive to improve \nexamination processes and ensures examiners have timely training.   \n\n \n Indeed, I would argue that providing banks regulatory choice serves as a check and \nbalance on  supervisory authorities so that they are not  so restrictive that banks are  unable to \nprovide the credit necessary for economic growth. Importantly, I’ve seen no evidence that other \nregulatory structures , including single regulator models, fared better in the most recent crisis.  \n \nPreserving the D ual B anking S ystem  \nYet if the dual banking system is to serve us well going forward, we must be willing to \nmake adjustments that adapt to a changing financial sector . One challenge is in providing states \nwith enough leeway to continue to implement laws and supervis e banks in  a manner most \nconducive to local interests and the state economy. Federal laws have continued to expand in an \neffort to create a more consistent framework across all banks —both state and national. While \nmuch of this is necessary in a nationwide banking  system, we must be careful to strike the right \nbalance in limiting the preemption of state laws and in respecting the authority of state supervisors and legislators. If we fail to achieve this balance, we risk losing many important \nbenefits of the dual ba nking system.   \nIn my view, another critical  challenge is making sure that supervision and regulation are \nconsistent across regulatory agencies and over time, as well as appropriately calibrated to  a \nbank’s business model, activities and complexity .  \nThere are many examples of coordination and cooperation. The Federal Financial \nInstitutions Examination Council is clearly an important forum for coordination and cooperation \namong the state and federal agencies.  State and federal agencies also accept  each other’s exam \nreports and share exam report software.  Also, the Conference of State Bank  Supervisors , state \n\n \n banking agencies, the FDIC and the Federal Reserve cooperated closely in setting up the \nprotocol for the seamless supervision of state banks  operating on an interstate basis. \nWe’ve been successful , although it has not always been easy, in working across agencies \nto discuss, debat e and develop joint notices of proposed rulemakings and to finalize  rules.  If we \nare to achieve our common goal of w ell-managed, well -capitalized  and well -supervised banks, \nwe will need to redouble our efforts to work together in this way.  \nIn closing, it is clear to me that the dual banking system has benefited the U.S. banking \nsystem and the overall economy since its establishment nearly 150 years ago. The diversity provided by this system allowed our economy to grow and to be the most vibrant, innovative and strongest in the world. This system has served the country well for many years, and I believe with the commitme nt of those here today it is a system that can continue to serve the public \ninterest and responsibly promote  economic growth for years to come.",

George  \nPresident and CEO  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2012 Community Banking Conference  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \nKansas City, Mo.  \nNovember 2, 2012  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers or representatives.  \n\n1 \n Introduction  \nCommunity banks are a n important part of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s \nregional economy , and we have significant supervisory responsibilities  for those banks and  their \nholding compa nies. Certainly, we recognize the challenges facing community banks  today . In \nfact, some have question ed whether community banks will be able to effectively compete going \nforward . Others remain optimistic and continue to see opportunities for the community bank \nmodel , as discussed this morning .  \nWithout question, t he recent financial cris is and slow economic recovery are now \nfocusing much attention on the banking industry and its regulatory framework.  In particular, the \nDodd -Frank Act and the proposed Basel III capital rules are bringing major changes to the \nregulatory structure . These include  the new Financial Stability Oversight Council and Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau, enhanced supervision and orderly liquidation authority for \nsystemically important organizations, a new regulatory regime for the capital markets and \nfinancial i nfrastructure, and higher and more complex capital requirements . \nUnderstandably, w e often hear from community bankers that they do not expect this \nchanging environment to work  well for them . These bankers  anticipate  being hit with  significant \nregulatory costs  for a crisis that originated in other parts of the financial system . I have similar \nconcerns about the current direction of regulatory policy and how it may negatively affect the \nability of commun ity banks  to be competitive  and serve the credit needs of their communities . \nToday I will discuss my concerns and the importance of ensuring a more equitable landscape for \ncommunity banks.   \n  \n \n \n\n2 \n Previous Challenges  for Community Banks  \nI should begin by acknowledging that community bankers are no strangers to a \nchallenging operating environment.  Over the past few decades, c ommunity banks have \nencountered many challenges and developments that were often thought to favor larger \ninstitutions and threaten the future of community bank s. Some of you here today experienced  \nthose challenges . \nWhen I started at the Federal Reserve  in 1982 , bank expansion laws  were viewed as a \nserious threat . In many parts of our District, we still had a unit banking structure in which banks \ncould only operate o ut of a single office or perhaps with a few  additional limited -service  \nfacilities . Several  District states also did not allow multibank holding companies, and interstate \nbanking was nonexistent  outside of a few special exceptions . \nWhen efforts were begun to relax these expansion restrictions, a common assertion was \nthat larger, expansion -minded institutions would invade  community bank  market s and steal their \nbusiness . We often heard t hat “Multibank holding companies would be the death of  the \ncommunity bank.”  As it happened , the liberalization of bank expansion laws still left many \ncommunity banks in operation , albeit with some reduction in the ir number s and overall share of \nindustry assets.  Many well -managed community banks have been able  to capitalize on this new \nexpansion framework by making acquisitions of their own and spreading their skills over a large r \nbase of operations.  In fact, about  60 percent of bank mergers since 1985 have involved one \ncommunity banking organization acquiring another one.  \nSimilarly, w hen deposit interest rate ceilings were removed in the 1980s , community \nbankers were concerned that larger  banks would be able and wi lling to pay more for deposits \nthan community banks —an outcome many claimed would pull  deposit s out of  community banks \n\n3 \n and destroy  their net interest margins.  Technological change was also thought to favor large \nbanks because they had the resources to be on the cutting edge of such developments as ATM \nnetworks, online banking, automation of banking operat ions, new financial instruments  and risk -\nmanagement models . Finally, community banks have seen c ertain lending and product markets \nshift to larger institutions , captive finance companies , credit unions  and the capital markets.  \nAmong these shifts  have been  credit card  lending , auto loans, equipment lending  and the \ndominant role community banks once had as the principal repository for their customer s’ \nsavings . \nIn all of these cases, community banks have established an innovat ive track record, \nwhether it is an increased ability to manage funding needs by paying competitive deposit  rates , \ndevelop their own expertise in technology and find vendors to provide other services , or discover \nnew services to provide to customers . To be sure, the community bank  business model has \nproven resilient and able to withstand significant challenges when bo ards of directors and their \nmanagement teams demand strong performance and are willing to be flexible and ready to \ncapitalize on new opportunities.  \n \nWhat Characteristics Allow Community Banks to Survive and Pro sper?  \nUnderstanding how community banks successfully overcame these challenges is \nimportant, especially as we consider the direction of today’s financial reforms. I’d like to \nhighlight a couple of studies we’ve done to analyze this.  \nFirst, community banks generally operate with t he right incenti ves and a n effective  \ncorporate governance structure . Many community banks are closely held institutions with the top \nmanage ment  and board members having significant ownership positions.  These ownership \n\n4 \n incentives help to ensure that key policymakers are committed to achieving good performance, \nhave enough a t stake to avoid excessive risk -taking, and also have a vested interest in the health \nof their communities.  This is well understood by community bankers , and it stands in sharp \ncontrast to some of the governance problems apparent at larger banks , especially during the \ncrisis.  Few outside of the community banking sector, though, fully understand the significance \nand implications of this governance structure.  \nThe s taff of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City has conducted several studies o n \nthe ownership and management structure of community banks .1 We found  that the better \nperforming and safer community banks are those where the major policymakers ha ve much to \nlose if they d o not  make the right decisions.  This concl usion  is significant when we consider  how \ncommunity banks should be supervised compared to larger banking organizations.  \nAnother commonly noted  strength of community banks is that they have close \nrelationships with and detailed knowledge of their customers.  As a general practice,  community \nbanks do  not make “cookie -cutter” loans  and do not offer the same standardized products  as \nlarger banks , but instead tailor their services to the needs  of their customers.  \nWhile  many now claim that the value of customer relationships is declining with credit \nscoring and credit risk models, a recent study at our Bank found that there is real value in \nrelationship  lending and in the soft personal information on customers that community bankers \ntypically have.   \nThis study looked at a large sample of Small Business Administration  loans made by \ncommunity banks  to new businesses and to other businesses with blemished credit records . \n                                                           \n1 Robert DeYoung, Kenneth Spong, Richard J. Sullivan, “Who’s minding the store? Motivating and monitoring hired \nmanagers at small, closely held commercial banks,” Journal of Banking and Finance , July 2001, pp. 1209 -1243; and \nRichard J. Sullivan and Kenneth R. Spong, “Manager wealth concentration, ownership structure, and risk in \ncommercial banks,” Journal of Financial Intermediation , April 2007, pp. 229 -248.  \n\n5 \n Given the inherent risk in such loans , one might expect that having a good personal knowledge \nof these customers would be useful . Not surprisingly, the study found  that default rates on these \nloans were indeed lower when the lending was to businesses  located in the same market as the  \nbank . Defaults were higher  when the borrowers were in a different  market where the bank would \nnot be expected to have the same type of  close personal relationship s with th ese borrower s. \nFurthe rmore , the lowest default rates were in smaller communities where local  banker s \ntypically have lifelong knowledge of their customer s and the closest personal relationships.  This \nresearch suggests that community banks fulfill a very important function in es tablishing close \nrelationships and directing credit to customers whose needs might otherwise go unserved . This \nevidence suggests that policymakers must understand the business model dynamics and \nincentives for banks of all sizes  and must carefully consider the implications of new reg ulation, \nits cost and benefit, and its unintended consequences.  \n  \nA More Equitable and Rational Path for Community Banks  \nGoing forward , community bankers  will be challenged once again to find way s to be \nsuccessful in a  difficult environment, ranging from a n economy that is growing slow ly amid  an \ninterest rate environment that is not especially  conducive to good banking , to a complex and \nburdensome regulatory regime . I will focus my remarks on the latter.  \nThe challenges of regulatory compliance have long ranked among c ommunity bankers ’ \ntop concerns.  And you and I both know that the industry and regulators view risk differently.  For \nexample, in 2006, the banking regulators issued interagency guidance  regarding commercial real \nestate concentrations.  Prior to issuing this guidance, w e received thousands of letters from the \nindustry and members of Cong ress question ing the guidance and causing regulators to back \n\n6 \n away.  As it turned out, some bankers would have been well served to heed this warning.  So, we \nbelieve supervision and regulation can and should play an important role . That said, h aving been \ninvolved in community bank supervision for 30 years, today’s regulatory issues , in my view , \nhave different i mplications .  \nAs you are well aware, m uch of the new regulation is a reaction  to the shortcomings and \nproblems at large banks and within capital markets that contributed to this crisis . Their business \nmodel and related activities and practices , combined with lax supervision , have been well \ndocumented.   The result is a  new regulatory environment  that is substantially at odds with how \ncommunit y banks actually operate.  \nFor example, r esidential mortgage lending is likely to become much more complica ted \ndespite the focus on simplifying disclosures.  This complexity includes new provisions defining \nqualified mortgage loans, requirements regarding a borrower’s ability to repay the loan, risk -\nretention standards, and an array of risk weights under Basel III based on standard mortgage \nlending terms.  In addition, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will be rewriting many of \nthe key regulations related to mortgage lending.  \nThis approach of specifying how residential mortgage loans should be structured and \nunderwritten will undoubtedly leave community bankers with far less flexibility and authority to \ntailor such lending to the characteristics of their communities  and customers.  Because of this , it \nis not uncommon to hear commu nity bankers say that th ey may be  force d to cut back \nsubstantially on their home lending activities or even eliminate them entirely.  Such unintended \nconsequences are costly and impede mortgage lending at a time when housing markets are weak.  \nNew capital ru les, known as Basel III , contain  a variety of features that could have a \nsignificant effect on community banks if they are adopted as originally proposed.  I know this \n\n7 \n because I read all 1,000 pages of the draft rule. Some of these include higher and more complex \nrisk weights for selected types of loans and securities, inclusion of unrealized gains and losses on \ncertain debt securities in regulatory capital calculations, the treatmen t of trust preferred securities  \nand additional capital dedu ctions of mortgage servicing assets . \nTo be clear,  I absolutely support efforts to increase the level of capital in our largest \nbanks and improve the quality of this capital,  but I find many of these rules to be costly for \ncommunity banks and of little publ ic benefit  for this part of the industry . Risk weights based on \nstandardized lending terms, for instance, completely ignore the data I referenced earlier —that \nlending relationships and personal information are of substantial value to community banks in \ncontrolling credit risks.  Nor do the higher, more complex risk weights , as well as  the restrictive \nprovisions of Dodd -Frank , accurately reflect the low loss rates that community banks typically \nexperienced on the ir residential mortgage lending and small bu siness  lending  during the crisis . In \naddition, Basel III will almost certainly lead to greater fluctuations in regulatory capital levels at \ncommunity banks even though the underlying assets and risks may not have changed much.  \nFurthermore , we should not forget that  the proposed Basel III rules are designed to be a \nthree -pillar approach, linking capital requirements with supervision and market discipline . \nUnfortunately,  I think  the complexity embedded in the proposed capital requirements fai ls to \nacknowledge that supervisory and market assessments of a bank’s capital are critical factors in \njudging capital adequacy.  In my experience, t he supervision of community banks clearly \nprovides a more refined measure of risk than can be achieve d with o ne-dimensional , static  risk \nweights . And, b ased on the performance of risk weights in the recent crisis, I support efforts to \nstrengthen our supervisory regime for large banking institutions to balance the assessment of risk \nbeyond quantitative measures of  capital.   \n\n8 \n We should also acknowl edge that market discipline plays an important role in community \nbanks.  As our studies have shown, the ownership and management structure of community banks \nprovide s important incentives , as does a strong  corporate governance framework . In the end, \ncommunity bankers know  they are not “too big to fail” and must manage their operations and \nrisk exposures accordingly . \nOverall, the  strength of  the community banking model should tell us that a regulatory \nformat aimed at the largest banking organ izations and the recent crisis is not likely to be a good \nfit for community banks.  Some have advocated for a different regulatory framework for \ncommunity  banks to recognize the difference in business models of large and small banks.  At \nbest, though, this strikes me as only a partial fix.  Until we address the incentive problems and \n“too big to fail” status of our largest financial institutions , the entire financial sector —indeed the \nentire economy —will be vulnerable to future crises.  For that reason, I would argue that we must \nalso take steps to ensure that the largest institutions operate under a framework that encourages \nsafe and sound banking and allows for failure of mismanaged risk.  \n \nConclusion  \nIn closing, h istory has shown that w ell-managed and innovative community banks are \nwell position ed to handle  the challenges of the future and to take advantage of  new opportunities.  \nThe new regulatory challenges,  though, may be a different type of battle.  I have been involved in \ndiscussions to encourage r egulators to take steps to ensure that commun ity banks are not put at a \ndisadvantage by laws and rules  meant to fix problems that do not exist in community banks . This \nReserve Bank is fully committed to this objective , and I encourage all of you to sh are your \nthoughts with us and with other regulatory agenc ies at every opportunity.",

This has certainly been a challenging period for bank supervisors  who took a \nvariety of ad hoc steps during the crisis to deal with troubled institutions and markets , worked to \nmaintain core financial services  and public confidence , and are now  issuing and  implementing a \nlong list of reforms .  \nDespite these well -intentioned  efforts, we should consider whether  the regulatory reforms  \nreflect an effective  response to the issues that surfaced in the recent financial crisis.  Further, we \nshould look to lessons from the past to understand to what extent the approaches used during the \nfinancial crisis may at least partially explain why many countries around the world  are \nexperiencing an economic recovery that has been agonizingly slow.  \nTo illustrate this p oint, I will first look at the policy approaches taken in previous cris is \nperiods  and examine what worked best and what did not. Then I will compare  the response to the \nrecent financial collapse with successful approaches  from the past.  Finally, I will dis cuss my \nview that t here are policy shortcomings that still need to be addressed and ways that we can  \nprovide for a stronger recovery.  \n \nLessons from Previous Crises  \n  As the side effects of the 2008 crisis ha ve lingered and turned into a very slow recovery \nprocess, several reasons  have been given as possible explanations for this  experience . One idea, \nfor example, is  that financial crises are unique  and it takes much longer to recover from them \nthan other econom ic downturns.  Similarly, some contend  that asset price bubble s produce a \n“balance sheet recession .” As a result, people  must  first try to pay down debt and increase \n\n2 \n savings, thus leaving monetary policy and low interest rates less effective in encouraging \nborrowing and expansion.  Another contention is that banks must first work off their bad assets \nand restore capital before they are in position to help promote a recovery.   \n  While all of these carry some truth, we have had major  financial crises in the pas t. In a \nnumber of  cases, the outcomes have been better, setting the stage for relati vely faster recoveries \nwhile also limiting any moral hazard problems that might be carried forward . \n \nUnited States, Sweden and Japan  \n  What the United States did to address  the banking panic  of the 1930s  became the model \nfor much of what was done in Sweden and eventually in Japan.  The banking crisis of the 1930s \nwas the most severe in U.S. history , with the total number of commercial banks declining by \n9,000 , or nearly 40 pe rcent, from the beginning of 1930 to the end of 1933.  About 4,000 banks \nfailed in 1933 alone.  \n  After a one -week banking holiday was declared in March 1933, the Reconstruction \nFinance Corporation (RFC), which was a public entity established in the 1930s to  provide \nsupport to ailing banks and businesses , joined with the banking authorities to quickly assess the \ncondition of every U .S. bank . Each bank was then placed into one of  three categories.  The first  \ncategory included  sound banks that were generally thought to have adequate capital.  A second \ngroup included banks that had lost most of their capital but still had the resources and ability to \nprotect depositors  and remain  viable , and a third group consisted of failing  banks that had lost all \nof their cap ital and would not be able to pay off their depositors in full.  Notably, i n making these \nevaluations, the RFC established a policy that every  bad asset in a bank must  first be written \ndown to its realistic economic value.  \n\n3 \n   The banks in the first group were then reopened promptly after the bank holiday, and \nbanks in the second group were reopened after raising new capital privately or by se lling \npreferred stock to the RFC.  Banks in the third category were placed into conserva torships.  The \nRFC also insisted that any needed changes be made in a bank’s management before RFC funds \nwere injected.  \n  Overall, the RFC was highly successful in promptly restructuring, recapitalizing and \nrestoring public confidence in a U .S. banking syst em that had been in a sharp downward spiral.  \nNearly all of the RFC funds were eventually repaid with virtually no loss to taxpa yers.  Also, the \nRFC’s insistence  that bad assets be written  down to realistic values and poor management be \nreplaced helped to minimiz e moral hazard issues.  The economy continued to remain weak  in the \nyears after 1933 due to a variety of factors, such as the substantial disruption in financial \nintermediation from bank failures, zero interest rates and extreme caution on the part of \nbusinesses to expand their operations by  making new investments and hiring new workers.  \nDespite the soft recovery,  the banking sector  encountered few problems after 1933.  \n   In Sweden, a speculative boom in real estate and bank credit , along with unsustainable \nexchange rate policies,  led to a severe economic downturn and banking crisis  in the early 1990s . \nActions by Swedish authorities closely followed what the RFC did in the  United States.  Swedish \nbanks were classified into three categories that w ere patterned after the RFC approach . This \nanalysis led to a governmental takeover of two of Sweden’s six largest banks, with a third bank \nneeding to raise additional capital.  To restore confidence during the crisis, the Swedish \ngovernment instituted tempo rary guarantees for bank depositors and creditors but left \nstockholders at risk.  \n\n4 \n   One additional element employed in Sweden was the  use of asset management \ncorporations to acquire and resolve the bad assets of the two banks that were taken over . Thus, \ntwo healthy bank ing operations  were  returned to private ownership without significant delay.  As \na result of these steps and a strong economic recovery, the Swedish banking crisis was resolved \nmore quickly than generally expected and at little or no cost to ta xpayers.  \n  In contrast to Sweden, Japan ese authorities  were slow to address the ban king problems \nthat arose after Japan’s  real estate crash in the early 1990s.  Japanese banks became swamped \nwith substantial volumes of bad assets and had little real capital  to support their operations.  As a \nresult , Japan suffered through a series of severe credit crunches for muc h of the 1990s —the so - \ncalled “Lost Decade .” \n  Japan ese authorities  finally took action beginning in 1998 to deal with bank insolvency \nissues and to inject capital into the remainder of the banking system, using the RFC model as a \nguide for these actions.  These capital injections largely ended the credit crunch and were l ater \npaid back with out loss to taxpayer s. \n  A final example  is the thrift crisis in the United States in the 1980s.  This crisis arose from \nthrift institutions holding 30 -year, fixed -rate mortgage loans during a period of rapidly rising \ninterest rates in th e early 1980s.  As market rates jumped well above the contractual rates on \nmany of these loans, a significant number of thrifts were faced with both funding and insolvency \nissues.  However, there was little public commitment  to deal with these issues, given an \ninadequate amount in the thrift insurance fund and little support in Congress for allocating \nmoney to clean up the industry.   \n  Unfortunately, t he primary  response was to give thrifts a wider range of powers in the \nhope of  provid ing a new way out of the ir problems while allowing them to continue operating on \n\n5 \n little, if any, capital base.  This framework led to serious moral hazard issues and a surge in \ncommercial real estate lending by problem thrifts . By the end of the 1980s, a greatly expanded  \nfederal b ailout was needed for  the thrift  industry . \n  The lessons from these previous financial crises are clear.  First, the quickest way to \nrestore prosperity and financial stability is to identify the losses in the financial system and take \ntimely and concerted action to address them.  A guiding rule for supervisors should be that o nce a \nloss in the financial system is incurred, it will not go away on its own and will only delay the \nchances for recovery  and increase the eventual costs . \n  Second, supervisors must b e in a position to identify whic h institutions are viable and \ncapable of surviving a crisis . Supervisors also  need to determine  which institutions  are insolvent  \nand must be  resolved while providing a  chance to  bring them  back to private ownership under  \nnew and more capable management.  \n  Third, moral hazard issues must be considered in the steps take n. Whenever possible , \nregulators should  pursue actions that force the responsible parties to take losses and minimize \nfuture problems.  \n \nRecovering from the R ecent Crisis  \n  Faced with uncertain ty and urgency,  the United States and many other countries did not \nturn to  these lessons or the  crisis resolution model that was used in the United States in the 1930s \nand later adopted in Sweden and eventually in Japan.  In the United States, for instance, public \nauthorities provided significant liquidity assistance and debt guarantees  during the recent \nfinancial crisis , but did  little to pursue corrective measures when granting this assistance.  \n\n6 \n   For example, t he Troubled  Asset Relief Program (TARP), which was used to inject \npublic capital into U .S. banks, did not follow  the key principles that were used by the RFC in \n1930s to strengthen banks and avoid moral hazard problems.  Unlike the RFC, TARP injected \nfunds indiscriminately into all the major U .S. banks . No attempt was made to  put these banks \ninto different categories based on their condition and viability . Neither were they required to first \nwrite down their problem assets  to gain a perspective into capital needs  and to  force a balance \nsheet cleanup  and minimize  moral hazard concerns.  Equally important, there was no effort to \nassess the quality of management and to insist on changes when needed.  Instead,  attention and \nrestrictions were tied to limiting executive compensation and bonuses after the fact and not to the \nmore critical question of management  capability .  \n  Perhaps one could ar gue that the 2008 crisis was different and did  not lend itself well to \nthe type of actions taken in previous crises.  For example, many claim that today’s financial \ninstruments  are less transparent and are harder to evaluate and price.  Another factor may be the \nsystemic nature of many of the institutio ns involved in this crisis and the global nature of the \ncrisis itself.  \n  These and other characteristics  certainly merit consideration . However , the slow nature of \nthis recovery, the limited amount of new lending after more than four years  and the continuation \nof banking issues  in some countries may suggest that the actions we took left unresolved \nproblems.  In addition, we must consider whether what we are doing is sustainable in the long run \nor whether it only increase s the chance of  futur e crises.   \n  We should first ask ourselves if we have corrected the misaligned incentiv es that were \nbehind this crisis.  Quite clearly, a major issue in the United States and many other countries \nduring the crisis was the public assistance and protection that was given to banks deemed “too \n\n7 \n big to fail.”  We cannot expect to have a sound financial system if the key players in it are not \nheld fully responsible for the choices they make.  \n  The traditional safety nets in most countries already provide incentives for added risk -\ntaking that we all attempt to address, albeit imperfectly, through regulation  and supervision . \nAdding too -big-to-fail protections into our safety nets not only further distorts these risk-taking \nincentives but also puts a much greater degree of pressure on the supervisory framework.  \nEnhanced supervision and the related steps many of us are taking now are unlikely to work well \nas long as major institutions still have incentives to take on added risk.  \n  Another incentive  problem  we should think about is the Basel risk weights.  Regulators \nhave spent a great deal of effort trying to construct a quantitativ e system for linking capital needs \nto risk levels.  Yet the financial crisis has clearly demonstrated that mortgage loans, mortgage -\nbacked securities and sovereign debt were  not the low -risk assets as designated under the Basel \nstandards.  We have also seen that institutions have a remarkable ability to circumvent  standards \nas long as they have an incentive to do so . \n  Regulatory capital measures undoubtedly gave us a misleading picture during the crisis —\nin part because we were reluctant to require that bank holdings be written down to their actual \nvalues, but also because these capital measures failed to  pick up the steep decline in capital that \nbecame evident in  market capitalization  figures  and other market -based measures of capital.  To \nme, all these issues imply that we must have a strong leverage constraint to counteract any \nshortcomings that may exist in risk-based capital standards .  \n  Along with strong leverage ratios, we must have the correct supervisory focus , \nparticularly since  we have not carefully followed some of the lessons of previous crises . For \ninstance, d o we still need to clean up the banks and insist on better management?  In previous \n\n8 \n crises, the first step to a successful recovery was to  admit that some banks had faile d and could \nonly be brought back to life with better management and a clean balance sheet.  \n  With regard to other aspects of supervisory focus , I am especially concerned that we may \nforget the importance of our traditional supervisory tools —microprudential supervision, careful \nexaminer assessments of credit and other banking risks and our evaluations of the quality of bank \nmanagement . Today we are focused on enhanced supervision of the systemically important \nfinancial institutions, stress tes ts, macroprudential supervision  and many other reforms . These \nsteps will not get us very far if we don’t first address the incentive problem s in our financial \ninstitutions , insist on better  bank management  wherever needed and emphasize our traditional \nsupervisory framework.  \n  Enhanced supervision and stress tests, for instance, are likely to draw many resources \naway from traditional supervision.  While the se new supervisory tools have been  useful exercises, \nin the end they may become little more than rou tine, repetitive steps  in satisfying regulatory \nrequirements —much like the Basel risk weights —without contributing to a more effective \nsupervisory process.  \n  \nConclu sion \n  It is said that regulators come in after the battle is over and shoot the wounded.  In this \ncase, many issues remain as we seek to put our respective economies in position for a strong \nrecovery and a more resilient financial system.  I believe we must first  identify and  correct  the \nshortcomings discovered in this crisis.  Previous crises pr ovide an excellent guide  of what works \nwell in re -establishing a strong banking system , as well as what does not work.  Because  each \n\n9 \n crisis is different, we must diagnosis carefully  the risks and outcomes within our financial system \nas a foundation for a stronger economic recovery.",

            "content": "Rebalancing Toward Sustainable Growth  \n          \nThomas M. Hoenig \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n               \n \nThe Rotary Club of Des Moines and the Greater Des Moines Partnership  \nDes Moines, Iowa  \nJune 30, 2011  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are his own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers or representatives.   \n\n2 \n  \nIntroduction \n \nThe U .S. economic recovery is under  way, but it remains more uncertain and volatile \nthan anyone would like. Some believe that the Federal Reserve can speed up t he recovery by \nkeeping the fed eral funds rate near zero , where it has been for nearly two -and-a-half years , and \nby promising  to keep it  there for an extended period. If I judged —or if evidence suggested —that  \na zero rate would solve our  country’ s unemployment problem or speed up the recovery  without \ncausing other adverse consequences , I would support i t. However, monetary policy is not a tool \nthat can  solve every problem.  \nIn today's remarks , I will outline  my current  views on the econom y, and suggest what \nalternative  options and policies our leaders might consider  as we search for ways to build a \nstronger,  more resilient economy .   \n \nU.S. economic conditions  \nFirst, it is a testament to the U.S. economic system that even  as this nation carries a heavy \npublic and private debt burden, the economy is completing its second year in  recovery. The level \nof activity , as measured by  GDP, has now surpassed its pre -recession p eak after growing at a \nnearly 3 -percent pace last year. However, I am concerned that in working to offset the effects of \nthis devastating crisis and to restore the economy to health, an extended zer o-interest -rate policy \nis producing  new sources of fragility that we need to be aware of and allow for  in our future \npolicy choices.  \nGovernments, businesses  and consumers have made financial choices and allocated \nresources with  an understanding  that a zero -interest -rate policy will remain in place indefinitely. \n\n3 \n The longer we leave interest rates  at zero , the more asset values will be defined by these low \nrates and the greater the negative impact will be once the inevitable move up in rates begins.  \nComplicating the fragility around monetary policy, fiscal policy as a pro -growth policy \ninstrument also appears to be approaching its limit . The government’s stimulus efforts to support \nthe economy, along with lower tax revenues, have resulted in historically large fiscal deficit s and \na very large debt level. Without a dramatic change, the deficit and the debt will only become \nmore daunting wi th the rising cost of entitlement programs  and likely higher interest rates . \nFor well over  a decade, t he U .S. consumer has been a principal  source of world demand \nand economic growth. As a result , the United States  has incurred consistently large trade def icits, \ncontributing to imbalances in the global economy. As we have painfully learned from the \nhousing bust, growth built on imbalances is ultimately unsustainable .   \nCircumstances require, therefore, that we transition  from an economy that relies too \nheav ily on  consumption and government spending for growth toward  more sustainable  sources \nof demand and economic pros perity . How we  undertake  this transition  will define our economy \nand country’ s economic future. \nTo start, over the next several years , we must change our national savings, consumption \nand investment  habits . Such shifts, though fundamental to long -term economic health, are \nadmittedly difficult to accomplish. They require changes in behavior and expectations. They involve dramatic shifts in resourc e use, which are not painless as workers are temporarily \ndisplaced and industries are disrupted. The pain is immediate, and the payoff comes slowly. However, the gains also can be significant, as more sustainable long -run economic growth is \nwell worth the effort and sacrifice.  \n\n4 \n In a recent visit to Singapore, I witnessed that nation’s  commitment to job creation. For \nexample, during the recent crisis and recession, Singapore developed a program to retrain \nunemployed workers to ensure they would have the skil ls needed when its manufacturing sector \nrecovered. As is well understood, workforce training matters. I spoke with individuals who \ndescribed the drive to bring new factories on- line, with the goal of bringing a factory on -line \nwith minimal delays  and, by their description , without compromising safety .   \n \nLessons from Germany  \nOther countries have made similar changes  out of necessity or during a time of economic \ndistress such as we are experiencing today. Countries have made deliberate  choices  and not  \nrelied on chance to  change economic incentives and behavior tha t served to improve economic \nperformance. I'm not advocating tha t we pick winners and losers —in fact, that is my big gest \nargument against too -big-to-fail financial institutions. Rather, I have observ ed a number of \ncountries that are building and expanding their manufacturing bases —such as Korea, Singapore \nand China —that have been able to experience strong GDP growth over long periods of time . \nGermany offers an other  example of a country having made sign ificant changes to \naccomplish real employment goals. In the mid -1990s, Germany’s trade defic it was simil ar to that \nof the United States . Since then, Germany has moved away from trade deficits to surging \nsurpluses, while the United States  has continued to r un large trade deficits. Complementing this \nshift, German levels of employment have made great strides, and its unemployment rate has \ntouched its lowest point in nearly 20 years.  \nI am not suggesting that the United States  attempt to be Germany or Singapore , two \ncountries that differ from us in many ways. I am also not advocating that we suddenly strive to achieve a large U .S. trade surplus . This might only create other global imbalances and \n\n5 \n distortions. However, adjustments in our economy are necessary, and other countries have shown \nit can be done.  \nPerhaps the most immediate, and obvious, observation is the simplest: We must change \nour national savings rate. To rebalance the U .S. trade position from deficit to balance requires \nthat the sum of private and public savings match  domestic investment. In other words, a country \nmust not produce less  than it consumes if it wishes to balance its trade position with the rest of \nthe world.  \nDuring the 2000s, Germany’s personal saving s rate increased and is currently about  \ndouble the U.S. rate. German households paid down debt and avoided heavily  relying on debt , in \ncontrast to the United States  and so many other countries’ households.  \nThe pers onal saving s rate in the United States has modestly increased since the start of \nthe recession, which is an important positive trend. Unfortunately, this improvement has been more than offset by the dramatic deterioration in public saving reflected in  the nation’s fiscal \ndeficits. Though a significant amount of the recent deterioration in public finances is related to \nthe U.S. financial crisis, the fact remains that our national savings crisis has been unde r way for \nnearly three decades. Si nce the early 198 0s, our nation has consistently chosen to spend rather \nthan save, as witnessed by the long -term decline in our private saving s rate and our tendency \ntoward fiscal deficits.  Most importantly, when we look across the more developed countries, we \nsee that those with higher national savings rates tend to have smaller trade deficits and higher domestic production per person.  \nGermany has also benefitted from managing unit labor costs in a manner that keeps its \nlabor force globally competitive. Over the last decade, the German economy experienced relatively modest wage increases and important productivity gains. Both of these factors \n\n6 \n contributed to keeping unit labor costs in check. However, another important component of its \nsuccess came in the form of labor polic y reforms.  \nIn the early 2000s, Germany, with labor and management input, passed a series of labor \nmarket enhancements called the “Hartz laws.” These laws modified some of the more generous employee benefits and reduced restrictions on temporary workers and the ability to lay off workers. Germany’s reforms also sought to incentivize unemployed workers to transition to employment by making changes to job training programs for the unemployed and creating targeted subsidies to support some manufacturing job cre ation.  \nFinally, Germany developed export markets by focusing on meeting the needs of parts of \nthe world experiencing the fastest growth and demonstrating strong demand for capital goods  \nthat German manufacturers produce : emerging economies in Asia, Europe and Latin America.  \nThe United States is well- positioned to match this kind of performance, if it chooses to do \nso. For example, since 2000, the share of our exports going to the BRIC countries —Brazil, \nRussia, India and China —has more than doubled. If we ch oose to increase our savings rate, if \ngovernment, labor and management see the mutual advantage of investing in and building a competitive manufacturing environment, then job growth will follow. \nAs the U.S. economy shifts gears to shrink its trade imbalanc es, many parts of the \ncountry will have a role to play. I fully expect Iowa to be an inte gral participant in this shift. \nIowa already possesses a strong manufacturing base that is a key driver of the state economy. By some estimates, about half of the manufacturing firms in the state are small - and medium -sized \nenterprises, which provide some parallels with Germany’s renowned export powerhouses, known as the Mittelstand . \n \n \n\n7 \n Real solutions versus economic shortcuts  \nRebalancing our economy and improving our trade position is a necessary development, \nbut unfortunately , it will take time. And as our immediate desire  is to rush to improve our \neconomy, I warn against the all -too-common impulse to take shortcuts and suffer their \nunintended consequences. Here in Io wa, for example, one area where I suspect this tradeoff \nmight be playing out is in the recent rapid run -up in agricultural land prices. \n Agricultural exports have played a significant role in the rapid rise of land prices . Since \n2000, agricultural exports from Iowa  have increas ed by a factor of six . A portion of this growth \nreflec ts surging commodity prices due to factors  on the supply side —such as extreme weather in \nparts of the world— and on the demand side, including the well -documented, rapidly growing \nfood demands of emerging economies.  \nIn addition to anticipated strong future demand for agricultural commodities, there is \nanother factor affecting these prices: exceptionally low interest rates. As a bank regulator in the \n1980s , responsible for financial i nstitutions in Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Missouri, \nWyom ing, Colorado and New Mexico, I witnessed the devastating effects of easy credit and \nleverage in ag riculture, real estate and energy. We closed or assisted nearly 350 banks in our  \nregion alone.  \nWith interest rates near zero and with additional massive liquidity poured into our \neconomy, all interest rate s are affected. Therefore, asset values of every kind are also being \naffected, including land values in Iowa. Loans for land are available at rates wel l below historical \nlevels —in some instances, 400 basis points below historical averages. The effect on land assets, \nlike any asset, is to artificially boost its value. And there is ample experience that tells us that if rates were to rise quickly, this would affect world demand for commodities and raise the cost of \n\n8 \n capital o n land almost instantly. When —not  if—the  adjustment occurs, we will see a dramatic \ndrop in values. In the meantime, if operators and speculators have incurred large amounts of \ndebt, then a new crisis will emerge.  \nFinally, we know that a crisis can affect more than one segment of the economy. It nearly \nalways affects the broad economy and emp loyment. Shortcuts don’t work. We need to focus on \nthe real economy. We need to focus on real refor m.  \n \nConclusion   \nMy point today is simply that as powerful as monetary policy is, it some times is not \nenough. It cannot ensure an economy that balances it s savings and investing needs. It by itself \ncannot correct o ur current account deficit or enhance savings and investment. These will require \nimportant changes in our real economy. Providing the right environment in which government \ncan play its role in supporting business and the consum er to save, invest, manufacture  and \nservice national and glo bal needs  in the end will create real income and wealth.  \nWe need to focus on l ong-term, stable monetary policy and fiscal policy goals that \nsupport these broader goals. Having seen the effects of financial crisis after financial crisis as short -term policies beget short -term policies, we should know that an ever -present short -run \nfocus, even if well intentioned, is the road to ruin.",

            "content": "Monetary Po licy and Shifting Economic Risks  \n \n \n \n      \nThomas Hoenig \nPresident  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n     \nLondon School of Economics  \nLondon, United Kingdom  \nMarch  30, 2011  \n \n   \n\nIntroduction \n The p ast three year period has  been  a great challenge to policymakers worldwide, \nincluding central bankers . Unprecedented steps have been taken to restore stability to the world \neconomy and, just as importantly, to assure a sustained recovery. I certainly support  these goals. \nWhile I argued for handling  the l argest financial institutions differently than was done, I \nsupported the  Federal Reserve’s massive  liquidity injections  designed  to stau nch the financial \ncrisis . After all, central banks exist  in part for just that purpose . However, when the crisis is past, \nit is incumbent upon central banks to return to another of their responsibilities : creating \nconditions for a sustained economic recovery that requires looking  beyond short -term goals  to \nlong-term consequences .      \n For more than a year, I have advocat ed, not for a tight U.S. monetary policy , but for one  \nthat would begin unwind ing those  policies put in place during the  crisis . In January 2010, as the \nrecovery entered its third quarter, I expressed the view that the Federal Open Market Committee \nshould modify its rate guarantee to the market. That is, while agreeing that policy sh ould remain \naccommodative, I voted against promising “ exceptionally low rates for an extended period .” As \nthe recovery continued  into the spring , I judged that the Federal Reserve should gradually shrink \nits enlarged  balance sheet with  minimal market disruption by disposing of mortgage -backed \nsecurities that  were trading in the market at  a premium. Thus, I  voted against replacing maturing \nMBSs with  similar or other securities. Finally, i n the fall, I questioned the long -term benefits of \nfurther easing monet ary policy during a recovery  – and  I voted against QE2 .  \nToday, my view has not changed.  T he FOMC should gradually allow its $3 trillion \nbalance sheet to shrink  toward  its pr e-crisis level of $1 trillion. It should move  the U.S. federal \nfunds  rate off of zero and toward 1 percent within a fairly short  period of time. T hen, after \n\nevaluating  the effects of those actions , it should be prepared to  move the funds  rate further \ntoward a level that could be reasonably judged as closer to normal and sustainable.   \n I recognize that these actions are not simple to implement. They would impact different \neconomic sectors differently and to  varying degrees .  They involve trade offs in their effects  and \nuncertainty about the short -term reactions of financial markets and the real economy .  However,  \nthey are not unreasonable or radical  or inconsistent with our experience in dealing with past \ncrises . They are focus ed on the long er run – refle cting a sharp awareness that policy geared  too \nlong toward extensive accommodation undermine s market discipline and e ncourages speculative \nactivities. Put another way, t hese actions  reflect the  view  that the longer exceptionally \naccommodative monetary  policies  remain in place , the greater the danger that resources  will be \nmisallocated within and across  world economies .   \n Given the wide differences in views around the se issues, I want to take time this evening \nto share my perspective on  U.S. monetary  policy choices and their  effects  on economic and \nfinancial  outcomes . \n \nRecovery is Under Way  \n The financial crisis is over , and the U.S. econom y is recovering.  GDP growth in the \nUnited States  averaged 3.0 percent from  the third quarter of 2009 through the fourth quarter of \n2010.  And it is worth noting that for the same period, the International Monetary Fund estimates \nthat global GDP growth averaged 4.9 percent . Also, the U nited States  added 1.5 million  jobs into \nthe private sector  over the one -year period ending in February of this year . Other parts of the \nworld, especially Asia, have experienced particularly strong  growth.   While p arts of Europe and \n\nthe U.K.  have grown less robustly , the fact remains that the U.S. and much of the  world is \nexperiencing sustained economic growth.   \n With the United States  and many  world econom ies experiencing such  growth and with  \nthe U.S. financial crisis over , I would expect to see a change in policy in which stimulus put in \nplace at the height of the crisis would be throttled back.  However, this change in policy is on \nhold in the U nited States.  The reason for the delay is the existence o f significant productive \ncapacity that remains unused  in many of the developed nations. While the U.S. economy has \nclearly strengthened, it has  not yet returned to pre -crisis output and employment lev els.  Its \nunemployment rate, for example, re mains near 9 percent.   In the U.K., unemployment remain s \nnear 8 percent . Thus for many the issue of policy turns on one ’s confidence in the long run \neconomic trends and the degree of monetary accommodation needed to e nsure that those trends \ncontinue.   \n \nShifting Economic Risks     \nThe monetary policy being implemented currently within the United States  and much of \nthe world is more accommodative now than  at the height of the crisis. Policy interest rates \nremain zero , and the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet continues to expand even as the economy \nimproves. With these actions, th e FOMC’s objectives  have shifted from that of containing a \nglobal crisis to that of more quickly accelerating economic growth. Its components focus on raising inflation expectations, i ncreasing  asset values  and pushing up growth in aggregate \ndemand, and, as stated in its September 2010 press release, emplo yment. While I agree these are \nworthy  goals, I am concerned that maintaining a crisis- oriented policy as the tool to achieve them \n\nsignificantly changes  the economic risks . Past  success in pursuing this form of policy is  mixed at \nbest. \n  \nCentral Banks and the Long Run  \n A Swiss central banker once advised  me that the duty of a central banker  is to take care of \nthe long run so the short  run can take care of itself . In the United States, this simple expression \nhas been codif ied in its laws. T he Federal Res erve Act requires that, “The … Federal Open \nMarket Committee shall maintain long -run growth of the monetary and credit aggregate s \ncommensurate with the economy’ s long- run potential to increase production, so as to promote \neffectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moder ate long -term interest \nrates.”  \n These mandates recognize that the factors of production come t ogether in a systematic \nfashion across economies, sector s within economies and re source availability to create growth. \nThe process is not simple nor does it occur quickly  – which  is the purpose of putting policy in \nthe context of the long run.  It is within this context that policy should acknowledge the \nimproving economic trends and begin to withdraw some degree of accommodation. If this is not  \ndone , then the risk  of in troduc ing new imbalances and long -term inflation ary pressures into an \nalready fragile recovery  increase significantly . \n \nShort -Run Actions Have Consequences  \n In the spring of 2003 there was worldwide concern  that the U.S. economy was falling \ninto a “Japanese- like” malaise; the recovery was stallin g, deflation was likely to occur  and \nunemployment was too high. This was the prevailing view  despite the fact that t he U.S. economy \n\nwas growing at a 3.2 percent annual rate and the global economy’s average growth was nearly \n3.6 percent. In addition, t he fed f unds policy rate was 1 ¼ percent . Although most knew that such \na low rate would s upport an expanding economy, i n June 2003 it was lowered further to 1 \npercent  and was left at th at rate for nearly a year,  as insurance.  \n Following this  action , the United St ates and the worl d began an extended  credit \nexpansion and housing boom . From July 2003 to July 2006, the monetary base in the United \nStates  increased at an average annual rate of 4.9 percent , credit increased at an annual  rate of 9 \npercent , and housing prices increased at an annual rate of about 14 percent . The long- term \nconsequences of that  policy  are now well known. The United States  and the world have just \nsuffered one of the worst recessions in decades.  \n The crisis has sometimes been described as  a “perfect s torm” of unfortunate events  that \nsomehow came together and  systematically undermined the financial system . Such events  \nincluded, for example, weak supervision and a misguided n ational housing policy . While these \nfactors certainly contributed to the severity of the crisis,  monetary policy cannot escape its role \nas a primary contributing factor.      \n In reviewing data from this and earlier econo mic crises, the fact is that extended periods \nof accommodative policies are almost inevitably followed by  some combination of ballooning \nasset prices and increasing infla tion. I recently compared the movement of real policy interest \nrates and inflation for four countries: the United States , the U.K., Germany  and Korea fro m 1960 \nto the present (Chart 1). The relationship between negative rates and high inflation is \nunmistakable . Also, the relationship between negative rates and housing price busts in advanced \neconomies since 1970 is instructive . In this instance , nea rly 50 percent of the housing price busts \nwere preceded by negative real policy rates in the years before the busts (Chart 2). If a housing \n\nbust is thought of as a tail -risk event, these percentages are too high .  Thus, it is also worth \nnoting that a s of this month, the U.S. real federal f unds rate has been negative for 11 quarters.  \n These relationships,  of course , must be tested more vigorously before final  conclusions \nare drawn ; but t he data are strongly suggestive  and the findings consistent with those of  schol ars \nsuch as Allan Meltzer. E xtended periods of  accommodative policy, pursued to enhance  short -\nterm economic  growth , are often highly disruptive in their economic effects . After the easing  \nactions of 2003, unemployment declined  from 6. 3 percent in June 2003 to 5 percent two years \nlater and to 4.6 percent the following year. However,  by late  2009, following the worst of the  \ncredit crisis,  the unemployment rate was  more than 10 percent.    \n \nThe Future  \n As in 2003, concerns were voiced this past year  that the U.S. economy  was facing the \nprospect of  deflation, slow growth and high unemployment.  This was the case despite the many \nactions  world economies had taken  to remedy the crisis  and stimulate growth .   For me , it was \ndifficult to conclude that more monetary expansion w ould assure a sustained recovery, and  while \nthere may be events that may slow  economi c growth , those events are related to other real \nfactors .   \n   As the U nited States  continues to ease policy into its recovery, once again t here are \nsigns that the world is  building  new  economic  imbalances  and inf lationary impulses . I would \nsuggest also that the longer policy remains as it is , the greater the likelihood these pressures will \nbuild and ultimately undermine world growth .  In the United States , for example, with very low \ninterest rates, we are beginning to see some assets accelerating in price. Agricultural  land  prices, \nfor example,  are increasing at double -digit rates. High -yield securities in financial markets are \n\ndemanding price premiums bey ond what some would judge reasonable relative to risk. Why? To \nquote a mar ket participant, “W hat are my choices ?” \n The world for some time now has been experiencing rapidly  rising commodity prices .  \nWhile some of the increase may reflect global supply and demand conditions, at least some of \nthe increase is driven by highly  accommodative monetary policies in the U nited States  and other \neconomies.  An d, more recently , in the U nited States  there is  evide nce of  accelerating  increases \nin core price s. Over the past four months , core PCE inflation in the United States  has increased \nfrom a modest rate of 0.7 percent to a rate of 1.5 percent . I understand the U.K. also is \nexperiencing rising prices.  W hile no one can say with certainty whether this will continue, \nevidence is mounting that it might.      I conclude  my remarks this evening with the following  observation. I tracked  the average \ngrowth of money and the price level s in the United States from the 19\nth century to the present \n(Chart 3).  It should surprise no one that t here is a striking parallel between the long -run growth \nof money and the growth in the price- level index. From the end of World War II  alone, the price \nindex has incr eased by a factor of ten . With such a track record , it is hard to accept that defl ation \nshould be the world’s  dominant  concern.  \n \nConclusion  \n Central bank ers must look to the long run. If current  policy remains in place , we almost \ncertainly will stimulate the growth of asset v alues and inflation. This may temporarily  increase \nGDP and employment, but in the long run, we risk instability, damaging inflation and lost jobs , \nwhich is a dear price for middle and lower income citizens to pay . \n\n However, t he long run is not yet here . We have oppor tunities to assure greater long- term \nstability. Moving policy from highly accommodative to merely accommodative would be a step \nin the right direction. In this way, we can achieve a better long -run outcome than if we delay \nnormalization.",

The unemployment rate is almost 10 \npercent, our financial system remains under stress, community bank failures have become \nweekly news and the central bank is printing money to such an extent that zero interest rates \nbring little return to t hose who choose to save.  \nNot in decades has the Federal Reserve seen such challenges in how it conducts monetary \npolicy.  With this in mind, this morning I will give you my sense of the issues we face and the \nhard choices that must be made.  I'll begin by focusing on financial reform  legislation, including \nmy observations about where we are with too-bi g-to-fail.  Then I'll turn to the economy and \nmonetary policy. \n \nRegulatory Choices  \n \nOn March 6, 2009, I gave a speech in Omaha called “Too Big Has Failed.”  I shared my \nthoughts about the financial crisis and my c oncern for the long-run effects of bailing out \ninvestors of the largest financial institutions .  That speech hit a nerve by stating what many \nconsidered a simple truth, which is that taxp ayers should not subsidiz e our largest financial \nfirms. With our very important Federal Reserv e Branch office in Omaha, I have been in \nNebraska many times since then, but this is my first trip back after the passage of financial \nreform legislation, so it seems an  appropriate time to review some of the implications of enacting \nthe 2,300-page law.   \nOverall, important steps were taken in an e ffort to strengthen and enhance the regulatory \nframework and accountability of fina ncial institutions.  However, th e success of this legislation \nentirely depends on how well regulatory authorities implement the new requirements. \nThere is, for example, a provision called the Volcker Rule, which will limit \na large firm’s ability to set up speculative activit ies.  So-called “proprietary” trading and the \nsponsorship of hedge funds that engage in hi gher-risk activities must be done outside of \ncommercial banks and bank holding companies, away  from direct access to insured funds and \nthe Federal Reserve’s discount window. This is an important provision.  However, there are exceptions to the rule and, again, whether it work s as intended will depend on how strongly  the \nrules are written, and how well they  are interpreted and enforced. \n\nThe legislation also sets up a new consumer bureau to address the gaps in unregulated \nand under-regulated financial firms, including mortgage finance companies, payday lenders and \ncredit card issuers.  Its success will depend on whether it can appropriately identify those \ninstitutions exploiting those gaps and bring them into accepted sta ndards of behavior.  If the new \nbureau merely directs its resources to the already heavily regulated community banks, its \nbeneficial effects will be minor.  A targeted implem entation program is critical if the consumer is \nto experience the hoped-for benefits. \nThe legislation primarily hoped to address th e public’s concerns about too-big-to-fail \ninstitutions—that is, those that are so large a nd interconnected that th ey will be bailed out by \ntaxpayers no matter what risks a nd bad decisions they make because they are too “systemically \nimportant” to be allowed to fail.  Whether or not  too-big-to-fail is addr essed by this legislation \ndepends on the leadership at the regulatory agenci es when the next crisis occurs.  The law now \nrequires that the FDIC take into receivership an  institution that is designated as “in default or \ndanger of default” for which the regular bankrupt cy process would have systemic consequences.  \nThe process for taking this action is complex, requ iring multiple regulatory parties to agree, the \nTreasury Secretary making the final determination with the President’s concurrence, and a court \nruling that the action isn’t arbitrar y and capricious.  This will be an incredible challenge for the \nregulatory agencies.  Recent experience tells us that  time is of the essence in a national liquidity \ncrisis. It will be extremely difficult in practice to  designate the largest institutions as insolvent, \ntake them over and liquidate.  The simple trut h is “too-big-to-fail” wi ll not go away easily. \nOur largest institutions, even after their poor performance during this last crisis, remain \nfinancially and politically powerful institutions.  It gives me pause, for example, that after the recent devastating experience of the global bank ing crisis, regulatory au thorities are already \nbacking off initial attempts to strengthen in ternational capital requirements for these largest \nbanks and financial firms.  The Basel Committee just announced an agreement to establish for our largest global banks a Tier 1 ca pital-to-asset ratio of 3 percent.   This is a 33-to-1 leverage \nratio.  Bear Stearns entere d this crisis and failed with a 34-to-1  leverage ratio.  It leaves a small \ncushion for error and is a level of  risk that I judge unacceptable.  \nAs I consider the outlook for financial regu lation, I am hopeful but realistic re garding  \nwhether next time things will be different.   Regulatory agencies have been given a mandate and authority to strengthen oversight of the larges t firms.  Success will depend on whether we choose \nto make hard calls and to use the new author ity with integrity, fairness and resolve.   \n\n \nMonetary Choices  \n \nI want to spend my remaining time on mone tary policy.  I acknowledge that there are \ndifferent perspectives on the array of economic data we receive and analyze, and therefore there \nare legitimate, differing views a bout what is best for the econo my. The Federal Reserve has a \ndual mandate to pursue stable prices and stab le long-term growth.  The entire FOMC is \ncommitted to pursuing those goals, but there are differing views on the causes and fixes to our current situation.   \nI have been at the Fed through past swings in the business cycle.  There is today a \nfamiliar theme as I listen to the media, various economists and “market experts.”  They say we are entering the era of a “new normal” in whic h we have to accept high unemployment and low \nincome growth and that interest rates will remain at  zero indefinitely.  They warn that deflation is \na serious risk and that the U.S. could become another Japan, which must be avoided at all costs.  Before this week’s FOMC meeting, The Wall Street Journal wrote that the Fed would add more \nstimulus into the economy—including the purchase of long-term treasuries.  It turns out that \nreporter was remarkably prescient.  \nI share these concerns about our econo my.  Economic conditions are far from \nsatisfactory, unemployment is simply too high, and we  want a stronger recovery.  But as much as \nI want short-term improvement, I am mindful of possible longer-term consequences of zero \ninterest rates and further easing actions.  Rather than improve economic outcomes, I worry that \nthe FOMC is inadvertently adding to “uncerta inty” by taking such actions.  Remember, high \ninterest rates did not cause the financial crisis or the recessi on.  Let me summarize four key \npoints that I judge releva nt in choosing among moneta ry policy options.   \n \nTrend data show modest recovery \n \nThe recovery is proceeding as many economists ear lier this year outlined  that it would.  It \nis a modest recovery, with mixed results.  Yet,  GDP is likely to expand at somewhere around a 3 \npercent rate through the re mainder of the year.  Month-to-month data will be mixed, as is typical \nduring recovery.  For example, industrial pr oduction was down 0.3 percent for April, up 1.3 \npercent for May, and up 0.1 per cent for June.  New orders for non-defense capital goods \n\nexcluding aircraft were down 2.8 percent in Ap ril, up 4.7 percent in May, and up 0.6 percent in \nJune.  Durable goods orders were up by 2.9 percen t in April, down 0.7 percent in May and down \n1.2 percent in June.  Corporate profits are bei ng reported as consistently strong, month after \nmonth.  What these data points tell me is that  volatile monthly data should not drive policy \nactions. \nWhile monthly data may be mixed, the trend data are consistently positive. Private job \ngrowth has been less than hoped for but positiv e nonetheless.  Private payrolls increased 630,000 \nsince January 1.  In the first half of the year, private labor income incr eased in all components: \nhours worked, employment and wages.  Hours worked have risen more rapidly than \nemployment, which is typical for the early stages of an economic  recovery.  In fact, we are \nexperiencing a better pace of rec overy this time than at this po int in our previous two economic \nrecoveries.    \nIn addition, since the second quarter of 2009, personal income growth has increased 2.8 \npercent, consumption is up 1.6 percent, investment  in equipment and software is up 15 percent, \nand housing is up 5.3 percent.  Year-over-year, in dustrial production is up 8.2 percent, high tech \nis up 20 percent and manufacturing is up 8.3 percen t.  Corporate profits are up 57 percent since \nthe fourth quarter of 2008. While we are not where we want to be, the economy is recovering \nand, barring specific shocks and bad policy, it shoul d continue to grow over the next several \nquarters. \n \nCorrections take time \n \nWe are recovering from a horrific set of shocks, and it will take time to “right the ship.”  \nMoreover, the financial and economic shocks we have experienced did not “just happen.”  The \nfinancial collapse followed years of too-low in terest rates, too-high leverage, and too-lax \nfinancial supervision as pres cribed by deregulation from both Democratic and Republican \nadministrations.  In judging how we approach this recovery, it seems to me that we need to be \ncareful not to repeat those policy patterns that followed the recessions of 1990-91 and 2001.  If \nwe again leave rates too low, too long out of our uneasiness over the strength of the recovery and \nour intense desire to avoid recessi on at all costs, we are risking a repeat of past errors and the \nconsequences they bring. \n\nHere are some important figures regarding just how out of balance our economy became \nand what might have contributed to these im balances between the early ‘90s and today: \n• The real fed funds rate averaged 1.6 percent between 1991 and 1995, 0.37 percent \nbetween 2001 and 2005 and -1.0 percent from 2008 to the present, hardly a tight \npolicy environment. \n•  Gross federal debt increased from 60 percent to 75 percent of nominal GDP \n•  Consumer debt increased from 63 pe rcent to 94 percent of nominal GDP \n•  Nonfinancial debt increased from 189 pe rcent of nominal GDP at the start of the \ndecade to 234 percent by December 2008. \n• Between 1993 and 2007, the average leverage of the 20-largest financial \ninstitutions in the U.S. (total assets-to- tangible equity capital) increased from 18-\nto-1, to over 25-to-1, reac hing as high as 31-to-1. \n• The U.S. increased its debt to the rest of  the world dramatically from 4.87 percent \nto 24.32 percent of nominal GDP. \n \nObviously, the effect of these trends on our  economy has been significant and we must \naccept that they will not be corrected quickly. \n \nIt is not time for tight policy \n \nIn my view, maintaining an accommodative mone tary policy is necessary at this time, but \na clear policy path toward a less highly accommodative policy will encourage a more sustained \nrecovery.  Under such a policy, financial dele veraging will evolve slowly and many of the \nremaining economic imbalances will rebalance.   Under such a policy, the economy will expand \nat a sustainable moderate pace with similar mode rate job growth, but job growth that will be \nstable and resilient.  There may be ways to  accelerate GDP growth, but in my view, highly \nexpansionary monetary policy is not a good option.   \nTo be clear, I am not advocating a tight monetary policy.  I am a dvocating a policy that \nremains accommodative but slowly firms as the economy itself expands and moves toward more \nbalance.  I advocate dropping the “extended peri od” language from the FOMC’s statement and \nremoving its guarantee of low rates.  This tells the market that it must again accept risks and lend \nif it wishes to earn a return.  The FOMC would announce that its policy rate will move to 1 \n\npercent by a certain date, subject to current conditions.  At 1 per cent, the FOMC would pause to \ngive the economy time to adjust and to gain c onfidence that the recovery remains on a reasonable \ngrowth path.  At the appropriate time, rates would be moved further up toward 2 percent, after \nwhich the nominal fed funds rate will depend on how well the economy is doing. \nIf such a path were chosen, then how mi ght GDP and important components perform?  \nLet me start with consumption, which for d ecades amounted to about 63 percent of GDP.  \nDuring the boom it rose to 70 percent.  It seem s reasonable that the consumer will most likely \nreturn toward more historical levels relative to  GDP and then grow in line with income.  If so, \nthe consumer will contribute to growth but is unli kely to intensify its contribution to previously \nunsustainable levels. \nTo view the role of the consumer from a nother perspective, I w ould note that personal \nsavings declined from nearly 10 percent of dis posable income in 1985 to less than 2 percent in \n2007.  It is now closer to 6 percent, better in  many ways, but still below historical norms. \n Assuming it stabilizes and pe rsonal incomes grows as it has so  far this recovery, you get a \nclearer sense of how consumption will contribute to the economy’s expansion but also why it is \nunlikely to play a dominant role as it did in this past decade. \nWhile businesses need to rebalance as well, they are essential to the strength of the \nrecovery.  Fortunately, they are in the early stages of doing just  that.  Profits are improving and \ncorporate balance sheets for the nonf inancial sector are strengtheni ng and are increasingly able to \nsupport investment growth as confidence in the economy rebuilds.  Also, although credit supply \nand demand may be an issue impeding the recovery  to some extent, a shortage of monetary \nstimulus is not the issue.  There is enormous liquidity in the market, and it can be accessed as \nconditions improve. \nFinally, the federal government needs to rebala nce its balance sheet as well.  Federal and \nstate budget pressures are enormous, and uncertain tax programs surely are a risk to the recovery.  \nThis adds harmful uncertainty upon both busine sses and consumers.  However, while these \nburdens are a drag on our outlook, they are not new to the U.S. and, by themselves, should not \nbring our economy down unless they go unaddressed. \nI believe the economy has the wherewithal to rec over.  However, if, in an attempt to add \nfurther fuel to the recovery, a zero interest rate is  continued, it is as likely to be a negative as a \npositive in that it brings its own unintended cons equences and uncertainty.  A zero policy rate \n\nduring a crisis is understandable, but a zero rate after a year of recovery gives legitimacy to \nquestions about the sustainability of the recovery and adds to uncertainty. \n  \nMarket motives \n \nWe were reminded of the critic al nature of our financial ma rkets when they locked up \nduring the crisis.  We need mark ets to function smoothly.  However, market participants should \nnot direct policy.  When mixed data are reported as systematically negative results, and the more \npositive, long-term growth trends fail to be adeq uately acknowledged, it is an invitation to hasty \nactions.  Of course the market wants zero rates to continue indefinitely: They are earning a \nguaranteed return on free money from the Fe d by lending it back to the government through \nsecurities purchases.   \nThe current recovery in its fi rst year saw GDP grow an average of 3.2 percent.  The GDP \ngrowth rate for the 1991 recovery was 2.61 percent; and for the 2001 recovery, it was 1.92 \npercent.  We would all like to see a stronger recovery, but slow gr owth is not a decline in growth \nand we should not react hastily.   The summer of 2010 has seemed strikingly familiar to me.  I recently went back and looked at news reports for the spring and summer of 2003, just prior to when the FOMC lowered \nthe fed funds rate to 1 percent, where it rema ined until 2004.  I’ll provide just two examples. \nIn June 2003, one prominent economist noted in USA Today:   “The Federal Reserve Board \nrecently warned that America faces a risk of [deflation].  Japan has been suffering from it for \nmore than a decade.  Europe may be heading toward it.  The entire world economy could succumb to it.  …This could be the first r ound in a deflationary cycle.  The Commerce \nDepartment reports orders to U.S. factories slip ped 2.9% in April from March, the largest decline \nin 17 months.  …With fewer jobs and stagnant wa ges, Americans won’t be able to buy enough to \nkeep the economy going.” \nAlso in June 2003, a Boston Globe  columnist noted:  “On the surface, one can make the \ncase that the Fed doesn’t have to do anything at al l. Interest rates are incredibly low….Still, the \nFed will not sit on its hands.  Chairman Alan Greenspan and his deputies have done everything \nbut advertise the coming rate cut on the Goodyear blimp.  Their mo tivation is to avoid deflation. \n  …Another rate cut, even a cut of one-half poi nt, doesn’t guarantee that there won’t be an \neconomic collapse.  But it makes that collaps e less likely—hence the no tion of rate cut as \n\ninsurance policy.  As insurance, a rate cut is pr etty cheap.  Lower rates aren’t going to trigger a \nburst of inflation, and if they give the economy an extr a boost, well, who is going \nto complain about that?” \nIn the third quarter of 2003, immediately foll owing these and many similar articles, GDP \nexpanded at what turned out to be nearly a 7 perc ent annual rate, yet rates were left at 1 percent \nfor several months.  With the low rates very lo w for a considerable period, credit began to \nexpand significantly and set the stage for one of the worst economic crisis since the great \ndepression.  In my view, it was a very expensiv e insurance premium.  Unemployment today is \n9.5 percent.  I fully acknowledge that I was on the FOMC at that time.  That’s why I believe that \nzero rates during a period  of modest growth are a dangerous gamble. \nThe Great Depression of the 1930s was a traumatic event.  We need to be aware of its \nlessons.  We need to avoid its mistakes.  For example, the Fed should never again double reserve \nrequirements overnight.  However, I urge us not to forget other more-recent lessons from the \ngreat inflation and the financial crisis of 2008: R eal interest rates that are negative 40 percent of \nthe time create severe consequences.   \nOne final note about deflation: The consumer price index was a mere 18 in 1945 but was \n172 at the start of this century.  Today, despite our most recent crisis, the CPI is over 219.  Not \nonce during more than half a cen tury has the index sy stematically declined.  I find no evidence \nthat deflation is the most serious threat to the recovery today.  \nConclusion \n \nI agree that the Federal Reserve needs to keep  its policy rate accommodative.  For a while \nlonger, it should remain even below the long-run equilibrium rate.  However, the economy is \nimproving and is growing at a rate faster than the last two recoveries.  Importantly, the recent \nfinancial crisis and recession was not caused by high interest rates but by low rates that \ncontributed to excessive debt and leverage among consumers, businesses and government.  We \nneed to get off of the emergency rate of zero, move rates up slowly and deliberately.  This will \nalign more closely with the economy’s slow, deliberate recovery so that policy does not lag the recovery.   \nMonetary policy is a useful tool, but it cannot solve every problem faced by the United \nStates today.  In trying to use policy as a cure -all, we will repeat the cycle of severe recession \n\nand unemployment in a few short years by keeping rates too low for too long.  I wish free money \nwas really free and that there was a painless way to move from severe recession and high \nleverage to robust and sustainable econo mic growth, but there is no short cut.",

            "content": "Comments on the Volcker Rule  Activity Restrictions \n \nThomas M. Hoenig \nPresident \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \nMarch 2, 2010 \n \n \n On January 21, 2010, President Obama announced the “Volcker Rule,” as an additional \nreform to his financial reform plan.\n1  Under the Volcker rule, bank holding companies and \nfinancial services holding companies would “no longer be allowed to ow n, invest, or sponsor \nhedge funds, private equity funds, or proprieta ry trading operations for their own profit, \nunrelated to serving their customers.”  The Pres ident indicated the rule is designed to prevent \ncostly risks that could destab ilize the banking system, preclude unfair advantages, and prevent \nconflicts of interest.  This document discusses th e rationale for the Volcker rule and suggests its \neffectiveness could be strengthened by supplemen ting it with traditional, simple, and proven \nregulatory rules, such as higher capital requ irements and concentration limits on nonbanking \nactivities. \n \nHow Volcker rule activities affect banks  \n \nThe Volcker rule is based on the idea that banks have a special role in the financial \nsystem.  They are integral to providing credit and operating the payment system.  As a result, the \nfailure of banking institutions ca n destabilize the financial syst em and damage the economy.  \nThis special role provides the justification for regulating bank and bank-related activities. \n \nSome supporters of the Volcker rule have mistakenly claimed th at restricting these \nactivities is necessary because th ey cause bank losses directly or that banks use insured deposits \nto fund proprietary tradi ng activities.  However, these claims  fail to distinguish between banks \nand holding companies that own banks.  Specifi cally, Volcker rule activities can only be \nundertaken in holding company subsidiaries, a nd the Federal Reserve’s Regulation W places \nbarriers between banking and holding compa ny activities that woul d preclude, among other \nactivities, using deposits to fund Volcker rule activities. \n Although the Volcker rule activities do not affect banks dire ctly, there are at least three \nchannels through which losses due to these activ ities might affect a holding company’s bank \nindirectly.  The channels exist because large holding companies manage activities along business \nlines that traverse legal entities.\n2  The 3 channels are: \n \n                                                             \n1 The transcript is available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/th e-press-office/remarks-president-financial-reform .  In \nthe same presentation, President Obama also proposed caps  on the percentage of financial institution liabilities that \ncould be held by any one firm to limit further consolidation in the financial system. \n2 For example, the investment banking business line at JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America all do \nunderwriting, market making in securities and derivatives, and lending. \n\n2 \n  Reputation effects – if a holding company's tr ading subsidiary fails, creditors may lose \nconfidence in the holding company’s bank.  As  a result, creditors could withdraw their \nfunding from the bank. \n Withdrawal of customers that prefer a variet y of services – holding companies are run along \nbusiness lines (as opposed to legal entity lines) to  more easily market to large customers that \nneed a range of services.  Failure of a holding company subsidiary may allow a large customer to be wooed away by a company that o ffers a full line of services.  In such a case, \nthe large customer may wit hdraw business and funding from  the banking subsidiary.  \n Funding from subsidiaries – A holding comp any’s nonbank subsidiaries will deposit their \nfunds and customers’ idle balances in the ba nk.  The failure of the nonbank subsidiary could \ncause a sudden withdrawal of a significant amoun t of funding.  Due to reputation effects, the \nsubsidiary’s failure may make it difficult for the bank to raise replacement funding.  \n \nRisk, conflicts of interest, a nd expansion of the safety net  \n \nAs noted above, banks play a special role in  the economy because they provide financial \nintermediation services and are the critical compone nt of the payments system.  As the financial \nsystem has evolved, banking services also have  evolved beyond the trad itional services of \nlending and deposit taking to other financial intermediation and client service activities.  These \ninclude such services as brokerage and market  making, underwriting new issues of stocks and \nbonds, merger acquisition and advice, and invest ment advice.  However, many large banking \ncompanies have gone beyond intermediation services  to proprietary invest ment activities, which \nare the activities prohibited by the Volcker rule .  These investment activities use the firm’s \ncapital to take greater financial risks that are expected to earn more at tractive returns.  With \nclient service activities, transa ctions are undertaken for the firm ’s clients, while with Volcker \nrule activities, transact ions are undertaken directly for the firm itself. \n \nThe proprietary investment activ ities not only tend to be risk ier than client intermediation \nservices, but when conducted with client activities in a single firm, they can cause conflicts of \ninterest.  For example, a firm that does client trading and proprietary tr ading has incentives to \n“front run” client trades.  In addition, the financial system safety  net (deposit insurance, discount \nwindow lending, etc.) has traditionally been provid ed for activities in th e intermediation/client \nservices category.  Allowing a sing le firm to engage in both cate gories of activities extends the \nsafety net’s coverage.  An important rationale fo r the Volcker rule is to prevent or reduce the \npotential for conflicts of interest and expansion of the safety net. \n \nA modified Volcker rule proposal  \nThe Volcker rule has many advantages.  It  prohibits holding companies from conducting \nrisky activities that can lead to losses for subs idiary banks, create conflicts of interest, and \nexpand coverage of the safety net.  In addition, it reflects, in part, con cerns that deregulatory \nefforts may have gone too far, allowing too much discretion and e rring on the side of \npermissiveness.  While the activities targeted by th e Volcker rule were not a direct cause of the \nfinancial crisis, they contributed to the overall ri sk level in the financial system.  Now that we \nhave seen how destructive a financial crisis can be , many people are ready to be more restrictive.  \nThe Volcker rule can help ensure that the restrict ed activities are not the trigger that sets off the \nnext financial crisis. \n\n3 \n  \nThe Volcker rule should be strengthened, however, by supplementing it with traditional, \nsimple, and proven regulatory rules, such as hi gher capital requirements and concentration limits, \nor additional supervision for nonbank holding compa ny activities.  Some critics have claimed \nthat prohibiting proprietary trading would not be effective because it is difficult to distinguish \nfrom other trading and hedging activities.  Thes e critics argue that holding companies would \nsimply continue to conduct these activities am ong other business lines, such as market making or \nprime brokerage, where the activity (and potentially the risks) are not as easy to identify and \nmanage.  Requiring these other act ivities to be conducted in sepa rately capitalized subsidiaries \nsubject to strict capital and concentration limits  would strengthen the Volcker rule by offsetting \nsuch attempts to “hide” proprietary trading.   \n Providing regulators the authority to im pose capital requirements and activity \nconcentration limits on nonbanking s ubsidiaries would also reduce the amount of activities that \nneed to be prohibited.  Specificall y, private equity investments do not  create conflicts of interest \nand may not be significantly riskier than some ac tivities that banks are allowed to conduct, such \nas leveraged lending.  In addition, given that private equity firms are allowed to purchase banks, \nit seems inconsistent to prevent bank hol ding companies from making private equity \ninvestments.  Strict capital requirements and c oncentration limits on priv ate equity investments, \ntherefore, may be sufficient to  protect the financial system. \n \nConclusion\n \n \nConducting activities such as hedge fund sponsorship and in vestment and proprietary \ntrading in a bank holding company can create problems for affiliated banks and the financial system.  The activities have a risk profile that  can lead to losses in affiliated banks, create \nconflicts of interests among various holding compa ny business lines, and lead to an expansion of \nthe safety net.  The Volcker rule is a reas onable approach for cont rolling problems created by \nthese activities, and it can be strengthened by allowing regulators to im pose capital requirements \nand concentration limits on the nonbanking subsidiaries of holding companies.",

            "content": " \n \nAre Community Banks Important? \n \n    \nThomas M. Hoenig \nPresident \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n \n \n \n        \n \n   \nAmerican Bankers Association Government Relations Summit \nWashington, D.C. \nMarch 18, 2010 \n \n \n \n \n\nAs a Federal Reserve Bank president, I am  occasionally asked outrageous questions \nregarding central banking and commercial banks.  “Is the Federal Reserve owned by a European \nbanking cabal?”  “How much owne rship of the Federal Reserve do the Rockefellers hold?”  But \nover the past few days, the questions  have become truly outrageous:  \n“Will the regional and community bank model survive in the future?”  Are community \nbanks important? \n“Shouldn’t the Federal Reserve supervise only the very largest bank s and not community \nbanks?” \nWhat’s more, it is particularly bothersome to me that these last two questions are most \noften asked by individuals who ha ve not been in or know what a community bank does. So let \nme answer the question.  \nWhether you are here today representing JP  Morgan or the First State Bank of \nHometown, Kansas, the answer is  the same.  When you cut thr ough the fog, there is no question \nas to the need for and the importance of commun ity banks in our nation’s  financial system. The \nmaps on the screen behind me show that banks w ith less than $10 billi on in total assets hold \nsubstantial market share in much of the United States and hold the majority of deposits in 16 \nstates. Bank subsidiaries of bank holding companie s with less than $50 billion hold the majority \nof deposits in 26 states.   \nAs you can see from these maps, regional and community banks serve local markets, and \nin turn, support local economic  growth. These banks rely on knowing their customer, and \nmanaging those relationships to work with bo rrowers through good times and bad. Regional and \ncommunity banks are also typically locally ow ned and managed, which means they have an \nimmediate and vested interest in th e success of their local communities.  \nYes, regional and community banks also are under pressure from this crisis, and it will be \na struggle for them to regain their footing; but, certainly no more so than that for our largest institutions that received significant government support. Commercial real estate will be a drag \non earnings for some quarters yet, and there w ill be bank failures.  But this segment of the \nindustry will recover and its model, with its focus on relationship banking, will prosper as the \neconomy recovers and expands.   \nInterestingly, looking at prelimin ary data, I suspect future analys is of this crisis will find \nthat regional and community banks during the cr isis actually may have done a better job of \n\nserving their local markets and maintaining lendi ng standards. While this group of banks has a \nhigher concentration of commercial real estate to capital, there is evidence that they are working \neffectively, and in some inst ances, more cooperatively than  the largest ba nks with their \nborrowers to work out or reduce losses, base d on their knowledge a nd active monitoring of \ncustomers.  \nSome of our largest banks would be well-served to take a lesson. \nIt is also no coincidence that with breakdow ns in other parts of the marketplace, a \nsubstantial portion of regional an d community banks have increase d their loans to businesses. \nDuring 2009, 45 percent of the banks  with under $1 bi llion in assets increased their business \nlending. \nAnd while it may make some of the largest banks uncomfortable to hear this, regional \nand community banks have managed all this while  operating at a competitive disadvantage.  For \nit is the largest financial firms that have an implicit, recently made explicit, guarantee that taxpayer dollars will be used to pr otect them from failure, regardless  of what risks they assume.  \nIt is only now that we are discussing legislation to address the issue of a special class of the \nlargest firms that we have deemed too-big-to-fail.  This is the one item that must be addressed if \nwe are to have any real competitive equity among all financial institutions.  What is proposed \nmay need to be strengthened, but it is a start.  \nLet me end my remarks by quickly commen ting on the Federal Reserve’s role as a \nsupervisor of regional and community banks, some thing that will soon come under debate in the \nSenate and perhaps again in the House. The strong opposition to removing the Federal Reserve \nfrom regional and community bank supervision, voiced by myself and ot hers from the Federal \nReserve, is not driven by the idea of simply pr otecting our “turf” or saving Federal Reserve jobs. \nThe record very clearly shows that the Fe deral Reserve System has made important \nchanges to its operations when such moves bene fit the country as a whole regardless of the \nimpact on the Federal Reserve. Most notably , the Federal Reserve was among the strongest \nsupporters of Check 21 legislati on, while realizing it would mean the eventual loss of thousands \nof Federal Reserve check processing jobs. The legislation improved the efficiency of our \npayments system, and while it was painful for me  personally to see the elimination of hundreds \nof jobs in my District, it was a step we  had to take to best serve the nation. \n\nIn this case, however, serving the best intere st of the nation does not mean reducing the \nFederal Reserve’s supervisory role. \nGiven the importance of 6,800 re gional and community banks lo cated in almost as many \ncommunities across this country, it  is inconceivable to me that  the Central Bank of the United \nStates would not have a role in  their oversight, through the supe rvision of state member banks \nand bank holding companies.   \nThe Federal Reserve System was designed by its  founders with the go als of it supervising \na broad cross section of U.S. banks, assuring eq uitable access to the Federal Reserve liquidity \nfacilities regardless of institutional size or lo cation, and contributing to  the stability of the \nfinancial system – not only on Wall Street but on America’s Main Street.  It does this job well.  \nIn the crisis of the ’80s, which affected bot h large and small banks, banks supervised by the \nFederal Reserve proportionately imposed the leas t losses on the FDIC when they failed relative \nto banks supervised by other Federal agencies.   \nIn addition, the Federal Reserve’s role in supervision of banks and bank holding \ncompanies provides it critical information on lo cal economies in places such as Muskogee, \nOkla.; Santa Fe, N.M. and Scotts bluff, Neb.  And to answer th e question: yes, our role in \nregional and community bank supe rvision supports our responsib ilities as members of the \nFederal Open Market Committee, by expandi ng our understanding of local and regional \neconomies.   \nStripping the Federal Reserve of its resp onsibility for supervising regional and \ncommunity banks and bank holding companies should be unacceptable to anyone who cares \nabout equity in the nation’s banking system, la rgest to smallest bank, and the nation’s regional \nand local economies. Confining the Federal Reserv e’s supervisory role to  only the largest firms \nwill, I fear, inadvertently make the Federal Reserve the Central Bank to the largest firms while disenfranchising the other 6800 bank s.  The map tells the story.  \nWhen Congress created the Federal Reserve nearly a century ago, it gave us a \ndecentralized system that spanned the continent. The explicit purpose for this structure was to better balance the interest of Main Street ag ainst those of Wall Street.  Recent experience \nconfirms that this structure is as important today as then, perhaps more so. Community banks are important to the banking system and to the econo my, and therefore continue to be important to \nthe Federal Reserve. I have said be fore but it deserves repeating: It would be a tr agic irony if the \n\noutcome of this crisis is a gain in power for the largest firms at the expense of the other 6,800 \nregional and community banks. If so, it would be a win for Wall Street.  \n\nGeographic  Market Share of Banks in the U.S. \n \n \nGeographic  market share of banks over $10 billion \n \nSource:  FDIC Summary  of Deposits (June 2009) \n  \n \n  \nGeographic  market share of bank subsidiaries  of BHCs over $50 billion \n \nSource:  FDIC Summary  of Deposits (June 2009) \n• 69% of total deposits are held at \nbanks with greater than $10 \nbillion in total assets. \n \n• Banks with less than $10 billion in \ntotal assets make up the majority \nof deposits in 16 states. \n• 60% of total deposits are held \nat bank subsidiaries  of BHCs \nwith greater than $50 billion \nin total assets. \n \n• These BHCs own the majority \nof deposits in 24 states. \n \n• Total assets of the largest \nBHCs constitute  83% of all \nBHC assets in the U.S.; \nhowever,  represent  less than \n1% of the total population  of \nBHCs. ",

            "content": "REFORMING U.S. HOUSING FINANCE \n   \nThomas M. Hoenig \nPresident \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n \n      \n \n            \nNational Association of Realtors Conference \nNew Orleans, La. \nNovember 5, 2010 \n   \nThe views expressed by the author are his own and do not necessa rily reflect those of the Fede ral Reserve System, its governors , \nofficers or representatives.\n\n \nIntroduction \nMy position on the current stance of our  nation’s monetary policy is well known, \nespecially to those who closely follow the Federal Reserve. The Federal Open Market \nCommittee has met seven times this year, and at each of those meetings I have cast a dissenting \nvote against the majority opinion of keeping the federal funds rate target at  its current level near \nzero for an “extended period.” \nI realize that advocating an interest rate in crease is not the best  applause line at a \nRealtors’ conference. However, I believe that moving rates modestly off of zero, where they \nhave been since December 2008, still represents highly accommodative monetary policy. More \nimportantly, such action is necessary if we are to  ensure a more stable economy that can thereby \nfoster a more sustainable housing market.   \nHow Can We Revive Housing? \nWe have all suffered through the worst colla pse in housing prices since the 1930s, and \nthe situation we face will not be easily corrected. \nThe housing collapse can be characterized as a classic asset-price bubble spurred by low \ninterest rates, easily accessible and often-unsound  financing, over-optimism about housing price \ntrends, and a high—and difficult to control—leve l of subsidies that flowed into housing. \nAlthough we may have experienced a few excepti onal years of housing activity, those years do \nnot come close to making up for the economic r ecession, foreclosures, erased wealth and slow \nrecovery that we now are experiencing. \n2 \n \n\nGiven this experience, the question that now confronts us is, “What can we do to create \nmore stable housing markets and lessen the boom -bust cycles in housing?” These cycles have \nunfortunately become all too familiar over the past few decades.  \nSome argue that our housing and mortgage mark ets will not recover in a timely fashion \nwithout extensive public support.  Among the suggested solutions are expanding Federal Housing \nAdministration lending and the role of the Fede ral Home Loan Banks and allocating whatever \nfunds are needed to bring the tw o housing agencies, Fannie Mae a nd Freddie Mac, back to their \npre-crisis role for housing. Other ideas include a renewal of tax credits for home purchases and \nmore extensive programs for mortgage restructur ings. From the Federal Reserve, some want a \ncontinuation of near-zero interest rates for an extended period and greater investments in \nmortgage instruments. \nIn sharp contrast to that vi ew, others suggest that the fi nancial crisis has exposed a \nnumber of critical flaws in our housing policie s and mortgage finance system that call for a \nsignificant “re-look” at how we finance this industry. For inst ance, Paul Volcker, who was \nchairman of the Federal Reserve during a porti on of the 1980s real estate crisis, recently \ndescribed the U.S. mortgage indus try as “dysfunctional” and a “creature of the government” that \nneeds reform.  \nThe options seem to fall out to either re building a system backed by extensive public \nsupport, subsidies and other prot ections, or build a new framework that returns housing finance \nto greater reliance on private market forces.  \nI support a policy path that re turns the housing industry toward  greater market discipline \nand greater long-run stab ility. This path requires a great ly reduced role for governmental \nintervention and public subsidies that have di storted the market over recent decades. The \n3 \n \n\nAmerican public, including as piring homeowners and those of you employed in the housing \nindustry, might be best served, over time, by reduci ng or removing these subsidies as part of our \nnational policy. \nThere are several factors that argue for making such a change in policy. First, the crisis \nclearly shows that a mortgage finance sy stem based on expanding the incentives and \nopportunities to take on more debt with little equity places hous eholds at significant financial \nrisk and creates unsustainable trends in housing expansion.  \nSecond, such policies create harmful distor tions within the economy, and they are \nenormously expensive in terms of both their e xplicit and implicit costs, to both taxpayers and \nhomeowners, especially when things go badly. Many of the subsidies directed toward housing \nhave been extremely inefficient, with other par ties capturing most of the benefits rather than \nhomeowners. \nMoreover, with the growing federal budget defi cits and the many interests that will be \nintensely competing for public funds, it is unrealis tic to expect that all can be accommodated or \nthat housing can continue to command the same portion of public funds and levels of taxpayer \nsupport and exposure. In brief, housing policy is  badly flawed, and today’s budget environment \nrequires reform. \n \nFix Freddie and Fannie \nWhat specific steps should we take? The first and most obvious step is to reform the two \nhousing finance vehicles of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These two institutions were \nresponsible for more than half of all U.S. mortgages passed thr ough the system at the height of \nthe housing boom. These government-sponsored enterprises were assigned goals around \n4 \n \n\naffordable housing that contributed dramatically to the growth in subprime credit and the decline \nin lending standards that led to the crisis. Fannie and Freddie clearly  fit the pattern of what Paul \nVolcker said we must avoid: “Private when things are going well and public when things are \ngoing badly.”  \nSeveral studies have found that the vari ous subsidies received by Fannie and Freddie \nhave done little to lower mortgage rates. Instead, the vast majority  of such benefits accrued to \nFannie and Freddie’s stockholders or was used to gain political  favor. For example, only two \nmonths before Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were  put into conservatorship in September 2008, \nmedia accounts detailed how both had made the list of Washington’s top 10 lobbying spenders \nover the previous decade. Together, they had spent a total of $170 million.1 At that time, Fannie \nemployed 51 lobbyists and Freddie paid 91, with  both counting former members of Congress \namong their hired guns. This was only two years af ter the Federal Election Commission levied a \n$3.8 million penalty against Freddie related to char ges it was illegally involved in 85 political \nfundraisers.  \nConsidering the high level of political activ ism on the part of these GSEs, it should not \nsurprise you to learn that both Fannie and Freddie are considered “heavy hitters” on the Center for Responsive Politics’ website, OpenSecrets.or g, which provides a wide range of data on \nmoney’s influence on U.S. elections and policy. Th at designation means that both are among the \nbiggest donors to federal-level politics since 1989.  \nSo, while Fannie and Freddie have spent m illions on lobbying and building influence in \nWashington, their losses could cost taxpayers as much as $363 billion, according to recent \nestimates—and those are just the direct losses. Th e overall losses that could be attributed to the \nGSEs are likely to be several multiples higher when we consider that without their implied \n                                                \n \n1 USA Today, July 17, 2008. \n5 \n \n\n“federal guarantee” and related incentives around ris k, the markets might have been far more \ncautious and the financial crisis far less prolific . More stunning perhaps, had these institutions \nbeen held to stricter financial standards, far fewer households would have suffered the tragedy of \nforeclosures, the lost home equity and the lo ss of personal savings a nd wealth that today \ncontinues to hold back our economic recovery.   \nGiven the costs and market distortions these government-supported institutions brought \nwith them, we should be confident that they shou ld not be allowed to operate in the future as \nthey have in the past. We cannot afford to igno re that through their us e of implicit government \nfunding guarantees, they held a significant compet itive advantage in the marketplace, and that \nthis in turn encouraged excessive risk on their balance sheets, w ith tragic outcomes. \n Given past errors, how might we approach the need for some modest support for future \nfinancing within the housing indus try? I see two basic options. \nFirst, if we judge that some public support is  needed, we could esta blish public  entities \nthat focus solely on the secu ritization of conventional, c onforming mortgages with strong \nunderwriting standards, tight public oversight and balance sheets limited to holding amounts \nnecessary for warehousing loans to be securiti zed. This makes the government a conduit only, \nfacilitating the flow of capital but not providi ng the implicit guarantees on funding and assets \nheld that contributed to this cr isis. The market remains the fina l arbiter of standards and funding. \nA second option would be to give private en tities sole authority to securitize pools of \nconforming mortgages—similar to what is now done  with jumbo mortgages. If the Congress was \ndisposed to provide some favor to housing, a federal guarantee could be given to certain \nsecurities backed by mortgages meeting strict co nforming loan standards. However, such favored \nstatus should be based on some limiting factor, such as need or special purpose.  \n6 \n \n\nEither of these two options would address many of the problems associated with Fannie \nand Freddie in this crisis and would create a mo re transparent and competitive marketplace. The \nlatter option involving privately owned entities would offer the a dditional benefits of greater \nmarket discipline and insulation from political influence and control.  \n \nEnforce Sound Lending Standards  \nRegardless of these actions, we must as a nati on insist on the return to sound real estate \nlending standards. We know today that countries th at avoided the worst of this most recent real \nestate meltdown did a better and more consistent job in maintaining an effective and consistent \nset of standards for loan-to-value and debt-to-in come ratios. Some count ries, such as Canada, \neven tightened mortgage lending requirements when  real estate markets heated up. In the United \nStates, the oppos ite occurred. \nWhile sound credit standards are a key respons ibility of individual lenders, public policy \nalso played an important role in the deteriora tion of loan quality in the United States. This \noccurred largely through public efforts to prom ote and subsidize homeownership and increase \naccess to housing credit. During the crisis, politic ians, regulators and market participants were \nsingled out for blame. In reality, it was a group effort. \n In the years leading to this most recent crisis, a common theme emerged at all levels: \nHouseholds can accommodate more debt relative to income. A report titled The 1994 National \nHomeownership Strategy: Partners in the American Dream  stated: “Financing strategies fueled \nby the creativity and resources of the private and public sect ors should address…financial \nbarriers to homeownership [and]…reduce downpa yment requirements and interest costs by \nmaking terms more flexible.” In other word s, the key to homeownership from a political \n7 \n \n\nperspective is to promote more creative and flexib le lending standards, or  what, in hindsight, we \nmight more correctly call high leverage. \nThis political desire for creative and flex ible lending was hardly new in 1994, though. It \nwas also a central fixture in the real estate collapse of the 1980s. A Senate report on a 1982 \nlegislative provision to remove national bank loan-t o-value limits on real estate lending provides \na powerful insight into the causes of financial cris es. According to this re port, the purpose of the \nlegislative change was “to provide national banks with the ability to engage in more creative and \nflexible financing, and to become stronger pa rticipants in the home financing market.” \nAlthough creative and flexible financing mi ght remain a goal in housing, sound lending \nstandards cannot be ignored if we are to have sustainable housing growth. With this in mind, the \nFederal Reserve in 2008 revised rules implemen ting the Home Ownership and Equity Protection \nAct. These rules simply prohibit lenders from  making loans without co nsidering a borrower’s \nability to repay the loan from income and asse ts other than a home’s value. Who would have \nthought it necessary to write rules that  are otherwise nothing but common sense? \nWe should also take a closer look at the loan-to-value guidelines that depository \ninstitutions are required to follow in making real estate loans. We should review guidelines to \nensure they are adequate, and we should apply them equitably to other lenders. Other lending \nprovisions, subsidies and public policies directed toward the housing sector and home financing \nalso need to be examined. These would incl ude the risk weights for mortgage loans and \nmortgage-backed securities under th e Basel capital requir ements, state and federal tax deductions \nfor mortgage interest, reliance on credit rati ng agencies’ assessments  of mortgage-backed \nsecurities, and the wide variety of other public policies related to housing. Given current housing \n8 \n \n\nconditions and the way a number of subsidies have become embedded in our housing system, \nsome policy reforms would have to be phased in  gradually and after ma rkets have recovered.  \nA key point in reviewing U.S.  housing finance policies should  be to consider whether \nthey encourage homeownership in a cost-eff ective manner without put ting homeowners at \nunacceptably high financial risk. The 2005 Presiden t’s Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform, \nfor instance, concluded that the federal tax deduction for mortgage interest provided an \n“incentive to take on more debt,” involved large subsidies that encouraged “overinvestment in \nhousing” and was “not shared equally among a ll taxpayers,” with higher-income households \nreceiving “a disproportionate be nefit.” Accordingly, the panel recommended replacing the \ndeductions with tax credits and placing a cap on the benefits as a means of distributing the \nbenefits more evenly and limiting the incentive s to take on excessive  amounts of debt.  \nWith regard to promoting housing through in terest rate policies, I have many times \npublicly expressed my views about the dangers  of using monetary tools and the Federal \nReserve’s balance sheet to pursue low interest rates and fund mortgage-b acked securities. The \nonly additional point that I would repeat is that  for home financing to follow a path that is \nsustainable over time, the Federal Open Market  Committee must begin ta king steps to normalize \nmonetary policy. \n \nConclusion \nEconomists Hyman Minsky, Charles Kindleberge r, and, more recently, Carmen Reinhart \nand Kenneth Rogoff have all writ ten extensively about how high credit growth and the financial \nimbalances that develop during economic upturns sow the seeds fo r future financial instability. \nIn a similar manner, a Norwegian economist looked  at banking and financial crises in Norway \n9 \n \n\n10 \n going all the way back to the early 1800s. She f ound that every major cris is was preceded by a \nrapid run-up in real housing prices. Consequently , it is apparent that uns ustainable trends in \nhousing prices and home financing have been a major contributor to financial crises. \nThe United States stands virtually alone in its use of GSEs and significant subsidies to \npromote homeownership. Fannie Mae, Freddie M ac and their political supporters have long \nattempted to justify this system by saying that  “American housing finance is the envy of the \nworld.” Few would believe that today. \nIt is time for a significant change. We must move toward a system with fewer subsidies \nand misdirected incentives. Furthermore, to ensure  accountability, any hous ing subsidies that we \ndecide to keep should be made explicit, voted on transparently and carefully targeted to the \nintended beneficiaries: potential homeowners most in need and fo r whom such support will bring \nsuccess. \nMany of you might question whether a system w ith greatly reduced subsidies will work. \nA partial answer to this question can be found in international comparisons. A recent study, for \ninstance, found that in terms of homeownership rates, the United  States ranked only 17th out 26 \neconomically advanced countries . Many countries have achieve d higher homeownership rates \nwithout—and perhaps because they don’t have—many of the special privileges of U.S. housing \nfinance, such as GSEs, minimal down payments, 30-year fixed-rate loans and mortgage interest \ntax deductions. To this list, we could also add non-recourse debt instruments, government \npromotion of “creative and flexible financing,” th e ability to prepay loans, affordable housing \ngoals and similar government housing programs. \nIn making these remarks, I am not suggesting we do away with all support for housing. I \nam saying it is time for change.",

Hoenig President Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City          Kansas Bankers Association 2009 Annual Meeting August 6, 2009            The views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, its governors, officers or representatives.  This text was prepared from a transcript of Mr. Hoenig’s remarks.  \n\nI want to thank the Kansas Bankers Association for inviting me here today and for giving me the opportunity to speak on what I consider to be increasingly important challenges confronting our economy in the coming months and years.  The challenges are focused around the common theme of debt and leverage as it impacts the banking industry, government, business and consumers.  How we address these challenges will also affect how the Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy as we emerge from this recession and beyond.   I’ll start by focusing on the banking industry and the challenge of too-big-to-fail.  The matter of a resolution process for failed large banks must be addressed before the financial system can be fully healed and functional.  Then I will speak on the broader issue of debt, federal government, business and consumer, and the challenges it presents for policy.  These topics are important because, as citizens, we have some very difficult choices before us that will impact us and future generations. Throughout my presentation, I will share a number of charts that illustrate the magnitude of debt and leverage in the economy.  The advantages of too-big-to-fail Chart 1 is a picture of leverage in the banking system and illustrates the enormous advantage of being too big to fail. For example, at the end of the first quarter of this year, the 20 largest financial institutions in the United States controlled more than $12 trillion in assets, supported by more than 3.5 percent equity capital. This chart illustrates how little equity supports that massive amount of assets and risk.  The next group of financial institutions, the non-top 20 financial institutions ($500 million to $100 billion in assets) has an equity capital ratio of 6 percent—notably higher than that of the largest banks. \n\nChart 1 \n Assume for a moment that the 20 largest institutions were required either to raise new equity, or to reduce their total assets to meet the 6 percent equity capital ratio.  This would require that they raise more than $300 billion in new capital or, as Chart 2 shows, they would need to shrink in size by $5 trillion, or some combination of the two options. The numbers in Chart 2 make clear how much of an advantage the larger institutions have over smaller banks, and show the excess leverage the largest banks have accumulated.      3.2%3.2%3.6%6.0%02,0004,0006,0008,00010,00012,00014,000Billions of Dollars Total Assets(less Tier 1 Common)Tier 1 Common\nTop 5Top 10Top 20Non-Top 20Tier 1 Common as % of Total Assets\nSource: Bank Holding Company Reports of Consolidated Condition [March 2009]Notes: Graph includes only BHCs that filed the Y9-C which excludes approximately $2 trillion in assets. Tier 1 Common = Tier 1 Capital less Preferred Stock, Related Surplus and Minority Interest. Non-Top 20 includes bank holding companies with $500 million to $100 billion in assets.\n\nChart 2         \n  It is no longer conjecture that the largest institutions in the United States have been determined to be too big to fail.   They have been bailed out, and proposed legislation allows for that practice to continue.  They have an implied guarantee, which affords them an enormous advantage in terms of their use of leverage and their ability to accumulate assets to unprecedented levels.  The large banks have added capital since the end of the first quarter, but they are far short of achieving a 6 percent ratio of equity capital to assets.  Ironically perhaps, some proposals being offered would require large institutions to hold more than this level of capital.  I would $3,916$5,020$5,118\n6.0%02,0004,0006,0008,00010,00012,00014,000\nTop 5 Top 10 Top 20 Non-Top 20Billions of Dollars Current AssetsTied to ExcessLeverageTotal Asset LevelSupported by Existing Tier 1 CommonExistingTier 1 Common\nSource: Bank Holding Company Reports of Consolidated Condition [March 2009]Notes: Tier 1 Common = Tier 1 Capital less Preferred Stock, Related Surplus and Minority Interest. Total Assets Supported by Existing Tier 1 Common Supported Assets assumes 6% Tier 1 Common to Total Assets\n\nsuggest such proposals are wishful thinking, and will not be achieved.  I would be pleased if these largest institutions were held to the same standards as the non-top 20 firms because the community banking system cannot survive if the largest banks continue with their current advantage, and that obviously has significant adverse effects for the financial system as a whole. There were two pieces of legislation that facilitated our migration toward too big to fail.  Chart 3 illustrates the relative growth in position of the largest institutions against the timeline of Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, which permitted banks to grow across state lines, and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which eliminated the separation of commercial banking and investment banking.  Since 1990, the largest 20 institutions grew from controlling about 35 percent of industry assets to controlling 70 percent of assets today.  This trend will continue unless we take specific steps to end it.  The way we normally address failure in a capitalistic system is to subject any institution, from the largest institution to the smallest, to the same penalties for bad management. To accomplish this, we must pass legislation mandating that institutions that become insolvent, due to liquidity or capital, be taken over in an orderly fashion and placed under a conservatorship or receivership.  In such an instance, both the equity holders and long-term debt holders should share the losses before the taxpayer is required to bail out the institution. Taking over the failed institution in an orderly fashion—not a panicked fashion—would protect the franchise and, more importantly, protect the economy from instability.  As I have described elsewhere, a resolution framework can be designed that is fair and much more efficient for the economy.  As we have handled the largest institutions through this crisis, they are not market-driven institutions, they are public utilities. This has to change or we \n\nwill not retain the dynamic financial system that has made the United States so successful over its history.  Chart 3 \n  Difficult choices While staying with the theme of debt and difficult choices, I am going to turn next to the challenge of the growing debt levels within our economy and the challenges they present for monetary policy makers, starting with federal debt levels.   0.150.250.350.450.550.650.75\n0.150.250.350.450.550.650.75PercentPercent\n5101520Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994*Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999\nNotes:  *Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 allowed for interstate acquisitions Sources: Bank Holding Company Reports of Consolidated ConditionParent Company Only Financial StatementsConsolidated Reports of Condition and Income19861988 19901992 1994199619982000200220042006 2008Industry Concentration in Top Bank Holding Companies[1986 to Present]\n\nIt is the responsibility of us citizens, through our congressional representatives, to decide how much our government spends and how we allocate those expenditures, which nominally increased to $3 trillion in 2008 from less than $500 billion in 1975.  Medicare, income security, Social Security and veteran’s benefits make up more than half of government spending. Federal outlays also include national defense, education, interest payments on the debt and other expenditures. These expenditures are substantial, and they may grow further as we set forth on implementing a stimulus package and tackle some very difficult health-care issues.  Both these initiatives involve legitimate goals, and it is not my place here to debate the merits or the arguments surrounding them. However, as Chart 4 shows, we need to understand that we, through our government, have already made significant long-term commitments and choices in allocating federal resources.

If we are not willing to tax ourselves, then funds must be borrowed.   Chart 5 shows that in nominal terms, the total federal debt has grown from less than $500 billion in 1975 to approximately $12 trillion, and over that same period, our debt-to-GDP ratio has increased from 35 percent to 90 percent.  We are spending 8 percent of our total federal budget just to make the interest payments on that debt, and that too will only increase.

Chart 6 shows that consumer and nonfinancial business debt are each now more than 130 percent of our national income.  Consumer leverage has actually worsened as consumer wealth has declined during this recession due to the collapse in housing and the decline in U.S. equity markets.  Chart 6   \n In an environment where debt is large and growing, low interest rates are preferred by nearly everyone: the government, bankers and bank customers. The desire for low interest rates will put incredible pressure on the Federal Reserve and the central banks of the world to keep rates low.

Consequently, we are carrying more debt than we have carried in most of our history, and the pressure to keep rates low is only going to increase as the economy begins to recover from this recession.  Chart 7   \n Chart 8 shows that low interest rates have coincided with a growing level of money in the economy, which the Federal Reserve defines as M2.   Chart 9 suggests further that this growth in money over these past several decades has had a staggering effect on the consumer price level.

That’s an astonishing increase in the general price level, and it represents a significant reduction in the purchasing power of the dollar over time.  These are matters that demand our attention as we make choices involving both fiscal and monetary policy.            Chart 8            \n  In considering these charts and the matters of policy, we should be aware of two pieces of legislation that I suggest influenced their contours: the 1946 Employment Act and the 1977 Amendment to the Federal Reserve Act. The 1946 Employment Act established as a national priority a goal of low unemployment.  Low unemployment is a worthy goal and one that I share, but it cannot be achieved by systematically keeping interest rates low.  In 1977, Congress passed the Amendment to the Federal Reserve Act—also called the Humphrey-Hawkins Act—which 01975 1977 1979 1981 1983 1985 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2003 2005 2007 200920011,0002,0003,0004,0005,0006,0007,0008,0009,000MoneyBillions of Dollars\nSource: Board of Governors. Money is defined as M2, a broad set of financial assets held principally by households. M2 consists of the sum of (1) currency, (2) traveler's checks, (3) demand deposits, (4) other checkable deposits, (5) savings deposits, (6) small-denomination time deposits, and (7) balances in retail money market mutual funds.  \n\ncalled upon the Federal Reserve, as the central bank of the United States, to pursue a dual mandate of promoting long-run stable economic growth and stable prices. Chart 9    \n  Though I am convinced we can achieve both mandates, I also am convinced that both are only possible if the first priority of the central bank is to achieve stable prices.  Understandably, however, many prefer that the emphasis be on growth and low unemployment.   Although the Federal Reserve is insulated from politics, it is not isolated from politics, as you can observe by the frequent congressional testimony of Ben Bernanke and past chairmen. The Federal Reserve System is accountable to Congress for achieving the dual mandate, and the data suggest it has given important deference to the growth objective.    05001914 1924 1934 1944 1954 1964 1974 1984 1994 20041000150020002500Consumer Price IndexIndex, Price Level in 1914 = 1001977 Amendment to the Federal Reserve Act1946 Employment Act\n\nRecession and recovery These issues provide context for the monetary policy choices that lie ahead. Based on the data we are receiving today, it would appear that we are at the bottom of the recession. The data are mixed, which is usually a sign that we are at the bottom. However, these mixed data also make it difficult to determine just how firmly or quickly we will emerge from the recession. Given the large amounts of consumer, business and government debt that will influence events going forward, I suspect we’re going to recover slowly.  The recovery will be assisted by the fiscal stimulus and an accommodative monetary policy, but it most likely will be slowed by the extensive rebalancing of the economy that has yet to occur. In this environment, one of the Federal Reserve’s major challenges will be how to pull back its highly accommodative monetary policy without undermining the recovery and not igniting inflationary expectations.   We learned in the Great Depression and with the Japanese experience that we have to pull back gently.  At the same time, however, we also learned from the great inflation of the ’70s that we have to be resolute in pulling excess stimulus back or risk greater consequences in the future.  We are going to be walking the “knife’s edge” for some time to come.   In considering this challenge it is important also to realize first that more than half of the current fiscal stimulus package has yet to be spent, so we have yet to see its full effects. In addition, monetary policy remains exceptionally accommodative and will provide significant stimulus into 2010 and beyond.    Focusing more narrowly on monetary policy, the excess reserves in the banking system now exceed $800 billion; they were less than $8 billion when this recession started. The balance sheets of the Federal Reserve Banks have increased from $900 billion to more than $2 trillion in \n\nless than two years. As we become more confident that we are at the bottom of the recession and are moving into recovery, we must become more resolute in systematically reducing our balance sheet and raising interest rates to levels we might all agree are more in line with the economy’s long-run growth path.  Moving from zero to one percent, for example, is not a tight policy.  I don’t know what the neutral rate is, but I am certain it isn’t zero. If the monetary stimulus does not come out, the price level trend shown earlier in Chart 9 will only worsen. As a reminder of what that might imply, you need only study the early ’80s when high inflation undermined our economic system.  Paul Volcker’s efforts to bring inflation down then were not without cost and required that the country suffer through a recession nearly as bad as the one we hope we are exiting now.   Conclusion If the government, the banks and consumers address the difficult issues of debt and the Federal Reserve begins to remove the significant stimulus in an orderly fashion, then we will come out of this recession without an inflationary hangover. Noninflationary growth will follow, new wealth will be generated, and we will continue to be the strongest, most successful economy in the world. But in the short run, these actions will involve painful choices, and it is the responsibility of citizens like you, and policymakers like me, to consider the impact of today’s choices on tomorrow. We must choose well.",

Hoenig \nPresident \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n \n    \n“Bankruptcy and the Financial Crisis” \nStern School of Business, New York University \nNew York, N.Y. \nJune 30, 2009 \n \n\n2 \n Introduction  \nThank you for inviting me here today for wh at is an especially timely discussion.  \nThose who are familiar with my public remark s know that I do not accept that some firms \nare “too big to fail.”  I do not be lieve it's inevitable or desirable to continue to have too-big-to-\nfail financial institutions because they pose an on going threat to financial stability.  Now is the \ntime to seriously consider a mandatory resoluti on process based on an obj ective set of criteria \nthat puts the largest financial organizations on notice they won’t recei ve a disproportionate \nsubsidy or guarantee.  \nWhen the financial crisis was unfolding, publ ic authorities responded with a number of \nad hoc steps. These actions kept afloat seve ral large financial and nonfinancial firms whose \ncollapse many thought would prove devastating to the financial system and the economy.  The \nnames of the institutions are well known: AIG,  Bear Stearns, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and \nMerrill Lynch. There were also initiatives to  support financial sector firms through TARP \nmoney. \nWith few exceptions, the steps taken to s upport these firms were outside the normal \nframework established to deal with troubled entities. The re lated actions raise important \nquestions around too big to fail and whether tr aditional corporate bankruptcy procedures and \nbank receiverships are adequate to the task of re solving failed firms.  The options chosen also \nraise important issues of fairness and the equity  of outcomes.  We know that public assistance \ninvolves political choice, which t oo often undermines market discip line and the proc ess of failure \nand renewal so essential to the long-r un success of our capitalistic system.   \n\n3 \n In my remarks this afternoon, I will discuss the role that I believe bankruptcy and bank \nreceivership authority must play in a financial crisis, the lessons we should learn from our recent \nexperience, and what steps we should put in place to deal with future disruptions.  \n \nThe resolution of depository instit utions and corporate bankruptcies \nManaging insolvency for depository institutions differs markedly from what we do with \nmost other corporations. Although we have ma ny experts here on both bank resolution and \ncorporate bankruptcy, I would like to briefly compare these appro aches before discussing issues \naround the resolution of larg e failing institutions. \nOur approach in dealing with insolvent banks  is largely based on the idea that because \nbanks serve a critical role in the payments a nd credit systems, their failures involve potential \ncostly externalities. Bank failures, of any size, could lead to significant di sruptions in the ability \nof individuals and businesses with in a community to carry out timel y transactions.  Furthermore, \nif the largest institutions are involved, these disruptions could bring about a systemic breakdown \nin financial markets and cause substa ntial harm to the overall economy.   \nThe primary focus in bank resolutions is to protect depositors at the least cost to the \ninsurance fund and, wherever possible, ensure continued access to ba nking services with \nminimal disruption to the overall economy. This requires timely action. As such, bank \nresolutions occur under an admini strative process with the FDIC acting as receiver.  The FDIC \nhas a number of “superpowers” it can use in its role, including the ability to reorganize or \nrestructure a failed bank, sell portions of the bank’s assets and operati ons, and repudiate certain \ntypes of claims and contracts.  \nOverall, the bank resolution process m oves quickly through prescribed steps. \n\n4 \n The failure of nonfinancial corporations i nvolves a more deliberative process. Although \nthe failure of these firms may have a significan t effect on individuals and economic outcomes, \nthey do not pose the same type of liquidity a nd systemic issues as the failure of a bank. \nConsequently, the resoluti on process differs in some important ways from that of banks; most \nnotably the resolutions are handled through the ba nkruptcy courts and are initiated either by a \nfirm’s creditors or its managers. The court pro cess concentrates on maximizing the value of the \nfirm and the creditors’ claims either through the firm’s liquidation or as an ongoing concern.  \nBankruptcy courts, moreover, could be characterized as part of a “time out” process in which \nneutral judges work with creditor s and other parties to resolve conflicts of interest and protect \ncreditors. \nDespite the differences in these two processes,  there are important commonalities as well.  \nIn both cases there is a strict set of procedures established under th e rule of law that sets out, for \nexample, a “priority of claims.”  Also, both fo cus on an orderly process and equitable outcomes \nwith care being taken to minimi ze political factors that might otherwise interfere with the \nresolution process. \n \nLessons to be learned \nAlthough we have a legal framework for dealing with failing institutions, we have \nlearned that, in a crisis, the “systemic spillover”  that can emerge from failures of our largest \ninstitutions and the threat to  the broad economy require additi onal consideration.  The most \nrecent examples of this have led to the susp ension of normal bankruptcy and bank resolution \nprocesses, thus institutionalizing the concept of too big to fail in our economic system. \n\n5 \n Even outside of the banking system, major securities firms and AIG, an insurance \ncompany, were thought to be systemically signi ficant because of their many connections and \nexposures with other firms and markets. Theref ore, it was concluded they could not be put \nthrough bankruptcy.  Many view the bankruptcy of Lehman Brot hers and its aftermath as a \njustification for bailing out other large financial institutions.  \nBut we have also learned, or been reminded, that too big to fail has adverse consequences \nas well.  Every financial crisis leaves a trail of losses embedde d among market participants.  The \nprocess of recovery must start with the recognition of these losses, which then must be distributed among the participants.  Moreover, in some instances the extent of the losses \nultimately requires the recapitalization or closing of the institutions and the replacement of the \nmanagement responsible for the failure.  When excep tions are made to this process for any set of \ninstitutions, especially our largest, this proce ss of recovery is delaye d or compromised.  In \naddition, taxpayers most often must bear the bur den of recapitalizing too-big-to-fail institutions, \nplacing billions of dollars of their funds at ris k.  And too often, the management who created the \nproblems or who failed to demonstrate the leader ship necessary to properly run the institution \nremains in place.   \nSuch interventions tend to break down market discipline and involve public authorities, \nnot the market, choosing winners and losers.  In  FDIC receivership or bankruptcy, institutions \nand claimants must deal with usi ng tested procedures and a set of rules that help ensure that all \nparties, regardless of size, are tr eated comparably. With too big to fail, this process is suspended \nand firms are treated differentl y based on one criterion: size. \n\n6 \n Thus, while in the middle of a crisis, short cu ts to tested resolution processes may appear \nand even be necessary, they almost certainly l eave us with a less efficient and less competitive \nmarketplace.    \n \nWhat steps should we take?  \nAs policymakers consider the administra tion’s recent proposal for a new resolution \nauthority for systemically important financial in stitutions, it is crucial that we ask ourselves \nseveral important questions.  For example, given wh at we have learned from this crisis, how can \nwe address the issue of systemic vulnerability th at is inherent in any system with institutions \nallowed to be too big to fail?  How can we better assure that managers, stockholders and \ncreditors know that there will be a credible sy stem that puts them at risk?  And how can we \nresolve large institu tions without raising systemic concerns  or disrupting key financial activities \nor markets?  I suggest there ar e three fundamental steps to addr essing the matter of too big to \nfail.   \nFirst, there needs to be a se t of basic rules of performan ce that apply to systemically \nimportant institutions.  I would emphasize that these rules need to be easily understood and \nenforceable.  For example, I strongly support si mple leverage standards for setting capital \nrequirements at financial instit utions.  Leverage re strictions, once assigned, are simple to \nunderstand and calculate.  They are straightforward to enforce and, if enforced appropriately, are \ncountercyclical.  Risk-based capit al standards, in cont rast, are complex, procyclical, and easier to \navoid.  Many institutions, in fact, have signifi cantly underestimated their risk exposure over the \nlast few years. These errors could have left them  with even greater capital shortages if they had \nbeen free to follow a true risk-based capital appr oach. While no system is perfect, clear and firm \n\n7 \n rules are easier to understand and enforce.  Pr inciples-based oversigh t is an exercise in \nphilosophy, not a supervisory framework.  \nSecond, there must be a clearly defined reso lution regime for systemically important \nfirms that are in financial trouble.  When addr essing serious problems, such a regime should set \nforth fundamental steps that ensure a continu ity of key operations but  which also carefully \nconfine policymakers from making special  exceptions to a defined process. \nSome have well illustrated the responses a ssociated with the recent crises to an \nemergency crew acting to save a burning home before it destroys th e entire neighborhood. I \nagree  that acting to save the neighborhood was important. However, to extend the metaphor, if \nthe fire was started by a homeowner who ignor ed fire codes and smoked in bed, should the \nneighbors be required to rebuild the home at twice its original si ze at their expense? \nWhile we could have addressed the too big to fail issue with current tools, a statutorily \nsanctioned resolution process would significantly im prove our ability to deal with failed large \nbank holding companies and large nonbank financ ial institutions. The Tr easury Department’s \nplan for Financial Regulatory Reform and its  resolution regime for failing bank and other \nfinancial holding companies provide a starting po int for discussing the is sue of too big to fail \ninstitutions, but it is only a start. \nIn the proposal there are a num ber of issues that deserve careful consideration. They \ninclude, for example, how solvency recomm endations would be determined among the \nconsolidated and financial subsid iary regulators. Also, the proce ss will need to be much more \nspecific in how we determine which institutions a nd activities would be regarded as systemic and \ncome under the federal safety net or public protection. For example, I would limit such \nboundaries to those institutions that  are directly and indirectly part of our economy’s plumbing: \n\n8 \n our system for payments and for the provision of liquidity.  Inside these boundaries would be all \nbanks and bank holding companies and any institu tion that has direct access to the payments \nsystem and to the Federal Reserve discount wind ow.  On the other hand, hedge funds would be \noutside the boundaries of the safety net, although they could be required to register and report \nunder SEC rules.  The plan must also more preci sely define how the cost of resolving a large \ninstitution would best be  distributed.  Such cost s are substantial and should be allocated to those \ninstitutions that benefit the most  from the public safety net.  \nThe most important part of any plan, how ever, will be the requirement that public \nauthorities resolve such institut ions by taking them into receivership and restructuring them to \nemerge under new and more careful management  and ownership. This step should be taken \nwhenever the chartering and supervisory authoritie s judge an institution to be insolvent from a \nliquidity or balance sheet pers pective, and I would advocate no  exceptions.  If a resolution \nprocess exists, then few, if any, exceptions will be necessary. \nUnder the pressure of a crisis, as we have  seen, it is difficult to avoid a piecemeal \napproach to dealing with systemically importa nt institutions with all of the unintended \nconsequences that seem to follow.  Thus, our en ergies in refining the pr oposed legislation should \nfocus on how best to narrow the exceptions a nd assure that a receiv ership or bankruptcy \nframework operates according to the rule of law and insulated from political interference. In \nbanking, Congress has set the receiv ership rules with independent  regulators making solvency \ndecisions and carrying out the reso lution process. A similar format must be part of the resolution \nprocess for systemically important, large financial organizations.   \n\n9 \n Third, in resolving issues around any failed firm, especially too big to fail firms, \nmanagement and stockholders must be accountable  for their actions. Restructured firms must \nhave new – and more careful – management and ownership. \nToo often institutions drift w ithout a clear vision of the or ganization’s goals with no one \nmaking the hard decisions. Other shortcomings include a failure or unwillingness to understand \nthe financial instruments the institution holds, re lying on mechanics rather than sound judgment.  \nToo often management has a greater concern fo r expanding the balance sheet than for managing \nexisting activities. Within today’s largest orga nizations, we have lear ned of individuals who \nwillingly carried a hefty title for the purpose of representation of the organization but with no \nunderstanding – and no requirement or desire to  understand – the busine ss lines, operations or \ncondition of the organization.  From the volume of  complaints blaming rating agencies for the \ncurrent crisis, it seems that far too few senior execu tives in these largest organizations believed it \nwas their responsibility to understand the fi nancial products their company was buying and \ntrading in quantities of billions and trillions of dollars.  This  is not only unaccept able, but also a \ndereliction of duty.   \nDealing with leadership issues is challe nging and should be addressed by respective \nboards and stockholders. But if a board fails to do so, then the compa ny’s likelihood of failure \nincreases.  When failure occurs, certainly new management must be required as part of any \nresolution process. One might observe that a CE O and his board of directors are hardly in a \nposition to be angry with any government-impos ed restrictions on compensation when they \nneglected their responsibility to manage a sound company.  \nA final point that needs to be highlighted is that there must be confidence in the fairness \nof any resolution process if it is to be successful over time . Capitalism works only if all \n\n10 \n competitors are held to the same standard and have equal opportunities to succeed or fail.  With \ntoo big to fail, capitalism is compromised and equ ity of opportunity is sacr ificed to expediency. \nThe vast majority of banks in the United States have complied with regulations and \nrequirements that, though necessary, are costly. Th ese banks have played by the rules or suffered \nthe consequences of not doing so during market turmoil. Understandably, today these smaller \ninstitutions are concerned about  the prospect of increased re gulatory requirements and an \nincreased competitive advantage that flows to the largest firms.  Such an outcome would \nundermine confidence in the market system th at has brought this c ountry past success. \n \nConclusion \nThe current crisis has made it clear that the group of systemically important firms that \nmight be deemed worthy of special consideratio n by policymakers is larger than previously \nthought. This extension of the too big to fail co ncept, along with the wide variety of public \nassistance and guarantees we’ve seen used in rece nt months, make it even more important that \npolicymakers find ways to deal with large failing institutions.  \nFailing to have a process that operates according to the rule of law and is free of political \ninfluence means an even larger section of our financial markets will operate on the assumption \nthat the idea of failure – a key element in mark et discipline – does not apply in all instances. \nOnce this happens, it will be difficult for other institutions to survive and compete, and for our \nmarkets to be competitive and efficient.  Importantl y, it will not be realistic for any authority in \nany regulatory structure to oversee a system where incentives remain to take on excessive risk.",

Hoenig \nPresident \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n         \n \n \n \n     \nECB/De Nederlandsche Bank Conference,  \nFrankfurt,  \nMay 25, 2009 \n \n \n\n2 \n \nThank you for the opportunity to be here today a nd participate in this conference on retail \nbanking and the role of central banks.  It is a pleasure for me to join you and provide my \nperspective on the U.S. retail payments system.   \nDiscussion regarding this topi c could not be more timely. Retail payments in the United \nStates and worldwide have undergone an enorm ous transformation over th e past decade driven \nby technology and, just as importantly, notable cha nges in consumer preference.  We get a sense \nof this change from a recent Federal Reserve study indicating that electronic payments now \nexceed two-thirds of all noncash payments in the United States. The efficiency, convenience, \nspeed and ease of use have fueled this transforma tion and will continue to do so for some time to \ncome. \nConsistent with the Federal Reserve’s mandate to ensure the integrity and efficiency of \nthe payments system, we were a strong advocate of the migration of pa yments to electronic \nmechanisms.  Though the electronic nature of retail payments has affected the Federal Reserve’s \ntraditional role, the Federal Reserve’s mandate has not changed.  Although some question \nwhether the Federal Reserve can or should play an important role in retail payments over the \nlong term, a strong case can be made for expa nding the Federal Reserve’s role in electronic \npayments if it is to fulfill its mandate.  \nToday I will discuss my own view that the Federal Reserve should not be contemplating \nan exit from retail payments. Coupled with the ri se in electronic payments products, a dramatic \nchange in the structure of the payments indus try has introduced new challenges to assuring the \ncompetitiveness and safety of this system.  The industry’s structure has been heavily influenced by economies of scale, which has brought with it an increased level of conc entration in debit and \ncredit markets.  For example, in 2007, the three largest PIN debit networks handled more than 81 \n\n3 \n \npercent of all transaction volume. Comparatively,  in 1995, the three larges t networks controlled \nonly 46 percent of the market. More  striking, perhaps, is the fact  that over the same period, the \nnumber of networks dropped from 43 to 14.  Si milar trends are evident in signature debit and \ncredit card issuance.  And, of course, in the Un ited States, three networ ks have long dominated \ncredit card clearing.  To me, these devel opments raise important concerns about the \ncompetitiveness of card payments systems. \nThere are also reasons to be concerned about th e integrity of this system.  Growing levels \nof concentration and an increasi ng complexity of systems have i nvited greater vulnerability to \ndisruption and an enhanced poten tial for “single points of failur e.”  The increasing complexity \nhas raised the opportunity for fraud. There also  has been a growth in the prominence of \nnonbanks, introducing new ri sks to the system. \nIn light of these developments, I believe th at the Federal Reserve needs to continue \nplaying a strong role in retail payments.  Before  looking more closely at what role the Federal \nReserve could play in the future, it may be usef ul to consider the economic rationale for central \nbank involvement in retail payments more ge nerally.  This rationale revolves around the \nexistence of externalities that potentially underm ine the efficiency and integrity of payments \nsystems. \nPayments products and services require a cri tical mass of participan ts on two sides of a \nmarket.  For example, a significant number of merchants must be willing to accept a specific \nform of payment before consumers will use it. Conversely, a substantial number of consumers \nmust use that form of payment before merchants will consider installing any necessary equipment or software.  In this situation, a ne w product or network might not develop because, at \nthe individual level where such choices are ma de, neither consumers nor  businesses have an \n\n4 \n \nincentive to use the product. Both sides, however , might benefit if such a product was in place. \nSuch externalities, in which individual benefits  or costs do not coincide  with those accruing to \nsociety, can justify a public sector role in providing the service. \nSimilarly, there are possible externalities re lated to coordination. Situations arise in \npayments markets where coordination among particip ants benefits both participants and users — \nfor example, adoption of uniform standards or a common technology.  But agreements around \ncommon standards or technology are difficult to achieve because par ticipants vary in size and \npreferences.  In addition there can be a “free-rider” problem, wh ere those that stay outside the \nprocess avoid cost associated with any agreem ent that might be made. The result is an \nunderprovision of services or products. One es pecially important ex ample is the potential \n“underinvestment” in payments security by the pr ivate sector, for example, the continued use of \nmagnetic strip authentication for credit cards rather than more secure smart card authentication. \nThese externalities help explain the Federal Re serve’s traditional role in retail payments, \nespecially its role as operator in check pro cessing and ACH. Its early check processing \ninvolvement was largely a response to the fragment ed nature of the industry as payments carried \nacross literally thousands of co mmercial banks dispersed across  a wide geographic area.  Non-\npar clearing was the norm, and remote locations  were inadequately served.  Under such \ncircumstances, it took only a few years for the Fe deral Reserve System to be involved in roughly \n50 percent of the value cleared through clearinghouses.  By entering the market and ultimately becoming a prominent participant, the Fed was, in  effect, addressing coor dination difficulties and \nnetwork effects.  Similarly, it was instrumental  in the 1950s and 1960s in working with industry \nparticipants to establish the MICR standard a nd to develop high-speed sorting equipment. \n\n5 \n \nWith regard to ACH, in the 1970s, the Fede ral Reserve assumed a leadership role in \npromoting this technology to provide an alte rnative for bank-to-bank small dollar payments. \nPrivate sector banks, facing high startup cost s and low ACH volumes, were understandably \nreluctant to invest in a new network. Without bank participation, there would not be consumer \ninvolvement. The Fed’s participation helped addr ess this externality. It became one of the key \nACH operators, and for a few years following imple mentation of the Monetary Control Act, it \nsubsidized the ACH network. Over time, a criti cal mass was achieved, and today the ACH is one \nof the nation’s most heavily used retail payments systems. \nIn light of the trend toward greater industry concentration a nd the existence of important \npayments system externalities, the Federal Reserv e should play a larger an d more active role in \nelectronic retail payments if it wants to promote the efficiency and integrity of the payments \nsystem.  The key question is how this role shou ld be defined.  While the Federal Reserve could \nfocus more on regulation and overs ight to achieve its mandate as many other central banks are \ndoing, I suggest that it should leverage its experi ence and position as an operator to achieve its \nobjectives. \nHistorically, the Federal Reserve’s role in both checks and ACH reflects a preference to \noperate within the market rather than as a pure regulator. We ar e well aware that industries can – \nand do – quickly develop methods to exploit any regulatory loopholes and avoid the intended \noutcome.  By competing with the private sector on a level playing field, the Federal Reserve can \nencourage efficiency and integrity  from an “on the ground” position.  \nLooking forward, I also suggest that it could do so in the r ealm of electronic payments \nmore broadly.  The Federal Reserve’s operati onal role will likely revolve around its ACH  \n\n6 \n \nplatform. Currently, the Federal Re serve is filling an important role in an ACH industry where \nthe Electronics Payments Network (EPN) is the only other active op erator, and where the \nelimination of either party leaves a highly c oncentrated and less competitive market. While a \nrecent joint processing venture announced by Bank of America and Wells Fargo may spur the entry of a third ACH operator, economies of scale make entry difficult, especially in these times \nwhere capital is scarce and expensive. Without the Fed, it seems unlikely that a more competitive environment would emerge. \nACH volume has been steadily increasing in r ecent years with significant growth in \nnontraditional payments, such as Internet trans actions and the conversion of paper checks to \nelectronic debits. Moreover, the volume and nature of ACH tran sactions have evolved to the \npoint where the ACH network is clearly of syst emwide importance so that a major disruption \ncould have significant effects on the paymen ts system and the broader economy.     \nThus, in my view, the Federal Reserve’s futu re role in retail pa yments should be built \naround its current position in ACH.  For example, in its operator role, the Federal Reserve could \naugment its ACH products and services, with the ai m of enhancing competition and safety within \nthe ACH industry.  An example where this is occurring is with same-day ACH settlement, which the Federal Reserve recently announced it will be gin to offer in the second quarter of 2010. This \nwill provide originating and receiving banks the option to accelerate the clearing and settlement \nof certain ACH debit payments, which will provide  an earlier opportunity to  identify return items \nand reduce risk.   \n\n7 \n \nThe Federal Reserve could also work with EPN to provide reciprocal backup services \nwith each other as well as with other electr onic payments networks, and thereby serve as a \n“switch of last resort.”  Such a role would prove invaluable in the event of  serious disruptions to \nmajor networks, however unlikel y such disruptions might be. \nFinally, the Federal Reserve could enhance competition in payment card markets by \npositioning ACH services as an alte rnative to debit card payment networks.  I am not suggesting \nthe Federal Reserve would issue its own cards or  operate its own card ne twork.  However, the \nFederal Reserve could add enhancements to its ACH network, enabling it to become an \nalternative to running transacti ons over card networks.  The recent development of so-called \ndecoupled debit cards provides an example of the industry making use of the ACH network in \nthis way. \nIn summary, as the payments system continue s to evolve, the Federal Reserve’s role will \nneed to change.  In my view, it would not be de sirable for the Federal Reserve to scale back its \npresence in retail payments or even exit retail payments as some might advocate.  Rather, the \nexistence of important external ities and increasing industry c oncentration suggest that the \nFederal Reserve must stay involved in retail pa yments.  The question, then, is what form this \ninvolvement should take.  Many centr al banks in a similar situati on will likely opt to rely on a \nregulatory and oversight role.  However, in part because of its unique history as an operator, I \nbelieve the Federal Reserve is well-positioned to le verage its traditional operator role to better \nenhance the integrity and effici ency of the payments system.",

Hoenig \nPresident \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n \n    \n \n       \nMid-America Payments Conference 2009 \nKansas City, Missouri \nOctober 29, 2009 \n \n    \nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect t hose of the Federal Reserve System, its governors, officers or re presentatives. \n\n \n \n2 \n Introduction \nI am pleased to have an opportunity to join  you today at the conclu sion of this year’s \nMid-America Payments Conference.  We have had a long association with the Kansas City \nClearinghouse, MPX and now EPCOR, as we shar e a focus on improving our nation’s payments \nsystem and ensuring its benefits accrue to financ ial institutions and their customers here in the \nheartland.    \nAs I begin my remarks today, I want to em phasize that I am expressing my own views, \nand they are not those of the Federal Reserve System. \nAs you know, our payments system is going through one of the most radical \ntransformations since the advent of the ACH network more than four decades ago.  The result is \nnot only a payments system that is much more  complex in its operation, but also in the \nchallenges that it faces and th e risks to its integrity.   \nIn response to this evolution, central banks around the world are th inking about how they \ncan continue to maintain an efficient, safe, a nd accessible payments system. In the United States, \none key question going forward is what role the Federal Reserve can and should play in this new \nenvironment. While some in the industry and government advocate a reduced presence, I believe \nthere is a strong case for the Federal Reserv e Banks to continue active involvement. \n \nChanges Prompting Rethinki ng of the Fed’s Role \nSince their founding almost a century ago, the Federal Reserve Banks have played a role \nin the nation’s payments system. Charged with ensu ring its efficiency, safety  and accessibility to \nthe public, this mission remains as important as ever.  \n\n \n \n3 \n The payments system today is very different than the one that was in place in the early \n1900s.  But more striking is how far removed it is from what we saw only a few years ago. \nConsumers have embraced debit and credit card s as the preferred form for payments. Paper \nchecks, when written, are converted to electr onic form and cleared via ACH or Check 21 \nnetworks.  Today, paper checks represent only 2 percent of the total deposited with Federal \nReserve Banks. By the end of the year, the Fede ral Reserve will have clos ed all but one of its \npaper check handling sites. The Federal Reserve he lped drive this move to electronics and the \npublic benefits are clear. For example, the aggreg ate fees paid by financial institutions to the \nFederal Reserve Banks for check collection will  have declined from about $700 million in 2005 \nto less than half that amount by next year.   \nWhile check clearing volume has been declin ing for a decade, ACH transaction growth \nbegan to flatten about a year a go. Whether that represents the te mporary effects of the recession \nor is the result of a structural change, the past rapid growth rates that we  have seen in our ACH \ntransactions are unlikely to continue at such a pace.  \nMeanwhile, debit card transactions have cont inued to increase, even during the recession. \nWe have also seen the growing presence and influence of nonbank providers of payments services. For example, firms like PayPal and Am azon are introducing the capability for software \ndevelopers to apply their front-end payment so lution to make online purchases for specific \nmerchants wanting to control the buying experience. Mobile access to  the Internet is projected to \nexpand rapidly with implications for the positioni ng of financial institutions, telecom networks, \nand technology firms in the payments chain. \nAs we step back and take a broad look at th ese developments in retail payments, it is \nperhaps striking how much of th e growth is taking place in the private sector with little \n\n \n \n4 \n regulatory oversight.  The Federal Reserve and ot her central banks have not played as active a \nrole in the operation or oversight of card ne tworks, the fastest growing portion of retail \npayments.  Many nonbank providers of payments products and services have little, if any, \noversight of their operations. If this continues,  it will create a significan t vulnerability for our \npayments system. \nFor many in the industry, the success and pr ofitability of payments providers is a \ntestament to the superiority of market solutio ns outside the Federal Reserve or regulatory \nenvironment. “Why mess with success?” I am as ked. While in the short term this may seem \nobvious, I want to remind you that this was also  said about subprime lending, complex financial \nproducts and commercial real estate guidelines only  a few years ago. It is the nature of highly \nprofitable private providers to oppose regulation and increased competition. However, in today’s \nenvironment, and based on recent experience, it s eems clear that the central bank will be held \naccountable for the safety and accessibility of a reliable payments system. If consumers are \novercharged or disadvantaged, or if the system  comes crashing down everyone will ask, “Where \nwas the central bank?  Why di dn’t it protect the public and the financial system?”   \nSo yes, candidly, I do question whether the private sector alone can provide a safe, \ncompetitive and efficient payments system over the long term. \n \nEconomic Rationale for a Govern ment Role in Retail Payments \nIn general, most economists believe that ma rkets work well in most circumstances. The \nexceptions arise when there are externalities or other forms of market failure. Examples are when there are interdependencies among market participants  that lead to important spillover effects or \n\n \n \n5 \n when scale economies lead to the emergence of  a small number of industry providers with \npotential market power.   \nMany payments markets have a number of thes e features, and I would like to highlight \nthree that seem especially important in assessi ng the need for central ba nk involvement in retail \npayments.  First, payments markets are networ ks, and economic studies of networks suggest \nthere can be severe coordination problems that may inhibit their growth and development. These \ninvolve difficulties in cr eating standards and in undertaking la rge startup capital expenditures.   \nSecond, because of externalities and spillove r effects, networks may under invest in \nsecurity as individual pa rticipants look first to their own prof itability and do not consider system \nintegrity as a whole. We are all well aware of the recent rise in  major information breaches and \nidentity theft in the retail payments system. I wo uld note that many of thes e instances have been \ncentered at nonbank payments providers.   \nThird, because of scale economies, payments systems and electronic payments systems in \nparticular, tend to have a small number of provi ders, raising concerns about market power and \nnoncompetitive pricing. In the United States, we have seen a trend toward increased \nconcentration in debit card networks, with a decline from 43 debit networks in 1995 to 13 in \n2007. Indeed in 2007, the top three debit card netw orks (PIN and signature) handled 88 percent \nof total transactions and Visa alone had a market  share of almost 64 percent. As consolidation \nhas occurred, we have seen significant increases in interchange fees, a development that has not \ngone unnoticed by the public and govern ment officials around the world. \nIn light of these issues, I think a strong case can be made for continued central bank \ninvolvement in retail payments. The key questio ns at hand focus on the nature of central bank \n\n \n \n6 \n activities and, especially, how these activities shoul d evolve to meet the changing structure of the \nretail payments industry. \nHistorically, the Federal Reserve’s involve ment in retail payments has centered on \novercoming coordination problems th at have inhibited efficiency. In this regard, I believe the \nFederal Reserve's position as an operator has allowed it to be an effective catalyst and facilitator for payments modernization.  \nFor example, in the early 1970s, as bankers, re gional payments associations, and the U.S. \nTreasury struggled with the incr easing volume of check payments and related costs, the Federal \nReserve collaborated with the industry to build the automated processing systems and \ndistribution network that would become the AC H.  And, in 1984, the Federal Reserve provided \nthe impetus for industry adoption of another ma jor innovation by applying digital image capture \ntechnology to the backroom of th e check processing business, agai n in response to a need from \nthe U.S. Treasury to reduce the costs of mi crofilming checks it issued.  As you know, this \ninvestment was later leveraged to esta blish check image exchange networks. \nIn each of these endeavors and others, we have worked closely with the industry and \nCongress to develop legislation, standards, technology and proce dures to overcome the severe \ncoordination difficulties that prevented the private sector from moving ahead on its own.  Even today, we continue to leverage our operational role in ACH. For example, we’re working with \nindustry stakeholders to address problems such as how to more efficiently and safely exchange \npayments internationally with lo w volumes now, but growing volumes in the future.  And we are \nworking to introduce faster ACH clearing with  a same day settlement capability, which we \nexpect to roll out in the first half of next year. \n\n \n \n7 \n Finally, I would be remiss if I did not empha size that in times of crisis, the Federal \nReserve’s operator role has served to minimize the impact to public confidence that would occur \nwith major disruptions to the re tail payments system. In the hours and days following the Sept. \n11, 2001 attacks, the Federal Reserve Banks were  in a position to keep the check collection \nsystem operating despite the disruption to air tran sportation. While the proba bility of disruptions \nis low, crises will happen sometime in the future and I believe the Federal Reserve’s operator role enhances the resiliency of our retail payments system. \nIn the future, the Fed’s traditional role of  catalyst and facilitator may be less needed \noutside of ACH. After all, card networks have developed and prospered without Federal Reserve \ninvolvement, and the innovation introduced  by nonbank payments providers has been \nimpressive.   \n \nThoughts on the Federal Reserve Bank s' Future Role in Retail Payments  \nIn my view, a starting point for considering the Federal Reserve's future role is to \nconsider whether the safety and efficiency of retail payments will be enhanced by the central bank’s continuing presence.   \nAs I indicated earlier, it is not  clear to me that the privat e sector will make sufficient \ninvestments to maintain the safety and integrity of  retail payments without some sort of Federal \nReserve or government pressure. Consequently, I believe it is important to ask whether the \nFederal Reserve, as a traditional, trusted provider of secure payments services, can play a role in \nhelping to enhance the security of the retail pa yments system and reducing identity theft. More \nbroadly, I think it is important to consider th e extent to which nonbank providers of payments \n\n \n \n8 \n services pose systemic risks to the retail paymen ts system and to explore how they, along with \ntraditional providers, might be more effectivel y monitored by regulatory oversight programs. \nI also think that the Federal Reserve coul d play a role in enhancing the competitive \nefficiency of the retail payments system by le veraging its operational role  in ACH to provide a \nplatform for clearing all forms of  debit transactions. Note that I am not suggesting the Fed issue \ndebit or credit cards, but rather, that the Federa l Reserve provide a cost effective alternative to \nmoving and clearing debit transactio ns, and as a systemic backup to the private sector – a role it \nhas played in payments since nearly its foundi ng. Such an approach may require additional \ninvestments in and enhancements to the FedA CH network. Some may disagree, but looking \nback, the Federal Reserve’s role in check paym ents did not drive comp etition out, but assured \nbroad, safe access in a more competitive environment, to the payments system.  \nAs I have floated this idea over the past year , I have received feedback from some who \ndisagree. However, we need to think about the ef fects of the likely alte rnatives. As I indicated \nearlier, concern about noncompetitive pricing of payments services and market power have \nemerged around the world. This has led to signifi cant government interventions in market pricing \nand market practices in a grow ing number of countries. The c ourse taken in many of these \ncountries has been to subject the card networks and market partic ipants to greater oversight and, \nin some cases, to direct government involveme nt in interchange pricing. As you know, similar \nbills are pending in Congress. \nMy own view, like that of many economists, is that government involvement in direct \nprice setting in any industry is fraught with problems in implementation, generally leading to \npoor outcomes and unintended consequences. At the same time, noncompetitive market \nstructures and pricing, if present,  do need to be addressed. One alte rnative, of cour se is greater \n\n \n \n9 \n antitrust enforcement. My suggestion is somewhat different, to increase competition via the \nFederal Reserve’s role in retail payments, speci fically as an operator of the ACH network. Of \ncourse there may be other means of making non competitive markets more contestable, which \nalso should be considered. \n \nSummary \nIn summary, the retail payments system is  evolving rapidly and is more complex than \never. It serves as a critical component to the infrastructure of the economy. The Federal Reserve, \nworking closely with financial institutions and the industry as a partner and competitor has been \nan important driver of efficiencies and current le vels of safety and stabili ty. However, the growth \nin payments transactions is now occurring in  card networks, and nonbanks ’ presence is growing. \nSome may call for the Fed to exit retail paymen ts now that physical distribution is no longer \nneeded and its share of retail payments tran sactions is naturally declining. However, \nconcentration in card markets, increased concerns  about security and re liability, the unintended \nconsequences of regulation versus Fed participati on in these markets, and the success of the Fed \nin sparking industry innovation fr om its position on the ground, lead  me to conclude that Fed’s \npresence as an operator is needed now more than ever.",

Hoenig \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Kansas Bankers Association Annual Meeting \nColorado Springs, Colorado \nAug. 2, 2007 \n \n \n\nIt is a pleasure for me to be here today, and I want to thank you for the opportunity to \nspeak at your annual meeting. \nThe Kansas Bankers Association has played an important role in the history of the \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, dating back quite literally to our Bank’s founding. \nYou may have read about some of this histor y earlier this year in an article published in The \nKansas Banker. \nWhen the Federal Reserve’s founders were determining locations for the nation’s new \nReserve Banks in 1914, the KBA was especially active in promoting Kansas City. Under the \nKBA’s leadership, more than 1,000 Kansas banker s signed cards indica ting their support for \na Bank in Kansas City. It was an impressive and important showing of unity as the entire \nregion came together for a comm on purpose. It was also unique. In many other areas of the \ncountry, bitter local rivalries nearly overwhel med the individuals responsible for determining \nthe locations of the 12 regional Banks. \nThe president of the KBA at that time was an Atchison, Kan. banker named Willis \nBailey. Interestingly, Bailey, who was also a fo rmer Kansas governor, became a member of \nour Bank’s first Board of Director s. He is also one of my early predecessors, serving as the \npresident of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City for 10 years starting in 1922.  \nBailey and his work set the stage for a l ong and important relationship between our \norganizations that continues to this day. Over the years, many of you have participated at our \nconferences, economic forums and regulatory up dates. We have also had a supervisory \nrelationship with nearly all of you, at either a bank or a holding company level. Moreover, \nKansas bankers, including some of you, have been important participants on our Board of \nDirectors. \n\nAnd recently, we were pleased when a group fr om the KBA was one of the first to tour \nour new headquarters, which is now under construction. We are extremely happy with \nprogress on the project, and we look forward to next spring when we will have the once-in-a-\ncentury experience of moving into  a new building. We look forwar d to the KBA joining us in \nthose ceremonies. \nToday, I would like to talk about  an issue that is important  to all of us: the Kansas \neconomy, its future, and the potential opportunitie s and risks for Kansas banks. I will be \nmore than happy to take your questions at  the end of my remarks as time allows. \n \nThe economic environment  \n \nOverall, the economy is healthy, with gr owth accelerating to potential while \nunemployment is low. There are, however, a few key concerns of which you are probably \nwell aware. One is residential housing, which might not recover as soon as some have \nexpected, and another, of course, is high energy prices, which could push up prices on other \ngoods and slow consumer spending. \nIn this economic environment, recent banking performance has been very strong. \nROAs have generally been high. Credit qua lity has been good, although slippage is \nbeginning to show in some portfolios.  \nLooking ahead, Kansas bankers face continui ng challenges as the structure of the \nbanking industry and the state economy evolve . As Kansas goes, so goes Kansas banking, \nand so the important questions can be framed  around what opportunity will there be in the \nKansas economy of the future? \n \n \n\nWhat sets the Tenth District and Kansas apart?  \n \nThe industrial structure of the Tenth Fede ral Reserve District, including that of \nKansas, has changed considerably in recent decad es, and it will continue to change in the \nyears ahead. It is vital for Kansas bankers, as they think about the future of their community \nbanks, to be prepared for whatever they encounter.  \nAccording to research by our Bank’s economis ts, a region’s ability to outperform the \nnational economy hinges on the industries that  are unique to that area. These defining \nindustries are what can differentiate, for be tter or worse, a local economy from national \ntrends. Knowing both what these industries ar e and how they are changing is vital for \nrecognizing the opportunities as well as the risks. \nBefore we discuss the industries that most  define the Kansas economy, it is important \nto look at the overall evolving i ndustrial structure, both in Kansas and more broadly in the \nseven states of th e Tenth District. \nTo give an idea of just how much the st ructure of the regional economy has changed \nover a long period: At the time of the 1900 Census , nearly half of all workers in the Tenth \nDistrict were employed in the agriculture and mining sectors. By 2000, that share had \ndropped to less than 5 percent. Manufacturing’ s share of employment in the region has also \nfallen as technological advances make it pos sible for fewer workers to produce greater \namounts of goods.  \nDuring this transformation to a more serv ice-based economy, the industrial structure \nof both Kansas and the entire Tent h District has come to look so mewhat more like the rest of \nthe nation. However, it is important  to note that in even with th is transition, we still remain \ndistinctly different. In a ranking of how closely states mirror the national industrial structure, \n\nKansas is 30th, and other states in the Tenth District are even more unique, including New \nMexico, 43rd, and Oklahoma, 47th. Wyoming was the state most unlike the national economy, \nfinishing 51st in the ranking, which also included the District of Columbia. \nAs you might expect, a few of the Tenth Dist rict’s defining industries, or those that \nmost differentiate our region from the rest of the country, include energy extraction and \nagriculture. Others that play a role include such long-standing  important industries as meat \npacking, aircraft manufacturing, rail tr ansportation and te lecommunications. \nHowever, in various places across the Tent h District, new industries are emerging as \nsignificant. These are industries that have achie ved critical mass, they  pay relatively well and \nthey are expected to continue to grow rapidl y. A few examples from various District states \ninclude software and computer  systems design, medical labora tories and biosciences, and \ndata processing and other high-t ech back-office support services. \nMost of the long-standing defi ning industries for the rest of the Tenth District play the \nsame role in Kansas, and they will likely continue to do so for many years to come. However, \nI believe there are also a couple of emerging industries in the st ate worthy of some attention \ntoday. In order to thrive in the future, Kansas banks need to be aware of what these industries \nare, and what risks and o pportunities they present. \nOne industry that still highly defines Kansas is aircraft  manufacturing—centered in \nWichita. This industry has been hit hard at times  in recent decades with defense cutbacks, as \nwell as the overall difficulties  of the airline industry follo wing 9/11. But the industry has \nperformed well of late—aircraft manufacturing employment in Ka nsas is up 6 percent from a \nyear ago—and the outlook is generally positive.  Increases in demand for defense aerospace \n\nproduction the past few years and an improving tr end in demand for civilian aircraft have \ncreated solid job growth.  \nAnd demand for personal air travel in general is likely to rise relative to other forms of \ntransportation heading forward, as real income s rise. This should be a boon for Wichita’s \ncivilian aircraft makers, as well as their many suppliers and employees in the years to come, \nproviding some opportunities for Kansas bankers . The industry will likely remain relatively \nvolatile, though, presenting so me lending risks as well. \nAnother highly defining industry in the st ate is wired telecommunications providers, \ncentered primarily at the Sprint Campus in  Johnson County but distributed in many ways \nacross the state. Wired telecoms were victims of the high-tech bust of  this decade, brought on \nby considerable overinvestment during the 1990s . While performance has improved slightly \nin the past couple of years and some opport unities exist as high-sp eed wired telecom access \nreaches more homes, employment remains well below pre-2001 recession levels, and many \nanalysts project the outlook for wired telecoms to not be as solid as for wireless, cable and \nsatellite telecommunications. Industry cons olidation and strong price competition are \nexpected to decrease telecom employment as well. But telecommunications in general will \nremain important to Kansas bankers, both as they  make sure their own bank is up-to-speed on \nthe latest capabilities and as they watch the extent to which the important telecom \ninfrastructure and expertise located in Kansas can adjust to changing trends in the industry. \nIn addition to aircraft and telecoms, another industry that remains fundamentally \nimportant throughout the state is, of course, ag riculture, in all facets of the industry. This \nincludes input supply and processing; farming and ranching; and, increasingly, biofuels. In \ngeneral, employment growth in agriculture-relat ed industries is anticipated to be sluggish \n\nheading forward as farming t echnologies and productivity con tinue to advance, although the \nrecent success of biofuels may provide some boo st. While risks exist regarding the long-term \nviability of ethanol as an economic driver, the adaptation of traditional agricultural methods \nand expertise to new products and services may continue to present opportunities in many \nparts of Kansas and thus be opportunities for Kansas banks to grow and expand as well. \nThese might include other types of alternativ e energy, other high-valu e-added products, agri-\ntourism and the like. \nWhile aircraft manufacturing, telecommunicatio ns and agriculture will, in one way or \nanother, continue to largely define and drive the Kansas economy in the years ahead, there \nalso are a couple of other industries emerging as significant in the state. Though, as with the \nstate’s long-standing defining indu stries, there are risks to re lying too heavily and focusing \ntoo much attention on specific industries, these industries could serve as  potential anchors for \nfuture economic growth in some areas. As such, their recent developments and trends need to \nbe on the radar screens of Kansas bankers. \nThe first is biosciences, including ag product-related research a nd development, as \nwell as R&D related to human health, food and pharmaceuticals and animal health. As \nrecently at 1990, this industry had very little pr esence in Kansas relative to the country as a \nwhole. But by 2005, it was more than twice as c oncentrated here as in the nation. It now \nemploys thousands and has begun to blossom in several places around the state. Although it \nhas been prominently located in Johnson County, where synergies with the Stowers Institute \nin Kansas City, Mo., are possible, activity has also emerged in or near most of the state’s larger university towns—including Lawr ence, Manhattan, Wichita and Hays. The \nbiosciences industry pays quite well (avera ge earnings of $48,000 in 2005), and the outlook \n\nheading forward is generally bright. While activ ity is likely to continue to center around \ncollege towns or areas with la rge research institu tions, the economic wealth created could \nbenefit many banks throughout the state.  \nIn addition to biosciences, a second important  emerging industry in Kansas is what is \ntermed office administrative services, and includ es relatively high-tech  back-office logistics, \npayroll, and other types of management suppor t and consulting services. Like biosciences, \nthis industry is now more than  twice as concentrated in Kans as as in the nation, and it pays \nrelatively well (also ~$48,000). A lthough it is also currently lo cated primarily in Johnson \nCounty, with advancing Internet  technology, portions of this work could potentially be \nperformed in more remote areas looking for new sources of job growth. A key will be \nmaking sure these Kansas communities have ac cess to the right kinds of telecommunications \ninfrastructure, as well as well-ed ucated workers, a necessity for economic growth in general. \n \nSummary  \nTo summarize, the Kansas economy, like the national economy and the economy of \nthe Tenth Federal Reserve District, has changed considerably over time and will continue to change, both within its traditional industries and in new defining industries. While trends in aircraft manufacturing, telecommunications and agriculture will continue  to play a sizable \nrole in the fate of the Kansas economy head ing forward, new industries such as biosciences \nand back-office high-tech work may present so lid opportunities for communities across the \nstate. Kansas bankers can thrive in this chan ging economic environment, but in order to do \nso, they need to be aware of trends in each  of these industries and recognize the unique \nopportunities and risks they  present for the state.",

            "content": "RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS  \nAND PERSPECTIVES ON LONG-TERM GROWTH \n             \nThomas M. Hoenig \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n              \n \n \nCody, Wyoming \nJune 6, 2007 \n \n\n 2\n \n I am pleased to be in Cody today to sp eak with you about the prospects for the \nU.S. economy in the period ahead.  As you know, the U.S. economy has been through a difficult period over the past year, with slower  economic growth and higher inflation.  I \nam optimistic, however, that economic condi tions will improve in coming months.  \nIndeed, as the year progresses,  I expect to see a notable pi ckup in economic growth, and I \nam hopeful that we will also see lower infl ation.  Realistically, though, there are some \nimportant risks to both outlook and inflation, an d the path for monetary policy this year \nwill depend importantly on how these risks play out. \nMoving beyond the near-term outlook, I would also like to discuss some \nsignificant challenges the U.S. economy will face over the longer term.  In recent years, \nthe U.S. economy has performed very well,  with strong growth in employment and \noutput coupled with low interest  rates and inflation.  However,  the future may not be as \nrosy.  Indeed, ongoing demographic changes co mbined with slower productivity growth \ncould lead to a reduction in the economy’ s potential growth rate and make it more \ndifficult to continue to increase our living st andards.  These changes will pose important \nchallenges for policymakers during the next several decades. \nLet me begin with a closer look at re cent economic conditions and the near-term \noutlook and then provide some perspectiv es on these longer term economic issues. \nRecent economic conditions\n \n During the past four quarters, the U. S. economy slowed considerably, with \ngrowth in real gross domestic product averagi ng less than 2 percent.  This is well below \nthe economy’s estimated potential growth rate  of around 3 percent.  At the same time, \ninflation moved higher.  Overall CPI infla tion, measured on a 12-month basis, rose to \n\n 3\nmore than 4 percent last summer before declin ing somewhat last fall.  Core CPI, which \nremoves volatile food and energy prices, wa s close to 3 percent last summer and \ncurrently remains at 2.3 percent.  The slowdown in growth resulted prim arily from weaker investment spending, \nboth residential construction and, more re cently, business investment spending.  The \nslump in housing, by itself, reduced GDP growth  by a full percentage point over the past \nfour quarters.  Indeed, absent the housi ng slowdown, the economy would have grown \nvery near potential last year.   \nThe weakness in business investment sp ending resulted from several sources.  \nSome of the weakness in housing activity sp illed over into busine ss investment spending \nin industries that supply the housing market.  In addition, declining auto sales, caused by \nhigher energy prices, led to cutbacks in auto production and inventories.  Business \nspending on new plant and equipment weakened as  well, for reasons that are not entirely \nclear, but may reflect the gene ral slowing in economic activity. \n Although there has been consid erable talk in the media in recent months about the \npossibility of recession, such talk ignores so me of the fundamental underlying strengths \nin the economy.  In particular, even t hough investment has been weak, consumer \nspending, government spending, and exports ha ve remained strong and have cushioned \nthe effects of weaker investment.  Indee d, despite the slowdown in GDP growth, we \ncontinue to see solid job gains, a nd unemployment remains very low.  \n When we look more closely at the recent behavior of inflation, we see two main \nfactors.  First, higher energy prices last  spring pushed up overall CPI inflation, and may \nhave spilled over into core inflation as well.  When energy prices declined last fall, we \n\n 4\nsaw considerable improvement in overall  CPI inflation and a somewhat smaller \nimprovement in core inflation.  The second key factor affecting infla tion last year was a \nlarge increase in the cost  of homeownership, which was caused by the housing boom \nduring the past few years.  After rising shar ply last spring, increa ses in homeownership \ncosts have moderated, contributing to the slowing in inflation in recent months. \nThe near-term outlook  \n  Turning to the near-term outlook, most fo recasters see a pickup in growth for the \nbalance of this year and some  moderation in core inflation.  I share this outlook.  Indeed, \nI believe growth is likely to average 2.5 percen t to 3 percent over the balance of this year \nand turn in a similar performance next year.   \nThis improvement comes from several sources, including: solid consumer \nspending, strong export growth and government  spending, higher business inventory and \nfixed investment, and a diminishing drag from  residential construction.  Because growth \nis likely to remain below the economy’s potential growth rate, however, we may see \nunemployment rise somewhat by year-end.  I al so believe that we will see some gradual \nimprovement in core inflation, especially as homeownership costs continue to moderate. \nRealistically, however, there are some important risks to the outlook, and the \nanticipated pickup in growth may be delaye d.  Growth may not rebound quickly if the \nhousing slump turns out to be deeper or more prolonged than expected.  As you know, \nmuch of the recent weakness in housing market s is due to the contraction in subprime \nlending.  Many of the new home loans made in  recent years were to borrowers who did \nnot qualify for conventional mortgage financ ing.  And, a large numbe r of these loans had \nfeatures, such as low teaser rates, short ad justment periods and interest-only payments, \n\n 5\nthat made them vulnerable in a higher interest rate environment.  Indeed, a rise in short-\nterm interest rates and reduced home price appreciation have made it difficult for some \nsubprime borrowers to continue to make mort gage payments or refinance their mortgage, \nleading to a rise in delinquencie s and increased foreclosures.   \nThese developments have caused highly publicized difficulties for some lenders \nspecializing in subprime lending and have resulted in some ti ghtening of credit terms in \nthe subprime sector.  Moreover, in the past fe w weeks, we have also seen some upward \npressure on conventional mortgage rates, which may put additional pressure on housing \nmarkets.  Most forecasters believe it will be several more months before conditions \nstabilize and even longer before we see a housing recovery.   \n Another risk is that consumer spending may turn out weaker than anticipated.  \nConsumer spending has been the primary engine of growth during the pa st several years.  \nHowever, many consumers have been sp ending beyond their incomes by tapping into \nhome equity.  With lower hous e price appreciation, this spen ding stimulus may diminish.  \nWe have also seen somewhat weaker employ ment growth and retail spending in the past \nfew months, which may be a harbinger of weaker consumer spending going forward.  \nThe recent uptick in energy prices may contribut e to slower spending as well, especially \nfor autos. \nA third risk is that business investme nt spending may remain sluggish.  Weak \ninvestment spending would not onl y result in lower economic gr owth in the near term but \ncould also reduce growth in productive capacity, leading to lower potential growth and \nhigher inflationary pressures over the long te rm.  I will have more to say about the \nconnections among investment, productiv ity and growth in a few minutes. \n\n 6\nNot all of the growth risks are on the downside, however.  Growth could be \nstronger than expected due to stronger exports  and greater fiscal s timulus.  Export growth \nwill benefit from the weaker dollar during th e past several years as well as stronger \neconomic growth abroad.  In fact, much of  the recent improvement in manufacturing \nactivity, both in the Tenth Di strict and nationally, is being driven by stronger export \norders.  There is also likely to be significant fiscal stim ulus coming from the improved \nbudget situation of state and local governments as well as  continued strong defense \nspending. \nThere are also risks that inflation may not moderate as expected.  Recently, we \nhave seen renewed strength in energy pr ices, which may pass th rough temporarily into \ncore inflation.  In addition, there may be a dditional cost pressures coming from tight \nlabor markets, rising commodity input prices an d the lower dollar.  Of special concern is \nthe recent slowdown in labor productivity, which,  if it continues, woul d lead to additional \ncost pressures in the future. \nAs to monetary policy in the period ahead, the Federal Reserve faces some \ndifficult decisions in balancing the risk of weaker growth agains t the risk of higher \ninflation.  In my judgment, th e current stance of policy, with a federal funds rate at 5 ¼ \npercent reflects an appropriate balancing of  these opposing risks.  I believe that the \ncurrent policy stance is somewhat restrictive and, if maintained, will bring core inflation \nback to acceptable levels ove r time.  While I can envision a set of circumstances in which \nthe funds rate is lowered, I can just as easily see circumstances in which policy might \nneed to be tightened further.  Consequently, any future change in the stance of policy will \nlikely depend on the evolution of the economy in the coming months. \n\n 7\nLonger term growth and m onetary policy challenges  \nIn my remaining time here, I would like to shift from a discussion of the near-\nterm economic outlook to examine the longer ru n growth prospects for the U.S. economy.  \nSpecifically, I would like to focus on some of  the important factors that will determine \nour potential rate of growth in coming decades  and the challenges they pose for monetary \npolicy.  Economists define potential output as the output that an economy can produce \nwith fully employed resources and with low an d stable inflation.  The growth in potential \noutput is a key determinant of how fast our living standards improve over time.  \nCurrently, many economists believe that the po tential growth rate of the U.S. economy \ncould slow over the next decade from current  estimates of around 3 percent to 2 to 2 ½ \npercent.  I would like to examine why this might happen and some of the difficulties this could create. \nGrowth in potential output stems from two main sources: growth in the labor \nforce and growth in the productivity or th e amount of output than can be produced per \nworker.  Labor force growth depends mainly on demographic factors such as the size of \nthe working age population.  Productivity growth depends on amounts of capital \nequipment, technology, and the education and sk ills of the labor force.  Forecasts of \nslower growth in potential output are based primarily on estimates of a sizable slowdown \nin labor force growth and pa rtly on estimates of declini ng productivity gr owth over the \nnext several years.  To see what lies behind these projections, let me take a closer look at \nthese two factors. \n \n\n 8\nLabor force growth  \n The projected slowing of labor force grow th is largely based on the anticipated \nretirement of baby boomers over the next decade.   It also reflects a continuation of the \nlower labor force participati on rates of younger age groups in  recent years.  As you know, \npopulation aging is not unique to the United St ates.  Most industrialized countries and \neven some developing countries, such as Ch ina, will experience rapid population aging \nand lower labor force growth in coming decades.  Three factors might mitigate the expected slowing of the labor force.  One possibility is that many workers may postpone retirement.  In fact, we have seen some signs of increasing labor force participation rates for older ag e groups in recent years.  In \naddition, increased shortages of labor c ould lead to rising wages and increased \nparticipation rates for those not currently in the labor force.   \nHowever, the largest factor is likely to be  the role that immigration plays in labor \nforce growth.  Immigration has been an increas ingly important part of the labor force in \nrecent years and potentially could make up a si gnificant portion of the expected shortfall \nin labor force due to population aging.  Howe ver, recent immigrants have generally had \nless education and job skills than the overall labor force and so would need significant \nimprovement in these areas to be as productive as other workers. \nProductivity trends  \n While some slowing of labor force growth is inevitable, the outlook for \nproductivity growth is much less certain.  As we look back over the past several decades, we see both periods of strong productivity growth and periods of weak productivity \ngrowth.  During the 1960s and early 1970s, for example, growth of output per hour in the \n\n 9\nnonfarm business sector averaged a strong 2.8 pe rcent.  Then, from the mid-1970s to the \nmid-1990s, productivity growth dropped by half  to only 1.4 percent.  Corresponding to \nthis slowdown in productivity growth was a sign ificant slowing in the growth of potential \noutput to around 2 percent to 2 ¼ percent.  Beginning in the mid-1990s and cont inuing to 2004, however, productivity \ngrowth rebounded to around 2.9 percent, and es timates of potential growth increased to 3 \nto 3 ½ percent.  Economists have attributed mu ch of this surge in productivity to business \ninvestments in information a nd telecommunications technology. \nMore recently, we have once again experi enced much lower productivity growth.  \nSince 2005, productivity growth has averaged only  1.8 percent.  It is this recent slowing \nthat is starting to concern policymakers beca use, if it continues, it could exacerbate the \nreduction in potential out put growth coming from sl ower labor force growth. \nAs I noted earlier, productivity growth is closely tied to factors such as the \namounts and types of capital workers use as well as the skills that workers apply to their \njobs.  Worker skills, of course, depend on education and on-the-job training.  The \nquantity of capital goods and the technology incorporated in those goods depends \nprimarily on research and development and investment decisions made by firms.  The \nrecent weakness in business investment spending that I discussed earlier is potentially worrisome because it could exacerbate the r ecent productivity slowdown and so lead to \nslower growth in potential  output over the longer run. \nChallenges for monetary policy  \n Let me conclude with a brief discussion of the implications of these developments \nfor monetary policy.  To begin, it is importa nt to recognize what monetary policy can and \n\n 10\ncannot do with regard to growth in potentia l output.  Monetary policy can play a major \nrole in assuring that the economy operates close to its potentia l.  For example, the Federal \nReserve can push interest rates up to head o ff inflationary pressures when the economy is \noperating above potential.  And, the Fed can push rates down to provide economic \nstimulus when the economy is operating below its potential.   \nTo be effective in stabilizing the ec onomy, however, policymakers must have a \nreasonably accurate measure of the econom y’s potential growth.  Without this \ninformation, there is the risk that policy coul d be unnecessarily tight if potential growth is \nunderestimated or too inflationa ry if potential growth is overestimated.  In fact, some \neconomists attribute the surge in inflation during the 1970s to polic ymakers’ failure to \nrecognize the slowdown in produc tivity growth and potential growth that I discussed \nearlier.  Consequently, the be havior of productivity and poten tial growth over the next \nfew years could have important implications for monetary policy. \nFinally, it is important to recognize that while monetary policy can help provide \nshort-run economic stability, it cannot affect the rate of potential out put growth directly. \nAs we have seen, the economy’s potential gr owth rate depends mainly on demographic \nfactors and productivity.  Monetary policy ca n influence potential growth indirectly by \nproviding a stable, noninflationary  economic environment.  Su ch an environment reduces \nuncertainty about the economic outlook.  In doing so, it provides a more favorable \nframework for households to pl an their lifetime savings a nd spending decisions and for \nbusinesses to make long-term investment deci sions.  And, as businesses are encouraged \nto pursue research and development and introduce new technology, productivity and \npotential growth increase.  Thus, by providi ng an environment of economic stability and \n\n 11\nprice stability in the short run, monetary pol icy can contribute to the economy’s potential \ngrowth in the longer term. \n###",

            "content": "OKLAHOMA BANKS \nAND THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF KANSAS CITY \n  \n    \n Thomas M. Hoenig \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n  \n \n               \nThe Oklahoma Bankers Association Annual Convention \nOklahoma City, Oklahoma \nJune 12, 2007 \n \n\n 2\n \nIt is a real pleasure for me to be here , and I want to thank you for the opportunity. \nThe Oklahoma Bankers Association and the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \nhave an important relationship.  Banks provide a key link in the implementation of monetary \npolicy, and our relationship with  the OBA is an important co mponent in carrying out our \nresponsibilities for the macroeconomy and for financial stability. The connections between \nour organizations extend into other areas as well, ranging from the cr edit available through \nour discount window to the work of our bank exam iners to our role in the payments system. \nWe know each other well and have for years. \nWhen times are good, as they are now, we mi ght tend to take our strong connection for \ngranted.  Today I’d like to reflect on our l ong working relationship:  how it has worked \nduring stressful times in the past and its importance for the future. I will also outline several banking issues we should be aware of even as we enjoy today’s very positive banking \nenvironment. Finally, I will briefly discuss the current banking conditions in Oklahoma. \n \nThe Oklahoma Bankers Association and th e Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n \nFrom their beginnings, both the Oklahoma Bankers Association and the Federal \nReserve Bank of Kansas City have had a strong interest in serving th eir membership and the \npublic.  The OBA had its start in June 1897 – 110 years ago this month – 10 years before \nOklahoma became a state.  The Federal Rese rve Bank of Kansas City opened in 1914 and \nour Oklahoma City Branch  had its start in 1920. \nThere are many things I can mention in term s of a very positive relationship between \nOklahoma bankers and the Federal Reserve.  Many of you have participated at our \nconferences, economic forums and regulatory up dates.  We have also had a supervisory \n\n 3\nrelationship with nearly all of you, at either a bank or a holding company level.  Moreover, \nOklahoma bankers, including some of you, have b een important participants on our board of \ndirectors in Kansas City and at our Oklahoma City Branch. \nOklahoma bankers, the OBA and Oklahoma legisl ators have also been very active in \nstate and national legislative issues, including many key pieces of legislation affecting the \nFederal Reserve.   \nIn discussing the Federal Reserve’s conn ection to Oklahoma, I should mention first \nand foremost that the person who was responsible for writing much of the original Federal Reserve Act was Robert Owen of Oklahoma, ch airman of the Senate Banking Committee.  \nWithout his efforts, and those of several other key legislators from the Midwest, it is unlikely \nthat the Federal Reserve Act would have been  passed in 1913 and that we would have the \ntype of central bank that we have today. \nOn a more personal level, I would also lik e to mention my long personal relationship \nwith Roger Beverage and Mick Thompson.  They  have been extremely helpful in providing \nme with their insights on Okla homa banking and have been great to work with on a variety of \nbanking issues of importance to Oklahoma and our region. \n The Federal Reserve’s Invol vement in Supervision \n \nThe Federal Reserve derives many benefits  from our connection with each of you.  \nOur Oklahoma City Branch office gains insi ght on the regional economy by staying in \ncontact with bankers and lo cal business leaders. We al so place great importance on \nmaintaining our relationships through our  role in supervision and payments. \n\n 4\nIn the area of supervision, Federal Re serve Governor Don Kohn described the \nimportance of this connection in a recent speech, saying, “The Federal Reserve’s activities as \na bank supervisor provide us with important a nd sometimes critical information, expertise, \ncredibility and powers to both dete r and manage financial crises.” \nFrom a personal and a very practical perspe ctive, this supervisory experience and the \nresulting relationships with banke rs on a regional level proved to be extremely helpful to me \nand others at our Bank during th e energy, real estate and agri cultural collapses in the 1980s. \nThis was particularly true in Oklahoma as  energy prices dropped dramatically.  We \nrelied extensively on the firsthand knowledge gained through our supe rvisory responsibilities \nof major Oklahoma banking organizations.  This  knowledge provided us with an in-depth \nview into the Oklahoma economy an d financial system – insight that proved to be of great \nimportance when our Bank was called upon to gi ve its views on macroeconomic policy and \nto take steps to help maintain a stable financial system.   \nWhile much of the rest of the country was still experienci ng “boom-like” economic \nconditions, we were among the fi rst regions to sound the alarm that the economy was not as \nstrong as some thought. \nIn one instance – the failure of Penn Square Bank here in Oklahoma City – we were all \nreminded that a seemingly small organization can have a substantia l impact on the entire \nbanking system and that actions on a regiona l level can have important implications \nnationwide.  Prior to its failure , Penn Square Bank had sold loan participations to eight of the \n50 largest banks in the country.  These participations served as the initial impetus in the \nfailure of Continental Illinoi s National Bank in 1984, which wa s one of the 10 largest U.S. \n\n 5\nbanks, and in Bank of America’s acquisition of  Seattle First National Bank under a special \nWashington state failing-bank law. \nMany of the steps taken in Oklahoma in the 1980s also benefited from a close \nrelationship among the Federal Reserve, the Oklahoma Banking Department, the FDIC, the \nOCC and individual bankers in Oklahoma.  This  was a very stressful time for everyone, and \none of my strong memories from that time was the effort by John Kirkpa trick to save Liberty \nNational Bank and keep it under lo cal ownership.  The commitme nt of John and a number of \nothers helped Liberty become one of only tw o major banks in Oklahoma and Texas not to \nfail or need FDIC assistance dur ing the 1980s.  Such efforts were  of critical importance in \nterms of providing a starting point for tu rning around the Oklahoma economy, maintaining \nfunding for many businesses here and encouraging investment in other banks, such as George \nKaiser’s willingness to support Bank of Okla homa.  These relationships and experience \nfurther made it clear to me that banking in th e United States is best  understood and nurtured \nat a regional level.   \n The Changing Banking Landscape and Financial Competition\n \nSince the 1980s, the banking landscape has ch anged quite dramatica lly, and all of you \nnow face a much different competitive environmen t.  In this new environment, I would like \nto think the relationship to the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City is as important and solid \nas ever. \nThere has been a significan t trend toward consolidation.  The number of banks \nnationwide, and in Oklahoma, has declined to about half the 1980 level.  During this same \ntime period, the 10 largest banking or ganizations in the United Stat es increased their share of \n\n 6\ndomestic banking deposits from about 19 percent to  more than 44 percent.  Interstate banking \nhas also been an important factor in these cons olidation trends, with ba nking organizations as \na group now holding nearly the same amount of de posits in other states as they hold within \ntheir home states.  In Oklahoma, 27 percen t of deposits are held by organizations \nheadquartered outside of the state. \nWhile there may be fewer banks in Okla homa, many of you are competing against \nlarger institutions, including a notable num ber headquartered outside of Oklahoma.  \nMoreover, the total number of banking offices – main offices and branches combined – has \nrisen since 1980 by about two-thir ds nationwide and somewhat mo re than that in Oklahoma. \nCompeting institutions have wider footprints in your markets.  As a result, structural changes in banking, along with several othe r factors I’ll discuss next, ar e leading to a more intensely \ncompetitive environment – one that differs greatly from that of just a decade or two before.      \nOn the lending side, a wide variety of fact ors are leading to more competitive credit \nmarkets.  Financial information on borrowers is  more readily available and at a much lower \ncost – both to bankers and to a wide range of nonbank lenders.  At the same time, the cost of \nprocessing this loan data and making a loan ha s declined significantly, particularly with the \nadvent of credit scoring, automated underw riting systems and other data processing \nadvances.  Loan customers can even be soli cited over the internet, and funds are often \nextended with little or no personal contact. \nSecuritization is further bri nging new investors into the marketplace, sometimes from \nall over the world, and increasing the volume of  funds flowing into credit markets.  \nSecuritization is also creating lenders who are largely originat ors and hold very few loans on \ntheir books at any time.  In addi tion, new financial instruments, su ch as credit derivatives, are \n\n 7\nallowing credit risk to be transferred to other parties – ideally, to thos e who are in the best \nposition to bear such risks. \nAn outgrowth of all these developments is  an enormous expansion in the types of \nlenders and investors that serv e credit markets, and, in turn, the creation of a much more \ncompetitive lending marketplace.  These trends  have further brought down risk premiums, \nand the spread between high-yield or junk bonds and U.S. Treasury securities has now \ndropped to near historic lows. \nOn the deposit side, a rising interest rate en vironment has meant a higher cost of funds \nfor banks.  Further adding to these funding costs is increased deposit competition.  The \ninternet is greatly expanding the choices that depositors have for placing their money.  Local \nbankers are also facing increasing competition from other sources.  Many large banks, for example, have rediscovered the benefits of  retail banking and a broader office network, \nparticularly as competition drives down profitabi lity in their other business lines.  In addition, \na rising stock market and improving returns on other investments are now encouraging \ndepositors to move more funds into nonbank investment options. \nAs all of you are aware, these trends ar e driving up the cost of bank funding and \nbeginning to put pressure on bank ne t interest margins.  During the past few years, increased \nreal estate and business lending have helped  Oklahoma banks to maintain or increase \nprofitability in this more competitive environm ent and period of declining risk spreads.  \nHowever, there are obvious limits to how far th is strategy can be ta ken without adversely \naffecting a bank’s risk exposure and potential lo an losses.  Thus, for all of you as Oklahoma \nbankers, an important question is, “How far can you go in this new environment and still \nmaintain profitable and safe banking operations?” \n\n 8\n \nRisks and Responsibilities  \nThe current performance of Oklahoma banks  indicates that many of you are meeting \nthe challenges of this changi ng landscape.  Net income for Oklahoma banks has been at or \nnear record levels for the past few years.  In fact, the average ROAA for Oklahoma banks \nwas 1.4 percent in 2006, which may very well be the highest ever achie ved in this state. \nOther measures of banking performance, su ch as loan growth, interest margins, \ncapital, nonperforming assets and loan losses have also remained at very favorable levels. \nBased on this performance, it would app ear that a challenge many of you face as \nOklahoma bankers is not to become complacent a nd lose sight of the risks that are always \ninherent in your operations. \nIn this regard, I recently gave a speech tit led, “This Time It’s Different (Or Is It?).” \nThe idea behind this speech was that some ba nkers are now telling us, as well as their \ndirectors and stockholders, not to worry  about their current strategies.  \nPart of their reasoning is that the market place has changed and that we are more \ncapable of measuring and controlling risk expo sures.  Many also suggest that the United \nStates economy has become much more stable , as based on our recent experience with \nseveral of the longest expans ions on record and very mild  recessions in between.   \nIn some ways, though, this combination of great optimism, record bank earnings and \ndeclining risk spreads mirrors what we saw here in Oklahoma during the energy boom of the \n1970s and early 1980s.  Back the n, many Oklahoma bankers saw little reason to worry about \nrisk spreads since the price of oil could only go up.   \nAnd indeed it did – for a while.  \n\n 9\nFrom $2.75 a barrel in 1973, oil prices rose to a peak of  nearly $37 in 1981 before \ndropping all the way down to $10 in 1986.  Th e optimism and rapid upward trend in oil \nprices made energy lending the hottest ticket in  banking back then and ultimately contributed \nto previously mentioned collapses of Penn Squa re Bank, Continental Illinois and Sea-First. \nFor most of you, this is hardly new inform ation.  My point in drawing this quick \ncomparison is not that I think we will repeat wh at happened then, but I be lieve we need to be \na little careful at this point in the business and credit cycle.  In my previous speech on this \ntopic, I gave a number of examples of banke rs in the 1970s and 1980s who thought they were \nfollowing “foolproof” strategies only to find there was something they should have been \nmuch more skeptical about.  Even tually, some of today’s strategi es will be tested under more \nstressful circumstances – subprime lending is a current example – and we will then find out \nhow “foolproof” such strategies might be. \n \nSummary  \nOne key to success for bankers is to be will ing to ask the difficult questions about your \nbank’s operations and strategies:  Is there anything that you shoul d be more skeptical about?  \nThese are the kinds of questions that bankers  and central bankers should be asking as we \nmanage the present and prepare for the future. N one of us can predict the future, my 30 years \nin banking and economics taught me that, bu t we can prepare for its uncertainty. \nI would assert that each of  you is in the best position of anyone in the financial \nmarketplace to play this role, given your cl ose customer relationships and the detailed \nknowledge and experience gained th rough your daily banking operations. \n   \n\n 10\nFinally, to come full circle, I suggest that  the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \nand the Oklahoma Bankers must continue to  pursue the common objectives of sound banking \nand a sound economy.  Our staff are observing best , and worst, practices.  We can provide \ninsight and help strengthen banking in Okla homa. As Oklahoma bankers, you can greatly \nhelp the Federal Reserve as well, by sharing with us your valuable knowledge and personal \ninsights on the Oklahoma banking industry and the economy. \nI look forward to hearing your thoughts on the current banking environment and to \ncontinue our banking and supervisory relationships. \n###",

            "content": "THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND MONETARY POLICY:  \nCHALLENGES IN THE PERIOD AHEAD \n         \nThomas M. Hoenig \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n     \n \n            \nOmaha, Nebraska \nJuly 19, 2006\n\n 2\n \n  It is a pleasure to be in Omaha toda y to discuss the national economic outlook and \nmonetary policy.  Over the past three year s, the U.S. economy performed very well.  \nStrong output and employment growth led to a significant drop in th e unemployment rate, \nand inflation remained relatively lo w despite higher energy costs.   \nRecently, however, we have seen increas ing signs that economic conditions are \nbecoming less favorable.  Continuing high energy  costs and rising intere st rates appear to \nbe slowing economic growth.  At the same ti me, inflationary pressures are beginning to \nemerge.  These developments have been associated with increased volatility in \ncommodity markets and in fina ncial markets around the world. \n The changing economic environment has important implications for the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy.  Since June 2004, the Federal Reserve has systematically \nraised its federal funds rate ta rget from 1 % to its current level of 5 ¼ %.  Over this \nperiod, as credit costs have increased, the stance of monetary policy has moved from \nbeing extremely accommodative to a setting I w ould characterize as somewhat restrictive. \n Going forward, however, the outlook for policy is much less clear, and \nuncertainty about the future policy path appe ars to be one factor behind some of the \nrecent volatility in financial markets.  Indeed, as you are aware, there is currently a lively \ndebate among financial market participants a bout whether the Fed will need to raise rates \nfurther to ward off inflationary pressure s or whether the Fed has already tightened \nsufficiently to maintain its commitment to long-run price stability and stable economic \ngrowth. \n\n 3\n In my remarks, today, I would like to provide my assessment of current economic \nconditions and the outlook for the economy in th e period ahead.  I would also like to offer \nmy perspective on the challenges facing m onetary policy in this difficult economic \nenvironment.  In this regard, I would em phasize that my views are my own and do not \nrepresent the official position of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market \nCommittee.  Current Economic Conditions\n \n Let me begin by taking a closer look at  the performance of the economy in recent \nmonths.  2006 started out on a very strong note.   First quarter GDP growth rose 5.6 %, a \nconsiderable improvement from the sluggish pace at the end of 2005.  As you may recall, \ngrowth was held down in the second half of last year by a combination of the effects of \nthe Gulf hurricanes, higher energy costs, and reduced auto incentives.  So, part of the \nsurge in growth in the first quarter was a bounce back from the economic weakness last \nyear.    Most forecasters believe that the pace of economic activity sl owed in the second \nquarter of this year to around 3 % due to  weaker consumer spending and slower \nresidential investment.  The most recent r ound of energy price increases seems to be \nhitting some consumers very hard, and the e ffects are being felt both in purchases of \nautos and other retail sales.  There is also  growing evidence that housing is slowing in \nmost parts of the country as higher interest  rates and rising home prices have reduced \naffordability.  At the national level, single family permits have declined for several \n\n 4\nmonths.  Signs of a softening housing mark et are also showing through in weaker \nhousing starts and sales of new and existi ng homes in many parts of the country. \n We are also seeing signs that hiring is slowing.  N onfarm payroll employment \naveraged 176,000 over the first three months  of the year but only 108,000 in the second \nquarter.  Much of this slowdown has been  in retail trade and construction, no doubt \nreflecting the softness in consumer spending and housing.  Amid the signs of slower growth, re cent inflation news has been somewhat \ndisturbing.  While higher energy co sts have caused broad infla tion measures to rise over \nthe past few years, most core measures of  inflation, which exclude volatile energy and \nfood prices, have remained low.  In the past  few months, however, we have seen sizeable \nincreases even in core measures of inflati on.  For example, core CPI rose 3.8 % over the \nthree months from March to May while the core PCE deflator increased 3.25 % over a \nsimilar period.   \nOne explanation for the pickup in inflat ion is that energy costs are now being \npassed through to prices of ot her goods and services to a grea ter extent than  previously.  \nWhen energy costs increased a few years ago, the lack of pass through to the general \nprice level was somewhat surpri sing.  Now the surprise seems to be going in the opposite \ndirection.   \nAlternatively, these increases could also reflect fact that the economy has been \noperating at high levels of resource utilizat ion for a period of time.  The current \nunemployment rate of 4.6 % is  below the level many economi sts believe is consistent \nwith full employment and stable prices.  And, capacity utilization has been rising in many \nindustries.  In any event, if these recent elevated inflation readings persist, they could \n\n 5\nmake it difficult for the Federal Reserve to maintain price stability over a medium-term \ntime horizon. \n \nThe Outlook and Risks to the Outlook  \n So far, I have discussed where the economy  has been and our best estimates of the \ncurrent economic situation.  From a moneta ry policy standpoint,  however, it is the \neconomic outlook over the next several quarters th at is most important in determining the \nfuture path of policy.  Let me move next to a brief discussion of the outlook and some of \nmajor risks to the outlook in the period ahead.  Many economic forecasters see somewhat slower growth continuing in the second \nhalf of this year and into 2007.  Indeed, most estimates of GDP growth over the next six \nquarters are about 3 % or sligh tly lower, which seems quite r easonable to me.  In looking \nat these numbers it is important to keep th em in perspective.  Many economists believe \nthat the U.S. economy’s potential growth ra te is around 3.25 %, so a 3 % growth rate, \nwhile somewhat below potential, may be a desirable development to keep the economy from overheating.  A more detailed look at the outlook suggest s that the major ar eas of slowing in \nmost forecasts are housing and consumer sp ending, reflecting the continuing effects of \nhigh interest rates, high energy costs, and sl ower employment growth.  In addition, weak \nhousing prices and stock pr ices could act as a drag  on consumer spending. \n Offsetting the weakness in these se ctors are healthy business investment \nspending on plant and equipment and increased exports due to strong growth in our major \ntrading partners.  Also, when we look be yond the consumer and housing sectors, there \n\n 6\nappears to be considerable strength in ma nufacturing, much of it aimed toward export \nmarkets, that is likely to pr ovide ongoing support to the economy. \n As to the outlook for inflation, most for ecasters see elevated inflation levels for \nthe next few months.  Over the longer te rm, however, slowing economic growth and a \nmoderation in energy costs are expected to put downward pressure on both overall and \ncore inflation measures.  Indeed, most forecas ters see both overall and core measures of \ninflation somewhat lower next year. \nWhile I am in general agreement with  the consensus outlook that I have \ndescribed, I recognize there are both upside ri sks to inflation and downside risks to \ngrowth.  If either should materialize, the futu re course of monetary  policy could be quite \ndifferent than we now expect.   \nAs to inflation risks, the main concern is  that inflation could stay elevated for a \nconsiderable period of time and could feed in to higher inflation exp ectations in financial \nmarkets and labor markets.  If so, the Federal Reserve might have to tighten policy \nfurther to insure that inflation expectations are contained and price stability is maintained \nover the long term.  Thus far, inflation e xpectations have remained fairly subdued, but \nthey will require continued scrutiny in coming months.  However, there is also some likeliho od that the economy could slow more than \nwe currently expect.  The la st several policy moves by th e Federal Reserve are still \nworking through the economy and may have a bigge r effect in restraining growth than we \nare forecasting.  Growth could also be w eaker if energy prices do not moderate as \nexpected.  In addition, consumers in the U. S. have been living beyond their means in \nrecent years, tapping into savings and home e quity to finance current consumption.   Any \n\n 7\nretrenchment by consumers from recent spendi ng patterns could lead to weaker economic \ngrowth.  Finally, central banks in a number of other industria lized countries are currently \ntightening policy, and slower growth abroad could limit some of the anticipated \nimprovement in U.S. exports over the next year.  Challenges for Monetary Policy\n  \nWith this discussion of the economic ou tlook as a backdrop, I would like to use \nmy remaining time today to explore the chal lenges facing monetary policy in the period \nahead.   In doing so, I am not in a position to  speculate about the futu re course of policy.  \nRather, what I hope to convey is some of my thinking about the design of monetary \npolicy strategy in the curren t economic environment.  \nAt the present time, financial markets place a fairly high probability on another \nincrease in the federal funds  rate target from 5 ¼ % to  5 ½ % at the August FOMC \nmeeting.  The downward slope to the Treasur y yield curve, however, suggests that \nmarkets believe the Federal Reserve is clos e to completing the ti ghtening cycle and is \nlikely to reduce rates somewhat over a longer time horizon. \nThe primary reason markets expect furthe r tightening in the near term is the \nexpected response of the Federal Reserve to hi gher core inflation.  Indeed, this morning’s \nrelease of the June CPI numbers is consistent with the view that inflation pressures are continuing.  The overall CPI for June was up .2 % and core CPI was up .3 %.  The June \nnumbers imply a three-month rate of 5.1 % for overall CPI and 3.6 % for core CPI and \ntwelve-month rates of 4.3 % and 2.6 % respectively. \n\n 8\nIn interpreting these inflation measures, it is helpful to keep a couple of points in \nmind.  First, monetary policy decisions are not  driven by individual data releases. Rather, \nthey depend on the implications for the economic outlook of the accumulation of data over time.  Second, monetary policy influences  inflation only with fairly long lags.  \nGenerally speaking, a change in the federal funds rate today ma y take an estimated 12 to \n18 months to affect inflation measures.  As  a consequence, monetary policy must be \nforward-looking in design. \nThe existence of lags in monetary policy has two impor tant implications.  First, \nthe Federal Reserve should only respond to hi gh current inflation to the extent that \ninflation is expected to be ve ry persistent.  Indeed, to the extent inflation pressures are \nseen as temporary and policy is currently restrictive, maintaining the current policy \nstance may be consistent with a reduction in inflation over time.  Of course, the other \naspect of this is that if inflation pressu res remain elevated, then they will affect \ninflationary expectations requiring more forceful action later.   \nSecond,  given the existence of policy lags , the actions that the Federal Reserve \ntook over the past year in moving the federal funds rate target from 3 ¼ % in June 2005 \nto 5 ¼ % last month have not yet had their full effects on the economy or inflation.  This is one reason why most forecas ters predict lower growth and inflation in the future even \nwhile current growth and in flation are quite strong. \nBased on this discussion, I believe a reasona ble case can be made that the current \nstance of monetary policy is likel y to be consistent with a reduction in inflation pressures \nover the next few quarters as energy costs mode rate and economic growth slows.  At the \nsame time, I recognize that further policy tightening could be warranted should the \n\n 9\nexpected slowing in inflation not materia lize.  As economic data accumulate over the \nnext few months, hopefully some of the curren t economic uncertainty will dissipate, and \nwe will have a clearer view of the path of monetary policy going forward.  Concluding Comments\n \n To conclude my remarks, today, I woul d like to briefly summarize my views on \nthe economic outlook and monetary policy.  My reading of the incoming data and \neconomic forecasts is that the U.S. econo my is beginning a gradual transition to a \nsomewhat slower path of economic growth.  At the same time, inflation pressures have \nrisen to the point that they cannot be easily dismissed.  In this environment, the future \ncourse of monetary policy is uncertain a nd will depend, to a large extent on how the \neconomy evolves in coming months.  In this regard, I can assure you that the Federal \nReserve will continue to maintain its commit ment to price stability and economic growth.",

            "content": "MONETARY POLICY AND THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThomas M. Hoenig \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNew Mexico Economic Forums \nAlbuquerque, New Mexico \nOctober 3, 2006 \n\n 2\n It is a pleasure to be in  Albuquerque tonight and to have  this opportunity to share \nmy views on the economic outlook and m onetary policy.  Although our economy has \nperformed well over the last few years, so me observers are uneasy about the current \nsituation.  Economic growth is slowing from  the brisk pace earlier in the year, and \ninflation has been higher than desired as pa st increases in energy and other materials \nprices raised production costs and strained consumer budgets. \n Much of the recent concern has been driv en by two issues.  One of these is the \nrisk of a larger than antici pated decline in the housing market.  Although economists have \nbeen predicting a slowing in the housing market  for some time, definitive signs of this \nslowing only appeared in the last few months.  The extent of this slowing and its impact \non future consumer spending is naturally a concern because the family home is the \nprimary asset for many households. \nThe other issue is uncertainty about the di rection of energy prices.  Over the past \nthree years, sharp increases in petroleum prices have pressured household budgets and \nraised the inflation rate.  But, recently, we  have seen gasoline prices declining and \npetroleum inventories building, creating uncertainty about future energy price \nmovements. \n In tonight’s remarks, I would first like to provide a br ief assessment of current \neconomic conditions and the outlook through 2007.  Then I will spend some time \ndiscussing the issues related to the hous ing and energy markets and how these might \ninfluence the outlook.  Finally, I will speak br iefly about some of the challenges facing \nmonetary policy in the period ahead.  I w ould emphasize that these views are my own \n\n 3\nand do not represent the official position of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal \nOpen Market Committee. \nCurrent Economic Conditions  \n Let me begin by taking a closer look at  recent economic performance.  Real GDP \ngrew at a brisk pace in the firs t half of this year.  Although growth slowed from the first \nquarter to the second, real outpu t expanded at a 4 percent rate  over the first half of 2006, \nwell above the economy’s long-run sustainable rate.  Part of this surge in economic \nactivity was, however, a re bound from economic weakness in  the second half of 2005 \nrelated to the Gulf hurricanes , higher energy costs, and re duced auto sales incentives. \n Most forecasters believe that growth slowed further in the third quarter because of another decline in residentia l investment and more moderate business investment in \nstructures and inventories.  Housing starts and sales declin ed over the last few months, \nthe inventory of unsold homes on the market is rising, and home pr ice appreciation is \ndecelerating.  However, consumer spending a ppears to be growing moderately despite the \npressure on household budgets from  past energy price gains.  \n Although the labor market remains healthy, the pace of hiring slowed in the spring.  Nonfarm payroll employment grew at  an average pace of 176,000 jobs per month \nin the first quarter of this year, but on ly by about 119,000 jobs per month over the next \nfive months.  While hiring has slowed, the unemployment rate was quite low in August at \n4.7 percent of the labor force.  This unemp loyment rate is below the level that many \neconomists believe is consistent with full employment and stable prices. \n The inflation rate has been a major concer n so far in 2006.  Past sharp increases in \nenergy prices caused broad inflation measures to  rise over the last few years.  Reflecting \n\n 4\nhigh resource utilization and some pass-thr ough of higher energy pri ces, core inflation \nmeasures, which exclude volatile food and energy prices, also worsened earlier this year.  \nFor example, the core CPI inflation rate rose from about 2.2 percent in 2005 to 2.8 percent over the year ending in August.  This is a pace of inflation that I would not find \nacceptable over the longer term.  However, it is encouraging that core CPI inflation \nmoderated somewhat in July and August, and core producer price infl ation eased as well. \nThe Economic Outlook  \n Although policymakers carefully monitor cu rrent conditions, our focus is on what \nthe indicators imply for the economic outlook.  Monetary policy must be forward-looking \nbecause policy actions affect growth and infl ation with long lags.  With that in mind, let \nme turn to the outlook for real economic growth and inflation. \n Reflecting past increases in energy prices  and interest rates, many forecasters now \nanticipate somewhat below-trend real GDP growth over the second half of this year and \nfor most of 2007.  Many economists believe th e potential growth rate for the U.S. \neconomy is around 3 to 3 ¼ percent. \nI share the view that real growth is likel y to be slightly below the potential growth \nrate, averaging around 2 to 2 ½ percent at an annual rate over the second half of this year \nand around 2 ½ to 3 percent in 2007.   But I would stress that the economy is likely to \nkeep expanding, and that growth that is a lit tle below trend in the near term may help to \nkeep the economy from overheating and thus  sustain growth over the longer term. \n An important factor in this outlook ha s been the gradual tig htening of monetary \npolicy.  Since June 2004, the Federal Reserve has raised its federal funds  rate target from \n1 percent to the current level of  5 ¼ percent.  Over this pe riod, the stance of monetary \n\n 5\npolicy has moved from being extremely accommoda tive to a setting that I would describe \nas somewhat restrictive.  Other interest rates have also incr eased over this period, \nalthough the rise in long-term ra tes has been fairly moderate. \n  Much of the slowing in economic gr owth will likely come from housing and \nconsumer spending.  To some degree, higher interest rates have produced this slowing \nbecause housing and consumer durables spending are interest-sensitive sectors.  In \naddition, past increases in oil prices hurt c onsumer confidence and left many households \nwith less income to spend on di scretionary items.  Moreover, sharp gains in home prices \nhave reduced the affordability of new homes for first-time buyers. \n Offsetting some of the weakness in c onsumer spending and housing will probably \nbe healthy business investment and solid e xport growth.  With regard to business \ninvestment, equipment spending was weaker th an expected in the second quarter, but \nnonresidential construction poste d large gains, partly due to  increased spending on energy \nproduction.  Orders for capital equipment con tinue to trend upward, and operating rates \nare above-average in the manu facturing sector.  Moreover, strong growth in corporate \nprofits should help to sustain business investment spending.   \n In addition, export growth will likely be  a positive for economic growth through \n2007.  Although the latest monthly trade de ficit was disappointing, much of the \ndeterioration was due to high oil imports.  Going forward, solid growth by our major \ntrading partners should increase the de mand for U.S. goods and services.  The \nInternational Monetary Fund, for example, ju st raised its forecast for world economic \ngrowth in 2006 and 2007.  At the same time, the expected slower growth in domestic household spending should moderate import grow th.  As a result, I expect international \n\n 6\ntrade to be less of a drag on growth over the next year or so, and possibly even a modest \ncontributor to growth. \n With real GDP growth slowing below th e trend rate, labor market pressures are \nlikely to ease somewhat.  Although I do not e xpect large changes in the unemployment \nrate, we could see the unemployment rate drift upward by late next year to 5 percent, or \nperhaps slightly higher. \n As to the inflation outlook, most for ecasters expect some moderation in the \ninflation rate over the next year or so.  Sl ower economic growth and reduced energy price \npressures are expected to gradually reduce bot h the overall and core inflation rates.  I \nshare the view that core consumer price infl ation is likely to moderate from the elevated \npace in the first half of this year, and I am pleased that long-term inflation expectations \nwere reasonably well contained during the past run-ups in oil prices.    \nA Closer Look at Housing and Energy  \n As always, there are many uncertainties about the economic outlook.  I want to \nhighlight two issues in particular because th ese issues are foremost in the minds of many \neconomists as well as American households.  Thes e are, first, the risk of a sharper than \nexpected decline in residen tial investment and, second, un certainty about the future \ndirection of energy prices. \nWith respect to housing, some observers have warned for a long time that the \nhousing market was becoming overheated.  Over the past several year s, there has been a \nrapid increase in the value of U.S. housing fueled by low mortgage rates.  This has \nincreased household wealth and contributed to strong growth in household consumption \nduring the current economic expansion.  If housing prices have risen above levels \n\n 7\ndictated by economic fundamentals, there is  a chance that housing prices could fall, \nhurting consumption as well as  residential investment. \nMy own view is that the housing market is  cooling, but this adjustment seems to \nbe happening in an orderly way.  Of course , orderly does not necessa rily mean painless, \nbut there appears to be enough strength in other sectors to keep  real GDP growing.  \nPolicymakers, however, must remain aware of  the risk that the housing market might \nsoften more than is built in to current economic forecasts. \nEvidence of a cooling housing market is abundant.  Single-family housing starts \nfell more than 20 percent over the last year .  Existing home sales and new home sales \nhave also declined this year , and the number of unsold hom es on the market has risen.  \nHome price appreciation as measured by th e OFHEO index has slowed sharply from over \na 13 percent annual rate last year to less than a 5 percen t annual rate in the second \nquarter. \nThe slowing housing market has both direct  and indirect economic effects.  Less \nhome construction means fewer jobs for construction workers and fewer building \nmaterials purchased, and a lower rate of ho me sales decreases brokerage commissions.  \nBut the reduced appreciation of homes also may have important indirect effects by \nlowering the growth rate of household wealth and the ability of households to easily tap \ninto past wealth gains.  Many homeowners have  used their home equity to finance strong \nconsumption growth through mortgage re financing or home equity loans.  \nThere is a risk of a sharper than predic ted slowdown in residential investment and \nfalling home prices, which cannot be dismi ssed entirely.  Policymakers will need to \n\n 8\nmonitor the situation carefull y, both in terms of the state of the housing market and its \nbroader economic effects. \nBut at the national level, we have not seen prolonged declines in nominal home \nprices when the housing market slowed in the past.  Moreover, continued income and \nemployment growth and high levels of stock ma rket wealth will help to sustain consumer \nspending.  As a result, I believe the housing market adjustment is unlikely to derail the \neconomic expansion. \nLet me turn to a second issue that is ve ry much on people’s minds right now—the \nfuture direction of energy prices.  The outl ook for energy prices appears to have shifted \nsomewhat. \nWe have been through a difficult period in which energy prices soared because of \nstrong world demand and unexpected disruptions  to energy supplies.  As a result, we \nhave become accustomed to nothing but bad ne ws on the energy front, and risk premiums \nwere built into energy prices to reflect possible supply disruptions.  But the forces \naffecting the energy market appear to have become more balanced. \n Oil and natural gas prices are extremely volatile by nature.  Small changes in the \nquantity of oil supplied may require large pr ice changes to balan ce the market because \ndemand is relatively insensitive to price change s in the short run.  Shocks to the energy \nmarket can come suddenly—as we saw with th e hurricanes last year —and there is little \nexcess production capacity in the world ri ght now with which to meet unexpected \ndevelopments.  Thus, the risk of a shar p upward movement in oil prices has not \ndisappeared. \n\n 9\n But although markets have focused on rising energy prices for several years, we \nnow must seriously consider the possibility  of further decreases in energy prices.  \nSupplies of petroleum products and natural gas are building, and we have seen some \nlarge declines in the prices of  gasoline prices, crude oil, and natural gas.  For example, \nthe price of a gallon of regular gasoline is more than 20 percent below levels in July.  \nNatural gas prices have also plummeted because inventories ar e at record highs for this \ntime of the year.  These recent declines in energy prices may help to moderate future inflationary pressures and free up some disc retionary income for many households and \nperhaps also cushion the effects of weaker housing. \nChallenges for Monetary Policy  \n Finally let me turn to the challenges f acing monetary policy in the period ahead.  \nIn doing so, I am not in a position to speculate about the future course of policy.  Instead, \nI hope to convey some of my thinking about  the factors that will shape the FOMC’s \ndecisions in the period ahead. \n We must always remember that mone tary policy decisions are not based on \nindividual data releases.  Rather, policy decisions depend on the implications for the economic outlook of the accumulation of data over time.  Monetary policy must be forward-looking because policy influences infl ation with long lags.  Generally speaking, \na change in the federal funds rate may take an estimated 12 to 18 months to affect inflation measures. \n The existence of lags in monetary policy has two impor tant implications.  First, \nthe Federal Reserve should only respond to high current inflation to the extent that it is \nexpected to be highly persiste nt.  If inflation pressures ar e seen to be temporary and \n\n 10\npolicy is currently restrictive, maintaining the current policy stance may be consistent \nwith a reduction in inflati on over time.  Second, given the existence of po licy lags, the \nactions that the Federal Reserve took over the pa st year in raising the federal funds rate \nhave not yet had their full eff ects on the economy or inflation. \n As I have stated previously, I believe a reasonable case can be made that the \ncurrent stance of monetary polic y is likely to be consistent with a reduction in inflation \npressures over the next few quarters as en ergy prices moderate and economic growth \nslows.  If housing were to weaken more than in the consensus outl ook or if energy prices \ndropped further, the case for maintaining the current policy stance might be reinforced. \n But at the same time, I recognize that  further policy tightening could be \nwarranted if the expected slowing in infl ation does not materia lize or if long-term \ninflation expectations should rise suddenly.  As economic data accumulate over the next few months, I suspect some of the current economic uncertainty will dissipate, and we \nwill have a clearer view of the m onetary policy path going forward.  \nConcluding Comments  \n In summary, although some observers are uneasy about the current economic \nsituation, my reading of the incoming data a nd economic forecasts is that the economy is \nmaking the transition to a somewhat slower grow th path.  At the same time, inflationary \npressures may moderate if growth does slow to a below-trend pace and upward pressures \non energy prices abate. \nTwo important issues that bear close wa tching are the risk of a sharper than \npredicted slowing in the housing market and uncertainty about the future direction of \n\n 11\nenergy prices.  The forces affecting the en ergy market have become more balanced, \nhowever, with both price increase s and decreases being possible. \nThe current somewhat restri ctive stance of monetary pol icy may be sufficient to \nreduce core inflation over the ne xt few quarters.  But the course of monetary policy is not \nentirely certain and will depend on how the economy evolves in the coming months.  In \nthis regard, I can assure you that the Federal Reserve will  continue to maintain its \ncommitment to price stability and economic growth.",

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFinancial Stability Institute/Bank for International Settlements  \nAsia-Pacific High -Level Meeting  \nManila, Philippines  \nFebruary 10, 2015  \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits gov ernors, officers or representatives.  \n \n\n \n1 \n Today’s program focuses on various aspects of reforms since the global financial crisis \nthat aim to address the risks posed to financial and economic stability.  Central banks have long \nrecognized that financial stabili ty considerations play a key role in achieving monetary policy \nobjectives.  Yet, there remains considerable debate about the role that monetary policy itself \ncontributes to financial stability and what steps a central bank should take with its policy regime .  \nIn my remarks today, I will review considerations on the interaction between financial \nstability and mone tary policy , as well as the post -crisis enthusiasm for the use of \nmacroprudential regulatory approaches  in addition to supervision of individual banking firms . I \nwill conclude with my own views on the role of monetary policy in assuring economic objectives \nare achieved in the context of financial stability.  \n \nThe relationship between monetary policy and financial s tability  \nPrior to the recent global financial crisis, a common view held that monetary policy \nshould not lean against apparent financial market imbalances —except to the extent they affected \nthe ou tlook for growth and inflation —but, instead , clean up after a bubble bursts . This line of \nthinking rested on t hree assumptions .  \nThe first is that spotting asset price bubbles or financial imbalances in real -time is \nnotoriously difficult —something that is just as true today as in the past. Knowing a t what point \nand how aggressively to intervene using monetary policy also poses a number of practical \nchallenges. A second assumption  is that monetary policy can be effective at limiting the damage \nto the broader economy after the bursting of an asset -price bubble . The pre -crisis consensus \nviewed  a collapse of asset prices as having the potential to inflict  sustained damage to the \nbroader economy, but also held that monetary policy could mitigate the fallout.  A third \n\n \n2 \n assumption  supporting the pre -crisis  consensus  is what  I will call “the separation principle,” in \nwhich regulators concern themselves with oversight of the financial sector  while monetary \npolicy makers  focus on macroeconomic objectives, such as inflation and , in some cases, \nemployment.  The goal of price stability was seen as largely complementary with that of financial \nstability, given a well -designed regulatory structure that monitored the risk exposure s of the \nfinancial sector.    \nGiven these assumptions, b roader discussions on the role of central banks in fostering \nfinancial stability were rare.  The bursting of the dot -com bubble of the 1990s , followed by the \nrelatively mild recession in 2001 only reinforced these views.  After many years of financial \nmarket stability  in advanced economies , policymakers seemed to have reason to view monetary \npolicy as appropriately focused on macroeconomic objectives —that is, until the onset of the \nglobal financial crisis that began in 2007 . \nThe collapse of the housing market in the United States a nd the global economic events  \nthat followed have posed fundamental challenge s to the thinking about the role of monetary \npolicy in maintain ing financial stability. And w ithout doubt, financial instability inflicted \ndamage that pulled many central banks far from their objectives  for a prolonged period . \n \nA macropr udential approach  \nToday , central banks are digesting a growing body of research on the appropriate roles  of \nmonetary and regulatory  policy  in fostering financial stability . The influence  of this research  on \nactual monetary policy decis ions has been only modest , although financial  stability concerns are \nbecoming more frequently discussed in the context of monetary policy. For example, the Federal \nReserve has adopted a Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy , which \n\n \n3 \n convey s to the public the objectives of monetary policy. The statement says  that “risks to the \nfinancial system” that threaten to impede attainment of the Committee’ s longer -run goals may \nwarrant a monetary poli cy response. No adjustment to policy has yet been made due to risks \nfrom the financial sector.  \nHowever, s ome countries over the past few years have raised financial stability concerns \nto a level sufficient to warrant a policy response. In most  cases, monetary policy was not altered. \nInstead, macroprudential tools were deployed to address overheating property markets or rising \nhousehold indebtedness.  Monetary policy has largely remained focused on inflation and \nemployment , leaving financial stability to  regulators and their macroprudential approaches ; in \nother words , the separation principle remains largely intact.  \nIn fact, the deployment of macroprudential tools  may be perceived as further removing \nthe need for monetary policy to be concerned with financial stability . For example, \ncountercyclical capital policy can be used to reduce the banking sector’s leverage and expand its \nloss-absorbing capacity  during an ex pansion. Calibrating t he appropriate timing and degree for \nusing this tool , however, poses  some  practical challenges  that are similar to those associated with \nmonetary policy . The Federal Reserve plans to  use a framework incorporating countercyclical  \ncapital adjustments , though details, such as when and by how much to releas e the buffer , will \nneed to be more fully developed.  \nIn addition to countercyclical capital, policymakers and regulators  have embraced \nmacroprudential approaches to liquidity requir ements . These steps are designed to guard against \nexcess ive maturity transformation , which in the past has led to asset fire sales and large swings \nin asset valuations.  With the new rules, banks must hold a minimum amount of highly liquid \n\n \n4 \n assets  under stre ssed conditions to ensure adequate funding and prevent fire sale losses and \nrelated externalities.    \nTo evaluate whether the capital and liquidity  positions of individual institutions aggregate \nto a stable banking system, s tress-testing has been used . In the United States, s tress-testing has \nlong been a microprudential tool aimed at ensuring the safety and soundness of individual \ninstitutions  and understanding , for example,  a bank’s interest rate risk exposure.  Since the crisis, \nit has also become an impor tant macroprudential tool that provides a  horizontal view of \nsystemically  important firms and their vulnerabilities to a wide variety of shocks to economic \nand financial conditions.  While stress -testing has proven to be a valuable tool, the results can be \nquite sensitive to a number of factors , such as model specifications and estimation periods.  For \nthese reasons, regulators should be cautious about taking too much reassurance from the tests.   \nRegulators also must remain focused on traditional microprudent ial, or firm -specific,  \nsupervision and regulation.  Sound execution of macroprudential regulation depends on sound \nmicroprudential regulation.  Ensuring that individual banking organizations are operating in a \nsafe and sound manner  is a prerequisite  to their ability to withstand the economic and financial \nshocks that can lead to financial instability.  In the U nited States , perhaps the most notable \nexamples were the declines in residential and commercial mortgage underwriting standards that \nemerged in the  years leading up to the crisis.  For commercial real estate, in particular, growing \nconcentrations led the banking agencies to issue supervisory guidance in 2006.  However, \nhighlighting such issues is of little value unless it is timely and accompanied by t argeted actions  \nto limit the risk exposure . From this standpoint, I see extremely strong complements between \nmicro - and macroprudential regulation.  \n \n\n \n5 \n Financial stability and monetary policy i nteractions  \nJust a s micro - and macroprudential polic ies play central role s in safeguarding financial \nstability, so does  monetary policy . I often hear t he view  that macroprudential policy should be \nthe “first line of defense” for maintaining financial st ability . Unfortunately , this approach  expect s \ntoo much of tools for which our understanding is imperfect . In addition,  a growing body of \nresearch shows monetary policy plays a key role in affecting risk appetite and risk premiums . \nAsking regulators to ensure  risk-taking is not endangering  financial stability places a large \nburden on our regulatory infrastructure , especially in an environment of highly accommodative \nmonetary policy . \n Indeed, central banks have used zero interest rates and large -scale asset purchases or \nquantitative easing as a type of monetary easing  that would affect  risk-taking , asset valuations \nand economic growth. While accommodative monetary policy can affect  economic activity via \nthis channel, it can also create financial market vulnerabilities , especially if  sustained  for a \nprolonged period. If financial imbalances in one sector turn out to have systemic consequences, \nthen a reliance on the risk-taking channel of monetary policy to stimulate economic activity \ncould prove more detrimental than beneficial over the longer run  for achieving stable inflation \nand employment .  \nIn particular, a  monetary policy that f ails to take into account building systemic or tail \nrisks exposes the economy to potential large setbacks in the future. Investors fluctuate between \nbeing more or less conc erned about  these  unlikely —but severe —economic  outcomes. These \nconcerns are often incorporated  in risk premiums , which  reflect investor concerns about the \ndegree and likelihood of severe events . For example,  a rise in risk premiums can indicate a \nrecession may be on the horizon, even when macro economic data may be providing no such \n\n \n6 \n signal.  Alternatively, u nusually low risk premiums, such as were experienced in 2003 -2005, \nreflected investors who were underestimating the severity and likelihood of a downturn in the \nhousing market.  \nResearch points to the effect monetary policy has on several aspec ts of risk -taking. For \nexample, after t aking into account economic conditions, low policy rates are correlated with \noverall easier financial conditions, as we see banks increase the share of risky assets they hold,  \ncredit quality  decline , risk premium s on syndicated  loans  fall, lending standards  soften , and \nfinancial institutions move towards shorter -term funding and higher  leverage.1 Many of these \nfactors manifest themselves in elevated asset valuations and rising credit growth. Once asset \nvalues or credit growth has risen to a level warranting concern, it is likely too late for monetary \npolicy to smoothly  unwind these imbalanc es without  triggering a sharp reversal that ultimately  \ninflict s damage on the real economy.  \nA focus on risk-taking and risk premiums in the context of monetary policy leads to two \nquestions. The first is whether risk premiums are useful for predicting economic activity. \nResearch from  the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  suggests they are, but they offer more \nof a signal about  the future when they are rising than when they are falling.2 That is, rising risk \npremiums signal poor economic performance in  the future, while declining risk premiums are not \nnecessarily a good indicator  of strong economic performance. Low risk premiums, however, may \nsow the seeds for future financial instability. The second question is whether monetary policy \ncan affect risk p remiums. This same line of r esearch also suggests monetary policy  does alter \nrisk premiums. As policy eases, risk premiums have a tendency to decline , suggest ing that \n                                                           \n1 See, for example, Rajan (2005); Jimenez et al (2012);  Santos (2012) ; Maddaloni and Peydo (2011) ; Stein (2012, \n2013); Adrian and Shin (2010);  Adrian, Moench and Shin (2009). Adrian and Laing (2014) provide a \ncomprehensive overview.  \n2 See Cao, Doh and Molling, “Should Monetary Policy Look at Risk Premiums in Financial Market s?” forthcoming \nin the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s Economic Review .  \n\n \n7 \n attempt s to lower  already low risk premiums will likely do little in te rms of future econ omic \nactivity  but may foster conditions that pose risks to  financial stability.  \nThis line of thinking suggests to me that modestly tighter policy earlier in the business \ncycle expansion could moderate risk -taking and the potential for destabilizing financial \nimbalances to build.  In reviewing financial stability reports for several countries prior to the \nglobal financial crisis, my staff found some countries effectively identified a number of  risks  that \nplayed  important roles in the crisis but underes timated their severity .3 Identifying “excess” risk -\ntaking always carries challenges, particularly in finding the right benc hmark with which to assess \nrisk-taking. Still, a number of these reports highlighted risks,  but late in the business cycle when \nthere was little monetary policy could do except wait to clean up. In addition,  using monetary \npolicy to prick bubbles  after they have developed , to slow elevated levels of credit growth, or to \nencourage firms to scale back on high levels of leverage are likely to end poorly.  \nThe bottom line is that it is difficult  to address stability concerns in particular sectors \nafter they have developed. Instead, it may be appropriate to adjust policy to address suppressed \nrisk premiums early in the expansion  rather than late. Once valuation pressures emerge, or \nunderwriting standards have been stretched, then it is often too late.  As a result, interest rate \npolicy used earlier in the cycle can foster a more stable financial land scape as a business cycle \nmatures.  \n \n \n \nRevisiting the pre -crisis c onsensus  \n                                                           \n3 Christensson, Spong, and Wilkenson, “Financial Stability Reports: How Useful During a Financial Crisis?” \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s Economic Review , 2010.  \n\n \n8 \n  The lessons of the financial crisis are many and warrant careful assessment of \nassumptions that have guide d the thinking about the proper relationship between monetary policy \nand financial stability. It remains true that w e can’t identify bubbles in real time, or at least don’t \nknow the proper time and manner to intervene to stem their rise. Following the collapse o f a \nbubble, monetary policy can be judiciously used to limit the damage inflict ed on the real \neconomy. However, monetary policy runs the risk of  remaining overly accommodative  following \na downturn , and lead to  future  instability . Importantly, policymakers should reassess the \nassumption that monetary policy and macroprudential regimes can be used independently.  This \n“separation principle” remains widely accepted  and continues to argue that macroprudential tools  \noffer the “first line of defense” against risks  to financial stability .  \nOur recent experience, combined with empirical evidence , suggests this view should be \nchallenged.  A comprehensive approach that views m onetary  and macroprudential policy as a \ncomplements, reinforced by sound microprudential underp innings , is the best approach to \nachiev e a stable financial system and the long -run objectives of central banks for sustainable \neconomic growth .",

George  \nPresident  and Chief  Executive  Officer  \nFederal  Reserve  Bank  of Kansas  City \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJuly 9, 2015  \nOklahoma  Economic  Forum  \nStillwater,  Oklahoma  \nThe views  expressed  by the author  are her own and do not necessarily  reflect  those  of the Federal  Reserve  System,  \nits governors,  officers  or representatives.   \n\n1 \n Seven  years  ago, our economy  was dealt  a tremendous  blow.  The financial  crisis  and \ndeep  recession  required  massive  bailouts  and aggress ive, unconventional  monetary  policy  \nactions  to restore  financial  stability  and economic  growth.  And yet, seven  years  later,  uncertainty  \nlingers  about  the durability  and strength  of financial  reforms  and of the economy  itself.  Clearly , \nthe financial  crisis  of 2008  cast a long shadow.  \nIn my remarks  today,  I will offer  my own observations  about  the current  state of the \neconomy  and why I believe  the Federal  Reserve  should  start the process  of interest  rate \nnormalization  sooner  rather  than later.  I’ll close  with some  perspectives  on the state of key \nregulatory  reforms  affecting  the banking  industry  and, in particular , the nation’s community  \nbanks.   \nThese  are my own views  and not those  of the Federal  Open  Market  Committee  or the \nFederal  Reserve  System.  \n \nThe economic  outlook  \nIn 2013,  during  my first voting  rotation  on the Federal  Open  Market  Committee,  I did not \nsupport  additional  stimulus  in the form  of a third  round  of asset  purchases.  By then,  the \nimmediate  crisis  had passed,  the economy  was slowly  expandin g for its third  consecutive  year,  \nand monetary  policy  settings  remained  extraordinarily  accommodative.  At the end of my voting  \ncycle,  I fully  anticipated  that a return  to more -normal  interest  rates  would  require  a lengthy  and \ngradual  adjustment  process.  But, I did not imagine  that in 2015  we might  still have  the same  \npolicy  stance.  \nDuring  the past five years,  the U.S. economy  has grown  at a moderate  pace each year,  \nlabor  markets  have  healed—albeit  with scars  from  the recession—and inflation  has remained  \n\n2 \n low. This year,  the economy  had a slower -than-expected  start.  The soft GDP  report  for the first \nquarter  reflected  some  temporar y factors  that held down  growth  but are unlikely  to persist  going  \nforward.  Looking  ahead,  I expect  the economy  to resume  its expa nsion  at an above -trend  growth  \nrate through  the end of the year and labor  market  conditions  to continue  improving.   \nConsumer  spending,  the largest  part of our economy,  will likely  grow  at a healthy  rate in \nthe quarters  ahead  due to an improving  labor  marke t, rising  wealth  and lower  gasoline  prices  \nrelative  to where  they were  last year.  Moreover,  as the economy  continues  to heal and domestic  \ndemand  continues  to strengthen,  businesses  should  have  more  incentives  to increase  capital  \nexpenditures.  I also expect  housing  construction  to provide  a tailwind  to growth  as more  adults  \npack  up and move  out of their parents’ home  or away  from  living  with roommates  to start their \nown households.  Construction  of multi family  units,  in particular,  has been  strong  due to rising  \ndemand  from  younger  workers  and the decisions  of some  baby  boomers  to downsize .  \nIn terms  of the labor  market,  the economy  added  3 million  jobs over the past year. For \nperspective,  consider  that the economy  did not even  add this many  new jobs over a one-year \nperiod  at any point  during  the housing  bubble  years.  You would  need  to go back  to the late 1990s  \ntech-bubble  era to find a period  when  jobs were  being  added  at a similar  pace.  In addition  to the \nnumber  of jobs,  we are seeing  better  jobs.  For example,  work ers today  are flowing  into more -\nstable  employment  relationships , and workers  with a high-school  diploma  or some  college  are \nfinding  employment  in higher -skilled  occupations,  something  that was not occurring  in the years  \nfollowing  the crisis.1 \nTaken  together,  the economic  data generally  point  to an economy  that is moving  in the \nright  direction  and has consistently  sustained  growth  over the past five years.  This is not to say \n                                                 \n1 See “Opportunity  Knocks:  Improved  Matching  of Jobs and Workers” by Didem  Tuzemen  and Jonathan  Willis.  The \nMacro  Bulletin , Federal  Reserve  Bank  of Kansas  City,  May 13, 2015.  \n\n3 \n the economy  is issue -free. There  are pockets  of the labor  market  that continue  to struggle.  \nResearch  shows  that workers  who enter  the labor  force  during  the lean years  of a recession  and \nrecovery  experience  long-lasting  scarring  effects  on their earning  potential.2 Millions  of workers  \nhad difficulty  finding  employment  and missed  some  experience  needed  to jump -start their \ncareers,  resulting  in fewer  skills,  underdeveloped  resumes  and lower  earnings.  In addition,  \nproductivity  growth,  which  ultimately  drives  living  standards  higher,  has been  notably  soft in \nrecent  years.  And, global  economic  concerns  can pose unpredictable  risks  to our economy.  \nUnfortunately,  although  we might  wish  it so, monetary  policy  is not the proper  tool to \naddress  all of these  issues.  The aggressive  monetary  actions  over the past few years  were  \nintended  to support  economic  activity,  help labor  markets  heal and move  inflation  toward  the \nFed’s target.  I view  the considerable  progress  in labor  markets  and the relatively  steady inflation  \nrate as encouraging.  However,  keeping  interest  rates  near zero to achieve  still further  progress  \ntoward  labor  market  improvement  and higher  inflation  is risky  in my view.   \nIn a protracted  period  of exceptionally  low rates,  investors  seeking  out higher  returns  are \nwilling  to take on more  risk or seek out more  creative  financing  approaches.  When  the economy  \nis expanding  and rates  remain  low, adverse  events  may appear  less likely  or far into the future,  \npotentially  resulting  in the mispricing  of risk and financial  assets.  Waiting  too long to adjust  \nrates,  as we’ve seen in the past, can leave  policymakers  with few and possibly  poor options .  \n \nSeparating  the signal  from  the noise  \nThe FOMC  has been  talking  about  its exit strategy  since  2011.  And since  March  of this \nyear,  the Committee  has been  emphasizing  that a decision  to raise  interest  rates  would  be data \n                                                 \n2 See “Long -Term  Nonemployment  and Job Displacement ” by Jae Song  and Till von Wachter,  presented  at the \nFederal  Reserve  Bank  of Kansas  City’s  2014  Jackson  Hole  Economic  Policy  Symposium.  \n\n4 \n dependent.  In other  words,  economic  data that confirms  further  gains  in the economy’s \nperformance  will drive  the timing  of the Committee ’s action s.  \nSo, why hasn’t the FOMC  yet raised  rates?  There  are of course  different  views  on the \neconom ic data we receive  and analyze  that lead to legitimate,  differing  views  about  what  is best \nfor the economy.  The Federal  Reserve  is charged  with objectives  that take into account  \nemployment  and inflation  in order  to foster  stable  long-term growth  in the economy.  The FOMC  \nis committed  to pursuing  those  objectives , but policymakers  may differ  on the appropriate  path \nto achiev e these long-run goals.  \nOf course,  the economic  data we rely on can, and often  does in the short  run, send \nconflicting  signals,  and it is quite  challenging  to measure  economic  activity  in an $18 trillion,  \ndynamic  economy.  As a result, policymakers  are faced  with an unclear  path for moving  interest  \nrates.  Those  choices  are all the more  difficult  as we must  rely on backward -looking  data to frame  \na forecast  that takes  into account  the long lags of interest  rate changes.   \nUnder  such circumstances , the Federal Reserve  must  be especially  careful  to avoid  \nreacting  to the last data point  to determine  policy.  Instead,  it should  focus  on longer -run trends  as \nit seeks  to understand  the economy’ s future  course  and to map the best policy  to assure  it \nremains  on course.  The real challenge  when  the data disappoints  is discerning  whether  it is due \nto temporary  factors  or an early  signal  that underlying  momentum  in the economy  is changing.   \nTake  the first quarter  of this year as an example.  The current  estimate  is that the economy  \ncontracted  in the first quarter  after three  quarters  of relatively  strong  growth.  While  this headline  \nnumber  raises  caution  for policymakers,  other  factors,  as I mentioned  earlier,  suggest  the slowing  \nis likely  to be temporary.  Severe  winter  weather  and labor  negotiations  concerning  dock  workers  \nlikely  took a short -lived  toll on growth.  At the same  time,  however,  the economy  added  nearly  \n\n5 \n 600,000  new jobs in the first three  months  of this year.  So even  though  the economy  appeared  to \nslow  a bit in the first quarter,  businesses  kept hiring , and the data for the second  quarter  suggest  \nthe economy  is again  expanding.  Thus,  in the face of consistent  positive  trends,  delaying  actions  \nfor more  positive  data can be unwise.   \nConside r as another  example  measures  of inflation , which  have  been  running  below  the \nFed’s  stated  inflation  goal. Since  2012,  the Federal  Reserve  has defined  2 percent  inflation  as \n“most  consistent  over the longer  run with the Federal  Reserve’s statutory  mandate”  of price  \nstability.  Does  inflation  below  2 percent  justif y waiting  longer  to raise  rates?  The answer  \nrequires  a deeper  look at the data.  Much  of the decline  in inflation  comes  from  a dramatic  fall in \nenergy  prices  throughout  the second  half of 2014  and low import  prices  from  a strong  dollar.  The \nswings  in energy  and food prices  certainly  matter  for households  and are an important  \ncomponent  of the inflation  measure,  but sometimes  it’s also sensible  to look at price  changes  that \nexclude  these  volatile  goods.  Along  these  lines,  the core measure  of inflation  is running  at 1.2 \npercent  over the past year and has moved  up to a 1.7 percent  pace over the past three  months . \nThis data suggest  to me that we understand  why inflation  has been  low, and as some  temporary  \nfactors  fade,  it will likely  move  back  toward  the Fed’s  goal.  \nPart of our job is to look through  the noise  and act in the economy’s long-run best \ninterest.  Separating  the signal  from  the noise  is always  difficult  and is usually  clear  only with \nhindsight.  Because  monetary  policy  decisions  are made  in real time,  waiting  for more  data before  \ntaking  an action  can be a trap. More  data is always  on its way,  and waiting  for clarity  too often  \ncause s decisions  to be persistently  postponed.  \n \n \n\n6 \n Timing  is everything  \nThe continued  improvement  in the labor  market , combined  with low and stable  inflation , \nconvince  me that modestly  higher  short -term interest  rates  are appropriate.  Current  guideposts,  or \n“policy  rules,”  often  used to inform  monetary  policy  decisions  also have been  signaling  that \ninterest  rates  should  be higher.  \nI recognize  that a rate increase,  however,  would  be the first one in nearly  a decade.  So I \nam not suggesting  rates  should  be normalized  quickly  or that policy  should  be tight.  Although  \nthe economy  has improved,  economic  fundamentals  could  well mean  an accommodative  stance  \nof policy  is appropriate  for some  time.  I would  like to avoid  the cost of waiting  for more  \nevidence  and further  postponing  liftoff,  drawing  on a valuable  lesson  from  monetary  policy  \ndecisions  in 2003.   \nAt that time,  the federal  funds  rate was held at a very low level—1 percent—because  \npolicymakers  were  concerned  about  low inflation  and had postponed  initiating  the tightening  \ncycle  in response.  Inflation  excluding  food and energy  in late 2003  was running  at about  1.3 \npercent,  not dissimilar  from  today.  The unemployment  rate was slightly  below  6 percent , again,  \nnot dissimilar  from  today.   \nBy the middle  of 2004,  core inflation  increased  to 2 percent  as the unemployment  rate \ncontinued  to decline.  A gradual  tightening  cycle  began  in June of 2004.  Core  inflation  then \nmoved  persistently  above  2 percent,  and the labor  market  began  to overheat  amid  one of the most  \nhistoric  credit  bubbles  in U.S. history.    \nOf course,  many  would  argue  that we do not face a similar  buildup  of leverage  today  and \nthat the recov ery remains  fragile.  Perhaps  so, and perhaps  this time it's different.  However,  \n\n7 \n economic  trends  and experience  suggest  otherwise.  And we would  be wise to act modestly  but \nact now.   \n  \nProgress  on regulatory  reforms  \n In addition  to the lessons  for monetary  policy,  the recent  crisis  taught  us of the expanding  \nchallenges  following  from  an increasingly  concentrated  and fragile  financial  system.  While  the \nlargest  financial  institutions  are meant  to be engines  of growth,  they also pose outsized  risk to the \neconomy.  With  that in mind,  I take note that this month  marks  the fifth anniver sary of the \nsigning  of the Dodd -Frank  Act, the law that aimed  to remedy  problems  associated  with the 2008  \nfinancial  crisis and, in particular , sought  to end the status  of “too big to fail.” While  regulators  \nhave  worked  diligently  over the past five years  to implement  new rules,  debate  about  the law’s  \nvarious  provisions  continue s.  \nImplementing  rules  focused  on limiting  certain  risky  activities  has proved  difficult.  For \nexample,  the law prohibits  banks  from  conducting  proprietary  trading  and from  investing  in \nhedge  and private  equity  funds.  Regulators  have  struggled  with complexity  in writing  this rule, \nand banks  have  lobbied heavily  against  it. The final rule was not approved  until late 2013  and did \nnot go into effect  until April  of last year. The deadline  for fully  complying  with the rule could  \nextend  into 2017.    \nAnother  provision  aimed  at limiting  risky  activities  has already  been  repealed.  The so- \ncalled  push -out rule was designed  to move  trading  of credit  default,  commodity  and equity  swaps  \nout of federally -insured  depositories  to non-insured  operating  affiliates.  Congress  reversed  this \npart of the law last December , allowing  the nation’s largest  banks  to continue  their swaps  trading  \nwith the benefit  of public  safety  nets.   \n\n8 \n Also  core to the objectives  of the Dodd -Frank  reforms  was preventing  future  government  \nrescues  of big banks.  Last week,  another  round  of resolutio n plans,  referred  to as living  wills,  \nwas submitted  to the regulators.  It remains  open,  if not doubtful,  whether  a credible  resolution  \nprocess  can be codified  so as to eliminate—or even  minimize —the pressure  to rescue  a large  \ninsolvent  bank  with taxpayer  money.   \nOf course  many  point  to the progress  made  in strengthening  capital  levels  of the largest  \nbanks.  Today,  the 10 largest  banks  hold $8 of tangible  equity  for every  $100 of assets , far more  \nthan the $3 held in 2008 . However,  if the full value  of derivatives  is include d in assets,  as \nrequired  under  international  standards,  the ratio of capital -to-assets  is only 5 ½ percent. \nCompared  to more  than 10 percent  held by the nation’s community  banks , further  progress  is \nneeded.    \nFinally,  a large  segment  of the banking  industry  composed  of thousands  of community  \nbanks  faces a regulatory  overlay  intended  for those  engaged  in global  markets  and riskier  \nactivities.  Multiple  bills to provide  relief  from  certain  provisions  of the Dodd -Frank  Act have  \nbeen  proposed.  Most  practical  and promising  is a proposal  by FDIC  Vice  Chairman  Tom  Hoenig  \nthat focuses  on calibrating  regulation  according  to a bank’s activities  and complexity  rather  than \nsize. I hope  it is receiving  serious  consideration  in the interest  of a stronger  and more -stable  \nfinancial  system.  \n \nConclusion  \nThe U.S. economy  and its financial  system  have  made  notable  progress  over the past five \nyears.  Regulatory  reforms  and monetary  policy  have  been  necessary  ingredients  in achieving  this \nprogress.  But it is time to recalibrate  these  measures.   \n\n9 \n Our regulatory  efforts  must  remain  centered  on ending  too big to fail without  \nundermining  the health  and diversity  of the financial  system.  Likewise,  monetary  policy  must  \nstep back  and allow  market  forces  to resume  their critical  role of pricing  risk and allocating  \ncapital  to its best use. Although  an accommodative  stance  of policy  may be needed  for some  \ntime during  this transition,  monetary  policy  cannot  solve  every  economic  challenge  we face.  \nStarting  now to move  rates up slowly  and deliberately  will allow  the economy  to adjust  to a \nmore -normal  and, in my view,  appropriate  stance  of monetary  policy  that will lead to long-term \ngrowth.",

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConcluding Remarks  \n“The Puzzle of Payments Security”  \nInternational Payments Policy Conference  \nKansas City, Mo.  \nJune 26, 2015  \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers or representatives.   \n\n1 \n  \n I want to thank the program presenters and discussants for the insights they’ve brought to \nthis most important and timely issu e of retail payments security. The conference has highl ighted \nencouraging areas of progress , including  technology, information sharing and  collaborative \nefforts  among financ ial institutions , networks, consumers and regulators. It also has served as a \nreminder that sizeable challenges remain . \nThe Federal Reserve has a keen interest in promoting the safety and the security of the \nnation’ s payments system , given its impact on the broader economy and public trust . As both an \noperator and an overseer within the payments system, the Federal Reserve is prepared to \nleverage its central bank roles to bring about critical improvements for payments security . \nAlthou gh the Federal Reserve is relatively unique among c entral banks in terms of its \nretail payments operator role, public authorities around the world have become more active in \nraising concerns about  retail payments security. Some authorities play explicit ro les with public \nmandates, while others rely on leadership to induce volu ntary changes in the industry. In the \nUnited States , the central bank has chosen to serve as a leader for a collaborative approach , \ninvolving a wide range of payments participants  as the path toward improving the system.  \nThis is not a new role  for the Federal Reserve . Since its founding, the public has looked \nto the Federal Reserve to provide leadership on advancing the safety, efficiency and accessibility \nof the nation’s payment system. Congress initially designed the Fed to serve as a payments \nsystem operator through the regional Reserve Banks and as an overseer of the system through its \nsupervision of financial institutions. These roles give  the Fed relevant insights as we work with \nothers to address the security challenges we face today.  \n For its own part as an operator, the Fed must consider and ensure the security of its  own \nclearing and settlement activities , and thi s directly influence s a large segment of U.S. retail \n\n2 \n payments. The Fed’s financial services business also  provides resources to support development \nof payment standards, including those related to security.  And, there are  plans un derway to work \nwith the Fed’s financial  services  customers  to identify demand for enhanced risk -management \nproducts that complement the Federal Reserve’s suite of wire, automated clearinghouse  and \ncheck service offerings.  \nAs a payments system o verseer , the Federal Reserve and other agencies  ensure banks \nprotect their systems from unauthorized access to online banking systems and safeguard sensitive \npersonal or account information.  In the case of retail payment fraud, consumers have been \nprotected from significant losses by r egulations.  \nThese roles h ave informed the central bank and enhanced its credibility where it plays a \nless formal but equally important role —that of leader and  catalyst for change. The improvements \nwe seek for greater  security in the U .S. payments system do not stem from a specific  mandate \nfrom Congress , but rather from an interest in ensuring stability  and confidence in the payments \nsystem .   \nIn this role, t he Federal Reserve seeks to drive improvement in the payments system \nthrough a collaborative approach , which in the past has led to payments innovations that we take \nfor granted today. R outing numbers on paper checks, the development of the ACH , and the \nimplementation of Check 21 are all examples of diverse interests coming together to find a \nsolution to co mmon challenges.  \nIt is in this spirit that we recently established two task forces  to take on today’s \nchallenge s. These groups are comprised of diverse and committed membership, which will \nensure a broad range of perspectives are considered as we move forw ard. \n\n3 \n One task force will focus on identifying and evaluating approaches for implementing a \nsafe, ubiquitous and faster payments capability in the United States. The other task force will \nprovide input on security aspects of a faster payments capability, an d serve as a forum to advise \nthe Federal Reserve on how to address security matters and to identify and promote actions that \ncan be taken by payment system participants collectively or by the Federal Reserve System.  \n An important question is: H ow will we judge success  of these efforts ? Each task force \nwill be asked to identify the criteria by which they will measure success. In the near-term, we \nwill look to the secure payments task force to articulate key priorities . We will also be looking \nfor evidence o f commitment from payments system participants to take action on these priorities.  \nLong er-term, we hope to see this collaboration among industry participants continue,  \nresulting in progress on the development and adoption of effective security standards. We would \nalso hope to see robust r esearch and implementation of processes that result in better data and the \nability to closely monitor fraud and identify adverse trends, develop more effective responses, \nand track policy initiatives.  Success will mean p ayments modernization in the U nited States  is \nwell on its way , with adoption that reflects the public’s strong confidence in new capabilities.  \nTime will tell whether this collaborative approach  can be successful or whether the Fed \nneeds to take a different approach to foster a modern payments system that serves the needs of a \ndynamic economy .  \nIt was t en years ago , in 2005, that the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City hosted  its \nfirst payments confe rence titled, “Interchange Fees in Credit and Debit Card Markets.”  During \nthe two da ys of presentations, discussion  and debate among leading economists, industry leaders \nand policymakers, the need for intervention in the credit and debit markets was hotly contested. \nBy 2010, Congress intervened with regulation.   \n\n4 \n As we conclude this conference on payments security, I sense a greater degree of \nconsensus around the security challenges we face. As the Federal Reserve begins the work of \nconven ing and engag ing with stakeholders  to achieve a faster, more secure  and widely available \npayments system , the pieces of the puzzle li e before us. Putting them together in a way that \nmaintains the public’s confidence is both our challenge and our opportunity.",

            "content": "The Next Phase of Monetary Policy  \n \n \n \n \nEsther L. George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCentral Exchange  \nKansas City, Mo.  \nMarch 4, 2015  \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers or representatives.  \n  \n\n1 \n Good afternoon . I appreciate the opportunity to be here at the Central Exchange . The \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City has enjoyed a long and productive relationship with this \norganization, and I applaud the Central Exchange’s important contributions to supporting women \nin our community as it celebrates its 35th anniversary  this year.  \nAs the national economy continues to expand, the Federal Reserve has turned its attention \nto the issues associated with normalizing monetary policy after years o f unprecedented \naccommodation. Preparing for the next phase of monetary policy has involved consider ation of  \nthe mechanics for raising rates, clear principles supporting the normalization process, and  now,  \nthe discussion about the appropriate timing of the first rate increase. In my remarks today, I’ll \noffer my views on the economy’s pro gress and the appropriate stance of  monetary policy. I will \nclose by offering some observations about recent calls for further transparency and \naccountability for the Federal Reserve .   \nThese are my own views and not those of the Feder al Open Market Commit tee or the \nFederal Reserve System.  \n \nThe e conomic outlook  \nThe U.S. economy is expand ing at an above -trend growth rate , which I expect to continue \nthrough the end of the year. A strong dollar and certain aspects of the  foreign ou tlook pose some \nrisks, but the economy appears  well positione d to withstand such headwinds.  \nThe economic outlook is positive for both consumers and businesses. Consumer \nconfidence strengthened markedly in the second half of last year as gas oline  prices declined and \nthe labor market improved, and we have seen an increased willingness to spend on discretionary \ngoods and services , such as restaurants and recreational activitie s. Household balance sheets \n\n2 \n continue to strengthen, which should support c onsumer spending. Meanwhile, businesses \nare reporting that it’s a good time to expand, with industrial capacity utilization hitting its \npre-recession rate and spending on research and development accelerating.   \nImportantly, this improved outlook for consu mers and businesses suggest s that \nmomentum in the labor market will likely continue going forward. The economy added \nmore than 3 million jobs in 2014, the highest level since 1999 , and the rapid pace of job \ncreation has continued into the beginning of 2015 .  \nAlong with this  strong employment growth , we’ve seen  significant improvement \nin the unemployment rate , which has fallen from 6.7 percent in December 2013 to 5.7 \npercent in January of this year. The current level is less than one-half percentage point \naway from what many vi ew as the long -run normal rate. With more than 5 million job \nopenings currently posted, there are now fewer  than two unemployed people per job \nopening, down from nearly seven per job opening during the depths of the financial \ncrisis.  Evidence from the last business cycle indicates that as this balance tilts toward a \ntighter labor market, wage pressures are likely to increase.  \nAlready, the rates at which people voluntary leave their jobs are  increasing a s \nemployers look to recruit workers  from other firms and workers look to increase their \nwages. For example, research by my staff shows that in the second half of 2014, \nindividuals who switched jobs saw their wages increase more than 5 percent compared to \nwhat they earned in the prior quarte r—a notable rise compared to a few years earlier. As \nmore workers quit their jobs and seek out higher -paying employment, wage pressures are \nlikely to broaden and further increase.  \n\n3 \n Of course,  while  these positive indicators are encouraging , the labor market is not \ncompletely back to normal. For example, the share of “long -term” unemployed and the number \nnumber of individuals working part -time for economic reasons remains elevated . These aspects \nof our labor market are concerning . As the economy con tinues to expand and the labor market \ntightens further, job opportunities should become more available for those who have had \ndifficulty securing full -time employment.    \nTo evaluate the health of the labor market  in a way that takes into account  both strong \nemployment growth and job-finding challenges for many others , my staff developed an index of \nlabor market conditions that includes  a range of variables —something like a stock market index \nfor the labor market. Th is approach  show s that momentum  in the  labor market is near its highest \nrate in two decades.  If momentum continues at this pace , the labor market will return to its \naverage level of activity later this year.  This does not mean that all labor markets indicators will \nbe back to pre -crisis levels or even their historical average, but on a broad basis, the labor market \nwill be close to what can be considered normal.  \nTypically , a growing economy and tightening labor market would be accompanied by \nrising inflation . That has not been the case recently. In terms of consumer price inflation, the \nFed’s preferred measure is running at 0. 25 percent year -over-year—down from the 1.5 percent \npace at the middle of last year. The recent sharp declines in oil prices are positive for economic \ngrowth, but lower energy prices are dampening headline measures of inflation. However, the \nimpact of these transitory factors should fade later this year, particularly as oil prices stabiliz e.  \nLooking beyond these temporary factors, other important components of inflation are \nmoving higher. Rental prices for housing  have been strong , for example, and are likely to \ncontinue rising. The strength in the labor market  I just mentioned  is also likely to lead to more \n\n4 \n rapid wage  gains . So while inflation is somewhat below the Fed’s 2 percent goal, I am \nnot overly concerned with this shortfall . Instead, I see current and forecast ed inflation as \ngenerally consistent with price stability.  \nAgainst a b ackdrop of the ongoing economic expansion, a strengthening labor \nmarket and low but firming inflation, it is reasonable to contemplate a shift in the stance \nof monetary policy.  Moving to the next phase of policy entails judgment  on both the \ntiming of the first rate increase and then the pace of future increases —issues  that the \nFederal Open Market Committee will deliberate carefully.  \n \nThe liftoff decision  \nThe labor market, as I’ve highlighted, has experienced substantial improvement \nover the past year.  But in earlier stages of the recovery, much of the emphasis was on a \nweak labor market as the d river of accommodative policy. For example, we implemented \na number of bond -buying programs, commonly referred to as “QE 1, 2, and 3,”  held the \nfederal funds rate near  zero since the end of 2008, and relied on various iterations of \n“forward guidance” to signal our intentions that short -term rates would remain \naccommodative. Until March of last year, forward guidance for keeping short -term rates \nnear zero  hinged on a 6.5 percent unemployment rate threshold. In addition, the last \nlarge -scale asset purchase program was tied to achieving substantial improvement in the \noutlook for the labor market. This past October, we took the first steps towards \nnorma lization by ending the bond -buying program s.  \nNow with the economy approaching full employment , attention has turned to \nmoving inflation back towards the 2 percent goal. Rather than focusing solely on either \n\n5 \n employment or inflation,  policy needs to take a balanced approach, as is clearly codified in the \nFed’s Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy. The balanced approach \nsuggests that temporary deviations of unemployment and inflation  from their longer -run values  \ndo not necessarily warran t an extreme policy  setting . Instead, the stance of policy needs to take \ninto account the magnitudes of any deviations, as well as how long any deviation is expected to \nlast. Currently, unemployment is not far from its longer -run level , and the lower rate of headline \ninflation is expected to be temporary. And as I’ve mentioned, monetary policy should look \nthrough temporary factors, such as the oil price decline, as long as there is reasonable confidence \nthat inflation will be moving towards 2 percent within  the forecast horizon and that longer -term \ninflation expectations remain stable.  \nThis balanced approach framework supports  taking steps to remov e the extraordinary \namount of monetary accommodation currently in place . The next phase in this process is to move \nthe federal funds rate off its near -zero setting . While the FOMC has made no decisions about the \ntiming of this action , I continue to support liftoff  towards the middle of this year due to \nimprovement in the labor market, expectations of firmer inflat ion, and the balance of risks over  \nthe medium and longer run.  \nLiftoff in the middle of this year , in my view , would be fully consistent with the FOMC’s \nStatement on Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy , which reminds the public that “monetary \npolicy actions  tend to influence economic activity and prices with a lag. ” This means some time \nwill pass before we can see the effects of interest rate decisions, so mo netary policy must be \nforward -looking  and act  before the economy reaches full employment and 2 percen t inflation . \nWaiting until economic conditions are nearly  back to normal before raising rates  may put policy \nbehind the curve and require rates to rise rapidly in the future.  \n\n6 \n Another factor supporting liftoff in the near future is that many  of the benchmarks \npolicymakers use to assess the appropriate level of short -term rates  indicate  rates should \nbe above zero.  These benchmarks signal liftoff even after accounting for some possible \nchanges in the economy, such as a slower trend rate of grow th stemming from \ndemographic change and a more modest pace of productivity growth.   \n \nAfter l iftoff  \nAlthough considerable attention is now centered on the timing of raising rates, \nthis step is only one of many in the policy normalization process . Every interest rate  \ndecision depends on how the economy unfolds , so simply deciding to make the first \ninterest rate move b y no means puts interest rate decisions on autopilot.  At the same time, \npolicymakers can’t perpetually wait for just “one more dat a point,” so actions often must \nbe taken in anticipation of how economic conditions are expected to develop.  \nThe FOMC will need to be forward -looking in determining the pace of  remov ing \naccommodation. Unique to the extraordinary amount of monetary stimulus that exists \ntoday, it is important to emphasize these steps are a “removal of accommodation” and not \n“tightening .” I see r aising the federal funds rate off zero in the middle of this year as a \nstep to normalize financial conditions  alongside a strengthenin g economy , rather than an \nattempt to slow an overheating economy. The alternative of m oving rates off zero much \nlater, but raising them at a faster pace, risks disrupting financial market  and sharply  \nslowing economic activity . For that reason, I see more balanced risks under an approach \nthat raises rates sooner , such as in the middle  of this year, but  at a gradual pace. \n \n\n7 \n Conclusion  \nAs the Federal Reserve  contemplates its path to normalizing monetary policy, it does so \nat a time of tremendou s public scrutiny. There are c alls for more transparency and accountability \nrelated to its monetary policy  and its supervision and regulation of large financial institutions.  \nAs a result, changes to Fed structure and governance are being contemplated by C ongress.   \nTo be sure, accountability and the public’s scrutiny of the Federal Reserve are to be \nexpected and appropriate.  It is well understood that securing the public’s trust and confidence \ndepends on the  central bank’ s ability to meet its mandates from Congress. But contemplated \nchanges should be focused in a way that does not compromise the Federal Reserve’s key \nstrengths , including an independent FOMC and a decentralized structure. Broad-based \nrepresentation, public oversight and the ability of policymakers to bring independent views to the \ntable  have been enduring features of the system and have proven to be a source of strength for \nthe nation ’s central bank . It would be a mistake to alter that b alance without thoughtful and \ncaref ul consideration .",

It is my pleasure to be here to offer my observations on what may \nbe one of the most ambitious undertakings in the history of our national  payment \nsystem —the public -private engagement that is taking shape to improve the system’s \nspeed, efficiency  and security . This engagement is designed to meet the growing \ndemand s of American consumers and business es that continue to shift toward  e-\ncommerce and Internet -enabled technologies  in their da ily transactions .  \nTo some, it may seem like an unusual approach that we’ve taken , but it is not a \nnew one at its core . Based on a history of mutual cooperation on payments  issues  \nbetween the Federal Reserve and the private sector , we have seen public -private \nengagement s yield important gains for the country . Such collaboration in the past \nproduced outcomes that contributed to a more resilient payments system and provided \nsignificant benefits  to the public, such as  the development of routing numb ers, the growth \nof the automated clearing house network, and the crafting of Check 21 legislation.1 \nI’m encouraged by the recent progress that we’ve made  with the current effort , \nand it is my own conviction that the prospects for achieving the goals we’ve set out are \nbest realized by working together.  The organizers of this conference used the right word \nin naming it.  It is imperative  that we modernize the  payment s system, and also that the \nFederal Reserve and the industry join together  in this effort.  \nIn my remarks this morning, I will preface my observations about the status of our \nwork by reflecting on the nature of the challenge s we face  and the strategies that have \nbeen framed to address them . These strategies, as you know, are the product of the \nFederal Reserve ’s deliberate and broad consultation with a multitude of stakeholders \n                                                 \n1 See: Medley, Bill. Highways of Commerce: Central  Banking and the U.S. Payments System . Federal \nReserve Bank of Kansas City. 2014.  \n\n \n2 \n involved in  payment s system modernization . That input importantly shaped the paper \nissued in January of this year by the Federal Reserve Board and the Re serve Banks , titled \nStrategies for  Improving the U.S. Payment System .  \n \nThe challenge  \n  Since e -commerce took hold  in the United States more than  20 years ago , it has \ngrown rapidly in volume, speed and capability and has transformed retail and business -\nto-business commer ce. Among the most profound and pervasive changes has been t he \nrising  expectation of consumers and business es for continuous improvement s in speed \nand efficiency.  People who have come to expect regular upgrades in computers and \ncommunications  technology  have also come to expect more functionality from their \ncomputers , tablets  and smart phones to help them buy things.  And so, same -day delivery \nof almost anything , for example, has become a way of life  that most of us could not have \nimagined  even a few years ago.  \n It was also some  20 years ago  that online banking became common ly available , \nand here , too, there has been significant growth in speed, volume and the range of \nservices  that banks provide . Simply put, Americans who demand fast and dependable \ndelivery of wh at they buy and sell want their payments to keep up.  An analysis \ncommissioned by the Fed eral Reserve  found that each year there are 29 billion payments \nfor which real -time or near -real-time delivery would be desirable to end users.  One-third \nof consumers a nd fully three -fourths  of businesses want real -time payments , and they are \nnow willing to pay  for them . \n\n \n3 \n   The growth of e -commerce and advances in communication  have spurred \ninnovation  and new business opportunities in the United States.  Some o f the most  \nvaluable, innovative and admired  businesses in the world are technology companies  that \nwere founded here and remain here.  But the sizable and widespread economic gains from \nthese advances require a payment system that meets the demands of consumers and \nbusinesses.  We have seen a  number of other countries mov e forward with faster and \nmore -efficient payment systems to better serve their citizens and compete with the United \nStates for new and expanding business . With this advanced capability, however, has \ncome a significant and evolving threat to the s ecurity of banking and commerce . The \nneed to stay ahead of this threat alone is a compelling reason to modernize the payment \nsystem.  \n \nDesired outcomes  \nThese challenge s prompted the Federal Reserve to undertake careful study several \nyears ago and to seek extensive public input  about the need to improve the U.S. payment \nsystem.  By 2013, the Federal Reserve identified certain desired outcomes , based on its \nown analysis and private sector input .  \nLet me describe tho se desired outcomes as a way to remind  you of where we are \nheaded . First and foremost is the development of a  safe and  faster electronic solution for \nmaking a variety of business and personal payments  that is both ubiquitous and available \non demand.  Such a  system would be  supported by a flexible and cost -effective means for \npayment clearing and settlement that would be  rapid and final.   \n\n \n4 \n Our second  desired outcome is a payment  system that remains safe and resilient . \nAny enhancements to  speed and efficiency m ust maintain both the privacy and integrity \nof our system and allow for continuous improvements to security as threats emerge and \nevolve.  Specifically, w e anticipate  potential improvements to the Federal Reserve’s \npublicly  available payment fraud data as well as  additional payment security research.  \nWe also look forward to sharing our results with payment stakeholders because we \nbelieve they will help inform future industry actions and policy decisions.  \nEfficiency is a third desired outcome . A reliable alternative to th e 18 billion paper \nchecks  written each year  could reduce th e average end -to-end cost of payment \ntransactions  and allow innovative payment services to  deliver better  value to consumers \nand businesses alike.  \n Our fourth desired outcome focuses on access  and efficiency  in cross -border \npayments.  A new payment system should offer better choices for U.S. consumers and \nbusinesses to send and receive convenient, cost -effective and timely cross -border \npayments.  We hea rd widespread support for  this goal among stakeholders.  Although \nthere is a range  of views about the priority for such payments , few dispute that the cost \nand convenience of cross -border payments have not kept pace with the impact o f \nglobalization.   \nOur fi fth desired outcome is simple : We need to work together . The Federal \nReserve cannot implement meaningful payments improvement on its own , and the \ncompetitive forces driving industry inn ovation mean the private sector’s ability to meet \nthe public’s needs would benefit from the kind of coordination and collaboration that the \nFederal Reserve  is uniquely positioned to provide.  Working together, w e believe the \n\n \n5 \n private sector can and should be able to provide the innovat ion necessary to address the \nneeds of the market .  \n \nMaking progress toward these g oals  \nFollowing our review of public comments and lengthy consult ation with \nstakeholders, the Federal Reserve Board and the Reserve Banks issued in January of this \nyear a paper that outlined strategies  for improving the payment system .  \nThese strategies represent  the first steps in a roadmap for payments \nmodernization , and they define the appro ach for how the Fed eral Reserve  will work with \nthe private sector.  We expect and encourage private industry to advanc e these goals by \noffering its own ideas and plans . But we also expect to see cooperation and, at some \npoint, visible evidence of both commitment and progress from all stakeholders.  \n Since the strategies paper was published  early this year , active engagement has \ntaken shape  with the creation of two task forces . One is focused on faster payments and \nthe other on the security  of payments .  \nOne way of describing the breadth of this effort is that many in this audience  \nalready are  members themselves or part of organizations represented on one or both task \nforces . At last count, the faster payments task force has more than 320 members and the \nsecure payments task force more than 170.  There are represen tatives of technology \nproviders;  small, medium a nd large financial institutions; payments networks; t rade \nassociations; business end users and consumers;  and a small number of government \nofficials.  Each task force  has chosen a steering committee , and w ork streams are \nunderway .  \n\n \n6 \n The Faster Payments Task Force, with its large and diverse membership, began \nwork  on criteria that will describe the standards for effectiveness in delivering faster \npayments . Members of the Secure Payments Task Force and a work group of legal  \nsubject matter experts are providing specialized input to that work . When finalized, these  \ncriteria will serve as both a description of stakeholder needs that the market can use to \nguide  faster payments innovation and a tool for the task f orce itself to assess alternative \napproaches for faster payments  solutions . \n The task force also has developed  and approved  a decision -making framework . \nThis framework ensures  that its decisions and work  products have broad support of the \ntask force membership, including support within and across the different stakeholder \ngroups represented.  Just yesterday, the Faster Payments Task force posted to the \nFedPaymentsImprovement .org website the latest draft of the criteria along with a survey \nto gather even broader public input . This effort to finalize the faster payments  \neffectiveness criteria  in the coming months  remains on track .   \nTo prepare for the evaluation of different approaches to payment modernization, \nthe Faster Payments Task Force is currently working to carefully define a process for \nencouraging the best ideas to come forward and assessing them against the effectiveness \ncriteria . In addition to identifying effective solutions for faster payments, the task force \nwill note the foundational aspects of a faster payment system that no single  solution \nprovider can deliver independently, and when implemented , will enable those providers \nto interoperate and deliver to end users a consistent, accessible and universal faster \npayments experience.  Finally, the task f orce will highlight strategic issues and gaps that it \n\n \n7 \n believes must be addressed to pave the way for successful implementation and \nwidespread ado ption of these solutions.   \nTurning to t he Secure Payments Task F orce, its work has begun with a focus on \nthe security needed for faster payments solutions , including a high priority on identity \nmanagement and authentication and finding more effective ways to protect sensitive \ninformation that travels through the payment system.  Importantly, however, the work of \nthe Secure Payments Task Force extends beyond the security needed for new faster \npayments.  It is also focused on curren t payment networks and channels . As threats \nchange , they are considering better ways to share fraud and cyber -threat information and \nto analyze such data.  Finally, t he Secure Payments Task Force will advise the Fed eral \nReserve  on priorities related to paym ents security standards , research  and education in \norder to promote enhanced safety of payments systems old and new.  \nAs the task forces continue their work, the Federal Reserve  will do its part to \nensure  that the process is progressing smoothly toward the desired outcomes I noted \nearlier . Task force m embership will continue to be representative of diverse stakeholder \nperspectives and interests, and we will recruit when appropriate to fulfill that goal . We \nwant active task force participation that contributes to and takes ownership of work \nproducts and decisions.  We will facilitate interaction and ensure processes and tools are \nin place to support the development of high -quality work produc ts that achieve task force \nobjectives.  In all of this, we wa nt to promote a process that carefully considers the \ninterests of all stakeholders, objectively evaluates different proposals, and arrives at an \napproach that will have broad support.  The hallmark of this process will be transparency \nand good communication , which are essential to reaching consensus.    \n\n \n8 \n Let me conclude by emphasizing  that the progress achieved so far has been \nimpressive and encouraging.  I remain confident t hat this collaborative approach to \npayment  system reform maximizes  our chances for succ ess. I am also realistic.  The task \nforces have made s ubstantive progress, but there is some distance to go before realizing \nour goals.  I fully expect that we will face challenges along the way.  But I am convinced \nthe end is worth the journey , and the Federal Reserve is  committed to working with \nindustry stakeholders to get there for the public’s sake .",

It is my pleasure  to welcome you to the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas \nCity and our first ever “ Workshop on the Future of Banking.”  I am  pleased to be joined today by \nbank executives from the Tenth D istrict and across the nation as well as a number of  esteemed \nacademics and industry representatives. It is my  hope that together we will have a productive \nconversation about  the key issues affecting the banking industry , whose success is vital to our \neconomy . I would also like to recognize that m any of you here today represent community \nbanks . Your  local ly focused  banks  are integral to our financial system  as service providers and  \nour society  more broadly because of  your  enduring commitment to civic engagement.  I hope to \nhear more  in our conversations today about how your  banks  strengthen local communities a s \nwell as the challenges and opportunities  you fac e.  \nOur discussion this morning will take an in- depth look at how banks are positioning \nthems elves for the future . In particular,  I am  interested in learning more about how banks will \nharness emerging  technologies to increase efficiencies and develop new product s to serve thei r \ncustomers. However, our conversation will also focus on the challenges banks  face  and the tools \nthey will require to persevere  and thrive in today’s dynamic economy . Overall, I  hope to get a \nkeen sense of the role that policymaking can play  in helping banks navigate an evolving financial \nlandscape while always ensuring a safe and sound U .S. financial system .  \nThrough today’s panel discussions, I also hope to better understand the barriers \nconfronting prospective entrants to the banking industry . New bank owners and managers can \nbring innovative ideas and promote changes that improve efficiency and  access to financial \nservices for  businesses and consumers . Such changes may be particularly impactful to banking \ncustomers in rural or otherwise underserved areas that have historically had  relatively  limited \n\n2 \n financial services  offerings . Indeed, financial services access is a particularly important topic to \nthe Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  because our district contains many rural and low -to-\nmoderate -income communities. Innovati on can also create a more efficient financial system  that \nbenefits service providers by lowering costs and increasing profitability . Despite the potential \nbenefits,  however, new charter issuance has declined substantially since the Global Financial \nCrisis.  Today’s discussion will illuminate the reasons why this decline has occur red and the \npolicy changes  that might be necessary to  enable new charter ing activity . \nOutside of new charters, entry into the banking industry can occur through the acquisition \nof existing bank charters  as well . Allowing fresh , innovative owners  to acquire existing banks  \ncan enhanc e system resiliency and increase new product offerings  in much the  same way that de \nnovo chart ering can . In fact, under certain circumstances, investors might be indifferent between \nacquiring an existing bank and setting up a new bank, as my colleague Governor Bowman has \npointed out in the past . However, in practice, there has been a clear  preference  for charter \nacquisition over de novo formation  among recent market participants . Therefore, I think it is \nreasonable for policymakers to ask , what  tradeoffs are involved when entry occurs via  \nacquisition rather than  de novo chartering ?  \nRelatedly, I am  interested in how consolidation across banks can affect  the future \nstructure of our community banking network. For the past 40 years, banks have steadily consolidated , resulting in fewer bank charters and increased institutional size and complexity.  \nWhile increased size and complexity has brought substantial challenges for both bank managers and supervisors, many argue th at the prolonged period of consolidation has resulted in a more \nefficient system that better meets  the needs of borrowers. At the same time, having fewer banks  \nmay decrease competition and  reduce access to financial services for some communities. I \n\n3 \n believe policymakers  have a n obligation to ensure financial services remain  reasonably \naccessible across a diverse range of localities  and communities . In turn, it makes sense to ask  if a \ncontinuation of the current consolidation trends will help or hinder this goal.  \nWe will also explor e questions surrounding bank competit ion today . Financial market \ncompetition has been fierce in recent years both  among traditional banks and  between  banks and \nnon-banks . In particular, nonbank competition has  increased substantially due to both greater  \ncompetition from traditional finance , such as credit unions  and the farm credit system , as well as \na rise in innovative financial startups such as fintechs. Policymakers should continually \nreevaluate whether the lens through which they view competition accurately  reflects the world in \nwhich modern banks operate .   \nOverall, the main objective of today’s workshop is to have  a conversation with an \nimportant set of stakeholders that will be  directly affected by ongoing market changes . However, \nI also understand there  are other  groups  who  have a vested interest in  the matters we will discuss . \nTo that end, I am hopeful that today’s event will be the starting  point for a larger conversation \namong all stakeholders . Ultimately, my goal  is to encourage  inform ed policy choices that lead to \na better financial system for the country  — one  that meets the needs of both modern financial \nservices  providers and the American people.  \nPersonally, I am very excited to host this event because these are issues that are near and \ndear to me. As a former community  banker myself , I ha ve ha d the opportunity to both operate \nestablished  banks  and to engage in mergers and acquisition s. So needless to say, I have sat where \nyou sit , and I have experienced  many of the challenges you face. I also have a deep passion for \nthe benefits that  community banks bring to our nation as both financial service s providers and as \npillars of our  local communities. As the lender of choice for many small businesses, community \n\n4 \n banks ensure  our local economies continue to thrive by meet ing businesses’  essential  financi al \nneeds . Community banks  have also continually demonstrated  an ability to understand the unique \nchallenges households and businesses face in their communities . It is my hope  that policymakers \ncan maximize the  benefits th at community bank s provide to our local communities while \nenhancing the ir health and resiliency.  For this reason, I look forward to hearing your views and \ndiscussing the many issues on the table today.   \nI would now like to introduce my Federal Reserve colleague, Governor Michelle \nBowman. Governor Bowman has been a member of the Federal Reserve Board since 2018. Prior \nto her Federal Reserve appointment, she served as Kansas state banking commissioner for t wo \nyears and as an executive of Farmers & Drovers Bank in Kansas. She also held staff positions in \nthe U.S. House and Senate as well as FEMA and the Department of Homeland Security. It is with great pleasure that I welcome Governor Bowman.",

A special thank you to our \nhosts, Joe Parcell and Emily Garwood from Kansas State , and Chuck Marv ine and Russ Behnam \nfrom the CFTC. Russ was kind enough to provide the keynote for the Kansas City Fed’s National \nAg Credit Conference last month . These types of cross -institution events are crucial for helping \nus understand key economic issues in the agricultural sector.   \nAgriculture plays an important role  in the economy, especially  in this part of the country . \nWhile locally important , the factors that influence  the ag economy  are often  global . Commodity \nmarkets  are subject to  shifting weather  patterns , swings in global growth , and geopolitical \ndevelopments . Commodity prices adjust quickly to these influences and  provide a real -time \nsignal  on the balance between  supply and demand . Commodity futures markets help \ncommunicate supply and demand conditions to a wider audience  and allow users and producers \nto hedge price risk . The CFTC plays an important role in promoting the integrity and resilience \nof these markets through effective regulation.   \nJust as  in commodity markets, price s and inflation  in the broader economy  also reflect  the \nbalance between  supply and demand . And, as we  have  witnessed in recent years,  a persistent \nimbalance  between the two  can lead to prolonged episodes  of elevated price inflation.   \nIn my remarks this afternoon, I  will offer my thoughts on the evolution of  imbalances in \nour economy and the ir implications for our progress towards low and stable inflation  as well as \nfor the appropriate path of monetary policy .  \n \nInflation and Wages  \nCongress  has provided the Federal Reserve with two monetary policy mandates : price \nstability  and maximum employment . The Fed interprets price stability to be consistent with a 2 \npercent inflation objective as measured by the annual change in the  personal consumption \nexpenditures (PCE) price index . This measure  aims to capture price movements  across the vast \narray of  goods and services purchased by consumers.  \nDuring the post -pandemic economic recovery, inflation surged  above 7 percent,  a 40-year \nhigh, as robust demand ran up against supply bottlenecks and constraints on production . \nAlthough inflation has stepped down significantly  since the F ed began raising interest rates in \n\n2 \n 2022, it remains above the 2 percent  definition of price stability . Inflation has surprised to the \nupside since the beginning of the year  and has run  at roughly a 4 percent annual rate  during the \nfirst quarter . This recent data underscores what I believe is the need for the Federal Reserve to be \npatient as we wait  for clear and convincing evidence that inflation is on track to sustainably \nreturn to 2 percent .  \nLooking ahead , I will be watching three factors to monitor progress towards our inflation \ngoal:  \n• First, the tightness of the labor market and consequent upward pressure on labor -\nintensive service prices . \n• Second,  the potential for an increased supply of labor to relieve labor market \ntightness .  \n• And t hird, the risk that renewed supply chain challenges could provide an unwelcome \nboost to inflation .       \n \nElaborating further  on the first factor : Elevated services price inflation is now the primary \ndriver of  overall  inflation in the economy.1  For example, higher prices for healthcare services \ncontributed significantly to the rebound in inflation  since the beginning of the year . The \nproduction of many services tends to be labor intensive . As a result , strong services prices are \nbeing supported by the tightness of the  labor market and the ongoing imbalance between the  \neconomy’s  demand for workers and the available  supply of labor .    \nAnd t he demand for labor continues to be strong . This is  evidenced by robust hiring and \nelevated wage growth . So far this year , firms added an average of 2 70,000 jobs per month to \ntheir payrolls , far above the historical norm . Postings for new positions  also remain elevated, \nwhile initial claims for unemployment insurance have remain ed low for some time now .  \nIndirectly, the ongoing tightness in the labor market has also pushed up the cost of \nhousing , an important contributor to the current strength of overall inflation . New work \narrangements and changing preferences increased the demand for living space during and after \nthe pandemic, leading to  a rapid increase in house prices and rents . After peaking near 9 percent  \nin 2022, rent inflation moderated significantly last year . However, the contribution of rents to \n \n1 See Supercore PCE Inflation Surged in January to Its Highest Monthly Level in More than Two Years , by  \nJordan Rappaport, A. Lee Smith, and Shu -Kuei X. Yang .  \n\n3 \n overall inflation remains well above its the pre-pandemic rate . Research by staff at the Kansas \nCity Fed suggests that the ongoing tightness in the labor market could keep rent inflation \nelevated for some time.2 Job gains and wage increases put upward pressure on rents and housing \nprices as income growth increases household demand for additional and higher -quality living \nspaces . \nA second factor I will be watching  is the outlook for the supply of labor . Last year, the \neconomy experienced  a large increase in the workforce , especially among women  aged 25 -55. In \naddition, the economy experienced a post -pandemic rebound in immigration  over the  last year. \nThis improvement in the economy’s ability to supply labor helped to ease tightness in the labor \nmarket .  \nDespite  these improvements in the supply of labor, wage growth  continues to signal an \nimbalance between  labor  demand and the number of available workers to meet that demand . \nWhile wage growth has moderated from its recent peak, it remains elevated compared to early \nperiods and likely is continuing to put upward pressure on services prices .  \nLooking beyond wages, t he Kansas City Fed’s Labor Market Conditions Indicators \n(LMCI) provide another  way to measure th e ongoing tightness in the labor market . These \nindicators, which are published monthly  on the Kansas City Fed’s website, summarize  many  \ndifferent labor market variables into measures of activity and momentum .3 According to the  most \nrecent  LMCI,  activity in the labor market remains well above its longer -run average level , \nsuggesting that the labor market remains tight  relative to its historical norm . \nA third thing I will be keeping an eye on is a  potential reacceleration in goods inflation . \nAs robust demand for goods ran up against supply bottlenecks during the post -pandemic  \nrecovery, prices for many goods rose rapidly and contributed significantly to the overall increase \nin inflation . While prices for goods have been roughly flat over the past year, recent disruptions \nto global shipping  imply some upside risk to goods prices going forward . Relatedly,  energy \nprices are also up significantly since the beginning of the year , which pose s an additional \nheadwind to sustainably low and stable inflation .             \n \n \n2 See A Tight Labor Market Could Keep Rent Inflation Elevated , by Brent Bundick, A. Lee Smith, and Luca Van der \nMeer .  \n3 See https://www.kansascityfed.org/data -and-trends/labor -market-conditions -indicators/ . \n\n4 \n Ultimately, achieving better balance in the labor market will likely be necessary for \nFederal Reserve policymakers to deliver on our price stability mandate and achieve 2 percent \ninflation . However, uncertainty  remains as to the role that improvements in  labor supply will \nplay versus slower labor demand in rebalanc ing labor markets . While I welcome the  significant \ngrowth  witnessed  in the economy’s  workforce last year , it remains unclear  whether this rapid \npace of supply improvement will continue going forward .  \n \nThe Outlook for Monetary Policy  \nWith inflation  still running above 2 percent and labor markets still tight, it is appropriate \nthat monetary policy remain restrictive . Over the past two years , the FOMC has raised  the \nfederal funds rate by over 500 basis points and has started to unwind the  large portfolio of  \nsecurity holdings it amassed on its  balance sheet . All of this is  an effort to help rebalance demand \nand supply in the economy and restore price stability .  \nEven with these actions , the demand for goods and services has displayed remarkable \nresilience to higher interest rates . The economy continues to grow  at a pace well above its \nlonger -run trend . Much of this  increase in overall growth has been driven by strong consumer \nspending . With increasing house prices and equity market s near all -time highs , the strength of \nhousehold balance sheets appears to be  encouraging households to spend rather than save despite \nthe high interest rates . Accordingly, the household savings rate remains near historic lows .  \nSimilarly, in the agricultural sector, although farm incomes are expected to be down this \nyear, they remain above their pre -pandemic levels . While higher interest expenses and reduced \nincomes may be weighing on some highly leveraged producers, the overall financial picture in \nagriculture remain s strong. Most lenders report that the credit qual ity of their farm portfolio has \nbeen strong, loan delinquencies are still historically low, and profits of recent years continue to \nsupport strong balance sheets. In addition, despite the increase in interest rates over the past  two \nyears, farmland value s remain  firm alongside relatively strong global demand for agricultural \nproducts. The strength of global demand for agricultural products is a topic we will explore \nfurther in a n event next month in Omaha , where we will look forward to connecting with a \nvariety of businesses tied to agriculture to hear their thoughts on longer -term factors shaping \ncommodity markets.  \n \n\n5 \n This ongoing resilience in the economy c reates  some uncertainty about the path of  the \nfederal  funds rate that will be needed to restore price stability . With inflation running above \ntarget, economic growth continuing to show momentum , and elevated prices across a range of  \nasset markets , the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate . Therefore, r ather than \npreemptively adjust the policy rate , I would prefer  to be patient and wait for  clear and  convincing \nevidence that  inflation is on track  to hit our 2 percent  target before adjusting the stance of policy .  \n \nThe Outlook for the Fed eral Reserve’s  Balance Sheet  \nNow, I’d like to turn to another one of the Fed’s policy tools: its balance sheet. While  the \nlevel of the federal funds rate  has held  steady  since  July of last year, the Fed has continued to \nshrink the size of its balance sheet . As I see it, reducing  the Fed’s  balance sheet is important for \ntwo reasons. First, balance sheet reduction  helps reduce  the overall degree of policy \naccommodation  at time  when policy should remain restrictive . And second, moving towards a \nsmaller balance sheet is important to lessen the Fed’s footprint in financial markets.  \nFor some context, the balance sheet grew significantly as the Fed responded forcefully to \nthe COVID -19 pandemic. To help stabilize the economy , the Federal Reserve purchased large \nquantities of Treasuries and agency mortgage -backed securities . These purchases were carried \nout to reduce long -term interest rates  and ensure financial markets continue d to function  amid \nlockdowns and historic uncertainty . Consequently , the Fed’s balance sheet more than doubled  \nfrom just under $ 4.5 trillion in 20 19 to nearly $9 t rillion in 2022 . To fund these purchases, the \nFederal Reserve  expanded the quantity of reserves in the banking system .      \nSince June of 2022, the FOMC has reduced its holdings  by more  than $1.5 trillion . \nHowever,  the balance sheet remains large and continues to put downward pressure on long -term \ninterest rates . With inflation running above target, a tight labor market, and historically high \nequity valuations, the economy and financial markets no longer require support from a  large \ncentral bank balance sheet . Rather, given the state of the economy, m y preference is for a much \nsmaller balance sheet with a shorter average maturity .  \nThe Fed’s large  balance sheet and footprint can also obscure price signals  and distort \nfinancial markets . Our holdings put downward pressure on longer -term rates and flatten the yield \ncurve . This stresses  the traditional model of borrowing and lending  central to the health of  many \ncommunity banks . In addition, the Federal Reserve continues to hold a large fraction of the total \n\n6 \n outstanding stock of agency mortgage -backed securities . These significant holdings could distort \nthe allocation of credit  and lead to future imbalances . As the Committee discussed in its \nPrinciples for Reducing the Size of the Balance sheet ,4 I believe our balance sheet should \nprimarily be composed of Treasury securities to minimize the effect of the Fed’s holdings on the \nprice and allocation of credit in the economy.  \nThe Fed’s large balance sheet is also suppressing  price signals  in funding markets.  \nFluctuations in interbank lending rates  provide timely signals to market participants about \nliquidity conditions in funding markets . For some time  now, the federal funds rate has traded \nconsistently 7 basis points below the interest rate on reserve balances and shown no sensitivity to \nfluctuations in reserves . This suggests  that liquidity remains abundant . These price signals imply \nthat our current pace of balance sheet reduction is not creating strains in funding markets .  \nHowever, unlike our previous balance sheet normalization in  2019, the Federal Reserve \nhas established the Standing Repo Facility , and banks have shown a greater willingness to use \nthe discount window . If runoff began to unexpectedly stress funding markets and the spreads in \nthe interbank market rose significantly, these liquidity tools would be available to prevent a \nsignificant  increase in short -term market interest rates . As we learn about broader liquidity \ndemand in the system through these price signals, I believe it will be important to tolerate some \nmore normal volatility in interest rates .  \nTolerating some interest rate volatility during runoff could improve the longer -term \nhealth of funding markets , which may all ow the financial system to operate with fewer reserves . \nWith a constantly evolving financial system, the appropriate amount of reserves needed to \nefficiently conduct monetary policy will not be defined by a fixed quantity but rather the ability \nof the financial system to redistribute that liquidity as needed .  \nConsistent with the theme of my remarks today , price signals from markets will be \nnecessary to help properly allocate this liquidity . Stopping balance sheet runoff too early poses  a \nrisk of further weakening the channels of liquidity redistribution . Along these lines, completely \nsmothering  rate volatility could make the interbank market less resilient and sow the seeds of \nfuture financial market instability.      \n \n \n \n4 See https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20220126c.htm  \n\n7 \n Conducting Policy Under Uncertainty  \nWith various unknowns surrounding the macroeconomic outlook, knowing the exact \nfuture course of monetary policy is always difficult . Jim Collins , the author , has been influential \nin my thinking as a leader  throughout my career . In his book, Great By Choice , he says that, \n“None of us can predict with certainty the twists and turns our lives will take.” In a rapidly \nevolving economic and financial landscape  only four years after the outbreak  of a global \npandemic , this statement resonates with me .  \nAs a policymaker though, I am certain that my colleagues and I on the FOMC will take \nnecessary actions to restore price stability and achieve maximum employment .

            "content": "Remarks  \n \nJeff Schmid  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAugust 8, 2024  \nKansas Bankers Association Annual Meeting  \nColorado Springs, Colo.  \nThe views expressed by the author are his own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers or representatives.   \n\n1 \n Thank you for having me . It is an honor  to participate in the Kansas Bankers Association \nannual meeting . You have quite a lineup  of speakers , and I am pleased to be part of such an \nesteemed group.  \nToday, I will speak to some issues of importance to the industry before turning to a \ndiscussion of the outlook for the economy and monetary policy.  \n \nBanking and the 10th District  \nIt is exciting  to see you once again . We were fortunate  to host many of you  in April at the \nKansas City Fed for a Workshop on the Future of Banking , which was also attended by Gov. \nBowman . That event was a recognition  of the importance of banking to the nation’s economy, \nbut even more so  a recognition of  the importance of banks to the Tenth District.  I will say here \nthat the banking industry as a whole in the Tenth District, and specifically in Kansas, is in sound \ncondition as a result of your leadership.   \nOur District is home to a large number of banks,  most of which are small community \nbanks.  An understanding of and connection with community banks has long been part of the \nKansas City Fed’s DNA.  As a former community banker myself, I will continue this tradition.   \nLocally focused banks, with their unique understanding of the challenges and \nopportunities of their communities , play a key financial and civic role across the country, and \nparticularly in the rural geographies that make up much of the Tenth  District.  In serving the \npublic, the Fed has an interest in the health of community banks.  This includes understanding  the \nunique issues facing community banks and work ing to prevent such banks from being \ndisadvantaged relative to other financial institutions.    \nFor this reason, it is important that bank regulators and supervisors take a tailored \napproach to manage the unique risks posed by different institutions. Effective supervision and \nregulation should ensure that the hundreds of regional and community banks in the Tenth District \nare safe and sound. But supervisory and regulatory frameworks should also acknowledge that a \none-size-fits-all approach can come with significant compliance costs and threaten the ability of \ncommunity banks to supply credit and deposi t services to rural households, agricultural \nproducers, and small businesses.  \nIt is also important that regulation not disadvantage smaller banks.  Small banks already \nmaintain, on average, higher capital ratios than larger , more systemic banks.  However, large \n\n2 \n banks continue to enjoy implicit funding subsidies that convey an unfair competitive advantage. \nIt is important that we continue efforts to level the playing field  to enable effective competition \nbetween small banks and larger more systemic institutions . Overall, adequate capital is at the \nheart of the resilience of the banking system.  Since the 2008 financial crisis, the system has \nbecome much better capitalized.  However, given the importance of capital , we should always \nwork to make sure that capital is c ommensurate to the risk, especially for larger systemic \norganizations.   \nThe Fed should also be aware of the challenges that smaller institutions face, especially \nin the context of rapid technological change , which has implications for cost and accessibility . \nOne important development here is the launch of FedNow, the Federal Reserve’s new 24/7/365 \npayment rail.  FedNow is the Fed’s first major new payment rail in over 40 years and aims to \nbring instant payments technology to all financial institutions, no matter their size or location.  \nOur continued commitment to discount window lending modernization is also helpful in \nreducing risks related to bank funding. I applaud the progress we have made to improve banks’ \noperational readiness regarding  discount window access. But I also agree with Dallas Fed \nPresident Lorie Logan’s recent remarks that technological advancements and policy changes can \nfurther assist us in achieving our goal of making the discount window an effective liquidity risk \nmanagement tool.  Bankers also have a role to play and should prioritize their discount window \nreadiness.  A diversified funding stack is essential , and the discount window has a role to play.    \n \nEconomic Outlook and Monetary Policy  \nI would like to turn now to an update on the  current state of the economy  and the outlook \nfor monetary policy.  Next year will be my first rotation as a voting member on the Federal Open \nMarket Committee (FOMC) , which has  responsibility for setting the Fed’s policy interest rate  \ntarget . With that responsibility comes a need for transparency.  It is important that I explain how I \nview the economy and how that view informs my take on appropriate policy.   \nOf course, my view of the economy is important ly shaped by my connection s and \nconversation s with individuals in the 10th District.  The structure of the Fed, with 12 independent \nregional banks, was designed to collect views and information from across the country . This \ndesign, which has worked well for over 100 years, makes sure that the whole country has a voice \n\n3 \n in monetary policy . The vote on the FOMC is my responsibility, but it is n ot a decision I take in \nisolation . \nIt is helpful to  review where we are now before turning to a more uncertain view of \nwhere we might be going.  Following recent sharp movements in financial markets , it is \nimportant to stress that all discussions of  monetary  policy must be rooted in Congress’s \ninstruction that the Fed pursue a dual mandate of price stability and full employment.  Of course, \nfinancial conditions can both reveal important information on the trajectory of the economy and \ncan also spillover to impact  the real economy.  However, t he Fed has to remain focused on  \nachiev ing its dual  mandate , and i n recent years we have had our work cut out for us.  \nPrice stability is defined as an inflation rate of 2 percent . Inflation at this pace is thought \nto be modest enough not to affect people’s day -to-day decision making . The target is not zero so \nthat the economy has some flexibility for relative prices to adjust over time.  Since 2021 , the Fed \nhas been missing on this part of its mandate , with inflation peaking at a 40 -year high in the \nmiddle of 2022 . Accordingly , the Fed reacted, and quite strongly, increasing the policy interest \nrate 525 basis points over a short period of time  and holding it there for the past year.  \nThe inflation that we have seen over the past few years was caused by an imbalance in \nthe economy, with demand for goods and services outpacing the economy’s ability to supply \nthose goods and services.  In a market economy, when demand exceeds supply, prices go up.    \nBy tightening monetary policy, the Fed’s goal has been to slow the pace of demand \ngrowth to allow supply to catch up, closing the imbalance in the economy and relieving price \npressure.   Demand has eased  and supply has increased, in part as pandemic -related disruptions to \nproduction cleared up.  And inflation has come down, falling from over 7 percent  at its peak to \n2½ percent  by the middle of this year , much closer to our 2 percent objective .  We are close , but \nwe are still not quite there.   \nThe most recent monthly price numbers have also been encouraging, with inflation \neasing across a wide cross section  of goods and services.  Given this data, I am more  confident \nthat inflation is on a path  to return to our target.  But the price data can be volatile, and it is \nstandard practice to look at inflation over longer periods of time to smooth through the monthly \nups and downs.  Given the multi -decade shock to inflation that we have experienced, we should \nbe looking for the worst in the data rather than the best.  However, if inflation continues to come \n\n4 \n in low, my confidence will grow that we are on track to meet the price stability part of our \nmandate, and it will be appropriate to adjust the stance of policy .  \nThe outlook only gets more uncertain from there . My view, as outlined earlier this year  in \nremarks at the Kansas City Fed’s Agricultural Symposium in Omaha ,1 is that while the current \nstance of policy is restrictive, it is not that restrictive.  \nThis view is based in part on the resilience of the economy and growth over the past two \nyears  even as interest rates climbed sharply higher.  Of course, last week’s employment report for \nJuly led many to question this resilience.  But it is important to note that many other indicators \npoint to continued strength.  Real GDP increased over 3 percent last year, faster than any year but \none in the decade prior to the pandemic, notwithstanding the low interest rates of that era.  More \nrecently, real GDP increased a  further 2¾ percent in the second quarter , supported by the \ncontinued strength of consumer demand and solid investment spending , and while it is \nadmittedly early , indicators for the third quarter show these trends continuing . Even more \nimportant, as I t alk to contacts in the region, I continue to hear a general tone of optimism and \nresilience . \nReturning to last week’s labor market data  for July . The rise in the unemployment rate to \n4.3 percent has certainly refocused attention on the employment side of the Fed’s mandate.  \nAcross many indicators, there has been a  noticeable cooling of the labor market from the \nhistorically tight  conditions  of 2023 and 2022 . But overall , the labor market still appears healthy .  \nAt the Kansas City Fed , we combine information from 26 labor market indicators into \nwhat we call the KC Labor Market Conditions Indicator (or LMCI) .2 Looking much broader than \nthe unemployment rate alone, the labor market still appears to be quite strong by this measure.  \nThis aligns with my discussions with district contacts, which generally acknowledge a cooling of \nthe market but not a sense of widespread disruptions or declines.  At this point, the cooling of the \nlabor market can be viewed as  a necessary condition for the easing of inflation that we have \nexperienced.  Imbalances in the labor market were a key factor keeping inflation high , and a \nlooser market was needed to bring inflation down . However, this story could change if \nconditions were to weaken considerably more . \n \n1 See https://www.kansascityfed.org/Speeches/documents/10168/2024 -Schmid-Omaha-05-14.pdf.  \n2 See https://www.kansascityfed.org/data -and-trends/labor -market-conditions -indicators/ .  \n\n5 \n The path of policy will be determined by the data and the strength of the economy.  With \nthe tremendous shocks that the economy has endured so far this decade, I would not want to \nassume any particular path or endpoint for the policy rate.  This is to say the data and the \nperformance of the  economy should guide  policy rather than a presumption that we must return \nto some pre -pandemic perception of normal.  I will be carefully watching the data and gathering \ninformation on growth, jobs, and inflation as I judge the appropriate path for policy . Thank you.",

Omaha Branch \nExecutive and Senior Vice President Nate Kauffman has organized an impressive gathering , and \nI thank each of you for being here . As leaders in your field, I recognize  the value of your time , \nand I appreciate your commitment in attending this event.  Likewise, my Fed colleagues and I are \ncommitted  to listening and learning  from the discussion today and tomorrow . Events like these \nplay a critical role in the Fed’s mission.  By engaging with a wide cross section  of industry and \nsociety , the Fed receives necessary information and input to guide the nation’s monetary policy.  \nThe strength of this network has helped make the  Federal Reserve one of the most successful \ncentral bank s in the world.   \nThe Federal Reserve’s effectiven ess is rooted in its 12-district  regional structure.  Having \n12 geographically defined Federal Reserve regions, each represented by a different Bank, allows \nfor the efficient and effective collection of diver se views on the economy  while also \nstrengthening  relationships with the communities we serve  and ensur ing that all segments of the \neconomy have a voice in monetary policy.  The system  continues to work very well and is a credit \nto the vision of  its creators.    \nFor the Kansas City Fed , agriculture is an important element  of our distinct voice , as is \nenergy, the theme of this year’s summit . Agriculture touches all 12 Fed eral Reserve  districts, but \nits imprint is particularly large in  the seven -state region covered by  the Kansas City Fed . We \ndevote  a fair amount of time, led by Nate Kauf fman, to analyzing and reporting on the sector  and \nevents like this further strengthen our bond.   \nThe agricultural economy in our region, and nationally, has gone through significant \nchanges over the past 10 to 15 years, with many of those changes tied to evolving global demand \nfor agricultural products. Growth in emerging economies, such as China, and  the rise of biofuels \nare two examples of factors that have shaped long -term demand for key agricultural commodities \nin the U.S. and globally. As we look ahead to factors that may further shape agriculture over the \nnext decade, we recognize that demand for  energy, and renewables in particular, will continue to \nplay a significant role.  \nAs we look to understand how the structure of agriculture might evolve in the years \nahead , I am here as an information  consumer, to listen  and learn from the experts in the room.  \nHowever, since now is my time on the agenda to be a produce r, I will turn to my views on the \noverall economy and the outlook for monetary policy.   \n\n2 \n  \nSubstantial Progress but Challenges Remain  \nAt the end of 2022, with inflation running near a 40-year hig h and the Fed in the middle \nof a historic tightening cycle, almost everyone was asking how much of a  slowdown  was it going \nto take to bring inflation back down towards the Fed’s 2 percent objective.  The consensus answer  \nat the time  was quite a bit . The majority of professional forecasters predicted  a recession in 2023.  \nBut we didn’t have a recession.  Instead , the pace of economic growth more than doubled even as \ninflation halved, all while the unemployment rate remained near all -time lows.      \nDespite this relative  success,  challenges remain.  Primarily, inflation is still  too high.  The \nFed is committed to bringing inflation back to its 2 percent objective.  So far this year, prices \nhave been increasing at about twice that pace, suggesting that the Fed has more work to do.   \nWe have seen a substantial shift in the underlying drivers of inflation over the past two \nyears.  Goods price inflation has eased considerably , as pandemic -related production disruptions \nfaded  and supply chains healed.  In contrast, services price inflation has remained firm , supported \nby a tight labor market .  \nPart of the strength of services inflation has been rents and the cost of housing . Rents \nhave been supported by strong income growth and the healthy labor market.  When a worker  gets \na job, they often want to upgrade their living space , and a tight labor market has historically \ndriven higher rents and housing costs.1 \nHowever, the strength of services price inflation has been broader than rents alone.  \nServices tend to be very labor intensive, so a tight labor market can be an important driver of \ninflation in this area.  And it is not just that the cost of labor tends to increase with labor market \ntightness.  If businesses are not able to hire sufficient labor, increas ing prices is one way to \nbalance supply and demand for their products and services independent of what they are doing \nwith wages.    \nTo recap, inflation is too high on account of a continued imbalance between the strength \nof demand and the economy ’s ability  to produce enough  supply to meet that demand.  Whereas \nwith the start  of the recent inflation , this imbalance was most apparent for goods . Now the \nimbalance has moved to  services and housing.   \n \n1 “A Tight Labor Market Could Keep Rent Inflation Elevated .” Lee Smith, Brent Bundick, and Luca Van Der Meer. \nEconomic Bulletin . Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. March 1, 2023.  \n\n3 \n Though elevated inflation is always painful, it is important to note that inflation ary \nperiods  are not the same.  The high inflation of the 1970s and early 1980s was rooted less in a \nstrong economy  than in the  psychology of price setting.  During that period, prices increased \nbecause firms and workers expected prices to go up, even though the economy was not \nparticularly strong .  \nToday , inflation expectations remain relatively low and anchored . The inflation we are \nseeing is coming from strong demand and an imbalance in the economy.  It is important that the \nFed act to preempt  inflation from becoming ingrained into the price -setting process, a \ndevelopment that would make lowering inflation all the more difficult.   \n \nThe Path Forward  \nWith the current imbalance -driven inflation, the Fed’s approach is relatively \nstraightforward.  The Fed must hold back  demand growth until supply can catch up and the \nimbalance that is driving inflation closes.  This is what the Fed is doing . By increasing the policy \nrate by 5¼ percentage points over the past two years , the Fed has tightened financial conditions \nand slowed demand growth.   \nWhile the overall economy remains strong, there are signs that  the imbalances driving \ninflation are easing.  The labor market has come off a historic boil by many measures.  At the \npeak, there were over two available job postings for every person reporting themselves as \nunemployed.  More recently, this number has fallen below 1½  postings for every unemployed \nperson , which is still high but is easing back.  We have also seen a decline in the  rate at which \nworkers are quitting their jobs.  When the labor market was very tight, workers were quitting at a \nhistoric rate , either as they found new jobs or expected to find them quickly . \nThe Fed works on inflation by easing demand, but our job is made easier by increases in \nsupply . An increased  supply of goods and services can also close imbalances and lower price \npressure.  Recently the supply outlook has improved, with solid growth and increased \nproductivity. The decline in the quits rate has been one factor  boosting  labor productivity and the \nsupply side of the economy.  Worker churn during the peak of labor market tightness and the \nassociated high  hiring and training costs were a drag on the productive capacity of the economy.  \nAs the labor market cools, this drag on productivity has dissipate d, boosting supply and easing \ninflation .  \n\n4 \n Over time , I expect inflation to ease back towards the Fed’s 2 percent objective.  I am \nprepared to be patient as this process plays out.  This will require a data -dependent approach that \nlooks at the data over time rather than loading too much weight on any one release . Although \nthere is an eagerness to spot turning points, I prefer a steady approach to policy, and one that \ndampens the volatility in financial markets rather than contributes to it.  \n \nInterest Rates Could Stay Higher for Longer  \nThat said, my own view is that interest rates could remain high for some time.  The \neconomy has undergone seismic shifts so far this decade . I have no certainty that we  are headed \nback to the low interest rate environment  that prevailed in the decade prior to the pandemic.   \nOne factor that I view as  particularly important here is the prospect of continued large \nfiscal deficits and the tremendous expansion of government debt, both in the United States and \nthroughout the world.  Prior to the pandemic, one often -cited explanation for the relatively low \ninterest rates of the period was high demand for  safe assets, including government  debt, relative \nto the supply of those assets.  Increased demand from financial institutions  as well as strong \ngrowth in China and emerging markets had boosted demand for such assets , bidding up their \nprice and holding down interest rates across the yield curve .  \nHowever, now this demand has cooled even as the supply of government debt has jumped \nand is expected to continue growing at a very rapid rate.  As such, it is possible that the balance of \ndemand and supply for government debt will shift from a factor holding down interest rates to a \nfactor boosting interest rates.  \nImportantly, shifts in supply and demand for safe assets influence interest rates \nindependent of the Fed’s actions. Though the Fed is not a passive bystander and plays a role in \nsetting short -term interest rates, it can’t perpetually deviate rates from mar ket forces without \nrisking its mandates for maximum employment and price stability. In this way, the Fed takes \nfiscal decisions as given and steers monetary policy in the appropriate direction to achieve its \ndual mandate.  \nIn the end, large fiscal deficits will not be inflationary because the Fed will do its job  and \nachieve its inflation objective , through  in doing so the outcome  could be persistently higher  \ninterest rates.  This relationship is also at the crux of the rationale for the political independence \nof the central bank.  Political authorities could very well  prefer that deficits not lead to higher  \n\n5 \n interest rates, but history has shown that  following through on  this impulse has often resulted in \nhigher inflation.  An independent central bank insulated from immediate political pressure and \nguided by a clear inflation objective has historically been an effective means for achieving and \nmaintaining low and stable inflation.   \n \nThe Fed’s Balance Sheet  \nIn part, c entral bank independence also motivates my position on another aspect of Fed \npolicy, the size and composition of the Fed’s balance sheet.  As part of the policy response to the \npandemic , the Fed embarked on a historic expansion of its balance sheet, purchasing trillions of \ndollars of Treasurys and mortgage -backed securities.  With the short -term policy interest rate \nstuck at zero, the purpose of these purchases w as to depress longer term interest rates  and \nstimulate economic activity . With the econo my recovering and price pressure s growing , the Fed \nappropriately started to reverse  these purchases in the middle of 2022, allowing maturing \nsecurities to roll off  and shrinking its balance sheet by $1.5 trillion relative to its peak.   \nAt the FOMC meeting two weeks ago, the committee announced that it would slow the \npace of this run off starting in June . The idea is that a slower pace will allow for a safer and less \ndisruptive approach to the balance sheet’s ultimate size  as determined by bank demand for \nreserves, the Fed’s primary liability.   \nWhile I understand this rationale  does not imply that the balance sheet will end up being \nany larger in the end , I would still reconfirm my preference to shrink the balance sheet as much \nas possible consistent with the Fed’s current operating framework . While a larger balance sheet \nlowers the risk of sharp movements in money market interest rates, maintaining a large balance \nsheet is not without cost . I am focused on three costs in my preference for a  relatively aggressive \napproach to balance sheet reduction:  \n \n1. First, a large balance sheet weighs on longer -term yields, distorting the price of duration  \nin financial markets  and potentially leading to distortions in the allocation of credit.  A \nsmaller balance sheet concentrated in shorter duration securities would lessen this \ndistortion.   \n\n6 \n 2. Second, a large balance sheet increases the Fed’s footprint in financial markets, \npotentially diminishing and weakening other mechanisms and markets for distributing \nliquidity across financial institutions and leading to a more brittle  financial  syste m.   \n3. And t hird, as I alluded to earlier, maintaining a large balance sheet can give the \nuncomfortable impression that monetary and fiscal policy are intertwined. Maintaining an \nexcessively large Treasury portfolio can give  the impression that the Fed’s balance sheet \nis supporting government debt markets.  \n \n In conclusion , I believe policy is in the correct place , and with patience we are on a path \nto achieve our policy objectives.  However, nothing is certain and continued vigilance and \nflexibility are necessary.   \nThank you again for joining us in Omaha , and I look forward to our discussion.",

            "content": "How Far and How Fast?  \n \n \nJeff Schmid  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOctober 21, 2024  \nDelivered to the C hartered  Financial Analysts Society of Kansas City  \nKansas City, Mo.  \nThe views expressed by the author are his own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers or representatives.  \n\n1 \n Thank you for inviting me to speak today.  I will offer some remarks on the outlook for \nthe economy and monetary policy , and then I look forward to any questions you may have.  \nAt its meeting in September, the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) lowered its \npolicy interest rate by ½ percentage point to a range between 4¾ percent and 5 percent.  This was \nthe first change in the policy rate in over a year and came about five years after the Fed last \nstarted a rate cutting cycle . But a lot has happened in those five years . After gradually lowering \nrates in the second half of 2019, the Fed  quickly dropped rates to zero  with the outbreak of the \npandemic . Only two years later, with inflation on its way to a  multi -decade high, the Fed \nembarked on the fast est tightening cycle of the modern era, pushing up rates 525 basis points \nover the course of a year -and-a-half. In the context of these outsized  moves, one may wonder \nwhat the future holds now that monetary policy has reached a new inflection point .  \nMy hope is for what I might call a more normalized cycle.  A cycle where the Fed engages \nin modest adjustments to  policy to keep the economy on an even keel of steady growth, stable \nprices, and full employment.  Absent any major shocks , I am optimistic that we can achieve such \na cycle, but I believe it will  take a cautious and gradual approach to policy.  While I support \ndialing back the restrictiveness of policy, my preference would be to avoid outsized moves, \nespecially given uncertainty over the eventual destination of policy and my desire to avoid \ncontributing to financial market volatility. In the remainder of my remarks, I will first discuss \nwhy now is the right time to start lowering rates . Then I will turn  to how low  rates might  go and \nhow quickly they should get there.   \n \nHow We Got Here  \nIn my view, it only bec ame appropriate to lower the policy rate after inflation \nconvincingly appeared to be on a persistent path towards the Fed’s 2 percent objective . Since \n2022, inflation has been the main plotline in the monetary policy narrative , and understandably \nso as prices surged at a pace not seen since the 1980s . More recently, we have seen considerable \nprogress in returning inflation to the Fed’s objective, with prices increasing  2.2 percent in the \nyear ending in August . I would not be comfortable lowering the policy rate if I w ere not \nreasonably confident that inflation was heading  in the right direction.   \nThere are a couple of factors that have considerably improved the outlook for inflation in \nrecent months.   \n\n2 \n First, the pandemic -related disruptions  that led to  the initial burst of inflation now appear \nto be largely behind us . This is especially true for the price of goods. It was a jump in goods \nprices  that provided much of the initial impetus for the surge in inflation,  but that impulse has \nbeen absent for over a year now.  In fact, over the past 12 months , goods prices have declined  \nalmost 1  percent.   \nThe fading of goods inflation reflects  developments in  both supply and demand . During \nthe pandemic, the supply of goods was lowered by production disruptions and logistical snarls . \nAt the same time , demand for goods surged as homebound consumers shifted spending away \nfrom services.  This imbalance between  low supply and high demand led to rapid price increases.  \nHowever  more recently , supply chains have recovered, the mix between goods and services \nconsumption has returned to pre -pandemic patterns, and goods prices are no longer a source of \ninflation.   \nA second factor increasing my confidence that the  easing of inflation will persist is the  \nloosening of the labor market.  The pandemic led to severe disruptions in the labor market, \ncontributing to historic tightness, and increasing pressure on labor -intensive services prices . \nMore recently , the labor market has cooled.  The vacancy ratio  has fallen to about 1 posting per \navailable worker from a historic high of 2 postings per available worker  at the height of labor \nmarket tightness in 2022 . We have also seen the unemployment rate creep up to 4. 1 percent from \n3.4 percent at the start of last year.   \nWhile the loosening of the labor market has led to some concern that the economy is on  \nshaky ground, my read is  that we are seeing a normalization rather than a significant \ndeterioration of conditions.  It might not be surprising that a historically tight labor market would \nbe followed by a period of relatively slack hiring.  When markets were tight and workers were \nquitting positions at a record pace, employers made every effort to retain existing workers and \nhire new workers, fearful that they would be caught short -handed.  Now that employers are \nconfident in their ability to fill  open  positions, they are no longer hoarding labor, easing retention \nefforts, and likely turning back the dial a bit on the aggressiveness of their hiring.  All of this will \nat least temporarily slacken the labor market as employers make these adjustments.   \nWith a variety of data sources and many different ways to view the labor market, I find it \nhelpful to reference the Kansas City Fed’s Labor Market Conditions Indicator s (LMCI)  for an \noverall view of the health of the labor market.  The LMCI combines 2 4 separate  labor market data \n\n3 \n series into two easy -to-interpret indexes.  Recently the LMCI has been trending down, suggesting \na loosening, but it remains  above its historical average, suggesting the overall labor market \nremains quite healthy.1 \n \nAdjusting Rates: How Low and How Fast?  \nWith the data suggesting inflation is heading in the right direction , there is a compelling \nargument that the policy interest rate should come down . Less certain is how low rates should go  \nand how quickly adjust ment s need to occur .  \nStarting with the first question  of how low interest rates will go, there is ample  evidence \nthat the current stance of monetary policy , and the level of interest rates,  is restrictive, but less \nevidence that it is very restrictive.  Growth remains strong  and the economy has shown continued \nmomentum . Real GDP increased 3 percent in the second quarter  and appears to be poised to \nincrease a similar amount in the third quarter.  Not bad, considering growth average d a little over  \n2 percent in the decade before the pandemic when interest rates were far lower.   \nThe economy has been supported by strong consumer spending, which in turn has been \nsupported by growing labor income and relatively healthy household balance sheets in the \naggregate.  Of course,  not all household balance sheets are healthy, and the aggregate numbers \nmask all the differences across actual households . But to summarize , if the economy does not \nappear to be very restricted, then it seems unlikely that monetary policy is all that restrictive.  \nIt is my belief that interest rates could  settle well above the levels we saw in the decade \nbefore the pandemic.  There are several  reasons why this may be true. One favorable, and some \nmay say optimistic, scenario is that continued strong productivity gains boost economic growth, \nstrengthen investment and support consumption.  Such a combination would increase the demand \nfor investable savings and hence push up interest rates.   \nA less favorable scenario, and one I discussed at length in a speech in May, is that the \ntremendous increase in government debt coming out of the pandemic , not just in the United \nStates  but around the world , maintains upward pressure on  interest rates across the economy.2 \n \n1 More information about the Kansas City Fed’s LMCI is available at https://www.kansascityfed.org/data -and-\ntrends/labor -market-conditions -indicators/ .  \n2 See “The Outlook for the Economy and Monetary Policy” at \nhttps://www.kansascityfed.org/Speeches/documents/10168/2024 -Schmid-Omaha-05-14.pdf.  \n\n4 \n However, there are some long -run structural factors that likely contributed to the low \nlevel of interest rates before the pandemic , and these factors have not gone away . In particular, \ndemographic trends point to aging populations in the United States and around the world.  As \nolder populations  age into retirement, they  tend to work less, which reduces demand for  physical  \ncapital and invest ment , depressing interest rates . Older populations also  save more,  particularly \nin fixed -income assets, which can further push down interest rates.  Though it is hard to know \nwhich of these factors will dominate  — productivity, debt, or demographics — we must be open \nto the possibility that interest rates will settle higher than we observed before the pandemic.     \nNow let’s turn to the question of timing.  If the Fed is to further lower interest rates, at \nwhat pace should it be done?  Given the uncertainties I just outlined about our eventual \ndestination, a cautious and deliberate course of action seems appropriate. Lowering rates in a \ngradual fashion would provide time to observe  the economy’s reaction to our interest rate \nadjustments  and give us the space to assess at what level interest rates are neither restricting nor \nboosting the economy.  \nA cautious approach will also work to minimize the Fed’s contribution to financial \nmarket volatility.  Outsized policy moves can provoke  outsized financial market reactions to data \nsurprises.  The data are messy and subject to large revisions as we have seen in recent months.  \nOur policy must be linked to the flow of data, but we should avoid putting  too much weight on \nany single  data point . As policymakers we should be flexible , but being nimble can come with a \nprice.  Reacting quickly builds expectations of f urther quick reactions . This  widens the scope for \nfinancial market expectations to diverge from the intent  of the Committee , potentially \ncontributing  to heightened financial market volatility.  Already, we have seen large swings in \nTreasury yields over the past few months  as markets assess and reassess the potential course of \npolicy interest rates.  \n \nThe Impact on the Balance Sheet  \nV olatile interest rates could potentially complicate another aspect of Fed policy , which is  \nour work  to decrease the size of our balance sheet . Following a tremendous expansion during the \npandemic, the Fed has been shrinking its balance sheet since the middle of 2022.  My preference \nis to shrink the balance sheet as much as possible while remaining consistent with the Fed’s \ncurrent operating framework.  While a larger balance sheet lowers the risk of sharp movements in \n\n5 \n money market interest rates, maintaining a large balance sheet is not without cost s. I am focused \non three costs in my preference for a relatively aggressive approach to balance sheet reduction . \nFirst, a large balance sheet weighs on longer -term yields, d epressing the price of duration \nin financial markets and potentially leading to distortions in the allocation of credit.  It is my view \nthat one factor contributing to the flatness of the yield curve is the large size  and elevated \nduration  of our balance sheet.  The long -term health of the traditional banking industry, which is \nwell represented in my Federal Reserve district , requires a positive slope to the yield curve.  A \nsmaller balance sheet conce ntrated in shorter duration securities would lessen our impact on the \nslope of the yield curve.  Recent research from the Kansas City Fed reviews some of the \nconsiderations around the eventual composition of the Fed’s balance sheet.3 \nSecond, a large balance sheet increases the Fed’s footprint in financial markets, \npotentially diminishing and weakening other mechanisms and markets for distributing liquidity \nacross financial institutions and leading to a more brittle financial system.    \nAnd third, maintaining a large balance sheet can give the uncomfortable impression that \nmonetary and fiscal policy are intertwined. Maintaining an excessively large Treasury portfolio \ncan give the impression that the Fed’s balance sheet is supporting gover nment debt markets.  \nAs we move past the post -pandemic surge in inflation, we have the prospect of \ntransitioning to a more normalized cycle where the Fed regularly recalibrates monetary policy to \nmeet  its dual mandate of price stability and full employment.  I am optimistic the Fed can achieve \nsuch an outcome, but it will take a careful approach that is attentive to the data and signals from \nthe economy.  My beli ef is that a cautious and gradual approach to policy adjustments would be \nbest suited for this uncertain environment.    \n \n \n3 See Sengupta and S mith (2024).  “Considerations for the Longer -Run Maturity Composition of the Federal \nReserve’s Treasury Portfolio” .",
